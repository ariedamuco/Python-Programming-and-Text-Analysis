 Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Senator D'Amato, the Chairman of the Banking Committee, for his diligence in bringing this legislation dealing with credit unions to the floor in a timely manner. Although I have concerns with the commercial lending provisions in the legislation, I do support the underlying bill. 
I do have one question, however for the Chairman of the Banking Committee relating to the community credit union provisions in the act. Specifically, I am concerned with the way that the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) will design their regulations dealing with the size and scope of community credit unions. Although I had initially intended to offer an amendment limiting the size of a federally-chartered community credit union to three or four contiguous census tracts, after discussing the matter with the Chairman I decided that my amendment would be unnecessary.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, thank you. 
This is a delightful day. As I think about the issue of swapping land, school trust lands in Utah for other Federal lands, I realize that this is an issue that my father worked on in this Chamber over 40 years ago. Governor Matheson, to keep it bipartisan, the Democratic Governor of Utah, tried an initiative on this same issue while he was the Governor some 20 years ago. To see it finally come to fruition now brings me a great sense of satisfaction. 
I thank my senior colleague for his support and leadership on this issue, I thank the members of the Energy Committee for their work, and I particularly thank my friend from Arkansas, the senior Senator, Mr. Bumpers, for his support as we have gone through this. He and I became acquainted when I first came to the Senate and went on that committee. We worked on a number of issues together, and I am delighted that this is one that comes together in a bipartisan fashion. 
So this is a time of rejoicing, nostalgia, and great pleasure on my part. 
Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today I introduce the Medical Information Protection Act of 1998. I know it is late in the 105th Congress and that there will not be time to give this legislation full consideration. However, I feel strongly about this issue and did not want this session to end without the introduction of this legislation. I feel that great progress has been made and that the legislation that I am introducing addresses many of the concerns that have been expressed. I will include letters and statements of support for the Record from the following groups: American Medical Informatics Association; Joint Healthcare Information Technology Alliance; Intermountain Health Care; Premier Institute; Association of American Medical Colleges; American Health Information Management Association; Healthcare Leadership Council; Federation of American Health Systems; American Hospital Association and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. It is my intention to reintroduce this legislation early in the 106th Congress and seek for its passage. 
Most individuals wrongly assume that their personal health information is protected under federal law. It is not. Federal law protects the confidentiality of our video rental records, and federal law ensures us access to information about us such as our credit history. However, there is no current federal law which will protect the confidentiality of our medical information and ensure us access to our own medical information. This is a circumstance that must change. This is a circumstance that the Medical Information Protection Act will correct. 
At this time, the only protection of an individual's personal medical information is under state law. These state laws, where they exist, are incomplete, inconsistent and inadequate. At last check, there were over 34 states with each state having its own unique set of laws to protect medical records. In many states there is no penalty for releasing and disseminating the most private information about our health and the health care that we have received. Many of our local health care systems continue to expand across state lines and are forced to deal with multiple and conflicting state laws. In addition, advances in technology allow information to be moved instantaneously across the country or around the world. The majority of providers, insurers, health care professionals, researchers and patients agree that there is an increasingly urgent need for uniformity in our laws that govern access to and disclosure of personal health information. 
Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that if we do not act by August of 1999, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to put into place regulations governing health information in an electronic format. Thus, we could have a circumstance where paper based records and electronic based records are treated differently. I urge my colleagues to work with me to pass legislation that would give HHS clear direction and provide each American with greater protection of their health information.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleague from Delaware, Mr. Roth, for his commitment to look further into the issue of medicare private contracting and to thank the honorable Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, for his leadership as the sponsor of S. 1194, the Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom to Contract Act. As one of 48 cosponsors of Mr. Kyl's bill, I believe that we need to take steps to maximize choice, access and care for Medicare patients, not restrict them in the name of patient protection. I have been contacted by hundreds of seniors from my state who understandably expressed outrage that Congress had passed a law that will inevitably restrict access to health care from the provider of their choice even when they are willing to pay for the care out of their own pocket. We have been told that this provision was included in the Balanced Budget Act as a protection for Medicare patients. However, I believe we can protect Medicare patients from fraud and abuse without restricting their access to desired care. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, once again, for their commitment and leadership and I look forward to working with them in the near future to address this important issue.

Mr. BENNETT. I would like to raise an issue addressed in the Senate report language regarding the Long Park Dam in Daggett County, Utah. Daggett County is the smallest county in Utah, with a population of just over 700 people. It is also the home of the Flaming Gorge Recreation Area, which is host to over 2 million visitors annually. 
I appreciate the committee's efforts to provide some assistance in repairing the dam through the water and waste disposal loans and grants program under RCAP. The city of Manila already has acquired a loan for a new treatment plant for Long Park Dam water, which has now been put in jeopardy because of the structural problems in the Long Park Dam. The city has a very limited capacity to assume more debt to repair the dam. 
Once the repairs on the dam are completed, the city would use as much as 50 percent of the water stored in Long Park Dam. Given the size of the communities involved and the limited ability to assume new debt, would it be appropriate to remind the Department of the special circumstances in Daggett County and encourage the Department to consider the community's current financial obligations when it reviews the grant application?

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have enjoyed being here and listening to the senior Senator of West Virginia on a subject about which I have had some opinions and to which I have given some thought, and I would like to engage with him at another time about these issues. But I would just share with him and with the Senate this personal experience. 
When I lived in California, I discovered that many governmental reformers had put into place in California, initiative, referendum, and recall. This was the cry of political reformers, I think, in the 1920s, and it was supposed to be a demonstration of how forward-looking you were if you were in favor of initiative, referendum and recall. I voted against every single initiative that came in California, whether I agreed with it or not, for precisely the reasons that the Senator from West Virginia has given us. Because, I said, the people should not be legislating directly in the ballot box. We have a republic to do that. The Constitution guarantees every State a republican form of government. And I felt that California was going down the road, away from that constitutional requirement. 
I have discovered, since I left California, that whenever the politicians there have a problem now that they find too difficult for them to deal with in the State assembly, they simply say: Well, let's put it on the ballot. And you have legislation going on the ballot that should be fought out in the legislative process of a republic. 
Another problem that you have in California, I would say to the Senator from West Virginia, if it passes in an initiative, it becomes part of the State constitution and therefore cannot be amended. And we have seen examples of legislation that could not get through the State assembly being put on the ballot by factions--to use Madison's term; today we would call them special interests--and therefore being embedded in the California State Constitution so that a future legislature cannot repair the mischief that is created by this attempt at pure democracy. 
So we have a laboratory here in our own Union of States that demonstrates the wisdom of Madison and his counterparts in creating the Constitution. As I say, I am proud to say that when I lived in California, as a citizen, as a matter of constitutional conscience, I voted against every single initiative, even those with which I agreed, because I wanted to preserve the concept of a representative republic that is the foundation of our liberties. 
I thank the Senator from West Virginia for this most scholarly presentation. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to be here to hear it.

Mr. BENNETT. I cannot let this exchange go without giving a word or two of explanation. The Federal Reserve Board, as the Senator from Iowa has accurately stated, was created by the Congress, and presents to the Congress an audited statement of its financials every year. It is addressed to the Speaker of the House. 
It is true that it was not done by the General Accounting Office, but they are audited by a legitimate outside auditor, and their activities, down to the penny, are reported to the Speaker of the House in a written document every year. 
I will be happy to supply it to any Member of this body that may wish it.

Mr. BENNETT. The Senator from Nevada is correct; they are not audited regularly by the General Accounting Office, but it is audited. A copy of the audited and exact financial activities of the Federal Reserve Board are submitted in writing to the Speaker of the House every year. 
I have constituents who are constantly saying to me that the Federal Reserve Board is owned by a group of Swiss bankers or foreign interests somewhere and that it has never been audited. I always send them a copy of the audited report of the Federal Reserve Board that is submitted to the Speaker so that they can know that this creation of the Congress does not go unexamined by an appropriate auditing firm. 
It is true to say that it is not audited regularly by the General Accounting Office. I think that is the point the Senator from Nevada was making. However, I think we should not let people be under the assumption that the Federal Reserve Board goes without anybody paying any attention to how they handle their money.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have two observations to make. We have had this debate virtually every year since I have been in the Senate. I don't want to repeat myself, although I have discovered since being here that there is no such thing as repetition in the Senate. We always pretend as if we have never said it before. 
Two things. One, a historic comment by John Adams, writing to his wife Abigail. He said: 
I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history, naval architecture, navigation, commerce, and agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry, and porcelain. 
One of the dearest dreams of our Founding Fathers was that we, as a nation, would turn our attention to the arts and have our children and grandchildren do the same. The second point is that we have heard a great deal of various aspects of grants from the NEA, where they have gone and what tremendous harm they are doing. 
I would simply like to share with the Senate where the funds from the NEA go in my home State. I don't usually list projects in my home State. But I think in this case it would make a good anecdote to some of the things we have heard. 
In Utah, NEA funds have been used for children's theater with educational outreach in Coalville, Kamas, Duchesne, Roosevelt, Castle Dale, Salina, Beaver, and Price. 
To those Senators who say they have never heard of those towns, I say that most people in Utah have never heard of them either. They are among some of our smallest communities. Without the NEA money, they would not have this educational outreach. 
NEA funds have helped fund community arts' councils around the State, including those in Springdale, Vernal, Richfield, Riverton, Cedar City, and Bluffdale, again in rural Utah. 
NEA funding in Utah includes the Festival of the American West, the Children's Museum of Utah, the Northern Utah Choral Society, the Chamber Music Society of Logan, the Payson Community Theater, the Utah Shakespearean Festival, the Dixie Art Alliance, the Sundance Children's Theater, Ballet West, Repertory Dance Theatre, Quarterly West, Ririe-Woodbury Dance Foundation, the Utah Symphony, and recently the central Utah Highlanders Pipe Band. 
The projects that I have listed are Utah projects organized by Utahns. The vast majority of the money spent on them is raised in Utah by Utahns. But here comes a bit of national recognition that brings pride and satisfaction to the local folks all across my State that says what you are doing is important, what you are doing deserves national recognition, and what you are doing deserves Federal support. 
I find as I walk around Utah spontaneously people coming up to me, saying, `Senator, for all the things you do, the one thing we most appreciate is your defense of the arts.' I would be unfaithful to those who asked me to continue that defense if I did not rise again, as I have on every occasion when this issue has come up, and make it clear that I support these appropriations. 
I support the chairman of the subcommittee in the way he has handled these appropriations. It is a legitimate expenditure of public funds. I hope it continues.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have listened with interest to the discussion that has taken place today regarding the Bumpers amendment and I would like to express my views on the BLM's proposed 3809 Regulations. I am concerned that my colleagues are facing another situation, like others in the past, in which policymakers in this Administration lacking support from Congress, nevertheless develop policy based on a predetermined outcome. Once that policy is introduced, we are then subjected to the usual vocalizing about the importance of public input and the necessity of hearing views of all interested parties. 
BLM's justification for new regulations is spotty--advances in mining technologies and current regulations which have not been updated for 15 years. Yet when we had this discussion last year, we agreed that since the regulatory authority of western states would be called into question, it was important that we allow for significant input from those impacted states. I am dismayed that the BLM draft regulations ignored most of the input received last year. The result has been a proposal that was so top-heavy with prescriptive regulation it would never pass muster if it were to move through the normal legislative process. 
We find ourselves in a situation where the Western Governors, which have individual state programs that are working very well with respect to mining in those states, wish to have greater input into the draft regulations. These Governors, regardless of party affiliation, have stated very clearly that the problems with the current law described by the Secretary simply do not exist. They would prefer to have several legal issues resolved prior to any modification of the current 3809 regulations. I do not see anything wrong with seeking guidance from an outside source as to how the current regulatory framework is deficient. I believe the language we have in this bill addresses those concerns by bringing in a non-biased entity to determine if the current regulatory framework is inadequate. 
I sometimes wish we could be more candid with each other. I am amazed at what happens when we can sit down around the table and have an open discussion. We have been successful in the past, as my friend Senator Bumpers well knows. Were it not for two or three candid discussions, we would have never reached agreement on National Park concessions reform. But this is a case where BLM is not willing to admit what it is really trying to do. The Secretary should admit that he is trying to accomplish mining law reform through the back door because the Administration lacks the votes in Congress. If he would simply say that, I would say that I disagree with his position. But because of the lack of candor around here, we go through various machinations and we find ourselves in this situation where we now have to bring in the National Academy of Sciences to provide a non-biased review so we can get the information to Congress. I think this issue has moved to the point where we are in need of unbiased, outside counsel. If there is a problem, let's fix it, if not, let's leave well enough alone. But the first step is to identify if a problem really does exist.

Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, we have heard a good deal in this debate about people buying access to politicians. Indeed, there has been a tremendous amount of time and printer's ink and television signals spent on debating how you buy access to a politician. I want to turn this debate around, for the sake of looking at it from a different point of view. It may take me some time to do this because there has been so much expenditure in one direction, but I think the core of this issue requires us to look in another direction, and that is not access to the politician, but access to the voters. 
Let me develop this for just a minute. We live in a democracy. Ultimate power in a democracy lies with the voters. Madam President, when you and I wished to become an elected official, in order to get here we have to have access to the voters, and this whole political process is about that challenge--how does the Presiding Officer gain access to the voters of Maine in order to get her message across? 
How do I get access to the voters of Utah in order to convince them that I am a better person than others who are seeking this opportunity? That is the focus that has never come into this debate. It is always assumed that the politicians are the constant and the voters somehow are the variable. It is, in fact, the other way around. The voters will always be with us in a democracy. It is the politicians who come and go and who are variable, and the question of how a politician becomes an officeholder depends entirely on how effectively the politician can get his or her message across to the voters so the voters can then make a choice. 
What I am about to say for the next half hour to 45 minutes, will be focused in a whole new direction than the direction that we have been having in this debate. 
I begin, Madam President, by going back to a historical review of the whole issue of money in politics. For this, I am dependent on a number of sources. One is the Wilson Quarterly published in the summer of 1997, with the cover article being entitled `Money In Politics, The Oldest Connection.' This gives us a historic point of view that will start us off in this direction that I think we ought to explore. 
In this particular article, it points out that in the beginning of our Republic, a politician had access to the voters because he knew them all. They all lived in his neighborhood. George Washington was personally known to the people who voted to put him in Virginia's House of Burgesses. Thomas Jefferson was personally known to the people who he would turn to for political support. He had no problem gaining access to the voters. 
I find it interesting, out of this Wilson Quarterly article, that even then, however, the subject of money did come up. If I can quote from the article:  
George Washington spent about 25 pounds apiece on two elections for the House of Burgesses, 39 pounds on another, and nearly 50 pounds on a fourth, which was many times the going price for a house or a plot of land. 
Interestingly, many times the price of a house for a seat in the State legislature. Oh, what fun we could have with the rhetoric about that in this Chamber when we are saying that a seat in the House was up for sale. 
Quoting from the article again: 
Washington's electioneering expenses included the usual rum punch, cookies and ginger cakes, money for the poll watcher who recorded the votes, even one election-eve ball complete with fiddler. 
An interesting footnote about that appears in the article later relating to one of Washington's fellow State members, James Madison. Quoting again from the article: 
James Madison considered `the corrupting influence of spiritous liquors and other treats . . . inconsistent with the purity of moral and republican principles.' But Virginians, the future president discovered, did not want `a more chaste mode of conducting elections.' Putting him down as prideful and cheap, the voters rejected his candidacy for the Virginia House of Delegates in 1777. Leaders were supposed to be generous gentlemen. 
Madison decided to enforce his own form of campaign finance reform, refused to treat the voters in Virginia, and they responded by refusing to send him to Virginia's House of Delegates. 
As the country grew, obviously the circumstances changed. We got to the point where no longer could a candidate announce for office and assume he would be known to all the voters. Even if he bought some rum punch or ginger cakes, he still could not sway voters' opinion and, as the article says, quoting again: 
Leadership was no longer just a matter of gentlemen persuading one another; now, politicians had to sway the crowd. 
As the article goes on to point out: 
In fact, the more democratic, the more inclusive the campaign, the more it cost. 
In that one sentence, we have a summary of the challenge of a politician gaining access to the voters. I will repeat it: 
. . . the more democratic, the more inclusive the campaign, the more it cost. 
Stop and think of the challenge today in that context where the Senator from New York has to reach millions, tens of millions, the Senator from California even more millions than that, in campaigns this fall. And the more democratic and more inclusive those campaigns are, the more they will cost. 
Cost to do what? To gain access to the voters; to get your message across to the voters. The cost is directly connected with how democratic, how inclusive, and in the case of the larger States, how big the electorate is going to be. 
We come into the present century, and we find things are getting worse in terms of the high cost of reaching the voters. One of the things, paradoxically, that has driven the cost of campaigns through the roof has been the cause of campaign finance reform. The reforms themselves have added to the burden of cost on a candidate who is seeking to have access to the voters. 
Again from the article: 
Some reforms, such as the push for nomination of presidential and other candidates by primaries, made campaigning even more expensive. Ultimately, the reformers' decades-long efforts to improve the American political system did at least as much harm as good. They weakened the role of parties, lessened faith in popular politics, and hastened the decline of voter participation. 
I find that very interesting. A historical analysis of America's politics written in an outstanding academic journal says that it has been the reformers' efforts that have `weakened the role of parties, lessened faith in popular politics and hastened the decline of voter participation.' We heard on this floor this morning the statement that voter participation is going down, and the reason is because we do not have campaign finance reform; indeed, that the more money we put into politics, the less people vote and the lower the level of participation and that there is a direct correlation between the money chase and the voters being turned off. 
We were told that in the State of Arizona, they just had a primary that set an all-time low for voter participation in this era when we have an all-time high in spending. 
Madam President, I offer the case of my own State and what happens with respect to voter participation and money. If I can go back in my own political career, the one career I know better than any other, I can tell the Members of the Senate that the highest voter participation in history in a primary in the State of Utah occurred in 1992 when I was running for the Senate. 
We had an open seat for the Senate, and originally five candidates on the Republican side and two on the Democratic side. We had an open seat for Governor, and originally there were five candidates for Governor on the Republican side, and I believe three on the Democratic side, plus an independent thrown in who ran on a third party ticket. 
By virtue of the Congressman in the Second District in Utah challenging for the Senate seat, we had an open seat in Salt Lake City, the media center of the State. So even though it was not a statewide office, it nonetheless called for purchase of statewide media. 
We had the largest spending amount of money in the history of the State as we went through that primary. 
In the Senate primary alone--there were only two candidates, I say, because under Utah's law a convention eliminates all but two--we had the highest expenditures in the State's history. My opponent spent $6.2 million in the primary in the State of Utah, setting an all-time record for money spent per vote. I struggled by with second place in spending with $2 million, which would have beaten the previous high if it had not been for the amount of money my opponent was spending. So that is over $8 million spent on a Senate primary in the State of Utah that has fewer than 1 million voters. 
At the same time, we had a heated race for Governor with primaries in both parties. Fortunately, the gubernatorial candidates did not spend in the millions that the senatorial candidates did, but they spent a lot of money for a primary. And we had spending in the House race in the Second Congressional District. 
If we believe what we were told on the Senate floor this morning, that should translate into the lowest voter turnout in history, people turned off by the money chase. But in fact it produced, as I said, the largest voter turnout in the history of the State.

Mr. BENNETT. It is my understanding that it is, Madam President. And I would like to underscore that point by going to the primary in 1998. In 1998, there were no Senate candidates on the primary ballot from either party, I having eliminated my challenger within the party within the convention, and my Democratic opponent having had no challenger in his convention. We did not have a gubernatorial race. There was no challenge in the Second Congressional District, which is in the large media market. 
But there was a primary in the Third Congressional District, where the incumbent Congressman was challenged by a gentleman who made it very clear that he not only would not accept PAC money, he would not accept party contributions, he would not accept individual contributions. He said, `I will take my message directly to the people without accepting any money'--as he put it, in biblical terms--`gold and silver, from anyone.' And the result of that primary was the lowest turnout that anyone can recall. 
His opponent did not spend any money. I talked to his opponent, the incumbent Congressman. I said, `Aren't you going to spend anything?' He said, `I'm nervous it will look like overkill if I do.' He did spend a little money on a get-out-the-vote campaign, but he did not buy any ads. There were no television broadsides and no radio ads. Most of the people in the district, by virtue of the lower spending, did not know an election was going on, and you had the lowest turnout in Utah history in that district. 
So I submit, Madam President, that at least on the basis of the anecdote with which I am the most familiar, the more participation that you want, the more money you had better be prepared to spend. And if you are in fact decrying the low level of turnout and the low level of participation and you want to do something about that, then you defeat this amendment, because this amendment would take us down the road to further lowering the ability of candidates to access the voters and thereby let the voters know that an election is going on. 
If I may go back to the historic pattern that I was outlining as to what has happened in this century, I would refer once again, Madam President, to the quote that I gave from the article in the Wilson Quarterly that `the reformers' * * * efforts to improve the American political system did at least as much harm as good * * * and hastened the decline of voter participation.' 
The article goes on to say:  
Twentieth-century politicking would prove to be far more expensive than 19th-century . . . politics . . . And as the century went on, politicians increasingly had to struggle to be heard above the din from competing forms of entertainment . . . 
That is a very interesting way of putting it, Madam President. Politicians had to compete with the din of competing forms of entertainment. If you read the history books, there was a time when politics was the leading form of entertainment in this country. If you were going to have a rally, a bonfire, something to do, you went out and got involved in politics. As other forms of communication and entertainment came along, it became increasingly difficult. 
I have a personal experience I can share on this which is perhaps not political but which makes the point. I served as a missionary for the church to which I belong in the early 1950s. And I served in the British Isles, where one of the great traditions of the British Isles is what is known as a street meeting. You stand on a street corner, you talk as loud as you can, and you hope somebody stops and listens to you. 
On a good evening in the summertime, when the weather is fine, you could almost always draw a crowd. I would go down to the city square in Edinburgh, and the Salvation Army would be on that corner, and the Church of Scotland would be on that corner, and the Scottish nationalists would be over here, and I and my companions would be here. 
The square would be filled with people, and you would compete with each other to see who could draw the biggest crowd and then who could hold the crowd as the other orators were speaking on their issues--the Scottish nationalists demanding that Scotland separate itself from the British tyranny, the Salvation Army putting forth--they were unfair in my book because they had a band. We did not have a band, we just had our own voices to carry it on. It was a great British tradition and still, presumably, goes on in some parts of Hyde Park in London, but I think only rarely now. 
What happened to dry up the crowds that would show up and listen to the orators on politics and religion and everything else? Television. As soon they could stay home and watch television, they were not interested in coming down to the city square in Edinburgh to listen to a tall bald kid from America. However entertaining that may have been in an earlier time, all of a sudden there was competition. Politicians used to be at that square. Politicians have discovered, in the words of the article, that they have to `struggle to be heard above the din from competing forms of entertainment.' 
And how are they heard? They buy an ad. They go on television themselves. They go on radio themselves. How are they going to get access to the voters? They are going to have to compete in the same places where the voters are. It makes you feel wonderful to stand on a street corner and give an absolutely brilliant speech, if there is anybody listening. 
But I can tell you from real experience, it makes you feel quite foolish to stand on a street corner and give an absolutely brilliant speech to a group of pigeons that keep flying in and out. If you are going to get access to the voters, you have to go where the voters are, and the voters are by their radio sets and in front of their television sets, and that is where you have to be, however much you might not like it. 
Back to the article: 
By letting politicians appeal directly and `personally' to masses of voters, television made money, not manpower, the key to political success. Campaigns became `professionalized,' with `consultants' and elaborate `ad-buys,' and that added to the cost. So did the fact that as party loyalties diminished, candidates had to build their own individual organizations and `images.' 
I go back to the question of, Why did the party loyalties diminish? Because the reformers showed up and said, `Parties are evil.' It was the reform movement that diminished the power of parties, so that it did not make enough difference for an individual to win his party's nomination, he had to have his own organization, his own campaign consultants, and his own ad-buys. 
Again, if I can give a personal anecdote to demonstrate this, my first experience with politics was in 1950 when my father ran for the U.S. Senate. Who managed his campaign that first year? It was the Republican State Party chairman who showed up when dad won the nomination and said, `OK, we have a party organization in place and we are going to run your campaign.' When my father ran for his last term in the U.S. Senate in 1968, I am not sure I remember who the Republican State chairman was, because by that time we had created our own organization--Volunteers for Bennett, Neighbors for Bennett, our own door-to-door system of handing out information. We had our own advertising budget and our own advertising program. We had to take it all over ourselves if we were going to get access to the voters in a meaningful way. And all of that costs money. It was the cost of the politicians gaining access to the voters that was going up and that was what was driving the fundraising challenge. 
Then we got to what is considered the great watershed in American campaign finance problems, Watergate. The article addresses that, as well. If I might quote once again: 
Yet for all the pious hopes, the goal of the Watergate era reforms--to remove the influence of money from presidential elections--was hard and inescapable fact, ridiculous. Very few areas of American life are insulated from the power of money. Politics, which is, after all, about power, had limited potential to be turned into a platonic refuge from the influence of mammon. The new Puritanism of the post-Watergate era often backfired . . . Tinkering with the political system in many cases just made it worse. 
I can offer anecdotes about that, as well. Let me give one. We heard in the hearings to which the Senator from Connecticut referred in the Thompson committee with respect to campaign finance reform, we heard there about a campaign that many can argue changed the course of American history. It was the McCarthy campaign in New Hampshire in 1968. Eugene McCarthy, a distinguished member of this body, decided against all political wisdom that he was going to challenge an incumbent President within his own party over an issue he considered to be a moral issue, the Vietnam war. Conventional wisdom said a sitting Senator does not do that to an incumbent President. The sitting Senator does not take on an incumbent President of his own party. But Eugene McCarthy did. He went to New Hampshire. He did not win, but he came close enough to scare Lyndon Johnson and his advisers so badly that within a relatively short period of time after the McCarthy challenge, Lyndon Johnson announced that he would not run for reelection as President of the United States. 
Now, we heard in the Thompson committee this bit about the McCarthy campaign. He went to five individuals, individuals of wealth, and said, `I want to challenge Lyndon Johnson on the basis of principle; will you support me?' And each one of those five said yes. Each one gave him $100,000. So he went to New Hampshire with a war chest of half a million dollars--which at the time was sufficient for him to gain access to the voters. 
Again, the theme that I am trying to lay down here, the whole issue is not access to the politician; the issue is access to the voters. Eugene McCarthy could not have had access to the voters without that $500,000. We would, perhaps, not have had history changed the way it was as a result of the McCarthy campaign if those five men had not put up $100,000 apiece. 
Now, someone connected with the McCarthy campaign testified before our committee and he gave this very interesting comment. He said those who signed the Declaration of Independence were so concerned about their Government that they were willing to pledge, in the words of that declaration, `their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor.' Then he said, in today's world it would say, `your lives, your fortunes and your sacred honor, just as long as it does not exceed $1,000 per cycle.' 
Now, I think the McCarthy campaign and the result of that demonstrates how the reforms of the Watergate era have backfired, how they have made it impossible for many people who would otherwise have a message worth hearing, to gain access to the voters. 
Let me give an example out of the last campaign. One of the more energetic of America's politicians is a former Member of the House, former member of the Cabinet named Jack Kemp. He brings to politics the same enthusiasm that he used to display on the football field. Sometimes he has the same suicidal motives that he seemed to have on the football field, but he plays the game with that kind of zest. Jack Kemp dearly wanted to run for President in 1996. He had run once before and he still had it in his blood and he was ready to go. I talked to Jack Kemp and said, `Are you going to do it?' And he said, `No.' I said, `Why not?' He said, `I can't bring myself to go through the agony of raising the money.' 
This is not cowardice on his part. If there is anything Jack Kemp is not, it is a coward. This is not lack of enthusiasm on Jack Kemp's part. It was a recognition of the fact that the so-called reforms out of Watergate meant that he could not do what Eugene McCarthy did. He could not go to five individuals and say, `Give me $100,000 a piece to get me started.' He had to do it $1,000 at a time. He said to me, `Bob, I would have to hold 200 fundraisers between now and the end of the year to do it, and I simply cannot eat that much chicken.'

Mr. BENNETT. The Senator is entirely correct. That is my point. If, indeed, we want to increase the amount of public confidence in the system and candidate participation in the system, we should remove the restrictions that now make it virtually impossible for anybody other than the well-known or the well-funded. 
I used Jack Kemp as an example. The Senator from Kentucky has mentioned Steve Forbes. It is widely assumed--I have not discussed it with him directly, but I think it is probably accurate--that Steve Forbes would have backed Jack Kemp in the last election if Kemp had been able to run. It is widely assumed --and I think it is correct--that if Jack Kemp, pre-Watergate reforms, had gone to Steve Forbes and said, `Steve, give me $1 million,' Steve Forbes would have done it. But because he can't do it under the Watergate reforms, Steve Forbes ends up getting in the race himself because the only way he can make his money available to his causes is to spend it on himself. 
The reforms we have make it impossible for him to spend it supporting anybody else, unless, of course, he does it in the terrible, dreaded form of soft money. And I will talk about that in a minute. 
But right now I want to focus again on the historic fact that, in the name of campaign finance reform, we have restricted rather than expanded the opportunities of politicians to get their message across. We have made it more difficult for a politician to gain access to the voters than it used to be before we had all of these reforms. 
Back to the article for just a moment. A summary of this point, and one other aspect of it: 
In an age of growing moral relativism, reformers raised standards in the political realm to new and often unrealistic legal heights. Failure to fill out forms properly became illegal. This growing criminalization of politics, combined with the media scandal-mongering, did not purify politics, but only further undermined faith in politicians and government. 
We are all familiar with that, Mr. President. Failure to fill out forms properly--oh boy, what a terrible sin that is, and how dearly we pay for it. I have remained silent on my own experience with the Federal Election Commission, but I suppose the time has come now for me to confess my sins. My campaign in 1992, staffed primarily by volunteers, failed to fill out some forms properly--indeed, they failed to fill some of them out on the proper timeframe. They filled them out properly, they just didn't submit them in the proper timeframe. And for that, after spending about $50,000 in legal fees to convince the Federal Election Commission that I was not some kind of an ax murderer, we finally achieved an out-of-court settlement that cost me another $55,000. 
In the negotiations between my campaign and the Federal Election Commission, my attorney made it very clear. He said, `You will settle at the amount they know is below what it would cost you to litigate this issue.' It has nothing to do with what constitutes an illegitimate penalty; it has to do with how much they know they can get from you because you would rather spend money to have this thing over than you would spend it for legal fees. As I say, I spent about $50,000 in legal fees. The settlement figure was $55,000. It is clear that it would have gotten to more than $55,000 if I had to go to litigation, and so financially I made the decision to settle. That is another one of the fruits of reforms. 
In the words of the article, `Criminalization of politics, combined with media scandal-mongering, did not purify politics, but only further undermined faith in politicians and government.' 
All right. I started this by saying the focus of this is on access to the voters. All of the debate we have had has been on how we must somehow deal with access to the politicians. Let's talk about access to the politicians for just a minute before we come back to the main theme. We are told again and again that the only reason people give any money, the only reason people make any contribution is because they want access. I will again refer to the article, but I will have other references out of a more current publication: 
Wealthy people who purchase status with payoffs to museums are admirable philanthropists. When they plunge into public service, they risk being called `fat cats' who want something more in return for their generosity than advancement of their notion of the public good and something more sinister than status by association. Donors are `angels' if they champion the right candidate or the right cause, but `devils' if they bankroll an opponent. 
In this week's issue of Fortune Magazine, Mr. President, there is an article on money and politics that brings up to date that observation from the article I have been quoting. It talks about fundraisers for campaigns and makes this point in concert with the point that was just made: 
Conspiracy theorists will be disappointed to learn that the majority of money raisers don't seek quid pro quos. Most have made their fortunes and dabble in politics because they are partisans and get a kick out of it. 
That has been my experience. The people who give really big money--Rich DeVos of Amway, for example, for the Republicans, and a gentleman I believe named DeMont, who gave over $2 million to George McGovern and the Democrats, were not expecting an ambassadorship and not expecting to be appointed to the Cabinet. They made their fortunes; they are partisans and they get a kick out of it.  
What they really crave is status and minor celebrity in the Nation's Capitol. The nastiest battles between fundraisers are often over who gets to sit next to the President or Presidential `wannabes.' It may seem absurd to the uninitiated, but among fundraisers, top pols are the rock stars of the beltway. In some ways, the real scandal of the White House coffees and overnights that got President Clinton in such pre-Monica trouble is that many sophisticated people were willing to raise or give so much to be little more than Washington groupies. 
Buying access? It is not automatically the motive on the part of those who give. They give because they believe that this is good for the country. They believe in the cause. In this same article in Fortune, there is a specific example of one of these gentlemen--Arnold Hiatt. He is highlighted in the article. Mr. Hiatt believes in many things in which I do not believe. He is of the opposite political persuasion than I, and the article reports that: 
In 1996, Arnold S. Hiatt, 71, was the second-largest individual contributor to the Democratic Party. His $500,000 gift was second only to the $600,000 given by Loral's Bernard Schwartz, who is now better known for his Chinese missile connections. 
According to the article, Mr. Hiatt has decided not to give any more money to the Democrats. He gave $500,000 a month before the November 1996 election, specifically to help unseat 23 vulnerable House Republicans and return the House to Democratic control. Quoting the article: 
It was the failure of his money to produce that result--not just a fit of conscience--that spawned Hiatt's change of heart. Asked why he decided to stop contributing to politicians so soon after giving so much, he admits that it was because his Democrats didn't win. 
He gave the money for what he believes is a public-spirited reason, and he stopped giving to the parties because he didn't get the result that he wanted. Being a good businessman--he is the former CEO of Stride Rite, the company that makes Keds--he discovered he wasn't getting a return on his investment--not a return in corruption, not a return in access--I am sure he still has access to all the Democrats he wants--but a return on his ideological investment. He wanted the Democrats to control the House. He gave money to the Democratic National Committee. The Democrats didn't control the House so he decided to do something else. 
What is he going to do? He is going to give his money directly to special interest groups. Now, according to the article, he doesn't believe that the groups to which he gives money are special interest groups; it is the groups he opposed that are the special interest groups. 
The article says: 
Hiatt then having gotten religion, has changed tactics. Rather than relying on the Democrats to press his agenda, he is now giving heavily to organizations like the Washington based public campaign which lobbied for publicly financed elections. Since the business interests that Hiatt so dislikes tend to have more money than the green groups he backs, Hiatt believes taxpayer funded elections would curtail the clout of the bad guys. Both the House and Senate would be controlled by the voters and less by special interests, Hiatt insists. But what he means is that Congress would be controlled by the people he agrees with. 
Once again, Mr. President, the issue is access to the voters. Mr. Hiatt thought he could help get his agenda if he gave money to the Democrats. It didn't work. So he is seeking access to the voters through special interest groups. He has decided that the parties are not able to help him advance his agenda, and he is going to fund other groups to help advance his agenda. He has every right to do that. I applaud his willingness to get engaged and involved in American politics. But, if we pass the amendment that is before us, he will be curtailed, and the groups to which he contributes will be curtailed in their effort to gain access to the voters.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky is now getting into grounds that I love but that some others have sometimes scorned in this debate; that is, the basis of the free speech position of the Constitution of the United States. 
If I may respond to the Senator from Kentucky by quoting from James Madison and the Federalist Papers that support exactly what he said, they didn't use the term `special interest' back in Madison's century. The term of art then was `faction.' 
This is what James Madison had to say: 
By a faction I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens. 
That sounds like the definition of a special interest group to me. 
Madison goes on to say: 
There are . . . two methods of removing the causes of faction: The one, by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the other, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests. 
It could never be more truly said than of the first remedy that it was worse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire. 
Certainly we do not want to eliminate air that we cannot breathe in the name of stopping a fire that might occur, and we do not want to eliminate liberty. 
So Madison makes that point. 
Referring to the second, giving everyone the same opinions, passions, and interests, Madison says: 
The second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be unwise. As long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed. 
Absolutely the Founding Fathers created the Constitution for the sole purpose of protecting the rights of every one to have his own special interest, belong to his own faction, and hold his own opinion. An attempt on the part of the Senate of the United States to destroy that right is clearly going to be held unconstitutional as it has been again and again, as my friend from Kentucky has pointed out so often on the floor.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would suggest that individuals are seriously restricted under this bill because they cannot exercise their constitutional privilege of giving the money to a political party. Mr. Hiatt has made the choice not to give the money to the political party, if the article is to be believed solely on the basis that it didn't work, not because he was motivated by some other higher spirit. He decided to give the money directly to a faction because he thought it would be more effective. 
If this bill passes, as I understand it, Mr. Hiatt would be prohibited from changing that decision. That is, if he were to decide that, `Gee, I could make things better if I gave it directly to the political party, I want to go back to what I was doing before,' he would be prohibited from doing that on the grounds that this is soft money, and he is forced by the law to give his money to a special interest group rather than to a political party or to a political candidate. 
This puts us in the position of paradoxically strengthening the hands of special interest groups at the expense of political parties and political candidates. This puts us in the position of saying that eventually political discourse in this country will go the way that it is going in California. I lived in California for long enough to know that the California pattern of putting issues directly on the ballot with no spending limitation whatsoever eclipses elections for candidates. The amount of spending that went on in the last California election on the various referenda vastly outstripped and eclipsed the amount that any candidate was able to spend. And if we get to the point where political candidates are squeezed out of access to the voters by groups funded by people like Mr. Hiatt who have unlimited amounts to spend, we are going to be in great difficulty.

Mr. BENNETT. That is not the only effect. If I can repeat once again, this bill, in light of the Snowe-Jeffords amendment, would hasten the day when people would abandon candidates and abandon parties and give their money directly to special interest groups, as Mr. Hiatt has voluntarily decided to do in this situation, and I think that would be tremendously deleterious to the cause of worthwhile political discourse in this country. 
I pause at this example. Let us suppose that in the State of Utah the Sierra Club were to decide that their No. 1 goal was to drain Lake Powell. Indeed, they have announced many places that that is soon to be their No. 1 goal.

Mr. BENNETT. For the information of all Senators, when the Senate reconvenes on Wednesday at 9 a.m., there will be 45 minutes of debate prior to a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the missile defense bill. That vote should occur at approximately 9:45 a.m. If cloture is not invoked, the Senate will resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill. At 4:30, assuming cloture is not invoked on the missile defense legislation, the Senate will begin 30 minutes of debate prior to a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the bankruptcy bill. That vote will occur at approximately 5 p.m. Therefore, Members should expect votes throughout Wednesday's session, with the first vote occurring at approximately 9:45 a.m.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, yesterday, as is the habit in the Senate, the Republicans met in policy luncheon during the lunch hour, and during that meeting I made some comments which, under the terms of the meeting, normally remain confidential. 
Apparently they were sufficiently provocative that, within an hour or so of the meeting, my office was besieged with calls from reporters who wanted to know if I was going to proceed in the manner that had been reported to them. Others of my colleagues were similarly accosted by reporters who wanted to know what is Senator Bennett going to do on the issue he raised in the policy lunch. Rather than try to respond to each of those reporters individually, I decided that I would take the floor this morning and make a presentation of what it was I said at the policy lunch yesterday, and thereby end any suspense anyone may have. I assure you, this issue is probably not worth the amount of concern that was stirred up yesterday, but I will make it clear what I said and what I have in mind. 
The issue that was under discussion had to do with the behavior of the President of the United States, as indicated by his statement to the people of America several weeks ago. I made this comment. I said that if any Member of this body had engaged in that kind of behavior, he or she would be subject to censure for that behavior, and I singled out three areas in particular which I feel would be worthy of censure. 
The first: It is now clear that the President of the United States had a relationship with an intern who was under his control and in his purview within the White House, which was improper, or, in the words of the President himself, `wrong.' This was not a chance encounter. It was not a matter of her bringing him a piece of pizza, catching his eye, he catching her eye, she smiled at him, he smiled at her, and something improper happened and that was the end of it. It was an affair with sexual activity that began in December of 1995 and continued for 18 months, including the period of time after she had left the White House and was no longer in the President's direct line of report. And it ended, apparently, only because it was discovered and reported in the public. If any Member of this body had that kind of a relationship with an intern in his office he would, I think, very appropriately be subject to censure from the Ethics Committee and by the Senate as a whole. That is the first item. 
The second item: When this matter became public, the President went before the public and insisted in the most emphatic possible language that it had not happened. Furthermore, he then gathered his Cabinet and his closest aides around him and, in direct personal contact with many of them, assured them that the public reports of this activity were false, and urged them to go forward and speak in his behalf repeating that denial. We had members of the President's Cabinet come before the Congress and repeat that denial, in effect lying to the Congress from their position as Cabinet officers on behalf of the President of the United States. This, in my opinion, is the second thing that would justify censure, lying and urging others, particularly members of his official family, to lie in various fora, including an official forum of the Congress of the United States. 
Then there is the third: While this was going on, for a period of 7 to 7 1/2 months, the President allowed many of his subordinates, aides and supporters to not only lie about this issue--admittedly, they thought they were telling the truth because they had believed the President--but also to attack and smear those who were telling the truth; to go after the reputation of those who had come forward with an accurate description of what was going on and attempt to destroy those reputations in the public arena. This, in my opinion, would be a third reason for censure. And I repeat, I am convinced that if any Member of this body had, No. 1, engaged in that kind of extended improper sexual relationship with an intern; No. 2, lied to his own associates and urged those associates to go forward and lie in his behalf; and, No. 3, then sat by while others of his official family smeared the reputations of those who were telling the truth, a motion for censure would be brought upon this floor and passed, I believe, overwhelmingly. 
So I raised in the policy luncheon yesterday the possibility of having a motion of censure raised as a sense-of-the-Senate resolution with respect to the President of the United States. I pointed out that this should in no way prejudge any impeachment activity that might occur in the House of Representatives for several reasons. In the first place, we do not know what is in Judge Starr's report that will come to the House of Representatives, and what I have described has public circulation, indeed confirmation by the President himself, and therefore need not depend upon Judge Starr's report in order for us to act upon it. 
Second, Judge Starr's report and the action of the House of Representatives will not take place, if such action does occur, until the 106th Congress. I believe that something as serious as this should be commented on by the 105th Congress. I do not know that I will be in the 106th Congress. I hope I will be. The political signs in my home State indicate that I will be. But I can take nothing for granted, and I raised with my colleagues yesterday the possibility of having this Congress go on record as stating that it found totally unacceptable and subject to condemnation--because the word `censure' is a synonym for condemn--the actions of the President in the three areas I have described. 
I pointedly said I do not want to go beyond those three areas with any resolution of censure because I do not know what is in Ken Starr's report. I do not want to prejudge the issue of whether or not those three items constitute impeachable offenses or high crimes and misdemeanors as such offenses are described in the Constitution. I think that is the responsibility for the House to undertake under the Constitution, and the House, in the 106th Congress, will make that decision. 
I raised that possibility within the Republican policy luncheon, for conversation and counsel from my colleagues. I received a good deal of conversation and counsel from my colleagues, both in that luncheon and subsequent to it, and I have reflected on the matter myself in conversations with my staff. But, as I said, it was within an hour or so after I had made essentially the same statement that I have made here within the policy luncheon that members of the press were after me and some of my colleagues, to say, `Is Senator Bennett going to offer a motion of censure with respect to the President of the United States?' I told those reporters, as I indicated earlier, that I would give them their answer today. 
The answer is no, Senator Bennett will not be offering a motion of censure, for two reasons. First, there are some who would interpret that motion of censure as an attempt to bring this issue to closure. Closure, interestingly enough, is a psychological term, not a legal term. In legal terms, you come to guilty or innocent; you come to `case closed,' with a final finding of fact. Closure seems to be a psychological term where you say the individual is now able to deal with this issue. 
But, aside from the semantic question involved, I do not want to be a party to any suggestion that the investigation of the President's behavior and the consideration of whether or not that behavior constitutes an impeachable offense should come to an end by virtue of the resolution that I might offer. So, for that first reason, I have concluded that I will not, in fact, offer this resolution. 
The second reason I have decided not to offer the resolution is because some have suggested that, since the Senate would ultimately be the jury that would try any accusations with respect to impeachment, I should not, as a Member of the Senate, prejudge the case. I can draw a fine line with which I would be comfortable that would say that my resolution of censure, saying that I found this behavior in the three areas I have described to be reprehensible, would not prejudge a determination as to whether that behavior constituted a high crime or misdemeanor under the Constitution, 
and I would be comfortable with that distinction. But since there are some who would not be comfortable and who would suggest that by offering the resolution I was prejudging the case, I have also, for that second reason, decided that I will not offer that resolution. 
That, I hope, Mr. President, clears up, if anybody had any concerns about what I said yesterday in the policy luncheon, what I intend to do. 
I conclude, however, with this one final thought with respect to this issue. One of the reasons I considered offering the resolution, so that the Senate at least would go on record as making it clear that this behavior was unacceptable, is because I imagined this scenario in the future: 
Let us suppose that at some point in the future--pick a date, 5 years--the superintendent of West Point, a married man in his early fifties, became involved sexually with a 21-year-old female cadet who had come to his office to bring him coffee. The superintendent maintained a sexual relationship with that female cadet for the next 18 months while she was still within his purview and under some form or other of his control. Other cadets found out about the relationship and began talking about it in the scenario I am describing. 
The superintendent, let us suppose, adamantly denies that the relationship is going on, recognizing that it is totally inappropriate and wrong. An investigation is opened whereby legally constituted authorities from the Department of Defense check into the rumors. The superintendent attacks the investigator, smears his ability and his integrity, denies absolutely to his own circle of aides that the affair had ever taken place, and allows the impression to go forward throughout the entire community that he is the subject of a witch hunt being undertaken by the Department of Defense. 
After 7 months of stonewalling, denying and refusing to cooperate, the superintendent is then forced to admit that, No. 1, the relationship did take place; No. 2, he has been lying through the 7 months; and, No. 3, there has been a smearing of the reputation of people of high integrity. 
I would not want, under that circumstance, to have the superintendent then approach the Department of Defense with a poll showing that 58 percent of the cadets were happy under his superintendency at West Point and say, `Since the Commander in Chief did something like this 5 years ago and no reprimand of any kind came out of the Congress, why cannot I do exactly the same thing under these circumstances and not have it affect my career?' 
I wish the precedent to be laid down that says that this kind of activity, whether it constitutes impeachable offenses or not, cannot go uncommented on in an official way. And just because I have decided that I will not offer this resolution in this Congress at this time for the two reasons I have outlined, I do make it clear, Mr. President, that should the voters of Utah send me back here to serve in the 106th Congress, I will do what I can to give Members of Congress a clear opportunity, regardless of impeachment proceedings, to express their opinion on the behavior of the President of the United States in this circumstance. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, this morning there will be a period of morning business for up to 15 minutes. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the Texas Compact conference report, with 40 minutes remaining for debate equally divided between Senators Snowe and Wellstone. 
At the conclusion of debate time, the Senate will proceed to a vote on the adoption of the conference report. Therefore, the first rollcall vote of today's session will occur at approximately 10 a.m. 
Following that vote, the Senate will resume consideration of the foreign operations appropriations bill. Rollcall votes are expected throughout Wednesday's session as the Senate attempts to complete action on the foreign operations appropriations bill. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the `San Rafael National Heritage and Conservation Act' and I am pleased to be joined by Senator Hatch in this effort. 
The San Rafael National Heritage and Conservation Act not only accomplishes the preservation of an important historic area, but it is the result of a collaborative approach among Federal land managers, state and local governments and other concerned agencies and organizations. This revised legislation incorporates several of the suggestions of the Administration, the House and those who originally expressed concerns about the bill as introduced in the House. The legislation we introduce today is the result of months of discussions between the Bureau of Land Management, the citizens of Emery County and Members of Congress. It is a good-faith effort to initiate what we hope will bring resolution to the larger philosophical differences between land management practices in Utah. With a little luck, we might even begin a process which could lead to a resolution to the ongoing Utah wilderness debate. 
The San Rafael Swell region in the State of Utah was one of America's last frontiers. I have in my office, a map of the State of Utah drafted in 1876 in which large portions of the San Rafael Swell were simply left blank because they were yet to be explored. Visitors who comment on this map are amazed when they see that large portions of the San Rafael area remained unmapped thirty years after the Mormon pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley. 
This area is known for its important historical sites, notable tradition of mining, widely recognized paleontological resources, and numerous recreational opportunities. As such, it needs to be protected. The San Rafael Swell National Conservation Area created through this legislation will be approximately 630,000 acres in size and will comprise wilderness, a Bighorn Sheep Management Area, a scenic Area of Critical Environmental Concern, and Semi-Primitive Area of Non-Motorized Use. The value of the new management structure for the National Conservation Area can be found in the flexibility it gives in addressing a broad array of issues from the protection of critical lands to the oversight of recreational uses. 
The San Rafael National Heritage and Conservation Act sets aside 130,000 acres as BLM wilderness lands. It permanently removes the threat of mining, oil drilling, and timbering from the Swell. It also sets aside a conservation area of significant size to protect Utah's largest herd of Desert Bighorn Sheep. Vehicle travel is restricted to designated roads and trails in other areas and visitors recreational facilities are provided. Finally, it will assist the BLM and the local communities in developing a long term strategy to preserve the history and heritage of the region through the National Heritage Area. Careful study of the bill shows that the San Rafael Swell National Heritage and Conservation Act is a multidimensional management plan for an area with multidimensional needs. It provides comprehensive protection and management for an entire ecosystem. 
My colleagues in the House have worked hard to address the concerns of the Administration and they have made several changes to the House version as introduced in an effort to improve the legislation. We have redrawn maps, eliminated roads from wilderness areas, eliminated cherry stems of other roads and increased the size of wilderness and semi-primitive areas. Specifically, by including new provisions dealing with the Compact and Heritage Plan, the new language ensures that the resources found in the county will be properly surveyed and understood prior to the Heritage Area moving forward. 
With regards to the Conservation Area, bill language guarantees that the management plan will not impair any of the important resources within the Swell. We have also included new language that ensures the Secretary of Interior is fully represented on the Advisory Council. 
The San Rafael Swell National Heritage and Conservation Act is unique in that it sets the San Rafael Swell apart from Utah's other national parks and monuments. It protects not only the important lands in this area but also another resource just as precious--its captivating history and heritage. This bill is an example of how a legislative solution can result from a grassroots effort involving both state and local government officials, the BLM, historical preservation groups, and wildlife enthusiasts. Most important, it takes the necessary steps to preserve the wilderness value of these lands. 
This legislation has broad statewide and local support. It is sound, reasonable, and innovative in its approach to protecting and managing the public land treasures of the San Rafael Swell. Finally, it is based on the scientific methods of ecosystem management and prevents the fracturing of large areas of multiple use lands with small parcels of wilderness interspersed between. 
Mr. President, I will conclude with this point; the wilderness debate in Utah has gone on too long. My colleagues will be reminded that in the last Congress, the debate centered around whether two million acres or 5.7 million acres were the proper amount of wilderness to designate. We are now trying to protect more than 600,000 acres in one county in Utah alone. The Emery County Commissioners should be commended for their foresight and vision in preparing this proposal. I hope that this legislation can become a model for future conflict resolutions. 
Unfortunately, the shouting match over acreage has often drowned out the discussion over what types of protection were in order for these lands. I doubt that there are few people who would debate the need to protect these lands. But too often in the past we have argued over the definition of what constitutes `protection.' Unfortunately for some groups, a certain designation is the only method of acceptable protection. I urge those groups to look beyond the trees and see the forest for a change. Should these groups decide to come to the table, lend their considerable expertise to our efforts and try to reach a consensus, the first steps toward resolving the decades-old wilderness debate in Utah will have been taken. 
I hope my colleagues will carefully review this legislation and support for this bill.

 Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today I introduce, by request of President Bill Clinton, the Administration's `Good Samaritan' legislation referred to as the `Year 2000 Information Disclosure Act'. 
I want to thank the White House for joining Vice Chairman Dodd and the rest of the members of the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem in the debate on how to promote the flow of information on Year 2000 readiness throughout the private sector. The Administration's recognition of this problem, the fear of law suits and its stifling effect on companies' willingness to disclose helpful Y2K information, is invaluable in helping all of us deal with this national crisis. 
The existing legal framework clearly discourages the sharing of critical information between private sector companies. The President's bill attempts to limit the legal liability of corporations and other organizations who in good faith openly share information about computer and technology processing problems and related matters in connection with the transition to the Year 2000. We welcome the thoughtful ideas of the White House and the hard work of the Office of Management and Budget, as well John Koskinen, the Chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion. 
President Clinton's proposal represents a good starting point from which to begin the process of addressing the critical need for private sector information sharing announced in his speech before the National Sciences Foundation on Tuesday, July 14. 
The Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, which I chair, has to date held hearings on Year 2000 problems in several industry sectors including energy utilities, financial institutions, and health care. This Friday, July 31, the Committee will hold its fourth hearing the subject of which will be the telecommunications industry. In each of the prior hearings, it has become increasingly evident that the fear of legal liability has proven to be the single biggest deterrent to the open sharing of Year 2000 information. With just over 500 days remaining before the Year 2000 problem manifests itself in full, we must do everything we can to encourage the sharing of vital Year 2000 information. Through this sharing, organizations can save valuable time and resources in addressing their Year 2000 problems. 
But, we must be careful to pass meaningful legislation that will indeed encourage disclosure and sharing of Year 2000 information. For example, small companies which cannot afford to do all of their own testing and who, for the most part, are not as knowledgeable about where the dangers of the Y2K bug may appear are significant elements of our economy and their Y2K failures could have devastating impacts on those who depend on their services. 
We look forward to hearing the input of those companies and individuals who are affected both as plaintiffs and defendants. To be of value, we must pass legislation this year. To that end, we will be working closely with the administration, and with Senators Hatch and Leahy of the Judiciary Committee which has the primary jurisdiction for this legislation.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, my understanding of the actions and activities of the FEC up to this point indicate that it is an agency badly in need of reform, and I am delighted that the term limits have been enacted. It is also my understanding that because of its past history, some Commissioners of the FEC have been less than diligent in their duties and, as a result, the power to run the Commission has devolved to the staff. 
When we debate term limits generally, we are often told that one of the reasons we should oppose term limits is because it will put too much power in the hands of the staff. The staff becomes the permanent and institutional memory of the body, while those who are supposed to run it keep cycling through on term limits. 
I think it entirely appropriate that we give the new Commissioners, as their terms expire, the opportunity to act affirmatively on the staff and not allow the power of inertia to keep staff members in forever and forever. It is a logical thing to do, and I am happy to support it and happy to be a cosponsor of this amendment. 
I reserve the remainder of the time.

Mr. BENNETT. I simply have to respond to the notion that this is an amendment to fire the incumbent general counsel. That is what we were told in the last debate. That assumes that the present general counsel does not enjoy bipartisan support. That assumes that the present general counsel has conducted himself in such a way that he cannot gather the necessary four votes. I have no knowledge that that is indeed the case. But if it is indeed the case, it is a strong argument for saying that the present general counsel probably should not be in his job. 
If he cannot muster bipartisan support to hold this job, we have a situation where he is obviously supporting one party over the other in order to maintain those three votes. That is the only conclusion that can be drawn from the argument made by the Senator from Wisconsin who claims this is an attempt to fire the incumbent general counsel. 
There is nothing in here that says this is an attempt to fire the incumbent general counsel. It simply says the incumbent general counsel has to enjoy bipartisan support. And if he is as wonderful and as bipartisan as the Senator from Wisconsin says he is, he has nothing to fear from this amendment.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I wish to make a personal comment about the tragedy that occurred in this building on Friday and add my voice to those that have been raised in tribute to the professionalism, the courage, and the compassion of the members of the Capitol Police Force. 
I remember, when I first came to Washington as an intern in 1950 as a student from the university, the Capitol Police Force was affectionately referred to as the `campus cops.' It was a patronage job, and people who served on the Capitol Police Force in those days were appointed by their Senators. Usually, they were law students who were going to school at George Washington University that taught the entire curriculum at night. So the Capitol Police could earn their way through law school by sitting at their various stations in the Capitol during the daytime and taking their classes at night. One of the more prominent attorneys in Salt Lake City got his law degree that way and said he did all of his studying at his desk as a Capitol policeman and commented, `If I had ever been called upon to draw my weapon, I wouldn't have known what to do. I would have been scared to death if anybody had ever confronted me in my position as a policeman.' 
That was the situation 40, 45 years ago. The professionalism of those who did draw their weapons and handled them expertly in the crisis that occurred last Friday demonstrates how far we have come and how great a debt those of us who labor here, hopefully doing the people's business, have to those who have produced that kind of professionalism and produced that kind of change from what we once had. It is a sad commentary that we need this kind of professional force and we don't have the kind of society that could get by with `campus cops' of the kind that were here that many years ago, but it is comforting to know, in the face of that need, we have people of the caliber that we do have serve us. I add my voice to those that have been raised in tribute to those who serve us in that capacity.

Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, let me give you a little history as I see it with respect to this bill and why this amendment, in my view, makes sense. 
We are here because the Supreme Court has ruled that the NCUA, the regulatory body dealing with credit unions, has been misapplying the law since 1982. The Supreme Court in response to lawsuits that were brought before it has ruled that credit unions have grown in violation of the law, or have engaged in actions that are a violation of the law since 1982. 
Since those credit unions were following the dictates of the NCUA, their regulator, it would be unfair to penalize the credit unions; they were playing by the rules as they understood them. And when the rulemaker itself was the agency that was making a mistake, it is not fair to penalize the people who followed those rules. But we have to change the rules if they have been improperly applied, and that is what the result of the Supreme Court decision has presented us. 
We have decided, as a Congress, that we are going to change the rules, that we are going to now codify that which has been done since 1982, and I think it is right and proper that we do so. I am in favor of doing that, however much that may disappoint the banks that were hoping that with the winning of this lawsuit they could turn the clock back to 1982. But we cannot. We must say that those who have appropriately opened accounts at credit unions will have those accounts protected, and that we will not turn the clock back that many years. 
As we have done this, we have raised the maximum size of an employee group which is eligible to affiliate into a multiple common bond credit union from 500 to 3,000. That is a sixfold increase, and the 3,000 employee threshold encompasses 99 percent of all businesses in America. There are only 16 private companies in my entire State that employ more than 3,000 people. So this is a major step forward to support and encourage the credit union movement, and I believe it is the real heart of the bill that is before us, and I support this activity. 
But in the process of dealing with the Supreme Court ruling and making the change about the maximum size of employee groups, the Banking Committee has taken a look at the credit union situation overall and has come to the conclusion, rightly in my view, that in order to protect the safety and soundness of credit unions, there should be a limit on the amount of commercial loans that credit unions make. 
The only controversy that we have with respect to the amendment before us is not should there be such a limit but, rather, where should the limit be. As it came out of the committee, the limit was at 12.25 percent of assets, and I supported that. But I recognized that it needed to be looked at more carefully, and as I have looked at it more carefully, along with the other Senators who have cosponsored this amendment, I have come to the conclusion that the limit should be slightly less than the 12.25 that was in the bill from the committee. It should be at 7 percent, which is the amount set aside by regulation as to credit union capital. 
Why the lower amount? Well, there are several reasons. One of them that Senator Hagel has already addressed has to do with safety and soundness and the experience in other States, specifically Rhode Island that had some serious difficulties. We don't want a repeat of those difficulties, and a lower limit is a greater bulwark against those difficulties than the one which is higher. 
I am interested that the telephone calls we get in our office as this amendment gets talked about out in the credit union world almost always follow the same dialog. 
They say, `Why is Senator Bennett proposing an amendment that the credit unions don't like? We thought he supported credit unions.' 
Then the member of my staff answering the call said, `Senator Bennett is supporting an amendment that would put a limit on commercial loans.' 
Then the caller said, `But credit unions don't make commercial loans.' 
Which then puts us in the position to say, `If that in fact is true, why do you object to a limit?" 
Most credit union people who talked to me believe that credit unions make loans only to individuals. And the credit unions that have come to see me from the State of Utah have all stressed the fact that commercial lending is a very small percentage of their business. Indeed, they say, `No, we do not go above 5 percent of our total capital involved in commercial loans.' 
And, to them I say, once again, `If you don't go above 5 percent, why would you object to a limit that is at 7 percent? You can continue to do exactly what you are doing under the Hagel amendment, with no difficulty.' 
Then, finally, one of them who was seized with a burst of candor cornered me when I was in the State this last time and said, `We want to grow our commercial loan business, and if you put in the 7 percent cap that you are talking about, we will hit that within a matter of months. We are growing very rapidly. We want the cap higher so we can grow beyond that level.' 
This gentleman--and I use the word `gentleman" appropriately, because he certainly was in the way he handled himself in our conversation--has, as his background, a career in commercial banking. He, for reasons good and sufficient unto himself, decided he was going to leave the bank that he had worked at most of his life and go to work for a credit union. 
Naturally, the thing he wanted to do with his new employer is use his skills to the very best advantage. And since his whole history is in growing commercial loans at the bank for which he had worked, he decided he would now work to grow commercial loans in the credit union where he worked. And he has been very successful. The credit union portfolio of commercial loans under his direction is growing rapidly, growing rapidly to the point that, as I say, if you put a cap at the 7 percent we are talking about with this amendment, his credit union will hit that within a matter of months. And he said, `Can't you stick with the 12.25 percent that came out of the committee, because we will not hit that for maybe a year or so?" 
So, as I said, the issue is not, should we have a cap; the issue is only where should it be. And, because he wants, naturally and properly, to see the amount of portfolio that he is overseeing grow to as big an amount as it possibly can, he wants the cap to be as high as it can. I am very sympathetic to him and, to be honest, I don't think there is a safety and soundness problem in his institution. I think he is properly trained as a banker, so that he can handle commercial loans in a credit union atmosphere and do very well. 
But the public policy issue that we have to decide here on this floor is, do we want credit unions in that kind of business in a major way? The 12.25 percent limit in the bill that came out of the committee answers that question, `Yes.' That is a fairly major involvement for credit unions. And we run the risk of having those who are not equipped with former commercial bankers, like the man who talked with me, going up to that limit and endangering the savings and the assets of their other members. 
One of the aspects of the amendment that is before us to which credit union representatives object says that, if you are going to make commercial loans, you have to have someone in your organization who has at least 2 years of business lending experience--in other words, someone like the man who came to see me while I was back in Utah, who clearly had plenty of years' experience. 
Again, I am interested that credit union representatives object to this requirement at the same time they insist they are not in the business of making commercial loans. You cannot have it both ways. If, indeed, you want to get in commercial lending in a big way, you ought to have the requirement that you have someone with experience in commercial lending in a big way. You can't say, `We want a higher limit for the amount of commercial lending we can do, but we want no requirement that we have anybody around who understands commercial lending.' This is a recipe for the kind of thing that the Senator from Nebraska has described as already happening in some States. 
So, I come back to the basic issue before us: What should be the proper public policy role of credit unions in the financial services mix? I believe credit unions have earned an honored place in that mix. I believe they have demonstrated for the last 60 years that they provide a vital function and that they should be encouraged to continue that vital function, and, indeed, in that function they should be encouraged to grow, and we should create a circumstance in which they can grow and prosper. I believe that this bill does that. 
But the policy question is, Should we as a Congress, while fixing the problems created by the Supreme Court decision, at the same time encourage them to grow in a field where, by their own statements and admissions, they have not been in the past? Should we use this bill setting aside a Supreme Court decision as the vehicle to encourage new ventures on the part of credit unions that are ill equipped for those ventures? I think the answer is no, we should not. And, therefore, after studying the matter between markup and the full committee and the floor, I join with Senator Hagel in saying the limit level should be lower rather than higher with respect to the amount of involvement credit unions should have in commercial lending. 
I don't understand why they object to the lower level, because they themselves tell me, `We are not interested in commercial lending. That is not our bread and butter. That is not our area of expertise. That is not what we are doing.' 
And then I say, `Then why do you object if we put a situation in place that keeps you in your traditional area?' 
Finally, I share this one last thought with you, Mr. President. With respect to how important this amendment is to credit unions, in the May 29 National Journal's Congress Daily, the NAFCU vice president, Pat Keefe, is quoted as saying, `From our point of view, this is not major.' 
Mr. Keefe was referring to an amendment that would have imposed tighter restrictions than the one we are talking about. I think he speaks for the vast majority of credit union members who have been in touch with my offices. This is not major for them. I think it is significant for the community banks. I think it is a responsible decision for us to take. 
Let me make it clear, if we do not agree to this amendment, I will still support the bill, as I did in the committee, where it had a limit at 12.25 percent. Just because I think the 7 percent is more prudent does not mean that I think this is a deal killer. So, in that sense I guess I am signaling, `This is not major.' But, to me, it is major because it is a demonstration of where the public policy ought to be with respect to the thrust and main direction of the credit union movement. They think it is not major. To me, it is. I hope we agree to this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments made by the chairman and the ranking member of the committee. They underscore my earlier statement that the issue here is not, should we have a limit on commercial lending, but rather, where should it be and what should its terms be? 
I agree with the Senator from Maryland that the committee did, indeed, address this; did come to the conclusion there should be some limits on commercial lending, and reached a compromise position that made it possible for us to unanimously report the bill with this limit in it.

Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Maryland. I think he is correct that there are some in the body who do not think there ought to be a limit. 
If I could just make one comment, the reason there is no limit now is because the original drafters of the legislation creating credit unions never conceived there would be any commercial lending by credit unions. It reminds me a little of the old story, `Please Don't Eat the Daisies,' where the kids said, `Well, you never told us not to.' And the mother said, `It never occurred to me that you would, and therefore, I didn't give you those restrictions in the first place.' 
But now it has started. I think the committee has rightly and properly said, we want to keep credit unions focused in the area where they have traditionally been focused, providing the service they have traditionally provided. We are going to allow some commercial lending because they have gotten into that area. 
But there is empirical evidence that credit unions can get in trouble with their commercial lending. We want to take advantage of that evidence and put a limit on it. So the question is, Should the limit be 12.25 percent? Should it be 7 percent? And should the $50,000 exemption continue? 
I realize in responding to the Senator from Maryland that the $50,000 threshold does put some new unchartered territory on this issue. We do not have as much information as we would like. But I will share with the Senate the information that we do have. 
During 1992 and 1993, the NCUA required credit unions to collect information on business loans under the threshold, which at that time was $25,000 rather than $50,000. I think it goes to the issue that the chairman raised about the burden that would be placed on credit unions to deal with this kind of requirement. There has been a period in our history when it was there. The NCUA used its authority to put that requirement in place. 
During 1992, the only year for which we have complete information, total business loans both above and below the threshold were 1.62 percent of the total outstanding loans. In other words, once again, the credit unions were saying, by their actions, `We are not primarily involved in commercial lending.' Of this 1.62 percent, loans above $25,000 constituted 1.42 percent, with loans under $25,000 constituting the remaining .20 percent. 
I think this tells us that the terms of this amendment can be adhered to. I think we have some past experience that says this will not be a burden and particularly, again, this will not be a burden on the small credit unions who do not do this anyway. All we are really saying to them is we do not want you to do it, we do not want you to get into territory that could cause you difficulty. 
The question has been raised, How about buying a pickup truck? Is that a business loan or a personal loan? In the hearings some of the credit union representatives said to me, `Senator, you have to understand, in a credit union every single commercial loan is backed by the personal guarantee of the individual members of the credit union.' And I said--and I repeat here on the floor--`I have borrowed a lot of money in my lifetime. I borrowed it from commercial banks. I borrowed it for commercial reasons. And in every single instance, I have had to make a personal guarantee. In every single instance, the bank wanted my personal guarantee. Sometimes they wanted my wife's personal guarantee. Sometimes I had the feeling they wanted the promise of our first-born child if we didn't produce--even though this was a business loan--the repayment appropriately.' 
So the credit unions are not giving us anything specifically different when they say these are loans only made to members, and they have the members' personal guarantee. That is standard business practice everywhere across the board. 
As I said before, for me, this is a public policy debate of, what is it we are trying to do in terms of shaping the direction of the financial services industry? 
As I have said many times before, the financial services industry regulatory framework was created at a time when everybody knew where they were--credit unions were a very specific niche. They knew what they did. Commercial banks were a very specific niche. They knew what they did. The same is true of insurance companies and stockbrokers and savings and loans. Everybody had a clear understanding and nobody competed across those lines. 
Today, the competition runs across lines everywhere--insurance companies hand out checkbooks. I told a story before when my father died, we notified the life insurance company of his death and awaited a check of the face value of his insurance policy. Instead, we got a checkbook with a notice saying, `This money has been deposited in this account as of the date of your husband's death'--it was addressed to my mother--`Here is a checkbook. You may write checks on that account and interest will accrue from the date of your husband's death.' In other words, don't be in a big hurry to take your money away from the insurance company; use it as you would a checking account. 
When I purchased some stocks in one situation and I wanted to redeem those stocks under the old regulatory pattern that I was familiar with, I had to go down to the broker and the broker would give me a check. `No, no, no, no, no,' the broker says, `we will give you a checkbook and you can write checks up to the value of your margin account against the margin value of your stocks'--clearly crossing the lines between banks, brokers, and insurance companies and so on. 
Now, we are beginning to say we have to create a new regulatory structure for the new reality of the financial services world. We recognize that everybody is in everybody else's business. All we are debating here on this floor is to what degree do we want credit unions to get out of their traditional business into the commercial lending business. I am not sure that says they should make no commercial loans. I think that is appropriate, particularly for the larger and more stable institutions to which the chairman has referred. But as a matter of policy, I think we are saying, I hope we are saying in this amendment, we want credit unions to stay where they have been traditionally. 
If we say, `No, the credit unions should get into commercial lending in a big way,' then at some point we are going to have to address the issue of taxation. We have not done that in this bill. We should not do that in this bill. It would not be appropriate in this bill. But as a public policy matter, if credit unions are going to get into commercial lending in a major way, the Congress is going to have to address the reality of the tax subsidy that they currently enjoy. I would just as soon avoid that question for awhile. I think keeping the credit unions in a more limited area of commercial lending will help us do that. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will make just one comment on the statement of my friend, the chairman of the committee. I agree with him absolutely that there are no massive failures. We do have the one example that occurred in the State of Rhode Island, and it is reflected in the additional views of Senator Reed of Rhode Island when he wrote, with respect to the bill that came out of the committee, that he was concerned that the cap adopted by the committee is higher than the level of commercial lending that credit unions are currently engaged in, and he is concerned that it might lead to a repeat of the problems they had in Rhode Island. 
I agree completely with the Senator from New York that we do not face a crisis here. My support of the amendment stems from my conviction that the amendment would help us avoid a crisis in the future. The amendment would establish a cap that is above the level of activity that is currently going on, with the exception of a very few major credit unions who have 3 years in which to work things out. It would establish a cap above where things currently are, allowing people plenty of room to round off their present activity. But it would send the public policy message that says: We want credit unions to remain in their traditional niche in the financial services area. And it is for that reason that I have decided to support this amendment, because that is where I want credit unions to remain. 
As I said earlier in my statement, all of the people who call me to talk about this bill insist that credit unions don't make commercial loans now. These are the members of the credit unions who are calling in who are unaware of the fact that their credit unions are making commercial loans. Therefore, I can't understand why they get upset when we say we are putting in a limit. It is not arbitrary in the sense that it is a limit above current levels; it is a limit above where people are currently operating and is simply sending the message that we don't want the current situation to change. That, after all, is the primary purpose of this bill. 
Without this bill, the Supreme Court changes the current situation and changes it drastically. The bill is crafted to say: No, we don't want to change; we want the present situation with respect to credit unions to be protected. Therefore, we are going to pass a bill that will change the law to protect where we are. Our amendment simply says, with respect to commercial lending and the levels of commercial lending, we will protect where we are. 
Now, I recognize there are those who disagree. I recognize that the committee decided to put the cap at a slightly higher level than one that would protect where we are, that would allow some growth from where we are in commercial lending. I don't think the Republic will fall if we allow that growth to occur. But I do think that if the thrust of this legislation is to keep in place the current situation of credit unions, our amendment is the logical way to keep in place the current situation with respect to commercial loans.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Maryland that the bill does represent a significant step forward in the regulatory framework with credit unions. I think his clarifying remarks are correct and welcome. 
The point I was making, which I think is still a valid one, is from the standpoint of the consumer, from the standpoint of the credit union member. The great angst on the part of credit union members, when the Supreme Court decision came down, was reflected in their visits with me repeatedly in my office. It was that: We are going to lose everything we have and you must pass this bill to protect what we have. 
I heard that over and over again in town meetings throughout the State of Utah, and over and over from people who called. From the standpoint of the credit union member, they are pleading for legislation that says: Let us keep what we have. Do not allow this decision to take away from us that which we have come to enjoy and get benefit from. 
My reference was to the reaction on the part of the consumer and the credit union member rather than on the part of the regulator. 
I think what we have done in the committee does that and, at the same time, as the Senator from Maryland points out, creates some stability for the credit union situation that was not there prior to this act.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to enter a colloquy with the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation Appropriations, Senator Shelby. The topic of my colloquy addresses the ongoing design/build work on Interstate 15 through the Salt Lake Valley and the unique opportunity this project presents to conduct seismic and other bridge structure research on existing overpasses that will soon be replaced. 
I would like to thank the Transportation Appropriations Chairman for his interest and support of research on Interstate 15 bridge structures during the reconstruction of this important segment of highway. The Subcommittee on Transportation Appropriations included language in its report (105-249, page 96) which provides $2,000,000 for research on Interstate 15 bridge structures. This report language directs the Federal Highway Administration to make this money available to the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) and the Utah Transportation Center (UTC), Chairman Shelby, am I correct in understanding that UDOT was included in this language primarily to facilitate the flow of these federal funds to the Utah Transportation Center which will administer the research done by Utah State University, University of Utah and Brigham Young University?

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the distinguished Chairman is aware of the importance of weather forecasting support for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. I appreciate the continued support of the Committee with these important preparations for the 2002 Winter Olympics. Millions of spectators will gather in mountain venues. Obviously, accurate and timely weather forecasting support is critical to ensure the safety of both the spectators and the athletes. As you know, the Committee directs the National Weather Service to provide support to the NOAA Cooperative Institute at the University of Utah. It is my understanding that the committee expects the National Weather Service to work with the Cooperative Institute to develop a plan and budget which will help ensure public safety and assist with the operations of the Games. The 2002 Winter Games represents an excellent opportunity for the National Weather Service and the Cooperative Institute to work with private meteorological firms and federal, state, and local agencies to provide accurate weather forecasting for the Games.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, it was my intention at this point to propound the unanimous consent request that the Senate proceed to S. 2137, with a list of the amendments to be in order. At the moment, full agreement on this has not yet been worked out between the majority and minority and negotiations are still going on to that end. It is my hope I will be able to offer such a unanimous consent request at sometime in the future. 
Looking forward to that time later today when we can get unanimous consent on proceeding to the bill, I would like to outline for the Senate the highlights of the bill. Then I understand there are some others who might wish to speak on the amendments that they would offer to the bill if we were, indeed, on it, and thereby have some of the discussion that we could deal with prior to the bill.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as I said, I was planning to ask unanimous consent that we proceed to S. 2137 and outline a series of amendments that would be in order. We are still working on that agreement between the majority leader and the minority leader who, I understand, are talking on this issue right now. 
When we do go to that appropriations bill, I will make a point of thanking Senator Dorgan for his assistance as the ranking member. Since I have been chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee and he has been my ranking member, we have not had, in my memory, a single point of major disagreement. Senator Dorgan has been more than diligent in attending all of the meetings of the subcommittee. His staff has been very cooperative with the majority staff in working out the difficulties, and I think it has been the kind of legislative relationship that I looked forward to, when I ran for the Senate, between members of the different parties. 
The legislative branch bill will provide $1,585,021,425 in new budget authority, exclusive of the House items for fiscal year 1999. Comity between the two Houses allows the House to set its amount and the Senate to set its amount, without difficulty from each other. This is a $53,704,925 increase, or 3.5 percent above the fiscal year 1998 level. But it is $72,359,575 below the amount included in the President's budget. The majority of the increases in the bill are for cost-of-living adjustments, estimated at 3.1 percent. 
The Senate portion of the bill includes a 1.8 percent increase over the fiscal year 1998 funding, which I think demonstrates some fiscal responsibility on our part. The Library of Congress and the GAO were provided funds for additional FTEs to assist the Congress in the information technology area, particularly addressing the year 2000 computer problem. 
The Presiding Officer and others in the Chamber know I have made this something of an obsession. The Senate has created a special committee on the year 2000 technology problem, which I chair. We recognize that most of the expertise to provide the committee with the guidance that it needs will come from detailees to the special committee and from those experts in the Library of Congress and the GAO who already have a background in this area. So, to make sure the year 2000 problem is not exacerbated by lack of funds, these additional FTEs were included in this bill. That is part of the 3.5 percent increase over last year's level. 
Approximately 21 percent of the Architect's budget is for capital projects; the balance, of course, of 79 percent is for the operating statement. 
These are the outlines of the overall bill. As far as I know, and Senator Dorgan knows, the bill is noncontroversial except for those amendments that some Senators have indicated they would be willing to offer. 
With that background of the bill that we have in mind, I yield the floor. I understand Senator Brownback will be talking about some of the amendments that he would offer once the bill does come before us, and we can proceed then in morning business with that matrix. I see the Senator from Kentucky. I will be happy to yield.

Mr. BENNETT. I want to make one quick clarification. The Senator made a comment that before we pay ourselves, and there are many people who believe that pay for Members of the Senate is included in the legislative branch appropriations bill. I want to make it clear that it is not. The legislative branch bill is pay for the staff, pay for the agencies connected with the legislative branch, but Members' pay is not here. If we do go to the legislative branch appropriations bill, it will not deal with pay for Members of Congress.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I take the Senate floor to enter a colloquy with the distinguished Chairman of the VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Subcommittee, Senator Bond. The topic of which I speak is the tremendous growth that continues to take place in my home state of Utah. Presently, Utah is ranked by the U.S. Bureau of the Census as the third fastest growing state in the Union. While Utah is often thought of as a rural state, roughly 80 percent of our population resides in the narrow mountain valleys along 100 miles of the Wasatch Front. In reality, Utah is one of the most urban states in the country. 
With this in mind, I would like to thank the Chairman of the VA, HUD Committee for his assistance in including report language in the Fiscal Year 1999 bill, which encourages the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to work with Envision Utah, a private/public organization tasked with planning for Utah's future. I would also like to ask Chairman Bond whether or not additional EPA programs might be of assistance to Envision Utah in fulfilling its mission?

 Mr. BENNETT. 
Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to provide individuals with greater control over their health care choices and dollars. This legislation will allow individuals enrolled in Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) at year's end to move unutilized funds in the amount of $500 or less to other tax protected accounts such as: a medical savings account, an individual retirement account or a 401k account. 
A flexible spending account is one of the options available to employers as they provide benefits to their employees. At the beginning of the year the employer gives the employee a set number of pre-tax benefit dollars which they can then allocate to any one or combination of the IRS approved FSA uses: health care, life insurance, day care, vacation, or retirement. The employee then must determine at the beginning of the year the number of dollars they will put in each account. In most cases the employee hopes they have made the appropriate allocation. If the employee has over funded a particular account they lose those benefit dollars at the end of the year. 
About 21.7 million Americans lose between $125 to $200 every year because of a 1984 Internal Revenue Service regulation that governs FSAs. Every year Americans lose between $4.3 and $2.7 billion due to this IRS regulation! The regulation mandates that individuals with FSAs must either `use-it-or-lose-it.' In other words, if you do not spend your money by the end of the year, your employer gets to keep the money you don't spend! 
This legislation will allow individuals enrolled in flexible spending accounts at year's end to `rollover' or move up to $500 per year from their FSA into one of the approved accounts including: IRAs, MSAs, or 401ks. The funds rolled over into an appropriate account would be treated for tax purposes as a rollover contribution for the taxable year from which it was unused. The $500 allowable rollover would be indexed in increments of $50 and rounded to the lowest multiple of $50. 
I believe this small change would have a significant impact on individuals and their health care. First, the incentive would be to spend these dollars only on health care services that are necessary, thus encouraging rational health care spending rather than the irrational health care spending promoted by the `use-it-or-lose-it' policy. Second, individuals would be more inclined to open up a MSA, and in doing so they would have both greater portability and greater choice. This would empower individuals by giving them greater control over their own health care dollars and expand access and choice. Third, more rational spending is likely to translate into lower health care costs and greater competition. 
I hope the Senate will act swiftly to hold hearings and to move this legislation through the committee process to the Senate floor for final consideration. I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation and would welcome their cosponsorship.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, the Chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee, a question related to a project in my State.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from New Mexico's support for this project. I have recently become aware of a problem with this project related to the Bureau of Reclamation's interpretation of the project's authorization which I hope we can clarify. As the Senator knows, I am a strong advocate for the concept of water recycling and reuse. In arid States such as ours we simply have to make every gallon of available water stretch as far as we can. It is for that reason that I sponsored the legislation that eventually became Public Law 104-266. The passage of that legislation expanded the Bureau of Reclamation's water recycling program and authorized the Tooele City project. Under this program the Bureau is authorized to contribute up to twenty-five percent of the cost of planning, designing and constructing water recycling and reuse projects. 
The Tooele Wastewater Treatment and Reuse project is designed to reclaim 2.25 million gallons of effluent daily and utilized the reclaimed water for a variety of non-potable uses permitted by Utah State law. Unlike some other States, Utah permits the utilization of water treated to secondary--as opposed to advanced secondary or tertiary--standards for certain non-potable uses. In formulating the Tooele project, the City has always anticipated the utilization of secondary effluent in conformance with State law. Now the Bureau of Reclamation has informed the City that it will not provide funds appropriated by Congress for that portion of the Tooele project that provides secondary treatment. I have searched the authorizations for the Title XVI program and the Tooele project high and low and can not find a statutory basis for the Bureau's position. Had Congress wished to limit the use of title XVI funds in this manner, it certainly could have done so. It did not. 
Mr. President, I remain hopeful that we can resolve this matter before this bill goes to Conference. However, in the event that we are not successful, I would like to ask the Chairman to entertain the possibility of Conference Report language, if necessary, to clarify this matter.

I believe this is exactly the type of local cooperative action Congress hoped for in the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 1992.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Hatch in introducing the Utah School Lands Exchange Act. This legislation is the result of months of negotiations between the Utah School and Institutional Trust Administration (SITLA), the Governor of Utah and the Secretary of Interior. 
Utah is a mosaic of land ownership and the federal government is the largest landlord. With 22 million acres under BLM management alone, eight million acres under the United States Forest Service and another three million in National Parks and Monuments, public lands issues command considerable attention in my state. This is complicated by the 1894 Enabling Act which created a checkerboard pattern of state ownership among federal lands, intermingling five sections of state lands in every township. The federal government and the state of Utah have been trying to resolve the thorny issue of how to manage or dispose of these trust lands for well over a half century now. My father attempted to bring some resolution to the issue when he served in this body more than forty years ago. 
In 1993, after extensive negotiations, Congress passed P.L. 103-93 which set in motion a process to exchange lands out of Utah's National Parks and Forest lands for other parcels within the state. The process was marginally successful at best, due to the complex process of appraisals and arbitration established by the legislation. Of the 500 plus parcels identified in that exchange over five years ago, less than forty have actually been exchanged to date. The trust lands issue was further complicated by the creation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in September of 1996. Without going into details, 176,000 acres of School Trust Lands were locked up by the creation of the Monument. President Clinton promised to use his office to facilitate the prompt exchange of these lands. Most Utahns were skeptical that this would actually happen. In fact, SITLA and the Utah Association of Counties filed suit over the creation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. 
Now, nearly two years later, the Clinton Administration has reached a historic agreement with the Governor of Utah and SITLA to exchange 376,000 acres of state lands for 138,000 acres of federal lands. This agreement fulfills the President's commitment to the schoolchildren of Utah and reduces the uncertainty over the future management of the Monument. I hope my colleagues understand that it is in the best interest of the federal government to exchange these lands promptly. 
This proposal benefits the school children of Utah as well as the visitors and users of public lands. In exchange for lands encumbered within parks, forests and the Monument, the state of Utah will receive just compensation in the form of mineral assets, comparable lands within the state and a sizable cash payment. These assets will be administered by the State Institutional Trust Lands Administration for the improvement of public education in Utah. In that context, we must support this agreement. We have a responsibility to help SITLA fulfill its mandate and utilize these lands for the greatest benefit to the children of Utah. Without this exchange, these lands, despite their significant mineral potential, will remain unproductive. 
At a time of competing interests and lack of consensus regarding land use in Utah, this is a step in the right direction. I believe that the agreement reached between the state and the Department of Interior bridges the gap that has existed for decades. While some interests are not totally satisfied, I believe the legislation we are introducing today is a fair and equitable agreement. I am also confident that the Committee will listen closely to those parties and make a good-faith effort to resolve any lingering concerns. 
I appreciate the good work of my colleague Senator Hatch, Governor Leavitt and Secretary Babbitt, as well as our colleagues in the House. I am confident that we will see a resolution to this longstanding debate in the 105th Congress. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and bring this issue to closure.

 Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to General Bernard A. Schriever, a modern-day pioneer whose legendary contributions to our nation's defense will be appropriately recognized on Friday, June 5, 1998, when Falcon Air Force Base will be renamed in his honor. General Schriever, a retired four-star general, is widely regarded as the father of the ICBM. 
General Schriever was born in Bremen, Germany, on September 14, 1910. His family immigrated to the United States when he was seven years old, and he became a naturalized citizen at age 13 and finished his early schooling in San Antonio, Texas. His flying career began in the late 1920s, as a mail-carrier flying between my home state of Utah and Wyoming. In 1931, he received a Bachelor of Science degree from Texas A&M, and a reserve appointment in the Field Artillery. He earned his wings as a second lieutenant in the Army Air Corps Reserve in June 1933. 
After obtaining his Master's degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Stanford University in 1942, he gained rapid promotions and positions of increasing responsibility during World War II. He was Chief of Staff of the 5th Air Force Service Command and later Commander of the Advanced Headquarters for the Far Eastern Air Force Service Command. After the war he became the Chief of the scientific Liaison Section at Headquarters USAF and held other scientific evaluation jobs as they pertained to military weaponry. 
Beginning in 1954 when he assumed command of the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division and later with the Air Research and Development Command, General Schriever pushed forward research and development on all technical phases of the Atlas, Titan, Thor and Minuteman ballistic missiles. He also provided for the launching sites and equipment, tracking facilities, and ground support equipment necessary to the deployment of these systems. 
With the expansion of the Air Research and Development Command, he became Commander of the newly created Air Force Systems Command (AFSC). Among the many creative programs he conceived and directed at AFSC was Project Forecast I, completed in 1964, which enlisted the best scientific and technological minds of that period in the projection of the aerospace world for the future. 
After retiring from the Air Force on August 31, 1966, with more than 33 years of active military service, General Schriever became a consultant to government and industry where he could most effectively use his knowledge and experience pursuing technology and its management into military operational capabilities. 
General Schriever has had several important government advisory assignments since his retirement in 1966, including: by Executive Order, Chairman, President's Advisory Commission on Management Improvement (PACMI); member, National Commission on Space; member, President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board; member, Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) Technical Advisory Committee; Chairman, SDI Institute, and various ad hoc advisory committees and panels involving national security (DoD) and space (NASA). 
General Schriever has been awarded four honorary Doctor of Science degrees, one honorary Doctor of Aeronautical Science degree, one honorary Doctor of Engineering degree, and one honorary Doctor of Laws degree, by various colleges and universities, including Utah State University. Inducted into Aviation Hall of Fame in 1980. Elected Honorary Fellow AIAA, recipient of James Forrestal Award 1986. Member of NAE. He received the National Air and Space Museum Trophy for Lifetime Achievement in November 1996. 
General Schriever remains very active even today, and continues to serve on several important advisory boards to government, industry, and education. He currently chairs the Guidance Council for the Space Dynamics Lab at Utah State University in my home state. Several years ago, I was honored to have General Schriever participate as the featured speaker at my annual conference, SpaceTalk. 
General Schriever's patriotism, intelligence, and vision have served our country well. The United States is more secure thanks to his many contributions and achievements. Thank you, General Schriever, for your dedication to the nation's well-being. I congratulate you and wish you continued success.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to expand the boundaries of Arches National Park. I appreciate my colleague Senator Hatch for joining me in this effort. The House version of this bill, H.R. 2283 sponsored by Mr. Cannon, was passed late last year. 
Most Americans recognize the familiar landscape of Arches National Park. It encompasses some of the most unique lands in the Southwest. Delicate sandstone arches, stunning vistas, contrasting colors, sweeping desert valleys, maze-like rock formations, and rugged gorges characterize the panorama in the park. In 1929, when the park was created, knowledge of ecosystem management was almost nonexistent. Park designation preserved these unique geological treasures but also relied on fairly rigid park boundaries which has resulted in some fragmentation of ecological areas within the park. This bill authorizes a 3,140 acre expansion to include the beautiful and unique Lost Spring Canyon parcel contiguous with the eastern boundary of the Arches. This addition will enhance the ecological protection of Arches. 
The Arches National Park Expansion includes portions of the following drainages: Salt Wash, Lost Spring Canyon, Fish Seep Draw, Clover Canyon, Cordova Canyon, Mine Draw, and Cottonwood Wash. These areas are currently under the jurisdiction of either the Bureau of Land Management or the State of Utah. Once the expansion is complete, the Park Service will continue to protect the wilderness values of these lands. No road or campground construction will occur in the new addition. Lost Spring Canyon will continue primarily to be used for back-country hiking. It is not in danger of being overrun by thousands of park visitors simply by the nature of the rugged terrain and the distances involved. But it makes good management sense to bring these areas under park management. 
Public lands debates are far too contentious in the West, particularly in Utah. While it is unfortunate that we have not been able to reach consensus on issues like wilderness, I am pleased that the expansion of Arches National Park is an issue which a diverse group of interests do agree. Local officials, the Grand Canyon Trust, the National Parks and Conservation Association, environmental groups, the State of Utah, the Utah Congressional delegation, and the Administration all support this bill. 
This legislation is good for Arches National Park and is a great example of how it is possible to reach consensus among public lands interests. The expansion will enhance the visitor experience of Arches by expanding back-country opportunities. It makes good management sense for both BLM and the Park Service. I hope my colleagues will join me in moving this legislation quickly.

 Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lupus Research and Care Amendments of 1998. This legislation would authorize additional funds for lupus research and grants for state and local governments to support the delivery of essential services to low-income individuals with lupus and their families. The National Institute of Health (NIH) spent about $33 million on lupus research last year. I believe that we need to increase the funds that are available for research of this debilitating disease. 
Lupus is not a well-known disease, nor is it well understood, yet at least 1,400,000 Americans have been diagnosed with lupus and many more are either misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all. More Americans have lupus than AIDS, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, sickle-cell anemia or cystic fibrosis. Lupus is a disease that attacks and weakens the immune system and is often life threatening. Lupus is nine times more likely to affect women than men. African-American women are diagnosed with lupus two to three times more often than Caucasian women. Lupus is also more prevalent among certain minority groups including Latinos, Native Americans and Asians. 
Because lupus is not well understood, it is difficult to diagnose, leading to uncertainty on the actual number of patients suffering from lupus. The symptoms of lupus make diagnosis difficult because they are sporadic and imitate the symptoms of many other illnesses. If diagnosed and with proper treatment, the majority of lupus cases can be controlled. Unfortunately, because of the difficulties in diagnosing lupus and inadequate research, many lupus patients suffer debilitating pain and fatigue. The resulting effects make it difficult, if not impossible, for individuals suffering from lupus to carry on normal everyday activities including work. Thousands of these debilitating cases needlessly end in death each year. 
Title I of the Lupus Research and Care Amendments of 1998 authorizes $45 million in grants starting in fiscal year 1999 to be earmarked for lupus research at NIH. This new authorization would amount to less than one-half of 1 percent of NIH's total budget but would greatly enhance NIH's research. 
Title II of the Lupus Research and Care Amendments of 1998 authorizes $40 million in grants to state and local governments as well as to nonprofit organizations starting in fiscal year 1999. These grants would support the delivery of essential services to low-income individuals with lupus and their families. 
I would urge all my colleagues, Mr. President, to join Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Shelby, and myself in sponsoring this legislation to increase funding available to fight lupus.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise because this is an anniversary date, not an anniversary of something that happened in the past but an anniversary of something that is going to happen in the future. This is an anniversary that is counting backwards. Depending on how you count it, this is either day No. 599 or day No. 600; 599 to the 31st of December, 1999, or 600 days prior to January 1, 2000--the day of the great New Year's Eve party that everybody is reserving their time for in Times Square, in the various hotels in New York. But it is also a day that we need to look forward to with some concern because of what has come to be known as the millennium bug, the year 2000 problem, or, as the computer people abbreviate it, Y2K. 
I used the phrase `Y2K,' and my wife said, `What are you talking about? What does it stand for?' Well, the `Y' stands for `year;' `2' and `K,' for `kilo' or 1,000 years--2,000--so it shortens it. Call it Y2K. She stopped and thought about it a minute, and she said, `Y2K or year 2000, you only save one syllable. What's the point?' Nevertheless, that is what it has come to be known as. 
As the chairman of the newly created committee dealing with this challenge here in the Senate, I want to take this anniversary date to bring the Senate and any who are listening over C-SPAN out in the country as a whole up to date on where we are with the Y2K problem. 
First, let me outline the dimensions of the problem. A lot of people say, `Oh, yes; we understand it. It is simply that computers are geared to handle the date with two digits instead of four.' So 1998 would be in the computer as `98' instead of `1998.' And that means when you get to the year 2000, the `00' to the computer means `1900' because the `19' is assumed in advance. 
Actually, it is more serious than that. There are three areas of concern about Y2K. 
The first one, of course, is the software concern that I have already mentioned. The software is programmed with two digits for the date instead of four. If you do not change the software program, the computer runs into problems and starts to do very strange things when it hits the year 2000. That is the first area, the area we have been focused on. 
Since I have been involved in this issue--and it has been almost a year since I began to focus on it--I have discovered there were two other areas. So in addition to software, you have a hardware problem symbolized in the phrase `embedded chips.' These little tiny chips that drive the computers, the miracles of the modern technological age, very often have a date function built into them. And, again, in order to save space on the chip, the date function is built in with two digits. 
Where are the embedded chips? They are embedded everywhere. Andy Grove, the CEO of Intel, the largest producer 
of chips in the United States, was here in Washington a week or so ago. He was asked, `How serious is the Y2K problem?' He said, `It is very serious. And the reason is'--he is focusing on the chip side--`you don't know where the embedded chips are embedded.' `For example,' he said, `the thermostat in your home may not work after New Year's Eve, 1999.' Now, it will not do you any good to call the manufacturer of the thermostat and ask him, because the manufacturer himself does not know. The chips were purchased, put into the thermostat, without concern as to whether or not they had a date function. And if the manufacturer got some chips that had date functions in them and put those chips into your thermostat, you are going to be very chilly on New Year's Day in the year 2000. And there is no way of knowing in advance whether that is going to happen. 
That can be a nuisance for you, it can be a life-or-death situation for some people, and it can be an enormous manufacturing challenge where we are storing and refrigerating meat and other perishables that are dependent on those embedded chips. It can be a life-or-death situation for an automobile manufacturer whose entire plant is now automated with robotics, all of which have embedded chips. 
So, as I said, Mr. President, it is not just the software that needs to be changed, as the first of these three areas of concern; it is also the embedded chips that need to be found and dealt with. 
As a final footnote to this, I was discussing this whole Y2K issue with an individual at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, more commonly known as the Mormon Church, the largest church in the State which I represent, asking him how prepared the church was. Fortunately, it was good news. He said the church was quite prepared. But he said, `We have identified, among other things, two embedded chips in the tabernacle organ, 
which if we do not replace means that the Mormon Tabernacle Choir will not have any organ accompaniment to it on January 1, 2000.' That shows how ubiquitous the problem of the embedded chips can be and how it can show up in places no one would ever think. 
I said there were three areas of concern. I talked about the software and the embedded chips. What is the third? This is the area of connections. Everything in the computer world is connected to everything else in one way or another. I was at the Defense Department talking to those officials about their Y2K problem and made the comment about how difficult it will be in our defense establishment if, on January 1, the screen goes blank, the various screens that handle the computerized information, in our defense establishment. 
Deputy Secretary Hamre said, `No, Senator, if the screen goes blank, while that is a problem, it is not a catastrophe; because if the screen goes blank that tells you you have a problem in that particular piece of equipment. The thing we are worried about is if the screen does not go blank, the computer continues to operate, but another computer system to which it is connected starts feeding it inaccurate data.' If the computer continues to function, make its calculations that `zero zero' really does mean 1900 and begins to give you bad information, that could contaminate your entire database. That, he says, is a bigger concern than if the screen goes blank. Frankly, that had not occurred to me. I was able to add, unhappily, a third category of concern--software, hardware in embedded chips, and now connections. 
What are we looking at in our special committee with respect to the year 2000 problem? I have divided it up into seven areas and prioritized these areas. We will look at them in the following order to try to see what we can do to avert disaster in the next 599 days--all the days that are remaining to us. Obviously, we would like to pass a resolution saying that we have an extra 2 or 3 years. We do not, no matter what the Congress does, no matter what the President does, no matter what anybody else does, we have 599 days and counting down, inexorably from right now. 
These are the areas of concern. No. 1, utilities. If the power grid goes down because of connections in the computers or because of embedded chips in certain power plants that shut those power plants down because of bad software somewhere, then it is all over. It doesn't matter if every computer in the country is Y2K compliant if you can't plug it into something. So we are focusing first and foremost on utilities and not just power. The water treatment system in every municipality in this country is computer driven and has the potential of being upset because of embedded chips and bad software. Utilities, therefore, are at the top of the list of the things we are addressing in our committee and are doing what we can to try to expose information about and get people worried and working on it. 
Second is telecommunications. What happens if you pick up the phone on January 1, 2000, and you cannot get a dial tone? I don't think that is going to happen in the United States. But the evidence is fairly clear that it is going to happen in some countries. If you are running a multinational organization, be it the Defense Department or a corporation, and you pick up the phone and you cannot get a dial tone in various parts of the world, you are in serious trouble. So, behind utilities, we are 
looking next at telecommunications. 
Third, transportation. Instantly people think of the FAA and the inability of the air traffic control system to control airplanes, and that is a concern, but what about shipping on the high seas--global positioning systems that all have chips in them that control the navigation of the oil tankers and the other freighters that are moving commerce all over the world? Here in the United States the railroads are heavily dependent on computer systems to route the traffic that produce the shipment of the heavy materials that keep our Nation going. Transportation is clearly No. 3 following utilities and telecommunications. 
No. 4 is the area that got me interested in this problem in the first place, the financial services. What happens if the banks cannot clear checks? What happens if there can be no electronic transfers of funds? I am happy to report that I believe we are fairly well along the road toward getting this problem solved. We have had seven hearings in my subcommittee on the Banking Committee on this issue, but we cannot relax here, either. The financial services clearly come in as the No. 4 concern. 
Then, No. 5, general government services, not only Federal but State and local, as well. What happens if in our large cities the county government cannot distribute welfare checks, the county government cannot handle food stamp distribution because of computerization of the way that situation is handled? What happens if HCFA, the Health Care Financing Administration, cannot handle reimbursement of Medicare or Medicaid funds? I have talked to hospitals and other health care providers that are dependent on HCFA reimbursements for their cash flow 
projections and they use the HCFA cash flow to do such things as purchase ordinary supplies for running the hospital. The whole health care system could grind to a halt if the government services in this area are not made Y2K compliant. The doctors who I have talked to tell me we have long since quit dealing with HCFA with paper. All of our interconnections with HCFA are electronic, and if that system goes down, the ripple effect will be tremendous. 
Next, general manufacturing. Fortune magazine had an article on their web site pointing out how much trouble General Motors is in. I don't mean to single out General Motors because I think every manufacturer has the same kind of problem. In today's world, where computers are available, we operate a just-in-time inventory system where you do not have huge stockpiles of spare parts out on the back lot anymore. With the computer, you have it worked out with your supplier that your spare parts arrive just in time for you to put them in your final manufacturing product. The just-in-time manufacturing system shuts down altogether and the manufacturing shuts down. General Motors has done a survey of every one of their manufacturing plants and they have found embedded chips in every one of their robotic systems. If they do not get this problem solved, they will not be able to produce an automobile after January 1, 2000. 
And then, finally, No. 7, listed last because it will come last chronologically, but probably should be listed first in terms of its financial impact if we do not get the other six solved, is litigation. The lawsuits that will be filed will be enormous. Estimates before my subcommittee of the Banking Committee indicate the total litigation bill could run as high as $1 trillion, one-seventh the size of the total economy that will change hands as people sue each other over the problems created by Y2K. We have to make sure we solve the other six so that No. 7 doesn't hit us and destroy us. 
The purpose of the special committee created by the Senate, I believe, is to examine all seven of these areas, act as a coordinating point for people involved with each of the areas, and then give reports, both to the Senate and to the people in the country as a whole, as to where we are, because it is not all doom and gloom. We do have areas where we are making progress. 
I talked this morning with John Koskinen who heads this effort on behalf of President Clinton in the executive branch. He reported to me that contrary to some of the information we have seen in the press, the Social Security Administration will be all right, 
and will indeed be able to distribute Social Security checks in the year 2000. Now, if the banking system is all right, those checks can be received, and that is a demonstration of the problem of interconnectivity that we have. But that is a piece of good news. As we focus on the challenge of Y2K, we should not lose sight of the fact that there is good news and there is progress being made. 
I close with this observation about the importance of this entire issue. One of the experts with whom I have been in contact since I assumed this new chairmanship said to me, `The one thing we know for sure about this is that nobody has ever done it before. We have no historical precedent to guide us, to tell us how to handle this and what we can expect.' And, of course, he was accurate. Of course, that is a true summation of where we are. 
Yet when I made that comment to another friend of mine, he said something that I think summarizes exactly the challenge we are facing. He said, `No, Bob, that is not true. We have a historic example. I said, `What is it?' He said, `the Tower of Babel.' He said, `The people got together and decided they were going to build a tower to heaven, and God didn't like it, so he fixed it so they could not talk to each other and that ended it.' He said, `That is the paradigm of what we are dealing with here, Y2K.' We are facing the possibility that after January 1 we cannot talk to each other because the world is all wired by computers, and if, indeed, that turns out to be the case, as was the case in Genesis, that will end it. 
I am hoping that everyone recognizes this anniversary for what it is--a milepost on the road toward an inexorable challenge, and that we use the opportunity to take the remaining 599 days to see to it that when we get to New Year's Eve 1999, we can look back and say that we were facing something as serious as the Tower of Babel, but we have, as a Nation, and as a world, faced up to that, and now Y2K is going to be a bump in the road instead of a drive off the cliff.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank my friend who has been very indulgent in my obsession with this issue in the subcommittee of the legislative branch of appropriations. In the spirit of what I just said about reports, I can report to the Senate that he and I heard testimony before our last appropriations subcommittee that the Senate will indeed be Y2K-compliant in the year 2000. The Sergeant at Arms, the Secretary of the Senate, and others, have focused on the priorities and are doing the things necessary to get us there. They are changing the computers in the Senate at the rate now of about a thousand a month. I was startled, as I think my friend, Senator Dorgan, may have been, to learn that there were close to 9,000 computers in the Senate; that is 90 for each Senator. I didn't think we needed that many. But there are. They are being made Y2K-compliant at the rate of about a thousand per month now. That will allow us the requisite amount of time to test the various fixes and see to it that we have it under control. 
The one disquieting note that came out of the hearing that I share with my colleagues was that they said, `We will have the mission-critical systems Y2K compliant by January of 2000.' I said, `What is your definition of a `nonmission-critical system?' They said, `Well, the copier in your office may not work.' There will be many constituents that will be delighted to know that we cannot make copies in January of 2000 until additional work gets done. But I thank my friend for his support in that area and for his very kind words. They are much appreciated. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

 Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the University of Utah ROTC Class of 1944 which responded to the call for active military duty during World War II. On May 2, 1998, at the University of Utah members of the ROTC Class of 1944 will hold a reunion commemorating the 55th anniversary of their activation into our national armed services. I believe it is fitting that we honor them today in the United States Senate. 
The University of Utah Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) was an unique organization. It was one of the few military units which were called into service during World War II from a specific community and which can return to that home area for a reunion. Most military units include individuals whose residences are scattered throughout the country. Through an Act of Congress in 1916, ROTC programs were established in higher education institutions across the country. Since that time, they have been an important part of this nation's civil defense--in times of war and peace--training generations of students for service to their country. 
In the early 1940s, this class trained at the University of Utah with horse-drawn artillery working with an old French 77 millimeter cannon and with a 105 millimeter howitzer, new at the time. As a unit, this ROTC class was first assigned to Camp Roberts in California, for basic training in truck drawn artillery. Later they were assigned to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, for further training and ultimately received further schooling at the Infantry Officers School at Fort Benning, Georgia. After graduation from Fort Benning, these young men, whose average age at the time was slightly over 20, served as officers in various combat units in Italy, France and the South Pacific. 
These were brave and honorable men, each one of them. Of the 99 who were called to active duty in 1943, two were killed in action while serving in the 10th Mountain Division in Italy. One was later killed in the Korean Conflict. Of the group's original 99 members, 71 are still alive. Today, I speak for all Utahns and all Americans when I say, we honor these brave men and pay tribute to them for their service and sacrifice for this great country. The Class of 1944's great tradition of discipline and leadership continues today as many of its members are respected professionals in the public and private sector as well as their own communities.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with Senator Wyden, the Affordable Housing Barrier Removal Act of 1998. According to the National Association of Home Builders, housing compromises 12 percent of the economy of the United States and the housing construction and remodeling industries employ approximately 2 million people each year. However, housing costs continue to rise and housing affordability continues to be a challenge for many American families. 
Unnecessary regulations contribute significantly to the costs of housing. Layers of excessive and unnecessary regulation imposed by all levels of government--federal, state, and local--can add 20 to 35 percent to the cost of a new home. 
Mr. President, the removal of regulatory burdens is essential to increasing the home ownership rate in the United States. Home ownership is the cornerstone of family security, stability, and prosperity. Congress has the responsibility to do all that it can to encourage and promote policies that increase homeownership. 
Mr. President, it is for these reasons that Senator Wyden and I introduce the Barriers bill today. This bipartisan bill has three major goals. First, the bill require federal agencies to evaluate any new rule or regulations to determine if they have an impact on the cost of housing. Second, the bill will encourage states and localities to bring together all the parties involved in the production of housing and those who regulate them to discuss barriers and how to remove them. Third, the bill will remove outdated requirements in the Federal Housing Administration's single-family mortgage insurance program to make the program more efficient. 
In addition to the major goals of the legislation, the Barriers bill will authorize the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to become more involved in comprehensive efforts to encourage barrier removal activities. As the federal entity that oversees our national housing policy, HUD must be actively involved in strategies and activities to remove regulatory burdens to produce more affordable housing. 
Mr. President, while there is no doubt regulations are necessary to protect our workers and our environment, there must be a commonsense approach to relief from excessive regulatory burdens that impact other sectors of the economy. I look forward to the input from my other colleagues and others involved in the housing industry about this legislation. I believe it opens an important and timely dialogue, and I commend Senator Wyden for the leadership he is showing on this issue.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am here for two reasons today. First, the Governmental Affairs Committee filed its report last week. I have individual views in that report regarding the scandals surrounding the 1996 Presidential campaign. I said in my individual views that I would focus, in a major floor speech, on what I consider to be the principal issue of that investigation. I am here today to fulfill that responsibility. 
Secondly, today I have sent a letter to the Attorney General focusing on what I consider to be the principal problem connected with our investigation. I owe it to her to make a full explanation of why I have sent her that letter. 
Now, Mr. President, I am a Member of the Senate who served on the first committee investigating Whitewater activities, chaired by Don Riegle, the Senator from Michigan. I call that Whitewater I. 
I served on the second committee investigating the matters relating to Whitewater, chaired by Senator D'Amato, which I call Whitewater II. 
I served on the Governmental Affairs Committee investigating the excesses of the 1996 campaign, which I shall call Thompson. 
From those three committees, I have some observations that I think I would like the Members of the Senate to be aware of. I am going to do two things in my presentation. First, I will outline the common threads that have run through all three of those investigations. They give us a pattern of how the Clinton administration reacts to scandal; and, second, I will, in response to the letter I have sent to the Attorney General, focus on the one specific situation that remains unresolved that in my opinion is the most important situation in this whole circumstance. 
So let us go to my first task, the identification of the common threads. At the end of Whitewater I, I went back to the office and dictated a memo to myself for historical purposes to help me remember what I had learned out of that situation. I have gone back and reread that memo and share with you now the things I wrote down. 
I came to the conclusion that the low-level people who testified before us--that is, people who are fairly far down in the bureaucracy--have good memories, gave us direct answers, and tell the truth as they see it. I found that pattern across the board. On the other hand, the higher level officials had bad memories, gave us evasive answers, and did their best, in my opinion, to shave the truth. As I say, I saw this pattern in the very first Whitewater committee. I saw it repeated again and again through all three experiences. 
Let me give you some examples. In Whitewater I, the Resolution Trust Corporation employees, who were involved with investigating this matter, who first noticed the criminal referrals relating to President Clinton's--then Governor Clinton's--business partners, all had good memories, gave us direct answers and told us the truth. 
But when we got to a higher level, we found a Treasury Department official who actually tried to convince the committee that he had lied to his own diary. That is, the notes he had taken contemporaneous to the events were wrong and the version he was now giving us before the committee was the correct one. 
When we got to the highest level, members of the White House staff, we had the people who could not remember anything. 
In Whitewater II, at the lowest level, the Secret Service people, the Park Police, the White House secretaries who worked in the office of the White House general counsel all had clear memories, all told us the truth, all were very direct in their responses. 
When we got up to a slightly higher level, reminiscent of the man who lied to his diary, we had a political appointee who could not recognize her own voice when it was played back to her on a tape recording of a conversation she herself had had, saying, `I'm not sure that's me.' 
When we got to the highest level, White House intimates, we had a White House official who said she could not remember being in the White House even though the Secret Service showed she had been there and had been in the family residence portion of the White House for 2 hours on that particular day, and she had no recollection whatsoever of the incident. She did recall making calls of condolence to people with respect to Vince Foster's suicide, but she could not recall any conversations about any other subject during that time period. 
Now, when we get to the Thompson committee, at the lowest level, we had briefers from the CIA, we had secretaries at the Department of Commerce, we had a bookkeeper from the Lippo Bank, all of whom had very clear memories--direct answers, believable. 
Then we got up to the DNC staffer, he constantly had to have his deposition read back to him when he was in front of the television cameras to remind him that his version now was not the same as his version previously. 
When we got to the highest level, the Deputy Chief of Staff to the President of the United States, he said he `could not recall' 299 times--one time short of a perfect bowling score. 
So, I came to my first conclusion: If you want to know what happened, talk to the people at the lower level, talk to the people whose jobs are not dependent upon White House patronage. 
The second common theme comes not from a detailed memo to myself but from an editorial that appeared in the New York Times. This editorial appeared January 22nd of this year. It was not talking about the three investigations that I have described, but it does analyze, better than anything I have seen, the patterns of this administration. It says, quoting from the New York Times: 
This Administration repeatedly forces its supporters to choose between loyalty and respect for the law. Those are Clinton . . . themes established long before the charges that Mr. Clinton had a sexual relationship with a White House intern. . . . In such circumstances in the past, the White House has relied on two principal weapons, stonewalling and attacking. . . . 
I would like to take it through the same pattern as the first theme I discovered. 
Let us go back to Whitewater I. Admittedly, there was a relatively small amount of stonewalling in Whitewater I. It was mainly memory loss. But there were attacks, attacks on the RTC employees, attacks on their veracity, attacks on their integrity, attacks on the way they did their jobs. 
We really saw this pattern in stonewalling and attacking when we got to Whitewater II. Stonewall the subpoena. Insist that you cannot find the notes. Say that that is attorney-client privilege. Then we saw something new that entered in here which I call the `incompetence defense.' Constantly we were told the reason they could not produce the information we wanted is that `a Secretary had misread the subpoena. . . . We didn't know that's what you wanted. . . . That was in the wrong file. . . . We looked in the wrong place. . . . We don't know where the notes came from.' Part of the stonewalling pattern was the incompetence defense. 
`We are so incompetent down here we can't provide you with anything.' 
Attack? Oh, yes, we saw it in Whitewater II--attack witnesses, including, incidentally, Linda Tripp, who was one of the low-level people who appeared before us in Whitewater II and who, in response to the attack she received by virtue of her direct answers, decided she had better start tape recording all of her conversations in order to protect herself. Attack the witnesses, attack the committee staff, and most of all, attack the chairman. 
All of us in this Chamber know the tremendous amount of abuse that was heaped upon the head of the committee, Al D'Amato, by virtue of his chairmanship of that committee. I personally saw it in the following instance. I appeared on the News Hour with Jim Lehrer opposite Anne Lewis, Deputy Director of the Democratic National Committee. She said on that occasion, with great indignation, `It is no coincidence that Al D'Amato, the chairman of Bob Dole's election effort, was appointed chairman of the committee to handle this investigation against President Clinton.' I stepped in and corrected her. I said, `As a matter of fact, it is coincidence.' It is the purest coincidence. The individual who made the decision that Al D'Amato would be the chairman of that investigation was actually George Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader in this Senate, who in the 103d Congress determined it would be the Banking Committee that would handle the Whitewater investigation. George Mitchell didn't realize that the voters would put Al D'Amato in that position in the 104th Congress. Pure coincidence. I saw Anne Lewis on television the next day after I had given her that additional information saying, `It is no coincidence' about Al D'Amato, and she went on with her charge, her unrelenting attack. 
In the Thompson committee, the same pattern. They attacked the witnesses, they attacked the staff, they attacked the chairman, and in this case, they attacked the committee members. I know that because they attacked me. Here was the circumstance. We had a description of Charlie Trie and how he was acting, and one of the members of the committee said he really couldn't understand that action, implying that Charlie Trie should be dismissed as nothing more than a buffoon. I stepped in and said, `No. I have owned a business in Asia. I have done business in Asia. Charlie Trie's actions are the typical actions of an Asian businessman.' By that afternoon, the Democratic National Committee issued a press release attacking me as a racist, and within 3 or 4 days, par for the course with their efficiency, there were letters to the editor of my hometown newspaper repeating the charge that I was a racist. 
I found it interesting that somewhat later when President Clinton was describing why Charlie Trie acted the way in which he did, he pointed out he was simply responding to the culture that he came out of, the business situation in which he found himself--in other words, a typical Asian businessman. I find it interesting that to the Democratic National Committee when I say it, it is racist; when President Clinton says it, it is exculpatory. In fact, of course, it is neither one. 
Stonewall and attack, stonewall and attack, stonewall and attack. We saw it through all three of these investigations. If I may, we are seeing it again with respect to Kenneth Starr and what is going on in the investigation into the President's personal life. Those are the themes that I saw. The second conclusion I add to the first one: The White House will stonewall and attack at every turn. Those who speak up candidly do so at their peril. 
Now, let me go to my second task, which is to focus on what I consider to be the most serious unresolved situation in all of this. For this we need to take a little history. We go back to 1977 and to the State of Arkansas. In 1977, Mochtar Riady decided it was time to come to the United States. He found a partner who would help him come into the United States, a man by the name of Jackson Stephens of Little Rock, AR. Now, Mochtar Riady is an ethnic Chinese who was born in Indonesia. He rose from running a bicycle shop to becoming a billionaire. We know on the basis of 
the IMF debate that is currently going on with respect to Indonesia how one becomes a billionaire in Indonesia. It is being called `crony capitalism.' It is characterized by money laundering, insider trading, and a cozy relationship with the Government that usually involves substantial payments to officials of the Government. That is the culture in which Mochtar Riady became a billionaire. We will revisit that in a minute. 
As I say, in 1977 Mochtar Riady wanted to come to the United States, and given the fact that his company, his group, called the Lippo Group, is primarily involved in banking, insurance, securities, and property development, it is natural that he should first look to acquire a bank. Jackson Stephens said to him, `We can help you acquire the National Bank of Georgia from Bert Lance.' But Mochtar Riady did not move fast enough. There were some Middle East investors who moved in, acquired the National Bank of Georgia, renamed it the Bank of Commerce and Credit International, or BCCI, and it went on to its own history and its own story, and we will leave it at that. 
Perhaps disappointed in his inability to acquire the National Bank of Georgia, Mochtar Riady looked elsewhere, and Jack Stephens had an alternative for him in the State of Arkansas. So Mochtar Riady sent his second son and heir, James Riady, to Little Rock, to intern at Stephens & Company where he became acquainted with the then Attorney General of the State of Arkansas, a rising young politician named Bill Clinton. Riady and Stephens went on to joint ventures in Hong Kong and in other deals. 
But in 1984, Riady and Stephens jointly took control of the Worthen Bank in Little Rock. James Riady was installed to run the Worthen Bank, and he brought from Hong Kong an experienced international banker to help him, a man by the name of John Huang. Now, immediately the bank ran afoul of Federal regulators. The Comptroller of the Currency accused bank officials of breaking Federal laws that limit insider loans. One reporter put it, `The Feds imposed controls on insider lending and started to ease the Riadys out of the bank. The pipeline from Worthen to Jakarta would be cut off.' Forced out of their control of the Worthen Bank, the Riadys moved their operations to California. They took over a small bank, renamed it the Lippo Bank of California, and James Riady and John Huang moved to California to head up the bank. 
Now, as occurred in Arkansas, the stewardship of the Lippo Bank of California promptly drew the attention of the regulators. Twice within 4 years it was hit with cease and desist orders from the FDIC. The first one was issued for `unsafe or unsound banking practices.' The second was issued for underreporting foreign currency transfers between California accounts and accounts in Hong Kong. The Los Angeles Times has noted, `Since 1990, Lippo Bank has spent most of its existence under the FDIC cease and desist orders which are uncommon and among the most severe actions an agency can take.' 
Now, the Riadys did not stop with banking in California. They branched out into other businesses. We found three of them in the Thompson committee, Hip Hing Holdings, San Jose Holdings, and Toy Center Holdings. There was one common thread of all three, they all lost money. 
The most spectacular loser was Hip Hing Holdings. Here is a summary of its financial results. In 1992, it had total income of $38,400. It had expenses exceeding that income of $482,395. They donated, out of that $38,000 in total income, $55,400 to the Democratic National Committee. That has since been returned, having been determined to have been illegal. In 1993, it didn't do any better. Its income went down to $35,000, which brought losses, because their expenses were stable, brought their losses up to $493,000, and this time they donated $32,960 to the Democrats. 
The committee determined this was a clear example of money laundering because the $55,400 that came in 1992 was all reimbursed from Jakarta. We asked the bookkeeper of the Hip Hing Holdings how this worked. She said, `Whenever I needed any money I contacted Jakarta and they sent it.' Now, John Huang was the president of Hip 
Hing Holdings. He was also an officer in every other one of these Lippo corporations that I have described, including the Lippo Bank, the one for which he was qualified by virtue of his background. We asked the Lippo Bank president what John Huang did all day. The president and John Huang had adjoining offices and they shared a single secretary. You would think if anyone would know what John Huang's activities were, it would be the bank president of the Lippo Bank. He responded he had no idea what John Huang did all day. We asked the same question of the bookkeeper; we got the same answer. They didn't know what the president of this company, which was losing half a million a year, and no one seemed to care, was doing with his time. 
Well, we know what he was doing with his time. John Huang traveled extensively as the Riadys' principal agent in the United States. Among other places, he went to Little Rock to keep up his contact with then Gov. Bill Clinton. He raised money for Governor Clinton's reelection and he raised money for the campaign for President. The committee determined that in 1992 the Riadys were the largest single contributor to the Democratic National Committee, larger than any union, larger than any Hollywood star, larger than any special interest group connected with the Democratic Party. The No. 1 contributor to the Democratic National Committee was the Riady family. 
After the election, John Huang continued traveling the country as the Riadys principal agent in the United States, but he added a new wrinkle to his activities. He started hosting officials of the People's Republic of China, taking them wherever possible to introduce them to members of the Clinton administration. 
In one case, he brought a Riady partner with connections to the Chinese intelligence apparatus to meet Vice President Gore. Now, why the People's Republic of China? Why would the Riadys be interested in courting favor with the Chinese? Public sources say the Riadys have more than $1 billion invested in China. We asked the CIA if there were other links between the Riadys and the Chinese. The answers are in S-407, the secret room here in the Capitol, and any Senator who wishes can repair there and see just how close the relationship is between the Riadys and the Chinese. I assure you it is very close. 
This is what the committee says: `The committee has learned from recently acquired information that James and Mochtar Riady have had a long-term relationship with a Chinese intelligence agency. The relationship is based on mutual benefit, with the Riadys receiving assistance in finding business opportunities in exchange for large sums of money and other help'-- I said we would revisit crony capitalism. `Although the relationship appears based on business interests, the committee understands that the Chinese intelligence agency seeks to locate and develop relationships with information collectors, particularly persons with close connections to the U.S. Government.' 
Let's go back to 1992. The Riadys, the largest single contributor, what did they want? The answer: they wanted a job in the Clinton administration for John Huang. Now, when his name went to the personnel processors, they assumed, we found out in the committee, that the primary reason for supporting John Huang was he was an Asian American and this was one of President Clinton's diversity appointments. Frankly, the appointment languished. It sat there for a year and a half and then two things happened: 
No. 1, Webb Hubbell, Hillary Clinton's former law partner, and President Clinton's close friend, found himself out of a job, out of money, and on his way to jail. No. 2, James Riady went to the White House five times in 1 week. On his last day at the White House, which was June 25, he attended the President's radio address. The White House photographers turned on the videotape. I have seen the videotape of the radio address and of the people who were there. At the end of the radio address, each person there shook hands with the President, had his picture taken, and left. Hanging back until everyone was gone was James Riady and John Huang. 
After the radio address was over and the people had cleared the Oval Office, James Riady, John Huang, and Bill Clinton were left alone. At that point, unfortunately, the White House photographer turned off the video camera, so we don't know what happened at that meeting. But this much we do know: On the next business day, Monday, June 27, Webb Hubbell was retained by the Lippo Group for $100,000, and John Huang got a memo from James Riady outlining his severance from Lippo in anticipation of his joining the administration in the Commerce Department. Ultimately, that severance came to nearly $900,000--over 4 years' pay--to an executive who had presided over nothing but losing operations. 
Well, as we know, the amounts we have shown of these losses are chump change to a billionaire. The Riadys were not in America to make money. They came to America looking for something other than financial gain from their investments in the United States, and they seemed to have gotten it when John Huang went to the Commerce Department less than a month after that White House meeting. James Riady summarized it very well when he described John Huang as `my man in the American Government.' John Huang didn't have just any job. He became the principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Economic Policy with access to critical economic information, including classified briefings from the CIA. 
What did John Huang do at the Commerce Department? Well, we know from some of those lower level people that he attended a lot of meetings and that he was a very assiduous note taker. He was an information collector. But other than that, his superiors at Commerce said the same thing that his superiors at the Lippo Bank said: `We really don't know what John Huang did with his time. We really don't know what he did each day.' 
Well, we know at least some of the things he did. No. 1, we know he went to the White House 67 times while he was Deputy Assistant Secretary. I know Cabinet officers who would be jealous of the opportunity to go to the White House half that often. No. 2, we know that at least once or twice nearly every week in the entire time he was at the Commerce Department he walked out of his Commerce Department office, went across the street to Stephens Inc's Washington office where he received packages, FAXes, and phone calls; and then with the door closed in an office in that suite, he made phone calls and sent out FAXes. We do not know to whom. We do not know what was in those packages that he received there or why it was essential for him to go there at least once, and often twice, almost every single week for 18 months. 
We also know that even though he had received close to $900,000 in severance from the Lippo Group, there was one tie with the Lippo Group that was not severed. They left him with a corporate telephone credit card, and he used that credit card to make over 400 telephone calls to Lippo officials--at least 232 of them to officials of the Lippo Bank. Many of these calls were made on his Commerce Department telephone, using the corporate credit card from the corporation from which, supposedly, he had been severed. 
Now, here, therefore, is the structure: You have John Huang in the Commerce Department, in an area of great sensitivity, taking notes and getting briefed by the CIA, and in and out of the White House more often than a Cabinet officer. He is on the phone weekly, or more often, to Lippo executives who have very close ties to Chinese intelligence. If ever there was a conduit that could be 
used to pass intelligence information from inside the Clinton administration to the Chinese intelligence apparatus, or Lippo, or both, that conduit was this: From the United States Government through the conduit created by John Huang to the Lippo Group or the Chinese Government. Was this what the Riadys hoped for when they paid for all those money-losing corporations? If it is, they certainly had it. 
Of course, all of this would disappear if Bill Clinton failed to be reelected in 1996. So, in 1995, it was decided in another Oval Office meeting, attended by James Riady, John Huang, Bruce Lindsey, and President William Clinton, that John Huang would move from the Commerce Department to the Democratic National Committee. The same apparatus that could have been used to funnel intelligence information out could now be used to funnel dollars in. Now, there was objection in the Democratic National Committee to John Huang because they were afraid he would break the rules, break the law, and embarrass them in his fundraising activities. The President himself overcame those objections, making it clear that he wanted John Huang at the DNC. John Huang went there and he began to raise money. Indeed, did he raise money. Here is the list of John Huang's fundraising capabilities: 
In November of 1995, he raised $30,000; in December, $100,000; in February of 1996, $1.1 million; in April of 1996, $140,000; in May of 1996, $600,000; in June of 1996, $90,000; in July of 1996, $700,000. In all, it was over $3 million. He created enormous cash flow for the Democratic National Committee. Unfortunately, it went both ways because almost half of the money that flowed in from John Huang's activities had to flow back out as it was determined to have come from illegal sources. 
His most spectacular success was the dinner in February of 1996 when they raised $1.1 million. Here is what President Clinton had to say on that occasion:  
I am virtually overwhelmed by this event tonight. I have known John Huang a very long time. When he told me this event was going to unfold as it has tonight, I wasn't quite sure I believed him. But he has never told me anything that didn't come to pass, an all of you have made it possible. 
Unfortunately, a substantial number of the people at the head table at that event could not participate in this tribute to John Huang because they didn't understand English. They were not citizens of the United States, and they weren't quite sure what was going on. But they were sure that money was going in the direction they wanted it to go. 
Now, I want to focus on the most famous of John Huang's fundraising activities--the April 29, 1996, fundraiser at the Buddhist Temple that he ran along with Maria Hsia. The amount of money he raised was not the largest amount, but it was the most significant amount. He raised $140,000, most of which had to be returned because the alleged donors were, in fact, reimbursed, dollar for dollar, in a way that is classic money laundering and clearly illegal. I focus on this not because it is the most famous, but because it is the best symbol of what appears to have been going on here. It has the most complete cast of characters. Here we have one event, and representing the Clinton administration was the Vice President, Al Gore; representing the DNC, its chairman, Don Fowler; representing the Lippo Group, John Huang, still carrying a Lippo credit card; and representing Chinese intelligence, Maria Hsia and Ted Sioeng. 
I need to talk a minute about Ted Sioeng. There were press reports that indicated he was, in fact, connected with Chinese intelligence. When we were in room 407 getting a confidential briefing in executive session from the Director of the FBI and the Director of the CIA, I asked the question, `Is there any connection between Ted Sioeng and the intelligence operation of the People's Republic of China?' The answer I got was, `We don't know.' So I asked the question, `Aren't you interested?' `Well, yes.' I then asked the question, `Will you find out?' `Yes.' And then I asked the question, `When you find out, will you share that information 
with this committee?' `Yes.' 
The next time we gathered in executive session with the Director of the CIA and the Director of the FBI, this was their opening comment: `We need to make a correction of our previous statements. It turns out that in response to Senator Bennett's questions, we went back and checked our files and discovered that we did indeed have information linking Ted Sioeng to the People's Republic of China.' 
This was discovered in the CIA files. When they went to find the source of that information in the CIA files, they discovered that their source was the FBI. In fact, it was in both agencies and neither agency Director had known about this. I won't go into that matter further, because Senator Specter made a speech about it on the floor castigating the Department of Justice for not doing the very fundamental kind of activities that would have discovered that and prevented their Directors from being so embarrassed before the members of the committee. 
It is time to summarize. What do we have here? We have a conduit that runs from the inside of the Clinton administration to the inside of the Chinese intelligence apparatus. It is a conduit through which could flow from the United States to the Chinese classified information about U.S. trade policy and strategy. It is also a conduit through which could flow from the Chinese, or Lippo, to the Democratic National Committee funds to support the reelection of President Clinton. We do know that funds did flow through that conduit from Lippo to the DNC--those funds that I identified that came through Hip Hing Holdings that have had to be returned. We do not know whether funds have come from the Chinese Government, either down through Lippo or directly through the conduit to the Democratic National Committee. 
So the key question that must be answered and, in my opinion, still is unresolved after all of these investigations, is: Was this conduit ever used either way for either purpose--the transmission of intelligence information, or the transmission of money? 
When I tried to find out by asking direct questions in executive session on this issue, I always get the same answer: `Senator, we cannot give you that information because it is part of an ongoing criminal investigation.' Now, on its face, that is an acceptable answer. That says that something is being done about this. Someone of importance in the justice apparatus of the United States is looking into this and pursuing a criminal investigation. 
But I want to put that in context. Who should conduct that investigation, the Department of Justice or an independent counsel? When we had word of a scandal in Arkansas prior to Bill Clinton becoming President of the United States, Janet Reno, the Attorney General of the United States, said that is a matter that requires an independent counsel. 
When we had a matter when one Indian tribe was accused of influencing a decision relating to the gambling license for a competing Indian tribe, Janet Reno, the Attorney General of the United States, said that is a matter for an independent counsel. 
When we had accusations that Henry Cisneros lied to the FBI about the amount of money he paid his mistress prior to his confirmation hearings, Janet Reno, Attorney General of the United States, said that is a matter for an independent counsel. 
When we had accusations that Secretary Espy, Secretary of the Agriculture, had taken favors improperly from certain lobbyists, Janet Reno, Attorney General of the United States, said that is a matter for an independent counsel. 
When we had information that the President had behaved in an improper way in his personal life, Janet Reno, Attorney General of the United States, turned to Ken Starr and said, `That's a matter for an independent counsel.' 
But on the question of whether or not this conduit was utilized for illegal transfers of money or intelligence information, either way, Janet Reno, Attorney General of the United States, says, `This one I will investigate myself.' On this one she has staked the integrity and objectivity of the Department of Justice. If she has staked the integrity and objectivity of the Department of Justice, in my opinion, there must be an accounting of that integrity.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I make three points in the letter. 
First, I point out that it is still time for her to do in this instance what she has done five times before in instances that are, in my opinion, less serious than this one. There is still time to appoint an independent counsel. However, if she persists in refusing to do so, I think she has, at the very minimum, two responsibilities to this Congress. 
First, if she uncovers any indication of the passing of improper information through this conduit from the U.S. Government to either Lippo or the Chinese, or both, she has the responsibility to share that information with the Senate Intelligence Committee, and to share it as soon as she finds it. 
Second, if she comes across any indication that there was an illegal transfer of money from either the Lippo Group or the Chinese Government, or both, into the Democratic National Committee, she has the responsibility to share that information with the Governmental Affairs Committee immediately after she finds it. We can always reconvene in S. 407. We can always go into executive session. But she has a responsibility, by virtue of her determination to keep this matter to herself rather than giving it to an independent counsel, to be that responsive and that accountable to this Congress. 
I say to her, `Madam Attorney General: By making the decision to keep this to yourself you have your work cut out for you. In addition to the pattern of poor memory at the highest level, you have a flock of witnesses who have fled the country. You have a flock of witnesses, including members of the White House staff, who have taken the fifth amendment. You have an intricate and almost massive task. And this Senator at least will be watching with great interest to see how you discharge it.' 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished colleague, Senator Dodd, in support of HR. 3116, the Examination Parity and Year 2000 Readiness for Financial Institutions Act. We jointly introduced the Senate version of this bill, S. 1671 and are in full agreement with it in every respect. 
Mr. subcommittee has held five hearings on Year 2000 compliance and I will chair another hearing on this issue next week. Generally speaking, most of our financial institutions are ill prepared to face the millenial date change at this time. None of our regulatory agencies are in the position they should be, based on the time schedule issued by OMB and GAO. This problem is compounded because several of our regulatory agencies have insufficient enforcement authority to ensure that the financial institutions they regulate can continue to function in a safe and sound manner after the millennial date change. 
The bill before us at this time will give authority to the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) in parity with the authority provided to other Federal banking agencies under the Bank Service Company Act (BSCA) with respect to the performance of services by contracted service providers. For example, OTS will be able to examine service providers that contract with a savings association, its subsidiary, or any savings and loan affiliate or other entity as identified in this legislation, as if it were inspecting the savings association itself. Under the BSCA, other Federal banking agencies already have this authority over service providers that contract with an insured bank or any subsidiary or affiliate of the bank that is examined by the agency. 
This authority enables all of the Federal banking agencies to take appropriate action against service providers, if for example, the services are provided in such a way as to jeopardize the safety and soundness of the financial institutions in question. This authority allows the regulatory agencies to take appropriate action against a service provider if the services being performed may result in a regulated entity not being Y2K complaint. We expect that the Federal banking agencies will continue to use their authority under the BSCA, and the authority provided by this legislation, to remedy the situation of services being rendered which will result in Year 2000 noncompliance, as well as to prevent any other unsafe and unsound practices. To ensure that the legislation is interpreted to give OTS parity with the other regulators and that Congressional intent is clear, the bill references the OTS's ability to issue orders under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, which includes the Federal banking agencies' general enforcement authority to address unsafe or unsound practices. 
This bill also requires that federal financial regulatory agencies hold seminars for financial institutions on the implications of the Year 2000 problem for safe and sound operations, and to provide model approaches for solving common Y2K problems. 
Passage of this bill is supported by both the NCUA and OTS. In a `Statement of Administration Policy,' OMB has notified us that `the Administration supports passage of HR. 3116.' 
I want to take this opportunity to thank Chairman D'Amato, Senator Sarbanes, and Senator Dodd for their assistance and support. In particular, I want to thank Howard Mennell, Steve Harris, Andrew Lowenthal, Robert Cresanti, Robert Andros, and Laura Ayoud for their efforts in bringing this bill to a prompt and mutually satisfactory resolution. I also want to thank my House colleagues and their staff for adopting the language of our Senate bill, S. 1671, in the final version of the House passed H.3116. This has greatly expedited the handling of this bill in the Senate.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky and I thank my colleagues for this debate. Let me make a personal point at the beginning of my comments. While I disagree quite heartily with the position taken on behalf of those who support McCain-Feingold, I do not challenge their integrity or their motives. I believe that they are acting on the basis of the highest motives, that they honestly believe that this legislation would, in fact, be good for our political system and be good for the Republic as a whole. I disagree most heartily with that position and I do my best to try to convince them that the course they are on, however well meaning and well motivated, is, in fact, dangerous and threatening of our first amendment rights. 
I learned today on the floor that in Europe it has been determined that if we went down this road we would be violating basic human rights, according to the European court. I am delighted to know that the Europeans have that much common sense. Clearly, the United States Supreme Court has made that clear and we in this body should not shirk our constitutional responsibility. 
I was somewhat distressed to hear the comment that the Supreme Court and only the Supreme Court can determine what the Constitution has to say about this. I think we have a responsibility to pay attention to the Constitution in this body itself and not burden the Supreme Court with laws that are clearly unconstitutional. There is always the chance one of them might slip through. A court might not be appropriately attentive when a case comes before them, and we get unconstitutional legislation. We are the first line of defense as far as the first amendment in the Constitution is concerned, and we should take that responsibility very seriously and not say, `Oh, well, let's pass a law because it sounds good, let's pass a law because the New York Times will give us a good editorial, and the Supreme Court will bail us out by declaring it unconstitutional.' That is a very dangerous position to take and I want to do my best to see to it that the first line of defense of the first amendment is drawn here in this body and maintained here so that the Supreme Court can pay attention to other issues. 
I want to address the two points that my friend from Maine talked about, soft money contributions and bogus issue ads. Let me reverse the order and talk about the first one, the bogus issue ads. She suggests, and I'm sure sincerely and honestly she believes, that bogus issue ads have come as a result of an attempt to get around the Watergate reforms. In fact, bogus issue ads have been with us since the beginning of the Republic and they are a free exercise of first amendment rights by Americans pre-Watergate, post-Watergate, and frankly post McCain-Feingold. Americans will find a way around that even if the Supreme Court were to allow McCain-Feingold to stand, should we pass it. 
One of the most vivid memories I have in politics is, as a 17-year-old high school student, watching my father, who was running for his first term in this body, standing in the living room of my grandmother, his mother, holding a newspaper and saying, `I can handle my enemies but, Lord, protect me from my friends'--a newspaper attacking the incumbent Senator from Utah, Elbert Thomas, as a Communist. And my father, trying to run his own campaign on other issues, was terribly distressed by this four-page attack on his opponent. There are those who wrote about that election after it was over who blamed my father for that rag. One of the professors from whom I took classes at the University of Utah, in the political science department, wrote an extensive article in the Western Political Quarterly in which he called the 1950 Senate race the dirtiest in Utah history, and blamed my father for calling his opponent a Communist and smearing him. My father had absolutely nothing to do with that particular publication and had no control over it. Mr. President, 1950 was clearly pre-Watergate. It was clearly pre- the reforms that the Senator from Maine hopes to reestablish here. 
However distasteful it was, however reprehensible it may have been, it was well within the rights of the first amendment guaranteed to the people who put up the money, published the paper, and distributed it. As the Senator from Kentucky indicated, we don't like independent expenditure ads. We want to control them. They make us mad--many times from our friends, many times from our opponents. But they are part of the price we pay for a free press and free speech in this country and I, for one, am not willing, in the name of shutting down that kind of an ad, to damage the first amendment right that everyone has, including the first amendment right to be stupid, the first amendment right to be outrageous, the first amendment right to say inflammatory kinds of things. I think 
that right is precious and the line to protect it must be drawn here in the Senate and not let us wait until we get to the Supreme Court. 
Now, the second issue, the issue of soft money contributions. Like the Senator from Maine, I sat on the Governmental Affairs Committee. I heard the testimony. Maybe I heard some different testimony than that which she heard, but one of the things that struck me most clearly was testimony from someone not of my party, not of my political persuasion, someone on the liberal end of the spectrum, who made this point historically. When Lyndon Johnson was President of the United States and prosecuting the war in Vietnam in a way that outraged huge numbers of our citizens to the point of protests in the streets, he was challenged in the electoral process within his own party by one brave Member of this body, Eugene McCarthy. McCarthy went to New Hampshire and took on an incumbent President within his own party, an unheard of kind of thing. He didn't win that primary but he came close. He came a close enough second that he shook LBJ to the point that LBJ subsequently left the race. How was the McCarthy campaign financed? It was financed with five wealthy individuals, each one of whom put up $100,000 apiece. And in 1968, $100,000 went a lot farther than it does in 1998. 
In a way, he brought the Government down, not because he had $500,000 to spend but because he had a message that the people of New Hampshire responded to. Without the $500,000, however, the message could not have been heard. He and the others who were involved with him, who testified before our committee, said, `If we had been limited to $1,000 apiece, McCarthy would never have been able to challenge Lyndon Johnson. If we had been limited to that kind of restriction, history would have been changed.' And he quoted, I believe it was Senator McCarthy, who said, `The Founding Fathers did not say: To this we pledge our lives, our fortunes up to $1,000, and our sacred honor.' They went the whole way and the Constitution gives them the opportunity to go the whole way. 
We have put limitations on. I happen to think that is a mistake, and I have talked about that. But we have allowed political parties to flourish by unlimited contributions to those parties. That is the terrible, awful, debilitating, corrosive soft money that we are talking about: The ability to challenge an incumbent President, the ability to expand political discourse at a time of great national concern over the direction in which an administration is going. 
I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to continue for another 2 minutes.

Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I am not a lawyer. Sometimes that is an advantage, sometimes it is a disadvantage. But I happen to have devoted a good portion of my life to trying to understand the Constitution and understand the intentions of the Founding Fathers. 
I don't know what was fully intended by the passing of the Watergate reforms, because, frankly, that was a period of time when I was leaving Washington instead of paying attention to what was going on here. But I do know what was intended in the passing of the first amendment. I do know what was intended in the creation of the Constitution. 
I believe that McCain-Feingold falls on two overwhelmingly significant points: No. 1, and most important, it is clearly unconstitutional; and No. 2, equally crippling, it is totally unworkable. On those two bases, I am happy and proud to be part of the group that is opposing it here today.  
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today, with my esteemed colleague Senator Dodd, to address an issue of significant import. Almost all of our nation's commercial banks, thrifts, and credit unions are regulated and insured. This brings great peace of mind to the American public. We all rest easier knowing that our funds, held by our insured and regulated financial institutions, are protected by (a) an insurance fund, (b) a safety and soundness regulator, and (c) the full faith and credit of the US Treasury. In order to continue this tradition of safe and sound banking practice, we need to ensure that banking law stays abreast of current practices in the market place and that our banks have the most up-to-date information available on upcoming issues affecting the safety and soundness of their operations. 
The Bill we introduce today has a two-fold purpose. It grants the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) the authority to examine third party service organizations which have assumed more of the traditional bank functions. This bill will make OTS and NCUA comparable to the Office of the Controller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in their ability to ensure safe and sound banking practices as they relate to third party service organizations. This Bill also requires federal financial regulatory agencies to hold seminars for financial institutions on the implications of the Year 2000 (Y2K) problem for safe and sound operations, and to provide model approaches for solving common Y2K problems. 
The authorities proposed for the NCUA and OTS have been requested by both regulatory agencies. NCUA `strongly supports [this proposal] and urges its quick enactment.' OTS, in separate letters to Senator Dodd and myself, refers to the current situation as an `obstacle' to their supervisory efforts and a `statutory deficiency'. OTS Director Seidman further states `I support your efforts. . . . I have asked my staff to cooperate fully with Senate Banking Committee staff to address any concerns you may have regarding this provision.' 
OTS staff has been very helpful in this effort and I want to take this opportunity to thank OTS Director Seidman for her assistance as well as Ms Deborah Dakins. I also want to express appreciation to the Senate Banking Committee staff, especially Mr. Andrew Lowenthal, and my own Subcommittee staff for their efforts.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I hesitate to intrude on this debate, but confession is good for the soul. 
I campaigned on behalf of a line-item veto. I worked on this floor for the passage of the line-item veto. I enthusiastically voted for the line-item veto. I learned one thing in basic training when I was in the military service of this country that has remained with me. One of the things they taught us was that the best time to escape is immediately after you are captured. Don't wait until you have been taken to the back lines. Don't wait until you have been put in a prison camp to try to plot your escape. Escape immediately after you are captured, when you are within 100 yards of your own lines. You are in the confusion of the battlefield, you are under the control of troops who are not trained to hold on to prisoners. 
I have applied that principle in my life. When I make a mistake I want to escape from it as quickly as possible instead of waiting until I have been put into prison later on behind the enemy lines. 
I reasoned that the experience of State Governors, 47 of whom have line-item vetoes, bade well for the line-item veto. My own Governor in the State of Utah has it. And it has not been the source of mischief in the process of legislation in the State. 
I have seen that it has become the source of mischief here in this body. And, as I said to my revered colleague on the Appropriations Committee when this came up--and our chairman was expressing his usual enthusiasm; in this case in anger for his position--it may be that I will have to eat a little crow. 
So as I receive the news of the action having been taken by the court in this case, I stand now to say that I would not support an effort to try to overturn that decision. The time to escape is immediately after you are captured. And we have been captured. And I will escape from my previous posture. 
I apologize, albeit much too late, to my primary opponent who stood in opposition to the line-item veto. And this was a matter of difference between the two of us in the primary. I think I made some progress because as we got near the vote he recanted and came to my side so as to try to get the people who were in favor of a line-item veto to vote for him instead of me. 
But I believe the arguments that have been repeated here, the information given here from the decision of the judge, are sufficiently persuasive that I need to make this apology and this recanting of a previous position. While I may not be with my two colleagues on many other matters, I try to be with them on constitutional matters. 
It is on this basis that I opposed a constitutional amendment regarding flag burning. That puts me at odds with my senior colleague from Utah, which always distresses me. It is for this purpose that I oppose McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform because I think it is unconstitutional. I believe the courts have ruled in similar cases that the guts of the McCain-Feingold bill is in fact an intrusion on the first amendment. 
But I think there is no more important function that we have in this Chamber, whatever our disagreements on the specifics, than the function of protecting the Constitution against the whims of the hour. 
And so I thank Senator Byrd and Senator Moynihan for their scholarship and for their leadership on this issue, and I, as one Senator at least on the other side of the issue, throw in the towel, eat a little crow, and declare my willingness to escape from a previous position.

 Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I submit for the Record the following National African American Creed, written by one of my constituents, Mr. Terry Harris. Mr. Harris is an active member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and has presented this creed before the NAACP Executive Board. Mr. Harris' National African American Creed challenges people to make a difference beginning with themselves. In particular, Mr. Harris encourages other African Americans to eschew drugs and gang violence, gain an education, display kindness, and support our country. I commend Mr. Harris on his interest in helping others.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Digital Signature and Electronic Authentication Law (SEAL) of 1998. 
We Americans place such trust in the act of signing a document that we traditionally have referred to the written signature as a `John Hancock' after one of the first signers of the Declaration of Independence and one of our country's founding fathers. As the country moves into the 21st century and into the digital age, it is necessary for the government to validate the use of equally trustworthy forms of authentication for electronic transactions. In doing this, our country will secure its position as a leader in the international digital economy. 
Electronic authentication, broadly defined, is any technology which provides a way for the recipient of a message to verify the identity of the sender, make sure the message was not altered in transit, and confirm that the message was the one the sender intended to transmit. Parties to electronic transactions must have access to this authentication process in order to feel secure in conducting business over open networks. 
While this concept is fairly simple, the legislative process has proven quite complex. Many states have enacted legislation on electronic authentication, but the state laws are vastly different. Because electronic transactions do not respect state or national boundaries, there are no clear rules to govern this activity. This lack of direction has limited the use of electronic authentication. The process is further complicated by the number of competing technologies available to provide authentication as well as the fact that businesses from all different sectors of the economy seek to use and offer authentication services. 
As Chairman of the Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Financial Services and Technology, I have examined this issue and have determined that the appropriate first step toward addressing it is to introduce a firmly grounded, free-market bill that addresses the concerns of financial institutions. In introducing this bill, I do not want to suggest that this authority should belong exclusively to that group. I have stated repeatedly my belief that all entities, banks and nonbanks alike, should be authorized to use electronic authentication for their own transactions and offer the service to third parties. In attempting to fashion a bill that would appropriately address the needs and concerns of all interested groups, however, I have reached an impasse. My attempts to reach out and engage those representing nonbank interests in serious discussions have failed. I have determined, therefore, that it is appropriate for me to take a first step and introduce this bill to address the needs of financial institutions. 
While I do not intend to create a monopoly for banks, and indeed hope that this legislation can be amended to include other entities, I do recognize that there are valid reasons why we may choose to address the concerns of financial institutions separately. 
Financial institutions are accustomed to assuming `trusted third party' roles, including serving as trustee and offering notary and signature guarantee services. Offering electronic authentication services is the functional equivalent of those traditional bank activities. 
Financial institutions are highly regulated entities, and the financial institution regulators have experience in supervising these `trusted third party' activities. 
Many of the transactions which individuals and businesses will seek to authenticate are likely to be financial transactions. 
In Europe and other countries around the world, electronic authentication activities are conducted almost exclusively by financial institutions. By taking a first step and authorizing our financial institutions to use electronic authentication, we will strengthen our position in establishing the conditions for international transactions. 
The Digital SEAL Bill is, as I have described it, a minimalist, free-market bill. It provides quite simply that a financial institution may use electronic authentication in the conduct of its business and that the use of such electronic authentication shall be valid. A financial institution's use of electronic authentication shall be governed by the rules of the system or agreement under which it operates and shall be regulated by the appropriate financial institution regulator. The bill defines electronic authentication broadly in an effort to be as technologically neutral as possible. 
Of equal importance is what this bill does not do. It does not create a new regulatory bureaucracy to supervise this activity. It does not impair consumers' rights under the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, or any state law of similar purpose. Finally, it does not limit, in any way, the ability of any other entity to use or offer electronic authentication in the course of its business. 
The time has come for Congress to begin a serious discussion of the impact of technology on commercial transactions and consider how age-old concepts, like the importance of a signature, will fit into an increasingly electronic world. Electronic authentication is a good starting point for this discussion, and passage of this bill will advance the development of electronic banking and commerce. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this legislation to give financial institutions, and appropriate other entities, the authority to use electronic authentication.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, there is a great adventure coming up. Everyone is looking forward to it and reservations are already being made. We are talking about the great New Year's Eve party on December 31, 1999, the New Year's Eve party of the millennium. Join with me in a moment of fantasy and speculation and consider yourself at that party. 
You have made your reservations. You are in New York City so you can be part of the celebration in Times Square. This is going to be a wonderful event in your life. 
You are wearing a name brand digital watch, one of the fancy ones that records not only the time and the day, but the year. So you have your watch on, and you look at it to follow the time until we get to the magic moment. You are looking at your watch, and it says 11:59, December 31, 1999. At the stroke of midnight, your watch clicks over to midnight and goes blank. 
What has happened? We have already seen that. Someone has taken a watch and set it ahead to that date to see what would happen. At the moment it goes to the year 2000, a circuit freezes open, the watch display disappears, the power from the battery fries the chip and the watch becomes useless. So at the moment of midnight, as you look at your watch, your watch becomes useless. 
I know the Presiding Officer would not do this, but for the sake of the illustration, let's say you celebrate a little more than maybe you should, and you decide it is appropriate that you take a taxi back to your hotel. You don't have enough money for a taxi. No problem, there's an ATM machine and you have your ATM card with you. You put the ATM card in, push the buttons and wait for the money. Nothing happens, because the ATM machine is not geared to click over into the year 2000, and it won't give you any cash; it is frozen. 
Somehow, Mr. President, with the help of maybe some of your friends, you get yourself to your hotel. The elevators won't work in the hotel because at midnight of the year 2000, the chip in the elevator said this elevator has not been inspected for 99 years, and it goes immediately to the bottom and stays there until an inspector shows up. So you are forced to stagger up the stairs to find your room. We hope you are using a key and not some other high technology to get into the room so that you can get a good night's sleep. 
The next morning, you get up, go down and find the lobby filled with angry guests. None of them can check out because the hotel's computers that handle the checkout procedure are all frozen with the year 2000 problem. You stand there getting more and more angry until finally with manual checkout procedures, you get out of the hotel and say, `Can I get a car to the airport?' 
`Unfortunately, Senator,' says the manager of the hotel, `our cars won't start. They have computer chips in them that are geared to the year 2000, and we can only get you to the airport in old taxi cabs that are so old they have no computers, and today they are in great demand.' 
You show up at the airport finally, hours and hours late, sure you have missed your flight, only to discover that no flights have gone because the computer program that controls the flights and the reservations is all shut down because of the year 2000 problem that has not been fixed. 
It is probably just as well that the flights are not flying, because the air traffic control system is managed by computers which have not been fixed for the year 2000 problem, and we would have no safety in the skies anyway. Whether you like it or not, Mr. President, you are stuck in New York for the foreseeable future. 
When Monday comes, the 3d of January, and the opening of the stock market in the new millennium. The stock market can't open because all of the stock market procedures are run by computers, and inadequate precautions have been taken to get the stock market ready for the year 2000 circumstance and the computers have shut down everywhere. 
You write a check only to discover that the automatic deposit that goes by computer into your checking account hasn't worked, because the bank in which you have your money is not year 2000 compliant and your check won't clear. The money is not in your account. 
Every single circumstance that I have just described could easily happen if nothing is done between now and the year 2000. 
Some of the circumstances that I have just described inevitably will happen no matter how much we work to try to get the problem solved between now and the year 2000. Our challenge, as a society, is to see that as few of those problems that I have described happen. It is impossible to guarantee that none of them will happen. The one that you can be absolutely sure of, Mr. President, is that, if you're wearing the wrong brand, your watch will fry on that date. 
How big a problem is the year 2000 problem? We have held hearings in my subcommittee and asked this question, and we have come up with two numbers, both of them large. 
The first is the number that it will cost to fix the problem. The estimate that we have before our committee and in our subcommittee record is roughly $600 billion--$600 billion. That is a little less than 10 percent of our gross domestic product, which is currently running at $7 trillion. So 10 percent of that would be $700 billion. If we are $100 billion off, it is going to cost 10 percent of our gross domestic product to fix the problem--a very large number, a very large percentage. 
The other number is even bigger. We have asked the question: How big is the potential liability that can come from lawsuits that people file in the year 2000? The answer we have is $1 trillion. 
So we are looking at a problem in the economy that could cost us as much as 10 percent of GDP to fix, and if it is not fixed properly, it could cost us as much as one-seventh of the economy in lawsuits to deal with the liability. 
I don't know of a problem we have faced here on the floor that has that kind of certainty connected with it and that kind of urgency connected with it. We, in politics, always try to create a disaster so that the politicians then can pass a law to fix it and then take credit for having averted the disasters. Many times the disasters we were talking about weren't coming anyway. This one you can count on. It is coming; it is there; it is quantifiable; it is very real. 
A lot of folks have said to me, `No, no, no, Senator, don't get excited, this is a simple problem and Bill Gates will fix it for us.' The idea is Bill Gates, or some other smart computer jockey, will sit down, spend a weekend coming up with a solution, mail it out to everybody, and we will put it in our computers like a magic fix, press a few buttons and the whole problem will go away. That is not possible, because it is not that kind of a problem and if you don't believe me look at the Microsoft website, under frequently asked questions, FAQ. There will be no magic bullet. 
Here is the problem, Mr. President. The computer code was written 20, 30, sometimes as recently as 10, 15 years ago. It was important for cost reasons to hold down the number of areas in a field. I am using the language the computer folks talk about, the bits and the bytes, and so on. They will have a field, and if they have two digits, it is a whole lot cheaper to put the field in the code than if there are four, at least under the old languages in the old code. So, to save time, to save money, they put in a two-digit field instead of a four-digit field, assuming that no one needed to know the 19 of the year, they only needed to know the 61, 62, 71, 72, or whatever would come later. 
Many of them assumed that these programs would long since be phased out by the year 2000, and if they gave any thought to the year 2000 problem at all, they were sure that their computer codes would not be in use at that time. 
In fact, Mr. President, many of those codes are in use, and they are in use in the largest computer systems that we have in the country, in the mainframe systems that run most of American business. 
Is it an easy problem to fix? Oh, yes, it is very simple; very simple. All you have to do is find that portion of the computer code where there is a two-digit field and change it to a four-digit field. That is not rocket science. What is not simple is finding where that field is in the first place. 
The analogy that I heard that best describes it is this: Fixing a line of code is as simple as changing a rivet on the Golden Gate Bridge. The Golden Gate Bridge is held together by hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of rivets. You have the responsibility of finding every one and changing every one during rush hour, and if you miss one or two, the bridge will fall down. That is the enormity of the problem that we have here. 
It is a simple, easy fix once you find it, but gargantuan in its size, because there are so many that must be found and, in many cases, with the older software, no one knows where the code is. Documentation was not an extended science at the time they were writing that code. No one knows where it is. You are on a search mission that can be tremendously frustrating. You can think you have everything, then you gear up the system and run it, only to discover there are still some rivets missing that you have not changed. There are still some fields of code that have not been expanded. 
Mr. President, we have held four hearings in my subcommittee on this issue. The first one we had the banks and the financial institutions come in and testify as to the size of the problem from their point of view. It was very revealing. 
They gave us this number which is what is driving my sense of urgency. They told us that if we do not have the year 2000 problem fixed by September of 1998 in the banking system, we are too late. September of 1998, that is less than a year away. Many people say, `Oh, 2000, this is 1997, we have 3 years to worry about it.' No, Mr. President, we have less than 1 year to worry about it. 
I asked the question, why must it be fixed by September of 1998? Back to my analogy about changing the rivets on the Golden Gate Bridge during rush hour. You have to test this system once you have replaced all of the fields with two digits with fields with four digits to make sure you got them all. The banking system can't test its computer programs while it is running all of its checks and deposits and transfer payments. So by September of 1998, when you supposedly have your system done, you have about 50 weekends left to test it. The experts who have looked at it said you have to have at least 50 in which to test it to keep changing the problems as they come along. 
So I repeat, as far as the banking system is concerned, if people do not have their remedial program pretty well done by September of 1998, they are way behind the curve and, indeed, the witnesses who spoke to us said we are already in a circumstance where we are not talking about a total fix, we are talking about triage, the medical term that says when you bring in an accident victim or a gunshot victim, you do what is necessary to save the victim's life and then you worry about other things to restore him to health later on. Triage is the lifesaving activity; the return to health comes later on. 
So we are talking about triage activity with respect to the year 2000 being in place by September of 1998. We are not talking about the total fix, because the total fix will have to take place for months and months after we pass the turn of the millennium. 
Obviously, when we are talking numbers this big if the problem is not property solved, it can have serious implications for the economy. Dr. Ed Yardeni testified in our last hearing. He is an investor analyst who has been looking at this problem, and his first reaction to it when he looked at it was, `My gosh, if this thing isn't settled, this could, in fact, cause a recession.' He put the chances of that happening at 30 percent, a recession of worldwide proportions, Mr. President--30 percent. That is enough to get our attention. 
Why does he say there is a 30-percent chance of a worldwide recession of the problem isn't fixed properly? 
He makes this very powerful point, going back to our last truly major recession which came as a result of the interruption in oil supplies in the early 1970's. The world runs on oil. If we cannot get a regular and dependable supply of oil, we cannot run our world economies. Today, the world still runs on oil, but it runs on information. And if there is an interruption in the flow of information, it will have implications far beyond your inability to get a taxi in New York on New Year's Day. 
If the information in the banking system and in the financial markets, information in insurance and loans is all interrupted in ways that cause things to fail, it could in fact trigger this trillion dollars worth of liability that we are talking about and create a recession. 
Many people said that to Dr.. Yardeni, `You're an alarmist saying there is a 30 percent chance of recession. Study the problem more so you understand it better.' He has done it and raised his prediction from 30 percent to 35 percent. At the time we had the hearing, he prepared himself for the hearings to that he would be very much up to date on everything that was going on. 
When he came before our subcommittee he said the chance of a worldwide recession occurring as a result of the year 2000 problem is now at 40 percent. The chances are going up as time runs out and people fail to react. The more time we have, the lower the chance. The less time we have, with a slow reaction time, the greater the chance. 
Mr. President, we have learned in the hearings in my committee that this is a pervasive business problem, not just limited to the financial markets. Businesses rely on computer systems for nearly every aspect of their operations from operating medical equipment that administers chemotherapy, to calculating interest on loans, to launching and tracking satellites. 
Failure in one computer system could not only devastate it, but we are so interconnected that it could have a ripple effect on other computer systems. So this brings us back to the fact that businesses are going to have to expend huge sums of money in order to deal with the risks connected with this. Some of the companies have already stepped forward and disclosed what they are going to do. 
American Airlines puts the cost at $100 million to solve their year 2000 problem. GTE plans to spend $150 million. And outside of the business arena--my State of Utah has set aside $40 million to deal with their problems. The USAA group said they will spend as much as $75 million. 
What about the companies in which you own stock, Mr. President? If you say you do not own any, then what about the companies that your pension funds own stocks? How much do they plan to spend in remediation or in contingency planning? If you check their disclosure statements, you probably will not find the answer, because more and more companies are saying, `We don't want to disclose how big a year 2000 problem we have because we don't want to tip off your competitors, we don't want to hurt the stock price, to in effect say to our investors that we've got this huge cost coming, while our competitors are not disclosing it.' 
And some of the regulators have said to us, `If a stockholder wants to know how big the problem is, he or she should call the company and ask.' That is totally unacceptable, Mr. President. It is unfair and unrealistic to expect an individual shareholder in any company or a depositor at any financial institution to make the inquiries on his own and have any hope of getting a meaningful answer. 
What we need is disclosure that is mandated by the regulators that everybody responds to. The burden must be upon the institution to disclose its readiness in this circumstance. 
That is why, Mr. President, I am rising today to introduce the CRASH Protection Act of 1997. We love acronyms in Government. CRASH stands for `Computer Remediation And Share Holder' protection. 
I hope that it will make our transition into next millennium 
much smoother than it would currently be. My legislation will require the Securities and Exchange Commission to amend its disclosure requirements in five specific ways. 
First, it will require disclosure of a moving peg pinpointing any publicly traded corporation's progress with regard to the remediation of the five recognized phases of the year 2000 preparation. Awareness, these five are awareness, assessment, renovation, validation, and implementation. So there will be a disclosure of how a company is doing in those five areas. 
Second, my bill will require a summary of the costs incurred by the company in connection with any remediation effort. Both sums already expended and those that can reasonably be expected to be expended in the future. That is a cost that every shareholder deserves to know. 
Third, it will require the disclosure of likely costs associated with the defense of lawsuits against the company or its directors and officers due to any liabilities incurred as a result of year 2000 problems. 
Fourth, it will require an estimate and a detailed discussion of existing insurance coverage for the defense of lawsuits or the specific occurrence of any year 2000 failure, large or small, and finally it will mandate the disclosure of all contingency plans for computer system failure. 
Mr. President, the SEC has commented on this issue. And I would like to read their appropriate paragraph. They say:  
It is not, and will not, be possible for any single entity or collective enterprise to represent that it has achieved complete Year 2000 compliance and thus to guarantee its remediation efforts. 
Again, Mr. President, it will not be possible for anyone to do that. Back to the statement: 
The problem is simply too complex for such a claim to have legitimacy. Efforts to solve Year 2000 problems are best described as `risk mitigation'. Success in the effort will have been achieved if the number and seriousness of any technical failures is minimized, and they are quickly identified and repaired if they do occur. 
Mr. President, that statement more than any other reflects my concern that we must move forward to make sure that the year 2000 problem is taken seriously by publicly traded companies, their officers and their legal representatives. 
It will be my goal to move this bill as quickly as possible after the first of the year because again may I stress, Mr. President, it is not midnight, December 31, 1999, tht is our deadline, it is September, 1998, in which the plans must be in place or they will not have the opportunity to be tested and get us out of the circumstance. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me stress that year 2000 problems are not limited to the private-sector businesses. Studies have shown that our Government is well behind the curve in its remediation efforts. 
As one of my staffers says that his grandmother, Maria Schwibinger, always told him `sweep your own stoop first.' Government ought to focus on its own year 2000 problems as well as require that others do that. 
The GAO has given many branches of Government unsatisfactory ratings in their management of the year 2000 problems. I have asked the GAO to report on the progress of the financial institution regulatory agencies. And they are doing that. 
So far I have only one of their reports, and it is not reassuring. They have completed their review of the National Credit Union Administration and expressed a myriad of concerns about its preparedness for the date change. 
Last Monday, I received NCUA's response to the GAO. And this response troubled me for several reasons. 
No. 1, it made no effort to refute the GAO assertion that `For some credit unions, year 2000 problems could even result in their failures.' We are not talking about expense here, we are talking 
about survival. And they do not refute that. 
No. 2, it implicitly agreed with the GAO's assertion that NCUA does not have qualified staff to conduct examinations in complex systems areas. They had better get going in getting that qualified staff as quickly as they possibly can. 
And, No. 3, its response plan for compliance on the part of the Nation's credit unions is all prospective in nature. They had no report of anything that they had done in the past. 
Now, lest anybody think I am beating up on the credit unions, let me make it clear that this is the only report I have. It is entirely possible that the GAO's review of bank, insurance, and securities regulators, would be equally as devastating. So others need not take comfort in the fact that I am talking about credit unions and not about them. Their time may very well be coming. 
So, Mr. President, I submit this bill and ask it be appropriately referred. I close with this final comment. I am doing everything I can. Chairman D'Amato, as chairman of the full committee, is cooperating fully and leading the charge at the full committee level and doing everything he can to see to it that our Nation's financial institutions are prepared and ready for the year 2000 problem. 
The Banking Committee and my subcommittee have no jurisdiction over the other areas of Government where this problem is real. We have no jurisdiction over the Defense Department, over the IRS, over the air traffic control system or any of the other myriad of agencies that have their own year 2000 challenges. 
I am currently putting together a letter to the President in which I am calling upon him to appoint, through the use of his Executive power, some coordinating figure within the entire executive branch whose sole responsibility between now and that great New Year's Eve party will be to monitor, hector, prod, push, and otherwise produce results in every area of the executive branch. 
I hope that if the Government will get involved in this at that kind of level, if the regulators in the financial areas will respond to the kind of prodding that is coming as a result of my bill, as shareholders react to the information that is made available to them if my bill passes, demand remediation efforts on the part of the companies that they own, that we will be able to look back on my opening comment on what the Presiding Officer could expect on New Year's Eve and say, instead of the disaster that Senator Bennett outlined back in November 1997, we had some minor inconveniences. 
Nothing could make me happier in this area than to see that my prediction will not come true, to have Dr. Yardeni, and other thoughtful people examining this issue, begin to move down their level of concern so that instead of a 40-percent chance of a worldwide recession, they are talking about a 35- or 30- or a 25- or a 20-percent chance or finally saying, well, by virtue of the reaction that was created, the chance of a worldwide recession is now down to practically nothing. 
I would be very, very happy to be proven wrong by the reaction that is created as a result of the legislation that we will introduce today and the hearings that we have held. But I stress again in closing, Mr. President, this is the disaster that we can see. It is like the oil crisis in its size, but it can be prepared for and it can be mitigated against if we only will muster the will to recognize what we are facing and do the things we have to do. I am hoping that my legislation and the hearings held in my subcommittee will move us in that direction.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to make a brief statement regarding S. 1258, a bill I introduced on October 6, 1997. This legislation will amend the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to prohibit an alien not lawfully present in the United States from receiving assistance under that act. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works has reviewed this bill and approved it for Senate floor action. 
My purpose in bringing this bill before the Senate is to address a loophole that was inadvertently created when immigration and welfare reform bills were recently enacted. In part, these bills were crafted to prevent illegal immigrants from entering the United States by denying Federal taxpayer paid benefits to illegal aliens. Currently, illegal aliens are still eligible to receive relocation assistance. Often, this assistance turns out to be a significant sum of money. 
This legislation was originally introduced in the other body following an incident in California in which an illegal immigrant was awarded $12,000 because her legal status in this country made her ineligible to be moved into section 8 housing. In other instances, relocation assistance is being awarded to illegal aliens who then use the money to buy homes in their countries of origin. 
This legislation simply closes a loophole which was overlooked in previous legislation and fully complies with the intent of Congress when it enacted immigration and welfare reform laws. I note that this legislation will not affect foreign nationals residing in the United States as legal residents or under the legal protection of a valid visa. In addition, the bill provides Federal agencies the ability to waive the provisions of this act in case of an exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. 
I have one technical amendment to bring the bill into conformance with the legislation already passed by the other body. This amendment does not change the substance of the bill and I ask that it be considered with the bill. I have worked closely with the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in bringing this bill to the floor. I appreciate their support and the help of committee staff in moving this legislation toward enactment.

Mr. BENNETT. I thank my colleague for his summary of the circumstance with relation to Hill Air Force Base. I want to take my 5 minutes and refer to the arguments made on the floor. 
We have heard that the bill as currently constituted contains 32 pages of anticompetitive language. I challenge that, Mr. President. I believe it contains 32 pages of rules by which the competition will occur. 
Do we refer to rules as anticompetitive when they establish the framework in which a competition will happen? I will take a sports analogy. Is it anticompetitive when there is a referee on the floor that prevents one player from fouling another in a basketball game? If I have a team filled with very rough players, I consider that anticompetitive. But if the purpose of the game is something other than to beat each other up, but to score baskets in the form of the rules of the game, the existence of the referee and, yes, the rule book which runs for more than 32 pages, in fact, enhances competition rather than cuts it down. 
Mr. President, 32 pages of oversight language. I must report my own experience with this issue. We have only one set of numbers before us as a Congress as to what happens with privatization in place, and those are the numbers that come from the GAO. The GAO says if you proceed with privatization in place, it will cost the taxpayers over half a billion. That is not right, says the Air Force, nowhere near, we will save money with competition. I said, fine, give me the numbers. `We don't have any numbers. We just know we will save money.' I had Sheila Widnall, the Secretary of the Air Force, in my office. I asked for numbers. She refused to give me any and just said, `We will save money. GAO is wrong.' If GAO was wrong, give me specifics. No, the Air Force said, we won't give you specifics. Just trust us that they are wrong. 
General Babbitt was put forward as the general who would command this activity. I held up his nomination until he came to my office. I said, `General, you are undoubtedly qualified for this. I will let you go forward. But there is something I want from you before I will let you go forward.' He said, `What is that?' I said, `I want you to agree to give us the numbers. If indeed you can improve that privatization-in-place will save taxpayers dollars, you ought to be able to prove that with numbers rather than rhetoric. If you have those numbers I want you to be willing to share them with the Congress.' He looked at me and said, `Why, of course, Senator, we will be happy to share those numbers.' I said, `General, you are the first person in the Air Force ever to agree to do that.' 
That is all we are asking for, a little sunshine here, 
not quite so much rhetoric and not so much `trust me,' a little sunshine, a little oversight, a little understanding. So in these 32 pages that have been attacked, there are requirements that the Air Force tell the Congress how much money they are spending, how much money, presumably, they are saving and how they are following the rules, and then have those numbers reviewed by the GAO. 
Is this so anticompetitive, if you are saving the taxpayers millions or hundreds of millions of dollars, that you are willing to share the information? I don't think it is anticompetitive at all. I think, again, it is like the rule book in a basketball game that says: These are the rules and there will be a referee to enforce them. The rules are fairly voluminous, but the end result of the rules is that you have a game that works. 
We have been told again and again, `no, we believe in competition.' I believe in competition. But I believe in competition in the open. I believe in competition where the information is available, particularly to the policymakers in the Congress. 
So, Mr. President, I hope that this bill passes. I hope the President signs it because I think we can pass it by a wide enough margin to send a veto-proof message to the White House, and I hope when it's over, we will then, by virtue of the language that has been added to the bill on the depot issue, as a Congress, be able to see what is done, be able to understand what is done and, if at that time they come back and say we would save the taxpayers this much money, and they get specific with numbers, I am perfectly willing to have them spend that money on privatization in place. But I am not, Mr. President, willing to accept a `trust me' attitude, given the history of the Air Force's unwillingness to talk to us on this issue up to this point. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. 
I sat and listened to the senior Senator from Texas as I did some weeks, if not months, ago when he made similar speeches, and I want to respond to some of the comments he made. 
He said that his primary interest in life is preserving competition. I want competition, too. He said he wants fair competition. I want fair competition, too. I remember in his previous speech he said he was so concerned about fair competition that he would be willing to write the law in such a way as to outline the requirements to make sure there was fair competition and then allow the depots a 10-percent cushion. He said, if they came within 10 percent of the private sector, they would be given the opportunity to hold the work. 
We believe the language in this bill fulfills the requirement that he laid out on this floor at that time, that it does outline fair competition. He says many people think of depots as an entitlement, and he says, `I reject that.' 
I agree with him 100 percent. Depots, or any defense facility, are not an entitlement, whether it is in California or Texas or Utah or Arizona. However, there is the question of the core capability of the Department of Defense in establishments that they have created over time. It is an established rule that core work is to be done in Government-owned facilities. 
What is core work? It is the work that has to be done in case we go to war, in case we are in the circumstance where a private contractor says, `I don't want to interrupt my commercial business to do this military business just because there is a war going on.' There is core work that must be done. 
Prior to the adoption of the language that is in this bill, the definition of what is core work and what is not was left entirely to the Secretary of Defense. That means if the Secretary of Defense wants to rule something as not core work and thereby rig the competition for political purposes, he has the right to do it. 
One of the things that appeals to me most about this language is that it puts sunshine on the process of determining what is core and what is not and requires the Secretary of Defense to report to whom? To the Congress, to the people who are appropriating the money, as to what is core and what is not. 
What can be wrong with that? The Senator from Texas wants competition. So do I. I think we have responded to the Senator's call for competition, and we have crafted language that produces that. 
Madam President, I have a document with responses to a floor statement that was made earlier by the senior Senator from Texas. This briefly addresses some of his primary objections, many of which have been repeated here today.

Mr. BENNETT. Now, Madam President, I have spent 5 years in the Senate. I have spent 40 years in the business community. I am a businessman who has run businesses. I would like to speak, in the remaining time, out of that experience rather than the political experience. 
What we are dealing with here from a business standpoint is a factory that is at overcapacity. The question is, How do we as competent managers deal with that excess capacity? Do we have competition? Of course, we do. If we have items that can be taken out of the factory and built more cheaply someplace else, we want them out of the factory and built more cheaply someplace else. But if we have the capital investment in the factory itself and we have excess capacity, we would not be wise stewards, we would not be intelligent businesspeople if we did not go out and look for things 
to be built in the factory to soak up that excess capacity as our first responsibility to the shareholders. 
We here in the Senate are responding not to shareholders but to taxpayers. We are responding to military people who are depending upon these facilities to provide the necessary skills in time of war, and we are facing a circumstance where we have excess capacity. 
I am as dedicated as anybody else to the idea that we need to move ahead with competition and save taxpayers' money. But to ignore the question of our existing capacity and overcapacity in the name of a theoretical argument in favor of competition, which sounds good in the classroom, is to be irresponsible. 
One final comment, Madam President, and then I will yield back the remainder of my time. The Senator from Texas has said on this occasion and repeatedly that this for him is not a parochial issue, that it is a matter of principle and that he is standing on this principle even if a base in Texas were not involved. I will accept that. I will respect that. I want to make it equally clear, however, Madam President, that there are those of us on the other side of the argument who feel just as strongly that we are standing for a principle where the principle is integrity in the contracting process in the Department of Defense, which integrity we feel has been attacked. 
I was asked, on the record, would you still be fighting this fight if Hill Air Force Base were not involved, and would you stand to protect Hill Air Force jobs if it cost the taxpayers extra money? I said to the reporter in the hometown where Hill Air Force Base is located, if we cannot demonstrate that the Air Force is better off financially by having the work done at Hill Air Force Base, I cannot as a Senator say the work should still be done at Hill Air Force Base at a higher price. 
I believe the position we are taking is sound management practice, sound business practice. It is what I would do if I were a businessman charged with the responsibility of running this factory that is at overcapacity, and I believe that we have just as solid reasoning to stand on principle as the Senator from Texas believes he has. 
I hope everyone will recognize that it is not appropriate to attack anybody else's motives. Now, if he attacks the motives of the folks in the House, that is fair game. I will let him do it with the people in the House; that is kind of the way we do it here. But I wanted to make my statement with respect to where we are in the Senate.

Mr. BENNETT. I am pleased to join with the Distinguished Majority Leader in sponsoring S. 1311 regarding arms sales to Iran. This is very critical legislation. If the relevant governments cannot regain control over their weapons sellers, Iran will have a ballistic missile capability within months instead of years. 
Mr. President, on Tuesday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told me, `Dealing with proliferation is the highest priority item of this administration.' In the national security field, she has the right sense of priority. And certainly, Iran is the leading problem country. 
The legislation we are introducing today calls on the administration to report on which foreign entities are contributing to Iran's missile ambitions. For example, the Washington Times has recently reported on a number of important Russian organizations involved in this trade. Special metals and associated technology are said to be involved. If necessary, sanctions against the named entities will be imposed. 
I hope sanctions will not be necessary. I have some confidence that foreign government leaders will fulfill their commitments. But it may become necessary. We already know Iran has a chemical warfare capability and we suspect it has nuclear and germ warfare ambitions. We cannot allow a sponsor of state terrorism like Iran to obtain a ballistic missile delivery system.

Mr. BENNETT. I would say to the majority leader before my next question, I have been called by brokers who have told me what a marvelous investment a particular company is. And I said, `But they sell cigarettes, and I don't want to put my money in a company that sells cigarettes.' And I was told, `Yes, but they're mainly in cookies and biscuits and other kinds of food.' And I said, `No, I am making a decision as to whom I will support with my investment dollars, and the company that's in the tobacco business is not one I want to support with my money.' I don't attack people who support it with their own money, but I make my own investment decisions. I have heard people say the same thing about entertainment companies, saying they don't want their money in the entertainment company that produces a particular movie, and whatever. 
But this is the next question I would like to address to the majority leader. The distinguished minority leader talked about campaign finance hitting a bump in the road today but saying it was not dead, that the Senate had hit it but not killed it. 
Is it not the opinion of the majority leader that the biggest bump that McCain-Feingold has hit is not the vote in the Senate but the vote in the Supreme Court? When the Supreme Court took action with respect to denying cert to a lower court ruling, did the Supreme Court not in fact inflict a much bigger blow on McCain-Feingold than the vote we took today? And if, indeed, we had passed it today, is it not now clear the Supreme Court itself would gut the bill?

Mr. BENNETT. I recall in Friday's debate when the Senator from Arizona laid down the three fundamental purposes of McCain-Feingold, and the second of those three was to lessen the amount of money in politics. So I think the question of the Senator from Kentucky is a legitimate one: How much do the sponsors of McCain-Feingold want to lessen the amount of money in politics? 
According to the Senator from Arizona, that is one of the three fundamental pillars of this, and I hope the two Senators will continue the colloquy until we get an answer to that question: How much do the sponsors of McCain-Feingold want to lessen the amount of money in politics?

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, if I may respond to my friend from Kentucky, I know a little bit about campaigns in Wyoming because a large portion of the Wyoming electorate is served out of the television market headquartered in Salt Lake City, UT. As a consequence, voters in Utah were treated to attack ads telling us how terrible Mr. Enzi was in the last campaign. We had no idea who he was. I did not meet him until he was sworn in here. But I had seen all of the attack ads that were put on through the Salt Lake City television stations attacking the senatorial candidate in Wyoming. 
By contrast, if I may, our friend from Delaware, Senator Biden, has told us that Delaware has no television outlets at all in the State. As a consequence, if he is going to run a television campaign in Delaware, he has to do all of his buying in Philadelphia, so that the voters of Pennsylvania get to hear all of the glories and beauties of Joe Biden, none of whom can vote for him because he cannot buy television time in Delaware. 
What the Senator from Kentucky has demonstrated is how incredibly difficult it is to craft legislation that approaches the ideal sought by the Senators from Arizona and Wisconsin in a market-by-market, State-by-State, election-by-election circumstance. It is virtually impossible to do that. We ought to recognize that and defeat the whole thing out of hand.

Mr. BENNETT. Of course the Government has no business doing that. That is the point we made on Friday when we were having the debate. Even if we grant the argument raised by the Senator from Wisconsin and his 126 experts that it can be done in a way that is constitutional, we recognize that it cannot be done in a way that makes sense. 
It is possible to craft a system that meets the narrow requirements of the Constitution in terms of protecting free speech, but it is not possible to do one in a way that makes any logical sense at all. 
I had risen to ask my colleague this question about the example we have before us. We are being told this is constitutional because it is voluntary. And I suppose that is the reason these 126 scholars have signed the letter. As long as you agree in advance to give up your constitutional rights, then the Constitution will not defend you. 
The Senator from Kentucky has said it isn't really voluntary. There is a huge incentive which the Senator from Kentucky describes as a gun pointed at your head to see to it that you are voluntary. So it is not voluntary. This is the question I had in mind. 
We have an example before us of people giving up their constitutional rights in return for Federal dollars. There are some who are so unkind to call that a bribe. But in the Presidential system now, virtually every candidate for President accepts the bribe; that is, he or she accepts the Federal dollars in return for agreeing to limit their speech. The Senator from Wisconsin says, no, every American has a constitutional right not to accept that money and to go ahead on their own. 
Isn't it true that the only two candidates who have been able to run for President without accepting the Federal money and mount anything approaching a worthwhile campaign are Ross Perot and Steve Forbes, both of whom approach billionaire status? Is that a correct summary of what the Presidential system that is constitutional has brought us to?

Mr. BENNETT. As I said at the outset, it demonstrates just how ridiculous it is for the Federal Government to get into the business of determining who can spend what and for how much in a constitutional way. You end up so contorted and distorted in your attempt to get around the obvious constitutional ban on this kind of nonsense that you create a circumstance that virtually no one can defend on practical grounds: More money going for a candidate in New Jersey than for a candidate in New York, different rules applying to a candidate in Delaware than apply to a candidate in Wyoming. 
All of this is voluntary, but it becomes voluntary because there is a huge bribe out there waiting for you if you agree to give up your constitutional rights. I think it is absurd. 
I was delighted over the weekend to read the comments of George Will, who said that this debate is one of the most fundamental we have had since the founding of the Republic. I had not thought to put McCain-Feingold in the same fashion that George Will does, but he describes it as similar to the speech codes adopted in many of our campuses, the excesses of the 1950's in the days of Joseph McCarthy, the 1920's speech activity, the Alien and Sedition Acts, but he says all of those are less significant in their threat to a fundamental liberty than this one because they came and went in the frenzy of the day. This one would leave behind a huge Federal bureaucracy aimed at producing exactly the kind of results the Senator from Kentucky is talking about, laying out that this candidate in this State can spend this much, and as soon as he steps across the State line, if he decided to run in another State, then the rules would change, the limits would change, the circumstances would change. 
That kind of Federal bureaucracy intruding itself into the campaign even if it were through some tortuous method of gaining consent on the part of those involved, constitutionally it remains clearly violative of the spirit of the first amendment, if not the specific letter. I believe the courts would strike it down.

Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, during the hearings we have held in the Governmental Affairs Committee there have been a number of headline-grabbing witnesses who have appeared before us. Unfortunately, when we got to the phase of the hearings where we were discussing this issue, the television cameras all left the room and the press tables all became vacant. 
In that atmosphere I was able to say some things that I maybe wouldn't have otherwise said because I knew no one would say anything. It is a bit like the question, When a tree falls in the forest and nobody is there to hear it does it make any sound? 
But there was one witness that appeared who made a lot of sound and whose statements are so apropos I have taken the floor to read most of them into the Record. His full statement is available to anyone who wants to go into the committee. I will not take the time to read the full statement here, but for the Senators who participated in this debate I think hearing some of the comments this man made will be particularly enlightening. I am speaking of Curtis Gans, the director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. The advisory board of that committee includes people such as David Gergen, Peter Hart, Abigail McCarthy, Cyrus Vance, former Secretary of State, Ted Van Dyk, Anne Wexler, Richard Whalen, and a number of others whose names I don't recognize but I am sure are equally distinguished. 
Mr. Gans points out he has been the director of this nonpartisan nonprofit committee for 21 years, engaged in the issues surrounding low and declining voter participation. That is his area of expertise. He has published publications, organized commissions, testified before Congress, engaged in this activity for a long period of time. 
With my apologies for quoting so much, I will get into the details of Mr. Gans' testimony because, as I said, I think it is particularly enlightening. 
I am now quoting from Mr. Gans:  
Mr. Chairman, with all respect to this committee's good work and the chairman's good intentions, I would like to suggest a few verities: that campaign finance is the most overblown issue in American politics, that the problems we face today in campaign finance are the products of bad law passed in 1971 and 1974 and the severability contained in that law and not the result of the Buckley versus Valeo decision; that there are serious problems in the present methods of financing campaigns, but that they are built into the incentive structure current law creates; that, in attempting to remedy the existing problems deliberations should be guided by the principle of `Do No Harm,' (that we have already seen the unintended consequences of good intentions) and that it should proceed incrementally and with true bipartisanship; and that the case for such incremental reform can be done without the gross vilification of individual leaders or the system as a whole which is both inaccurate and does a profound disservice by undermining--perhaps more than the laws themselves--public faith in the political process. 
Mr. Gans goes on in another place in his testimony: 
I think the American people have long known that people give money for essentially four reasons: 
1. That they are friends with the candidate or officeholder. 
2. That the candidate or officeholder has views congruent to the giver on one or more key issues. 
3. That the opponent has views which are anathema on one or more key issues. 
4. To gain access to the candidate/officeholder to express one's interest and point of view. 
I don't believe that the American people think that Representative . . . 
He names the Member of the other body. is a liberal because he gets liberal money, or that . . . 
He names another Member of the other body. is a conservative because he gets conservative money. 
I do believe they understand that access is different from influence--even if money buys access. I think they know that access to a leader comes from several different sources--personal friendship, long-time loyalty, fame, grassroots citizens organization and money, and that money does not speak with one voice. I think the American people know--as their responses to surveys about their own Congresspersons and Senators (the ones with whom they have had first-hand experience)--that the overwhelming majority of leaders are honorable leaders who arrive at public policy decisions on a basis other than contributions. And that if there is cynicism about the profession as a whole, it is not because of its actions, but because they have been vilified by those who seek reform. 
Later on in his statement, Mr. Gans gives what I find to be two fascinating questions: 
I am fond of asking the question: `What do Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Federal aid to education, the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Council on Environmental Quality have in common?' 
The answer is that they were all enacted and created when individuals could give unlimited and undisclosed amounts of money to candidates, often in unmarked paper bags, and when the Republican party usually enjoyed a 3-1 spending advantage over the Democrats. (As one staff member of this committee has pointed out, it should also be noted that the Hatch and Taft-Hartley Acts were also enacted in this period, lest the Republicans think reform would be a good thing for their policy ends.) 
What this incandescently shows us is that major public policy is a matter of leadership and citizen consensus rather than campaign cash. 
Mr. Gans goes on in his second question, equally compelling in my opinion: 
I am also fond of asking a second question, `What do Michael Huffington, Clayton Williams, Rudy Boschwitz, Mark Dayton, Lew Lehrman, Jack Brooks, Guy VanderJagt, Steve Forbes and, if anyone remembers, John Connally, have in common?' 
The answer is that each and every one of them spent millions of dollars of their own money, outspent their opponents by as much as 5-1 and lost. 
When he gets to discussing our current problems, Mr. Gans has this to say. 
. . . campaign finance laws were enacted in 1971 and 1974, whose only beneficially durable features were the mandating of public disclosure of some of the money in politics, the provision for partial public financing of campaigns and the establishment of an agency, which for whatever its flaws, has attempted to do a decent job of disclosure and tracking and improving election law. 
Later, he says: 
That law were challenged and substantial parts of the law were overturned in Buckley. The Supreme Court ruled, and I believe rightly, not, as some would have us believe, that `money is speech,' but rather that money is necessary for speech to be heard. Accordingly, the Court ruled against spending limits--as inhibiting speech and competition (about which there is considerable evidence) unless such limits were truly voluntary and until there were compensatory benefits to insure that there would be a full and fair hearing of campaign speech. It overturned restrictions on the use of personal funds in campaigns. But it left stand, I think wrongly, the $1,000 contribution limits (to meet the `appearance of corruption,' and established a `bright line' of `express advocacy'--the specific advocacy to vote for or against a particular candidate, so named, as the only place in which the amount of money spent on such advocacy could be regulated. 
Because the law law was written so that it was severable--that the provisions which were not struck down--would remain in place, we emerged with an accident waiting to happen, a partial law for which evasion would prove not only likely, but perhaps necessary. We ended up with contribution limits that were constraining and subject to strict disclosure, hard money for both candidates and national parties which were severely restricted and subject to disclosure both on the contribution and expenditure level, soft money--to nonfederal party accounts and to nonprofit groups--which were unregulated and only partially disclosed. . . . The problems with the resulting system became evidence early. 
Mr. Gans goes on to give us a personal example that I found fascinating. He says:

Mr. BENNETT. I hesitate to intrude when he is in full cry because I don't like to be intruded on when I am in a full cry. But I am emboldened by the kind of words that my colleague offered at the beginning. 
This is a personal observation. I agree with the Senator absolutely. That ad should be identified; that it was clearly part of the campaign. I am not any more fooled than anybody else. However, we are driven to that kind of chicanery by the present law. 
My solution--and I am speaking clearly just for myself and not for anybody else on this side--would be to repeal the present law and allow the campaigns to go back to a degree of honesty. I do say to the Senator: I believe that under the present ruling of the Court the statement by the Senator from Kentucky is correct. The Court would rule that since the magic words were not in that ad it would in fact not be considered a campaign ad under the legal definition. 
I agree with the Senator. The legal definition is artificial and improper. 
But I would solve it in ways other than passing the McCain-Feingold. 
I thank my friend.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the opening statements made on this issue. I appreciate the sincerity of those who have made them. I wish to make this first personal point before I make some additional points. The Senator from Arizona said that there is only one purpose here, and that purpose is to enact fair and effective campaign finance reform. I wish to make it very clear that I accept that purpose on behalf of the Senator from Arizona, the Senator from Wisconsin, the Senator from Tennessee, or anyone else involved in this matter. I do not challenge for one moment their sincerity. Certainly we cannot challenge their earnestness. Certainly we cannot challenge their motives. I want it clearly understood that I have that kind of feeling about what they are doing. 
I want it equally understood that I think they are fundamentally wrong and that, in their effort to get to what they consider to be a sincere and proper goal, they could do irreparable damage to our Nation and to the fundamental freedoms about which I care just as passionately as they do. I hope they will grant to me the same sense of honor and integrity that I am more than willing to grant to them, and that we will not get into the name-calling business of saying, if you oppose McCain-Feingold, you are somehow opposed to anything that is true and beautiful and worthwhile. 
I believe McCain-Feingold cuts at some of the most fundamental freedoms we have in this country, and I am going to outline that. I want everybody to understand that I am not acting because I believe something sinister or improper is going on here. 
As to the second point, before I go into some of the specifics I want to talk about, I would say to Senator Feingold, I think you ought to meet Senator McCain. From the notes I have made in this morning's debate, Senator Feingold said, if I quote him correctly, `No form of expression will be prohibited,' just after Senator McCain said, `No ad mentioning the name of a candidate will be allowed in the last 60 days of the campaign.' 
I do not find those two statements coinciding with each other. Indeed, the Senator from Arizona, in his summary of the things that would be allowed and would not be allowed, gave us a whole list of that which would be allowed to take place and that which would be prevented. To me, we are debating ways in which Government power will be marshaled to control legitimate speech, and we are saying, with all of the intensity of middle-aged theologians debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, that this will be allowed and that will not; this is permissive but that is not; 60 days is legitimate but 61 is not, back and forth, in and out on all of these particulars. We are going to marshal the full power of the Federal Government of the United States of America and focus that power like a laser beam on this particular ad, this particular contribution, this particular activity, all in the name of campaign finance reform. 
Mr. President, to me marshaling Government power to regulate what can and cannot be said in another context is called censorship. And marshaling the power of the Federal Government to censor political speech is not an activity in which I would lightly engage. 
The statement was made by the minority leader that Buckley versus Valeo was a close call; it was only 5 to 4. On the issue of whether or not spending money in campaigns represented protected speech under the first amendment, Buckley versus Valeo was 9 to nothing. And in every subsequent decision from that time forward, the Court has 
reemphasized that. Let us understand that. We are talking about the most fundamental political right that we have in this country, the right of free debate and speech in a political campaign. I want to lay that down as the fundamental predicate, when we get into the details of this, when we argue with the Senator from Arizona about what is and what is not wise and proper, we are talking about tinkering with the fundamental right of Americans to engage in robust political activity. We should tread on this ground very, very carefully. I think that is why the Supreme Court slapped down the first attempt to tread on this ground by such an overwhelming margin. 
Now, some specifics. The Senator from Arizona laid down the three principles that we are going to see preserved in the substitute bill to McCain-Feingold, S. 25. I am delighted there will be a substitute bill to S. 25. 
I have gone through S. 25 reading it personally. If ever there were a maze of regulations subject to misinterpretation and reinterpretation by bureaucrats enforcing them, this is the maze. 
This morning on this floor we had a series of speeches regarding the IRS and how the Tax Code is used and abused with ordinary citizens. I wonder what the IRS or regulators like those who work for the IRS would do with the provisions of S. 25? Saying, well, you could have run that ad, but you can't run this ad; you could have had this guide, but you can't do that guide; this was OK last Tuesday, but it is not OK on Thursday. 
Now, the fundamental assumption here underlying what we are hearing is that money is the only factor in determining the outcome of an election, and that if we can only level the playing field, which we hear over and over again, in terms of money, then we will have fair elections. 
Well, when we raise the issue of people who defeat incumbents without having as much money as incumbents have, we are told always, well, that is the exception that proves the rule. That is an aberration. That is not the way things normally happen; incumbents normally win. 
Yes, incumbents do normally win. And they normally win for a whole series of reasons, not necessarily connected with money. 
I am interested that Senator Feingold is raising this issue when he is one of the challengers who defeated an incumbent in order to get here. And, while I will not pretend to be an expert on his campaign, it's my understanding that he spent less than his incumbent opponent in order to do it, thus demonstrating that maybe the ability to communicate better than your opponent has something to do with who wins. Maybe the ability to write a smarter ad than your opponent does may have something to do with who wins. Maybe even having a more powerful message than your opponent has something to do with who wins. Or maybe which State you live in, whether it be predominantly Republican or Democrat, in terms of the leanings of the voters in the first place, has something to do with who wins. It is not necessarily money as the only ingredient in what happens. 
All of us here, because we live in the beltway circumstance, saw the ad campaign that went on in the senatorial race in Virginia in 1996. You couldn't avoid it if you lived anywhere in the Washington area for any period of time. Mark Warner spent something like $25 million trying to defeat Senator John Warner. He didn't succeed. He outspent him overwhelmingly. What advantages did John Warner have to fight off that kind of money barrage as an incumbent? There are those here who will say his only advantage was, as an incumbent, he could raise more money. Clearly he could not raise more money. There is not enough money in the world to warrant raising more money than Mark Warner spent in that race. 
I know my opponent in the primary race in Utah outspent me 3 to 1. He spent $6.2 million in a primary in Utah. When I say there isn't enough money--to spend more money, he was buying ads on Saturday morning cartoons. He had run out of places to spend it. 
Yes, there are finite limits. I think Mark Warner reached those finite limits in Virginia. Why didn't he defeat John Warner if he had that kind of money advantage? John Warner had 18 years of service in the U.S. Senate, which means 18 years of answering phone calls, sending letters, attending bar mitzvahs, going to Rotary Clubs. John Warner was known as the most popular politician of either party in the State of Virginia. That is a fairly significant advantage for an incumbent to have, regardless of money. 
John Warner has spent 18 years with name recognition against somebody of whom no one had ever heard. Yes, money buys name recognition. An incumbent doesn't have to spend any money to buy name recognition. That is a significant advantage. 
John Warner had a staff. I can give that example. I didn't run against an incumbent Senator but I ran against an incumbent Congressman who had a congressional staff. When the Congressman wanted to come to Washington to attend a fundraiser with a PAC group, who paid for it? The taxpayer, because it was a trip back and forth from his congressional district to the Capitol. When I came to Washington challenging him, trying to hold a fundraiser among the PAC's, who paid for it? My campaign paid for it. I had to raise that money. It put us on a level playing field. Both have the same amount of money, I don't get to come to the fundraiser but my opponent does because he's an incumbent. 
When my opponent put out a press release accusing me of committing a crime, which he did--actually, that was one of the good things about my campaign. Everybody thought he had lost his mind, and I got some extra votes as a result of it. Nonetheless, when my opponent put out the press release accusing me of a crime, who prepared it? His press secretary. Who paid the salary of the press secretary? The taxpayers. He was an incumbent. He is entitled to a staff. 
When my press people went to the press conference to say, `No, Bob Bennett did not commit that crime,' who paid their salary? My 
campaign did. So let's put him on a level playing field. He gets his staff paid for as an incumbent by the taxpayers. I, as a challenger, don't get my staff paid for. I have to raise the money. 
Incumbents have all kinds of advantages that have nothing to do with money. They also, sometimes, have some disadvantages that have nothing to do with money. We have the example--perhaps an extreme one but let's use an extreme one to make a point--back in the 1994 election, Mike Synar, the Congressman from Oklahoma, lost his primary. He spent $325,000. His opponent spent less than $10,000. His opponent's campaign consisted entirely of distributing his business card, sticking it under windshields in parking lots, and written on the back of the business card was the phrase, `Not the incumbent.' And he beat the incumbent. The incumbent in that circumstance had a $325,000 to, let's say, $10,000 money advantage; he had the disadvantage of a voting record that members of his particular congressional district didn't like. 
We cannot let ourselves get into this notion that money is the only factor and then write laws based on that assumption because, if we do, we will do violence to the Constitution and freedom of speech. 
Now, let me go down the three points that the Senator from Arizona made, as the core points of McCain-Feingold and the proposed change that we will have. First, he said it must be bipartisan. I will grant him that. McCain-Feingold will damage both parties equally, damage the process for everybody. It doesn't play favorites. It will be equally bad. 
Second, he says we must lessen the amount of money overall in campaigns. If he had listened to the expert testimony that we have had in the Governmental Affairs Committee this last week, he would find that even people who support McCain-Feingold, who come out of the academic community and commented on this, told us you cannot control the amount of money in political campaigns. The Senator from Kentucky has said, `Controlling political money is like putting a rock on Jello. You put it on one place and it squeezes out another.' And these experts said the same thing. They said political money has been in the process ever since George Washington was President and will always be in the process, and we have had a continuing process of simply trying to control it. But you are not going to eliminate it. It is always going to be with you.

Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend from Massachusetts for an example that I think makes my point. You made the decision, your opponent made the decision, and you are in control in this circumstance of the amount of money that is spent. What McCain-Feingold does is take that decision out of your hands and 
put it in the hands of the bureaucracy. 
When I say you can't control the amount of money, I should be more specific. You can't control it by Government fiat. You certainly can control it in terms of what happens in your own campaign, just as I made the decision in my campaign that there would be no negative ads. I refused to run any ads attacking my opponent. But I would oppose any Government rule that would say to me I could not make a different decision if I wanted to. And I would oppose any Government regulation that would say that you and Governor Weld could not have made that decision on the basis that you wanted to, instead of there being more particulars that would be imposed upon you by Federal law that would say, `Well, you have come fairly close but we are going to put this regulation and that regulation on top of the decision that the two of you jointly made.' 
I applaud you for what you did. I think every campaign would be better off if the candidates could sit down in advance and make that kind of a deal. But I want every deal to be a separate deal, made by separate candidates, rather than dictated from this Chamber.

<TEXT>
Mr. BENNETT. May I respond to my friend, and then I see the Senator from Kentucky wants to get into this. 
In the first place, I think we ought to wait for some experience from these cities and States as to what happens before we rush to Federal legislation on the basis of the bills that they have passed. I think it is salutary that the States are being used as a lab, to see what works and what does not. I don't know that there has been any constitutional challenge to any one of these statutes yet. I would expect there would be. And I would like to have the reasoning of the courts before us before I rush to Federal legislation. Then, as I said, I would like to have some on-the-ground experience to see how it really works. 
If I may give a separate kind of example, in the State of Utah we allow corporate contributions for statewide races--Governor, attorney general, Lieutenant Governor, what have you. There has not been a hint of scandal. There is no outcry to stop that. And we have had a series of outstanding Governors, both Democrats as well as Republicans, every one of whom has been a man of highest rectitude. 
So, if you are going to look for a local example of something that works, you could say, based on my State's experience, that we ought to open the whole thing up and let corporate contributions come in as well as individual contributions. The one thing that we do have in Utah that has made it work is full and complete disclosure so that everybody knows that, if the Utah Power and Light Company has given to X campaign, that is on the public record. And when the Governor goes to deal with utility regulation, everybody knows how much the power company gave him.

Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend from Kentucky for that additional information. Let me go back to the three points made by the Senator from Arizona: Must be bipartisan--I agree, this is bipartisan. Two, must lessen the amount of money overall in politics--if the experts that have testified before our committee are correct, and I believe they are, in a free society that is simply an impossible goal. You can disclose it, and I think we should; you should shine as much light, sunshine, exposure as you can, and I think we should. You should do things about getting people better informed of what is going on, and I think we should. 
I am perfectly willing to talk about amending the current laws to go in that direction. But you should not kid yourself that in a free society, somehow Government can control the total amount of money people want to spend in political advocacy. 
So we come to the third principle, laid down by the Senator from Arizona, that there must be a meaningful campaign finance reform, which is we must level the playing field between challenger and incumbent. We must help the challenger. 
I have already made the point, and will make it again, that the best way you can help the challenger in the field of money is to allow the challenger to raise more money than the incumbent. If you level the playing field and say to the challenger--my own example again repeated--you cannot raise any more money than the incumbent, but the incumbent starts out with all of the name recognition, all of the years of going to Rotary Clubs and bar mitzvahs, all of the staff paid for by the taxpayer available to him, all of the record of answering letters and doing favors and congressional constituent service, and you can't spend any more to try to overcome that advantage in the name of campaign finance reform, you have decapitated the challenger and guaranteed that the incumbent is going to get reelected in virtually every circumstance.

Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend from Kentucky for that additional information about this particular issue. 
Mr. President, I want to end as I began by expressing my deep concern over this whole attempt to tiptoe into the area of free expression in a free society regarding political activity and political speech. I know it is frustrating to see large amounts of money come into a campaign. I have heard my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, tell of his personal experience when Buckley versus Valeo was handed down, where he was in a Senate race with the man who became Senator Heinz. The story ends well because Senator Specter became Senator Specter as well, but not in that race. 
He, Senator Specter, was running the campaign. There were spending limits. Buckley versus Valeo struck those limits down in terms of an individual American being allowed to spend whatever amount of money he wanted to spend in expressing his own point of view. As Senator Specter said, `Senator Heinz had virtually unlimited resources and I did not. And Senator Heinz put those resources into the race and I was prohibited.' 
`Now,' says Senator Specter, `my brother had enough money to fund my campaign, but my brother was forbidden to put that money into the campaign and, therefore, I was at an unfair disadvantage to John Heinz.' 
My solution to that would be let his brother put the money in the campaign. If we are going to level the playing field, and Heinz has x amount of money that he can put in and Senator Specter has a brother who has x amount of money he can put in, in the spirit of the decision just described by the Senator from Kentucky, I would have no problem with saying, OK, let Senator Specter's brother put it in, let's level the playing field by letting both sides spend. 
Now, if Senator Specter's brother put it in, it darn well better be disclosed where he got the money, where it came from and 
let people ask the question: What did Arlen Specter's brother expect to get in return if Arlen Specter took enough money from him to match John Heinz? 
Or to put it in a more contemporary circumstance, we see in the Presidential situation where we have these kinds of limits, in this last election, Jack Kemp wanted to run for President. Those of us who know Jack and can read his body language could tell he was anxious to run for President. He looked at the fundraising problem that he faced under the present limitations, and he said, `I can't physically do it. I have to go out and raise this much money at $1,000 apiece. I can't physically stand the wear and tear.' 
Sitting at Jack Kemp's elbow, figuratively, was somebody who believed in everything Jack Kemp believed in. His name is Steve Forbes. Steve Forbes could have funded a Kemp campaign for President without noticing it. But under the circumstances in which we currently are operating, Steve Forbes is forbidden to do that. So, ultimately, what did he do? He ran for President himself. At some point in this debate, I will have some comments about that, too, and what happened with that injection of money coming from Steve Forbes. 
But wouldn't it be a better kind of system if Steve Forbes could say, `Jack, you're better known than I am, you have more experience in this arena than I do, you probably have a better chance of making it, you represent the same ideas I feel strongly about, here's a check for $15 million; go to it, Jack.' 
The first question that Jack would have been asked is, `What did you promise Steve Forbes in order to get $15 million?' And that might be a very embarrassing question for Jack to answer. Indeed, Jack might say, `Steve, I'm not going to take your money because I don't want to have to answer that question.' But that is the kind of openness and honesty that I think would make the system a whole lot better than what we are talking about here.

Mr. BENNETT. Well, the assumption is that it would be an advantage to incumbents because it would give them freedom from criticism by an outside group in that period. My sense of smell tells me the outside group would, even under McCain-Feingold, probably find some way to try to get around that. 
For example, as I understand the Senator from Arizona, he said there can be no criticism by name of a candidate, so perhaps the outside group would say, `The Congressman from the Third Congressional District of Utah is terrible, but we didn't name him.'

Mr. BENNETT. I believe the Senator is partly right. I think either that would be the likelihood, that a group would be deprived of its right to exercise free speech in that area, or another equally likely outcome, in my view, is that the outcry from the group over the injunction would be sufficiently significant in the press that it would override any discussion of substantive issues from that point forward and the last 60 days of the campaign would be spent bickering over whether or not the group really should or should not have had that right. Either way, it distorts the political dialog in a way I find corrosive and damaging to the intent of the Constitution.

Mr. BENNETT. I respond to my friend from Massachusetts by saying that, of course, the country would be better off if all of those things happened. There is no reason whatsoever to believe that the prohibitions of one kind of expression that are outlined in McCain-Feingold would automatically produce all of the other more beneficial kinds of expression that the Senator from Massachusetts has described. 
There is no credible cause-and-effect relationship between the two. We are back to the fundamental point that I am trying to make in this entire presentation, which is, we are talking about ways in which the Government will regulate speech. And that, in any other context, is called censorship. And I am opposed to it. 
Now, I must go back to the Senator from Kentucky.

Mr. BENNETT. I can respond to the two questions by my friend from Massachusetts. 
Yes; there is clearly. The answer to his first one, an attempt to define the difference between issue advocacy and express advocacy in terms of a candidate, how that would play out under McCain-Feingold in terms of the 60-day rule is still very troubling to me and, in my view, does indeed cross over the line and become censorship. 
Now, as to his second question, this is a matter of political 
experience. Obviously, every Member of this Chamber has his or her own political experience to draw back on. I will only comment in terms of my own, that I am known in Utah as a politician who believes perhaps more strongly than any other in the importance of grassroots organization. 
I am currently spending all the money that I am currently raising in building such an organization. Some of the people who work for the Senator from Kentucky under the other hat he wears as chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee are a little disturbed that I do not have more money left in the coffers from the amount I have raised, and where has its gone? 
It is going right now into building a precinct-by-precinct, voting-district-by-voting-district campaign organization so that if I have no money for television, I have at least one person for every 10 or 20 households who will go out and knock on doors on my behalf. I am building that organization right now. I believe in that fundamentally. 
However, my personal experience says that I cannot energize these folks without some ads on television. I can give them all the letters, I can give them all the phone calls, I can tell them all how wonderful they are, but until they see something on the screen, they are not convinced I am a serious candidate.

<DOCNO>105-bennett-ut-22-19970926</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. BENNETT. If I may finish. 
At the same time, my experience in the last campaign is that when there were ads attacking me, I found that the general public did not pay any attention to them and did not care. But my own troops all panicked until I was able to get back on television and answer those ads. And they heaved a gigantic sigh of relief. 
By the same token, I am told by my opponent's people--Utah is a small enough State that virtually all the politicians talk to each other, particularly when the campaign is over--that it was one of my ads puncturing my opponent's attack on me that took all the starch out of their door-to-door grassroots organization. 
The former chairman of the Democratic State committee said, `I was shaving in the morning, feeling good about the campaign. We were closing the gap on you. Our attacks were taking hold. I had the radio on and heard your voice come on on the radio. At the end of 60 seconds, I said, `It's all over. He has just punctured our balloon. There's no way we can get anybody going again.' 
So, these things play hand in hand. Everyone has his or her own experience in it. We come back to the basic posture that I took. We, as candidates, should be in charge of our campaigns. We, as candidates, should make the decision as to what is said, when it is said, how it is said. We should make the decision whether we use grassroots or television or radio or billboards or handbills or newspapers. 
Those around us who want to get into it should be free to make their own decisions in that regard. The heavy hand of the Federal Government should not be in that circumstance saying, `This group can; that group cannot. And 61 days is OK; 60 days is not. The public is not smart enough to sort through all of this and make their own decisions. We must regulate how the money is raised. We must regulate how it is spent.' 
I am perfectly content to have the Federal Government regulate from whom it is raised. I think the ban we have had on corporate contributions since Mark Hannah's days is legitimate. In terms of direct contributions to candidates, I think that is a legitimate restriction which we have had in this country for longer than I am old. I have no problem with that. 
I am perfectly willing to have the Federal Government involved in requiring full disclosure so that everybody knows if I take money from Fred Thompson, I am going to have to answer for that, that everybody knows what I am doing. I have no problem with that. 
But I have serious, serious fundamental problems, in terms of my devotion to the Constitution, people who know me know on the floor how strongly I feel about this--I think we are treading on very, very sacred ground when we say the Federal Government is 
going to start to make these kinds of decisions for candidates and groups and ordinary Americans, and it is going to do it in a way that carries the full punitive power of the Federal Government behind it.

<TEXT>
Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I am pleased to report that the House and Senate conferees reached an agreement on funding for the legislative branch for the fiscal year 1998. The agreement we reached provides for total spending of slightly under $2.5 billion--an increase of 2 percent over the fiscal year 1997 level and a decrease of 6 percent from the President's budget. 
Before we begin, I would like to state for the record that the issue of pay for Members of Congress is not in this bill. 
However, there were significant differences in the amount of funding in the House and Senate bills. The House wanted to limit the growth of the legislative branch to the fiscal year 1997 level exclusive of Senate items. The Senate had made a commitment to the General Accounting Office--a commitment which was made when Senator Mack chaired this subcommittee and oversaw a 25-percent reduction in GAO. This was a 25-percent reduction in their budget and a 33-percent reduction in staff. I participated in the decision to reduce the agency, and I was also a party to the Senate's commitment to stabilize the agency once it made the reduction. Senator Dorgan shared my desire to meet that commitment. 
I want to thank Senator Dorgan for his hard work, and interest in the bill. It was only with his strong support that we were able to provide adequate funding--a $7 million increase in direct appropriations plus and increase of $1.5 million in offsetting receipts over the fiscal year 1997 level. 
The Federal Government will spend almost $1.7 trillion next year. The legislative branch has the responsibility to oversee this budget and make sure that taxpayer funds are being spent wisely. GAO is responsible for identifying wasteful Federal spending and recommending ways in which we can save billions of dollars. This past year GAO has identified $6 billion in measurable savings in the Federal Government. That does not include other savings which cannot be measured in dollars--such as better organization, ways in which an agency can better serve taxpayers, etc. For every $1 appropriated to GAO, they have identified $50 savings. This is an agency which is worth the investment. 
Maintenance was another issue in this bill. I believe strongly in the need to invest in maintenance. Saving a small amount of money now on maintenance will only result in higher costs in the future. 
I learned in business that if you do not properly maintain your building and equipment you will soon find yourself spending much more money to replace those items which have crumbled or can no longer function. There are a number of maintenance and security items which the Senate identified as priorities such as, repairs to the Library of Congress roof, investment in the Capitol powerplant, and Capitol security. 
Funding for the Joint Committee on Taxation was also an issue. The Senate conferees agreed at the strong urging of the House conferees to split the difference between the House and Senate bills resulting in an increase of $91,500 over the Senate bill. For many years now the Joint Committee on Taxation has operated as an extension of the Finance and Ways and Means committees. Members of Congress who are not members of those committees have not been able to get revenue estimates for their proposals. Without the revenue estimates, it is almost impossible to go to the floor to offer an amendment to a tax bill. 
We have been assured by the House that Congressman Archer--the current chairman of the Joint Committee on Taxation is committed to working harder to provide to Senators and Representatives revenue estimates in a timely fashion. It is our intent to ensure that the Joint Committee on Taxation assists all Members of Congress. Included in the statement of managers on page 26 of the conference report is language identifying the scope of the assistance we expect the Joint Committee to provide to Members. 
During the course of the next year, I would like to hear from my colleagues if they are finding the Joint Committee to be helpful. 
In reaching this agreement, the Senate came down $37 million in budget authority and the House went up $24 million. I am comfortable that the legislative branch will be able to meet its oversight responsibilities with the funding provided in this agreement. 
Again, I would like to thank Senator Dorgan as the ranking member for his hard work on reaching this agreement. In addition, I would like to thank Senator Steven, Senator Craig and Senator Boxer for their assistance on the subcommittee as well as the following staff: Christine Ciccone, Jim English, Mary Dewald, Mary Hawkins, Chuck Turner, and Chip Yost, for their superior work. 
I thank my colleagues in advance for their support of the conference report.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I find this debate very illuminating, and I congratulate the Senator from Arizona in bringing an issue to the attention of the Senate that I for one was not aware of. I do not treat lightly the conclusions of the Association for Public Administration who have made their examination of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial. I think it deserves airing. 
I think the deficiencies that are identified in that report should be discussed, and at some point I may find myself convinced to follow the Senator from Arizona down this particular road if in fact there is not a significant change that would allow at least some objective observers to come to the conclusion that the Memorial was more fittingly fulfilling its mission than apparently it is now. 
Having said that, I find that I will vote with my subcommittee chairman on this issue for the following reason, based on my own experience in terminating longstanding organizations. 
When the Republicans took control of the Senate, I found myself on the subcommittee for the legislative branch, chaired by the Senator from Florida, [Mr. Mack], and the two of us as a team began to look around the legislative branch to see what there was that we might either cut back or eliminate because it was not performing properly. 
We focused in on the Office of Technology Assistance, OTA, and, as we spent time looking at OTA, we found that it did a number of very good things. We also found that it was duplicative of a number of very good things that had been done other places in the Government. 
I was lobbied about as hard on that issue as any issue I can think of by Members, not only of this body, including the Senator who is now the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, but also Members of the other body who came at me and said, `we must hang on to the OTA for all of these good reasons.' 
Senator Mack and I agonized over this decision for a long period of time. We examined the record of the OTA. We had the leadership of the OTA come before the subcommittee and we held open hearings, we presented to them our concerns and we gave them every opportunity to respond. Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that the OTA was, indeed, duplicative of that which was being done in the Library of Congress, particularly the Congressional Reference Service, and however good its performance was, we decided that it was redundant and we voted, ultimately, to shut it down. 
When you take something that has been part of America as long as the Woodrow Wilson Memorial has been, I think you owe it the same kind of opportunity to defend itself through hearings and examinations if, indeed, you are determined to kill it. As a member of the subcommittee before which such hearings would be held, I do not recall that the subject has ever come up prior to the introduction of this matter on the floor. 
Much as I sympathize with and react to the need for more money in the Indian gang program, and if we can find more money I am more than sympathetic to finding an offset to make it happen, I am reluctant on the basis of a debate on the floor--without a hearing, without an opportunity for these people to come defend themselves, to lay out exactly what they are doing in a full hearing circumstance where they are notified sufficiently in advance and are able to marshal their arguments and their activities--to react to the debate on the floor saying, `All right, this sounds more logical as a priority than that and so I will vote to eliminate an agency that has been around for, what, 30 years?' 
So, for all of my sympathy with my friend from Arizona, and I am reluctant to oppose him because he is usually right and he is very thoughtful and he does not give knee-jerk reactions to these things, I find that I will be with my subcommittee chairman in saying that this is not the kind of thing to do at this late hour in this bill with an amendment on the floor. 
I would say to my friend from Arizona, if in the next appropriations cycle, which will be upon us so rapidly we will not be able to remember how short the time was, he wants to raise this in the subcommittee, I would support the actions of the subcommittee in having a hearing on this and letting the people from the Woodrow Wilson Memorial come in and respond to the charges that have been made against them by the responsible organization that has examined them. And I will keep an open mind in that circumstance. But I reluctantly part company with my friend from Arizona in this circumstance and at this time, because I do not think it is fair to the people who are involved in the Woodrow Wilson Memorial for the Senate to make this kind of a decision in this rapid circumstance. 
So, I intend to be with my subcommittee chairman and intend to vote to keep the bill as it is in this regard.

I want to clarify the intent of this amendment which has been accepted by the Managers of the bill. 
The language I have included provides $800,000 to the Forest Service to undertake the preliminary design and engineering of a road connecting the Trappers Loop (SR 167) and Snowbasin, the site of the 2002 Winter Olympics Downhill and Super `G' ski racing events. This road is identified in their Master Plan as a Phase I project referenced in Public Law 104-333, Section 304.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to raise an issue with the Chairman as we conclude the debate on the Interior Appropriations bill. I had intended offered an amendment on behalf of myself and Senators Thomas and Murkowski to instruct the various agencies of the Department of the Interior to prepare a report to the committee regarding the instances in which they have entered into InterAgency Service Agreements with other Federal agencies or into agreements with State and local governments on foreign entities. Unfortunately, we have been unable to reach agreement among members of the committee on the feasibility and scope of this amendment. I am disappointed with this development and I will not offer this amendment this evening. 
As the Chairman well knows, there are a number of architectural, engineering, geological mapping and even aircraft services that are contracted out by the various agencies within the Department of the Interior. I simply would like to get a sense of the impact on private engineering and consulting firms when agencies enter into agreements or contract for services within. I believe the information would have been valuable to the committee. It would help the committee recognize opportunities to save money by using the private sector more often and it will help redirect agencies toward their core governmental missions. While I will not offer this amendment, I intend to continue to pursue this information. I ask the Chairman if he would be also be interested in exploring this issue further?

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the chairman knows, the Forest Service recently completed the consolidation of the Intermountain and Rocky Mountain Research Stations in Fort Collins Colorado. I had some serious reservations with this consolidation, but in the interest of reducing the federal budget, I reluctantly agreed to allow the consolidation to proceed. Allow me to share with my colleagues what some of those concerns were. 
I was concerned that the proposed merger would actually produce the cost savings promised by the Forest Service. I was further concerned that any administrative savings would be offset by increased travel costs of staff traveling to Fort Collins. And since the consolidated center would be responsible for providing research for approximately 60 percent of the nation's forest lands, I was particularly concerned that the new center would have the ability to provide quality services to my constituents once consolidation removed the administrative process one step further from Utah. Finally, I was most concerned that the employees currently stationed in Utah would be jeopardized by consolidation. While I received numerous assurances that no positions will be eliminated in Utah due to consolidation, it was still unclear that the employees based in Utah would continue to have substantive research responsibilities. 
As I mentioned, despite these reservations, I reluctantly concluded that the merger should proceed. I sought your assurance that the Committee would revisit the consolidation next year to determine if the promised benefits and savings have indeed been realized. If these savings have not been met, I requested that the committee take the appropriate action to rectify the situation. Is it still the Chairman's intent to revisit the consolidation?

Mr. BENNETT. I thank the distinguished Chairman, Senator Gorton, for his support on a matter of particular importance to the Utah Navajo population of San Juan County. The issue involves the Montezuma Creek Health Clinic in Montezuma Creek, UT. 
For nearly 3 years, my colleague Senator Hatch and I have worked together to improve the delivery of health care services to the residents of San Juan County. This area is located in an extremely remote part of southeastern Utah and is the home of approximately 6,000 Navajos. The Montezuma Creek Clinic is very important to this rural community. However, the existing facility is in extremely poor condition and has undergone numerous repairs. The clinic comprises a patchwork of a mobile trailer connected to a permanent structure which is approximately 40 years old. 
In an effort to make improvements to the clinic, the committee provided $100,000 for planning and renovation of the existing structure. These funds will be matched by the State of Utah and the Utah Navajo Trust Fund that collectively will provide at least $300,000 for renovation of the facility. However, I do have a question for the Chairman regarding the intent of the committee report language with respect to how these funds can be spent.

Mr. BENNETT. The committee report language on page 98 states: `The Committee does not intend for any of these funds to be used for facility or program [expansion], but rather, for improvement of existing conditions.' My concern is over the word `expansion.' As a practical matter, the renovation of the facility may result in an expansion of the overall structure. This is especially apparent since the clinic is partially housed in a temporary structure and replacing it may, in fact, increase the overall square footage of the clinic. They clinic's staff also informs me there is a critical need to increase the size of the emergency room as well as add additional examination rooms in order to handle the current heavy caseload. Moreover, in order to comply with Federal and State building codes, some expansion of the facility will be needed. Clearly, these measures are designed to accommodate existing services and, as such, should not be viewed as an expansion per se.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to discuss briefly the technical corrections made in this bill to Section 116 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1997. I wish to point out to my colleagues that the original language was intended to ratify the State of Utah's legislative decision to allocate all funds generated by two federal land grants for a miner's hospital to the University of Utah in Salt Lake City for construction and support of a physical rehabilitation center. However, the original language inadvertently failed to include the statutory citation of the first of the two land grants for a miner's hospital. The technical amendments correct this omission, clarifying Congress' ratification of the Utah legislature's actions with respect to funds generated from miners' hospital land grants in both 1894 and 1929.

In the Utah Enabling Act, Congress granted the new State of Utah the right to select 50,000 acres of unappropriated federal lands for support of a miner's hospital for disabled miners. This 1894 grant was supplemented in 1929 by the grant of an additional 50,000 acres. In the late 1950's, the Utah legislature, with the support of the United Mineworkers of America, determined that accumulated funds from these two grants could best be used for the construction of a rehabilitation center that would serve both miners and the general public, rather than for the construction of a standalone hospital for the limited number of disabled miners in the state. This facility was constructed in 1965 and operated under the supervision of an advisory commission that included representatives of the State's mining unions. Subsequent state legislation has provided that ongoing funds generated from the two land grants are to be used to support this rehabilitation center.

Mr. BENNETT. Although the rehabilitation center was constructed with the support of the United Mineworkers of America, and has been open to use by the state's miners, some have questioned whether the Utah legislature was permitted under the Utah Enabling Act to use funds generated from these grants for a rehabilitation center open to both miners and the general public, as opposed to a facility open only to miners. Section 116 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1997 was intended as Congressional approval of the Utah legislature's actions with respect to use of accumulated and ongoing funds from these land grants. However, as I have noted, that Act referred only to the 1929 land grant and inadvertently failed to cite the 1894 land grant. These technical amendments correct that omission.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to the debate this afternoon, hearing interesting comments by the senior Senator from New York who, as he said, was present at the creation of the National Endowment, hearing now this eloquent and well-reasoned attack on the National Endowment by the junior Senator from Missouri, I find myself compelled to make a few comments from my own observation that I think will be a little different from some that we have heard. 
The Senator from Missouri talks about distorting the arts by virtue of Federal involvement and Federal subsidization. I can only say that is not what happens in my State. The main impact of the National Endowment for the Arts in the State of Utah has been to spread the arts; that is, make them available in areas in rural Utah and in poorer school districts where they would not be available otherwise. 
I find no distortion of the arts when a Federal grant goes to support the establishment of string quartets playing Bach and Beethoven and Mozart in areas where the people would not of themselves be able to sustain that kind of musical organization coming into their community. I don't think it is a distortion of good art to have this kind of spreading effect take place in the rural areas of our country. 
The Senator from Missouri makes the point that the vast amount of funding for the arts does, indeed, come from the private sector and that the amount of Federal contribution is so small as to be almost negligible, and he uses as his example the Metropolitan Opera. 
I would be happy to stipulate that if the National Endowment for the Arts went away, the Metropolitan Opera clearly would not. The Metropolitan Opera has the ability and the visibility to raise the money necessary to stay viable if the NEA were to disappear. 
But I stand here as a supporter of the NEA not because I love the Metropolitan Opera. I have been to a few performances. I think it is fine. I would go to more if I had the opportunity to be in New York more often. It is the Utah opera I am concerned about and, yes, the Utah opera would probably survive without support from the National Endowment for the Arts, but the fundraising efforts of those who put on and produce the Utah opera would be hampered. 
The National Endowment for the Arts is something like a `Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval' put on a local effort which allows the people who are running that local effort to then go out and do their fundraising and say, `You see what we have here is really a class operation. 
It's something worthy of your support, worthy of your private contributions. Look. It's good enough that the National Endowment for the Arts has put their seal of approval on it.' 
There are organizations in Utah that compete heavily for that seal of approval, not because they are involved in any distortion of what they are doing for purpose of seeking a Federal grant. 
The Utah Shakespearian Festival, for example, is not going to rewrite Shakespeare's plays just in an effort to get a Federal grant. But if they can get just enough seed money out of the National Endowment for the Arts that says to the people of southern Utah, `The Utah Shakespearian Festival has arrived, the Utah Shakespearian Festival is a first-class operation important enough to come to the attention of the National Endowment for the Arts,' they can then take that statement, along with what little amount of money that came along with it, and redouble their fundraising efforts to make sure that the Utah Shakespearian Festival will thrive. 
If I may, for just a moment, talk about the Utah Shakespearian Festival. It started as almost a class project at the College of Southern Utah in Cedar City for something to do during the summer. The founder of the festival would probably be a little more grandiose in his description of what he was getting started. This was roughly 30 years ago. It has grown to be one of the top five Shakespearian festivals in the country. People come from all over the country to attend it. And we have a marvelous, marvelous cultural experience in southern Utah as a result of its existence. 
Do they need money from the National Endowment for the Arts to survive? No, they do not. But they compete for the money as often as possible even though they are now a multimillion-dollar operation because they want the seal of approval that comes with the recognition by a centrally located Government agency that says, `You are quality. You have reached the point where you justify our kind of concern.' 
So those who are involved in the Shakespearian festival are grateful to me for speaking out in their behalf on behalf of the NEA. They are not seeking to distort what they do. They are not, as I say, rewriting Shakespeare's plays so some bureaucrat will love them. They are simply seeking the credibility that comes with association with the National Endowment for the Arts. 
I have talked to school districts around the State of Utah. In every case, they have the same story to tell. `If we can just get a few hundred dollars that has the NEA seal connected with it attached to our program, we can then raise far more easily the local money that we need.' 
No, the Utah Opera will not disappear. The Utah Shakespearian Festival will not disappear. The Utah Symphony will not disappear. Ballet West will not disappear. These are the leading arts organizations in Utah. But the school music programs will be hurt. The orchestras--they are not even big enough to be orchestras. The school musical activities that go on throughout rural Utah will be hurt if the NEA disappears. I think that is something to be concerned about. 
The Senator from Missouri says, well, the art in this country was just as good before the NEA as it has been afterward. I will not dispute that. I do not think the NEA has funded the creation of a new Beethoven or a new Michelangelo or a new Shakespeare. But it has made it possible for people to enjoy the productions of the old Michelangelo and Beethoven and 
Shakespeare in places where they had not had that opportunity previously. 
Of course, in my State there is a long history of public funding for the arts. This is, as people perhaps are beginning to get tired of being reminded, the sesquicentennial of the arrival of the Mormon pioneers in Salt Lake Valley; 150 years ago this group trekked across the plains, came in to found what is now the State of Utah. And there has been a great deal of national publicity about that, a great deal of discussion about the difficulties and hardships that they went through. 
In the context of this debate, I point out that within weeks after their arrival in the Salt Lake Valley, which was about as inhospitable a place as they could possibly have arrived, they put on a production of the `Merchant of Venice.' In their total poverty, having walked across the plains, now exhausted, faced with the possibility of starvation because they were not sure they could get their crops in in time to get any kind of a harvest before the winter set in, in a hostile environment where no crops had ever been grown before, they turned their attention to put on a production of the `Merchant of Venice'--public support for the arts. 
You say, `Oh, that was all private money.' Well, that is true. They did not have any Federal money. They did not have any money at all. And I am sure it was not the most wonderful production of the `Merchant of Venice' that has ever been put on. But they focused on the renewing, enriching circumstance of the arts. Brigham Young, when he arrived in the valley, planted his cane in the ground and said, `Here we will build a temple to our God,' establishing his first priority, which was worship in the manner that they saw fit. That is why they went there, because they were prevented from worshiping the way they saw fit when they had been in the United States. And so they went to leave the United States. When they started out for that part of the world it was part of Mexico. 
But the temple was 40 years in the building. Long before the temple was built, they had built the Salt Lake Theater. And they were having plays. They were supporting the arts with public funds. 
We recently passed a tax increase in Salt Lake County for one purpose, and one purpose only, to support the arts--public funding going for arts support. The Utah Symphony probably would not survive without that tax increase. And there was a recognition that what the Utah Symphony does for the school children of Utah, what the Utah Symphony does for the cultural atmosphere of the entire State of Utah, the concerts they give all up and down the State that are attended free by schoolchildren and others is worth public funding for the arts. 
That is a precedent that I think we cannot lose sight of when we are having this debate here on the floor and saying, `The public has no business funding the arts. Let the private people take care of it.' 
The public has an enormous stake in seeing to it that the arts flourish in our society, that if we ever get to the point where our schoolchildren have no appreciation for Shakespeare, have no sense of excitement when they hear the `Ode to Joy' from the last movement of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, because they have never heard it before--oh, if they live in a major metropolitan area they will hear it, if they live within the sound of public radio, which some of our colleagues in the House 
want to destroy as well, they may hear it--but there is nothing quite like hearing it live in your own rural community, maybe badly played, put on by the local folk, and only a few hundred dollars from the National Endowment for the Arts that made it possible, that started the ball rolling, but essential, vital, important to the lives of all of us. 
The public, as a whole, has a stake in seeing that the arts flourish. Those who would cancel any kind of Federal participation in the arts will be sending a powerful message that the public in the United States wants to turn its back on any kind of public involvement in disseminating the impact of the arts throughout our society. 
So, Mr. President, with all due respect to my colleagues for whom I have great personal affection who are on the other side of this issue, I make it clear that I stand for funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Out of that general statement, let me make some specific comments about the debate we are having. 
Is the National Endowment for the Arts the perfect vehicle for this funding activity that I have just defended? Probably not. There are always improvements that can be made in the bureaucracy. 
Has the National Endowment for the Arts funded art with which I am disappointed? Absolutely. There is no question that the sense of outrage that has been raised on the floor of this House and the other over the years about some things that have been funded by money from the Federal Government is a legitimate sense of outrage. 
Unfortunately, we have ourselves in the circumstance where if you are for the arts you almost have to stand up for this appropriations, in the way the public perceives it. And if you think that there is a problem, you almost have to be with Senator Helms and opposing everything. I would hope we could get away from that. And I know there are a lot of amendments on the floor. 
Senator Hutchison from Texas has one that I am almost tempted to vote for, maybe with some tweaking I might be able to vote for it. I wish we could be in the atmosphere where we started out with the amendment of the Senator from Texas and said, `OK, this is a description of where we want to be. Now let's try to work from here towards solution.' 
But unfortunately, the matter has been so polarized you almost have to pick a side and stand on that side and say, `Any movement away from this side opens me up to misinterpretation,' any movement away from a stand for the full amount approved by the subcommittee that Senator Gorton chairs, and on which I serve, is a demonstration you are not in favor of the public support for the arts; or, on the other side, any movement away from total elimination is a demonstration that you are in favor of filthy art. I do not think either of those extremes is accurate in the legislative situation in which we find ourselves. 
I would hope that in this Congress we would pass the bill as it came out of the subcommittee--I voted for it in the subcommittee and support it strongly on the floor--and then move toward a more reasoned or, if you will, less emotional analysis of what should be the future of funding for the arts, what should be the restructuring of the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Could we perhaps combine the National Endowment for the 
Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities in a single endowment, overseeing both activities, and see if we can't achieve some efficiencies in administration, that some of the same administrative functions could take place to support both activities, and do that in a much less emotionally charged atmosphere that seems to surround this debate? 
For that reason, I will support the amendment by the chairman of the full committee, Senator Stevens, that says once this is all over in this appropriations bill, Congress should hold some hearings on this issue and see where we really ought to go. 
But in this emotionally charged atmosphere that we find ourselves, I find that those kinds of conversations get lost in the rhetoric and you have to chose either one side or the other. The highly polarized atmosphere of this debate is, I think, unfortunate. 
But in that atmosphere I have made my choice, true to the traditions of the State that I represent, going back 150 years. I have decided to support public funding for the recognition that it is the spreading of the arts throughout all of society that is the great benefit of the arts. 
It is not for the elite, who sit in the concert hall and listen to the Metropolitan Opera, to say, `That is a magnificent operatic experience'; it is for the people in the small towns of Utah, who sing those operatic arias, usually rather badly, but are nonetheless inspired by the experience of coming in contact with that which the Metropolitan Opera itself helps preserve for the Nation as a whole. 
Would I like to have more money for my State out of the National Endowment? Of course. What politician would not, but not at the expense of dismantling the great artistic organizations that are at the core of the spreading of art throughout our society as a whole. 
So I look forward to the passage of Senator Stevens' amendment, for the coming of some kind of hearings for the examination of the particulars of how we deal with this. But I repeat again, in the polarization that has occurred here where you have to ultimately say you are on one side or the other, I have chosen the side that I have been on. And I wish to make that clear.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, with all of the discussions that have occurred in recent weeks regarding the Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA], it seems that every year about this time, we in Congress scratch our heads and wring our hands over how to improve efficiency with this most cumbersome of Federal bureaucracies. I want to share with my colleagues an experience that one of my constituents recently had with the BIA. It deals with Hodges, Inc., a small construction firm with home offices in Sandy, UT. This is a case with a long and complicated history, but I want my colleagues to have a better understanding of what it is like for a small contractor to conduct business with the BIA. 
On June 20, 1994, the BIA awarded to Hodges, Inc., a contract for the renovation of the Taos Pueblo Day School in New Mexico, in the amount of $649,541. According to this agreement, the renovation work was to have been completed within 120 days from July 5, 1994. 
The first problem occurred when the architect of the project was also selected to be the contracting officer's representative [COR] creating several built-in conflicts of interest. When Hodges, Inc., the primary contractor, pointed out several deficiencies in the design, the COR unfortunately interpreted these comments as personal attacks. Problems escalated as the COR visited the job site only three or four times, and failed to take into account differing site conditions, changes, and payment clauses of the contract. The COR never attempted to determine if the work was satisfactorily completed at the time of invoice preparation. 
Unfortunately, the COR and the contracting officer also failed to understand the significance and importance of issuing change orders to the contractor. Numerous incidents occurred during the renovation when change orders were issued to the contractor, directing him to perform a specific repair and to submit a proposal for that work. Under the terms of the original contract, Hodges, Inc., had no choice but to perform these tasks as directed and, in return, the contracting officer was to pay the contractor an equitable adjustment, covering any increased costs and recognize the additional contract performance time as a result of the directed change. 
However, the BIA did not always agree with the invoices submitted by Hodges, Inc., and arbitrarily determined the amount it would pay with no attempt to negotiate the payment or understand the nature of the expenses incurred by the contractor. 
Mr. President, competent architects and engineers know that renovation of an existing building is frequently far more complicated than new construction projects. Consequently, extra care should be taken to ensure the accuracy of the contract documents. The number of complications during renovation of the Taos Pueblo Day School that can be traced to defects in the plans and specifications led to significant changes to the contract. Singularly, these defects might not have 
been significant, but the considerable number of defects hindered the contractor's ability to perform in a timely and cost-efficient manner. 
Throughout all the performance process, there was no sense of urgency on the part of the BIA in responding to several concerns raised by the contractor, with delays in answering critical correspondence of up to 45 days. The BIA's failure to respond to requests for clarification or direction in a timely manner impacted Hodges, Inc.'s ability to perform its contractual obligation. By September 1994, the antagonistic relationship between the BIA and Hodges, Inc., was so strained as to make any sort of amicable solution very difficult. Rather than having meaningful discussions to resolve the differences, the remaining performance period became a nonproductive paper war. 
The contract was terminated for default by the BIA on April 6, 1995. In accordance with the disputes clause of the contract, Hodges, Inc., appealed the termination for default to the Interior Board of Contract Appeals [IBCA] on June 6, 1995. In October, Hodges, Inc., filed a complaint with the IBCA alleging they were delayed in performing the contract by the BIA's improper administration of several contract clauses. Hodges, Inc., filed claims against the BIA in the amounts of $16,627.39 for improper administration of payments during contract performance, $82,394.53 in documenting costs because of equitable adjustments to the contract under the changes clause of the contract, and $573,398.28 requesting termination for convenience costs. 
In December, BIA agreed to a termination for convenience rather than the termination for default, with an effective date of April 6, 1996. On December 12, 1996, the BIA and Hodges, Inc., settled the termination for convenience costs with a payment due to Hodges, Inc., in the amount of $495,000.00. During the course of the negotiations the parties agreed that payment would be made by the middle of January 1997, the because the project was not yet completed by the construction contractor performing on behalf of the bonding company, the costs that the bonding company incurred would be paid directly to them by BIA. 
To almost no one's surprise, BIA did not fulfill its obligation of paying by mid-January. Only after my office contacted the BIA in behalf of Hodges, Inc., and with the oversight of the Department of the Interior, were payments made. The first $145,000 payment was received on April 2, 1997, a second $300,000 payment was received on April 16, 1997, and a third $50,000 payment was received on May 6, 1997. All payments were made well after the convened date, causing undue hardship on the contractor who had made arrangements with its subcontractors in order to clear its own debts. 
Unfortunately, chapters in this strange saga continue to be written. BIA has denied the contractor claim to recover interest penalties owed them, and because the bonding company has not received payment from BIA for work beyond the conversion, they have been forced to withhold Hodges, Inc.'s performance and payment bonds with the Small Business Administration. As a result, Hodges, Inc., is limited on the size of contracts it can bid, hindering its ability to do business. 
Mr. President, this whole episode has escalated the cost of the renovation of the Taos Pueblo Day School from about $650,000 to $1.1 million--$500,000 over the original amount awarded. That is a half a million dollars that could better be spent improving education, law enforcement or housing. And we wonder why things don't seem to be getting any better for the tribes over the years. 
In the coming days, we will discuss the future of tribal funding. As this debate is conducted, I ask my colleagues to also keep in mind that no matter how funding formulas are changed, failure to force BIA to improve efficiency will only hinder efforts to improve conditions for the tribes. A new funding formula administered by an old, inefficient, and unresponsive bureaucracy is the equivalent of putting new wine in old bottles. I encourage my colleagues to seriously consider the need to restructure BIA in addition to the need to restructure current funding formulas.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as my colleagues know nearly a year ago, on September 18, 1996, President Clinton announced the creation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument under the authority of the Antiquities Act, declaring 1.7 million acres in the State of Utah as a national monument. The majority of the citizens in southern Utah were understandably distressed that they were left out of the designation process. Today, those local citizens continue to be alarmed by the potential negative impact this designation may have on their counties' economies. While we may not wish to reverse the President's designation, we must ensure that the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument is sufficiently funded and managed in a way that ensures the integrity of the public comment process. 
I have included specific language included in the committee report accompanying H.R. 2107 represents the first opportunity we have to appropriate funds for this monument. I would like to express my appreciation to the chairman, Senator Slade Gorton and the distinguished ranking member, Senator Robert Byrd, for working with me to address the immediate needs of the monument. 
The language included in the committee report identifies $6,400,000 in funding for the monument. This amount, rather than been consolidated in a single line item, has been distributed among 20 different subaccounts within the Bureau of Land Management's budget under `Management of Lands and Resources' account. Because these funds are appropriated through so many separate budget functions, it is extremely important that the moneys allocated for the monument be clearly listed in the report by line item, so that funds are not diverted to other agency programs. In order to ensure that sufficient resources are available during this planning stage, the report language mandates that all of the funds designated in this bill are to be allocated to the Utah BLM office and the on-ground field office. I thank the chairman for his help in this matter. 
Mr. President, it is also important that Congress provide maximum flexibility at the field office level to utilize these funds in most effective way. The report language expresses the expectation that funds will be relocated as needed, with an emphasis on the provision of visitor services. On this matter, the committee directs the BLM to work cooperatively with Kane and Garfield Counties and the State of Utah in accommodating the diverse range of visitor expectations. The agency should look first to the capabilities and expertise of local citizens, private and government entities in addressing the issue of safety, access, and maintenance of the areas visited by the public. The two impacted counties have already signed cooperative agreements with the BLM outlining the goals, expectations and deliverables and defining the counties' participation in the planning process. The reports I have received of this cooperative effort have been encouraging. 
The committee is appropriating ample funds to continue the development of a management plan and allow the continuation of the existing cooperative agreements with Kane and Garfield Counties. However, the committee has expressed that the cooperative relationship must not be limited to the management plan, as it has been already expanded to include some short-range search and rescue and other related concerns. 
Mr. President, regarding the ever critical matter of schools, President Clinton assured the people of Utah that `the creation of this monument will not come at expense of Utah's children' and that once land exchanges were underway, `the differences in valuation will be resolve in favor of the school Trust.' However, the committee rightly so, has expressed its concern that the Department of Interior may be undervaluating school trust lands within the monument. We have been very specific in our instructions to the BLM that this is unacceptable. 
In closing, I would like again to thank my distinguished colleagues, Senators Gorton and Byrd and their staff for their assistance in forging the directives that will guide the BLM and the Department of Interior in the planning and management of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in the next fiscal year. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Senators should, therefore, anticipate the first rollcall vote tomorrow morning at approximately 10 a.m. 
If cloture is invoked, it is the majority leader's hope that the Senate can conclude action on the FDA bill in a reasonable timeframe on Tuesday. Under the consent agreement, all Senators have until 10 a.m. in order to file second-degree amendments to the FDA bill. 
The Senate will also resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill. Therefore, Senators can expect additional votes on Tuesday following the cloture vote.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Senate's attention the recent National Cancer Institute recommendation that followup studies be conducted regarding American's exposure to radioactive iodine-131. During the 1950's and 1960's the Nevada test site conducted a number of atomic tests. The radioactive fallout from such tests was significant. I believe that a number of Utahns were exposed to this radioactive fallout. 
The University of Utah has conducted several studies to assess the impact of this fallout. In doing so the University of Utah collaborated with the Public Health Service, the National Cancer Institute, and the Department of Energy. Although these studies concluded that there is an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancers among the examined group and that further research was needed. Many of those exposed are just now coming to the age where thyroid cancer is manifested. As a result, I believe it is important that Congress fund the next phase of this study. 
I would like to ask Chairman Specter if he would work with me to find the necessary resources to fund the next phase of this study. I am well aware of the limited resources available to this subcommittee. I also understand that there are many competing needs and important programs and projects. However, I am hopeful that we can work together to find the necessary resources to fund this study.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, in the Federalist Papers, Madison tried to allay fears of a Federal government overpowering state and local concerns, by stating: 
. . . where on one occasion improper sacrifices have been made of local considerations to the aggrandizement of the federal government, the great interests of the nation have suffered on a hundred from an undue attention to the local prejudices, interests, and views of the particular States. 
. . . But what degree of madness could ever drive the federal government to such an extremity?--Federalist Paper, No. 46. 
Mr. President, while Mr. Madison believed that Federal encroachment of local interests would be rare, I believe the State of Utah finds itself in that circumstance. Utah's education budgets are being improperly sacrificed by federal action. Mr. Madison predicted that legislative devices would be used to solve these types of problems. He was right. Today I am offering an amendment in an attempt to do just that. 
Last September, the President created the 1.7 million acre Grand Staircase-Escalante Monument in Utah. While I vehemently disagreed with the process the Administration used to designate this monument, it is now a fixture on our map. We must now move on and work toward resolving the problems that were created by this Proclamation. 
One of the most important issues that must be addressed are the 176,000 acres of school trust lands trapped within the boundaries of the monument. For those of you who are not familiar with school trust lands, let me briefly explain. At statehood, the federal government granted about one-ninth of the lands in Utah for the support of public education. School trust lands exist solely to generate revenue for public schools. 
President Clinton, in designating the monument acknowledged the impact to state education funds. He stated, `I know the children of Utah have a big stake in school lands located within the boundaries of the monument that I am designating today . . . creating this national monument should not and will not come at the expense of Utah's school children.' Utah's citizens, and education groups, including the Utah's Education Association, the Parent-Teacher Association, the School Boards Association, the State Board of Education, the School Superintendents Association, the Association of Elementary School Principals, the Association of Secondary School Principals, and School Employees Association agree, and have spoken loudly and clearly about the need to solve this problem for the benefit of Utah's school children. 
President Clinton then directed the Interior Department to conduct a land exchange of school trust lands located within the Monument. While this is one of the most realistic solutions to this problem, it will not be easy. Land exchanges are expensive, time-consuming, and unfortunately, will negatively impact tight State education budgets. In a May 14 report on the Grand Staircase-Escalante Monument, the Department of Education reached the following conclusion:  
The Department [of Education] recognized that the process of arranging for land exchanges exacts costs on the State of Utah . . . These costs are paid from funds that would otherwise be available for public education. 
Mr. President, this amendment provides a grant to the Utah State Education Agency to partially defray expenses of conducting a land-exchange. State education funds are badly needed to educate Utah's children. 
I would like to thank Senator Specter and Senator Harkin for their assistance, and leadership in education. I look forward to working with them, the Department of Education and the Administration on this issue, and appreciate their willingness to work with me.

Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I thank the Senator from Delaware for his courtesy and consideration in allowing me to take this time. I also congratulate both the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from New York for their ability in crafting this particular piece of legislation. 
When I ran for the Senate in 1992, I made tax reform one of my primary goals. I must confess that this bill does not meet all of my expectations and promises as I ran in the campaign, because one of the things that I was most devoted to was a determination to make the Tax Code less complex, easier to understand, and tax returns, perhaps, filed that are the size of a postcard. 
This bill does not accomplish that, and I still hold that out as a goal for the future. But if this bill does not make the Tax Code less complex, it at least makes the Tax Code less burdensome --less burdensome for middle Americans, middle-class Americans who have not received a significant tax break for a long, long time. There have been tax breaks at the other ends of the Tax Code, yes, at the bottom end for people who received the earned income tax credit and, some would argue, too much at the top end. But there has not been the kind of middle-class tax relief talked about in the 1992 campaign until this bill. 
So while it is not everything that I would want--and there is still much unfinished business to be taken care of in terms of tax simplification--it is a step in the right direction that we should apply. I intend to vote for it enthusiastically and urge all of my colleagues to do the same. 
When I came here in January 1993, the atmosphere was completely different than the one we find on the floor today. At that time, there was a determination to see that spending would grow and that taxing would grow. I am delighted to have been able to be a part of an effort that has brought us to a case where spending is going down, at least in percentage terms, and taxes are going down, in terms of the burden that they are placing on the American people. 
So I congratulate all connected with this effort, including, yes, Mr. President, the President of the United States. I know it is not common for people on my side of the aisle to stand up and say nice things about this President, and I have said my share of unkind things in areas where I feel he has done things that I think are inappropriate. But as I have said to the President when I have been to the White House on occasions, `When you are right, Mr. President, I will back you. When I think you are wrong, I will oppose you.' I owe it to him and to those in his administration who have worked with him on this agreement to publicly acknowledge that this time I think he has been right. I congratulate him and those who work with him for their willingness to do this. I must say that I still had hoped that Senator Dole would be elected President. I think if he had been, we would be here discussing the tax simplification that I believe in as well as some tax reduction. We had our opportunity to make that case in the campaign. For one reason or another, it didn't fly, and it will have to wait for another day. But I congratulate all those who have put partisanship aside and worked together for the good of the people and made a compromise with which perhaps none fully agree, but for which the American people, overall, will ultimately be grateful. 
For that reason, Mr. President, I am grateful to the two Senators for allowing me to take this brief time to make these expressions. I conclude as I began, with my congratulations to them and to their colleagues on the Finance Committee, to the leadership of both Houses in both parties, for their ability on the legislative side to work out an agreement with the President and his associates in the executive branch to give us at least this first step in the direction of making the Tax Code less burdensome and less onerous on the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in introducing the Mining Law Reform Act of 1997 today. The merits of this legislation have already been outlined by others, so I will not go into details. I believe that we have come a long way toward reaching a compromise and I congratulate the chairman for his willingness and his efforts to reach the middle ground. 
Mr. President, in this time of economic prosperity, I find it worrisome that we must constantly remind the American people that our Nation's economic prosperity is largely dependent upon our ability to create wealth. The ability to create wealth depends upon ability to take a raw material that has little or no economic worth and turn it into something of value. The economic prosperity which we have experienced in this decade is due, in part, to the increased ability of our Nation's mining industry to create wealth out of our raw materials. 
In my own State, there are some groups which argue that the mining industry is no longer needed, that it is a relic of the past. I hear from these same groups how tourism will be the savior of Utah's rural communities and if the people of rural Utah would only accept this, then everything will work out just fine. The economy will be strong, the environment will be protected and everyone will have a high standard of living. 
Mr. President, I do not want to diminish in any way the important contribution that tourism provides to the economy of my State. Utahns encourage people to come and enjoy our ski slopes, our canyons, and our national parks. But much of the tourism industry is seasonal in nature. In some small communities in southern Utah, it takes two and one-half incomes to generate the average income. It is not uncommon to strike up a conversation with a waitress in the local cafe, and learn that her husband works two jobs to make ends meet. As one County Commissioner summarized recently, `If tourism was really the answer, making beds, frying hamburgers, and pumping gas would have made us rich a long, long time ago.' 
In 1995, the values of minerals mined in Utah exceeded $2.4 billion. Utah's direct economic gain from mining exceeded $1.1 billion, including $358 million in personal income gains. The average mining job in Utah pays about $36,000 a year. With this in mind, imagine the tremendous positive impact that a few dozen mining jobs have in these communities. These jobs impact the local auto dealer, the real estate agent, the contractor, and the hardware store owner. 
Mr. President, responsible and reasonable mining law reform should be enacted. But as we undertake these efforts, we must also recognize the important contribution of the mining industry to our Nation's economy. It makes no sense to enact mining law reform in the name of environmental protection or budgetary concerns, if these reforms in turn force industry offshore where environmental restrictions are not a consideration and some other country's government receives tax revenues. I urge my colleagues to keep this in mind. 
I congratulate the chairman for his efforts and I look forward to working closely with him to enact this legislation.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I had not expected to be here in the Senate today. I had made plans to be in Salt Lake City where the celebrations are going on for a historic event marking the 150th anniversary of the entry of Brigham Young into the Salt Lake Valley. As Senate business has been pressing, combined with a bad cold that you can hear in my throat, I decided wisdom meant that I should stay here, even though my heart is in Utah. 
Mr. President, we have heard a lot from the senior Senator, appropriately, about the trek and what went on. Like him, I have forebears who were part of that great movement, which began with Brigham Young in 1847, but continued until the coming of the railroad in 1869. My grandfather, John F. Bennett, was 3 years old when his parents and his grandparents took him out of the slums of Liverpool, where they were born and raised in what would be considered the lower-lower class, walked across the great American plains to try to find a new life and a new religion in a new place. Out of that family that came from that little boy, who had no education, no hope, and in the class-ridden status of England at the time, no chance of opportunity for advancement, have come two United States Senators, a number of successful businessmen, a series of college graduates, and a tremendous family of achievement and family happiness of which I am a beneficiary. 
There was indeed something magic about that trek that called people not only from the United States, but from all over the world, to go forward in the name of their religion and their faith to a place that was picked because no one else wanted it. Indeed, their leader chose this place because he had been literally driven out of the United States--some say solely because of his religion, others say because of political problems, and others say because the Mormons weren't good at getting along with their neighbors in Missouri, Illinois, and the other places where they tried to settle permanently. 
I won't try to rehash that history because it doesn't really matter. What matters is that they stayed together, they traveled together, they spread their version of the Gospel of Jesus Christ throughout the world, and they called their adherence from all over the world to join with them in that tremendous sacrifice, to find a place where they could be left alone to flourish. 
They were not successful. They were not left alone. Within 2 years after Brigham Young arrived, gold was discovered in California and the world started going through Utah on its way for riches. Not everyone found their way to riches, but they did help, economically, build a State--an ironic twist of events for Brigham Young, who wanted to be alone. 
We have had a great deal said during this sesquicentennial year about the tremendous physical sacrifice involved in that trek. As I think of my 3-year-old grandfather, I can barely identify with how physically difficult that must have been for him and for his parents and his grandparents. I have just gone across country with a 5-year-old grandchild, courtesy of Delta Airlines, and it was a whole lot easier than taking him in a covered wagon for hundreds, if not thousands, of miles. 
So I pay tribute today to the legacy that I owe to those people and what they did and what they endured. I have been back to England and have looked at my relatives who stayed there and compared what happened to those of us who are descendants of the people who were willing to make that trek with what happened to those who stayed in what they thought would be the comfort of the British Isles. It is one of the things I offer thanks for in my personal prayers, that I am descended from that branch of the family that endured that trek. 
I want to make one final point about this, which I think is the important point out of this entire experience as we pay tribute to the people and who they were and what they did. As impressive as their physical sacrifice and performance was, there is something else that I want to mention that I think, in many ways, is more distinctive and more instructive for us today in our world. This was a group of people--at least the core group--who had been physically driven from their homes several times. They had been physically driven from Ohio. They sought refuge in Missouri; they did not find it. They were physically driven from Missouri and ended up penniless, with nothing but 
the clothes on their backs, in the State of Illinois. They started over again. They built the largest and, by some accounts, most beautiful city in Illinois. They were physically driven from there and, again, started out with very little to go someplace where they could be left alone. 
In today's world, when we see articles in books constantly written about how we are all victims, we could expect that they would have spent their time lamenting over that which they lost and focusing on their resentments and their bitterness and that which other people owed them. They did not. Oh, I am sure that there was some of that. It would only be human that there would be some regrets and tears shed for homes left. But that was not their focus. That was not their driving force. They were not driven by hatred, a desire for revenge, a sense of victimhood and petitions to get everything back that had been taken away from them. 
Instead, their focus was on the future. Senator Hatch has already quoted the third verse of the hymn that they wrote and sang to themselves again and again as they endured the physical difficulties. I want to repeat it here in this context. It was not a hymn of mourning or longing for the past. 
They said:  
We'll find a place which God for us prepared, 
Far away in the West, where none shall come to hurt, 
or make afraid. 
There, the Saints will be blessed. 
We'll make the air with music ring, 
Shout praises to our God and King, above the rest. 
This tale will tell, all is well, all is well. 
Mr. President, we look around the world today in Bosnia, in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East, and we find people who have suffered ancient wrongs, sometimes terrible, unforgivable wrongs, at the hands of their fellow men, in the name of politics or religion, or just plain ethnic hatred. We find people in the Middle East who remember the Crusades and feel offended by something that happened a thousand years ago and are sworn to set right those ancient grievances. 
I say to them and to all of us that those who made their way across the plains 150 years ago had reason to hold grievances, but they looked not to the past but to the future. And as I rise today to pay tribute to their memory, I pay tribute not only to their physical courage in undergoing that trek and express my gratitude for the privilege of being descended from them, but I express my greater gratitude for what, in my view, is a greater legacy: that I have grown up in a circumstance where these people, however much they talk about the history of the past, are willing to forgive the past; that they are not viewing themselves anymore as that first generation, as victims, as obsessed with redressing old wrongs or attacking old antagonists. The legacy that is of greatest value to me and to the people of my State that came from those who were engaged in that great trek was their legacy of hope and optimism and a willingness to forgive and forget and look to the future. 
That is what we are celebrating today as we look back on 150 years since the time they finally found their place faraway in the West, which God had in fact for them prepared, where they have indeed been blessed. Senator Hatch and I would like to be with them today, but we cannot because of our duties here in the Senate. But we thank the Members of the Senate for their indulgence in allowing us to take the time of the U.S. Senate and make this recognition of significant events in American history. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BENNETT. I would like to take a moment to discuss an issue in which I know my colleague, Senator Lugar, has a strong interest, that is the need for access to credit by entrepreneurs in the rural areas of this country. I have been concerned about the access to capital for entrepreneurial businesses almost since I first stepped onto the Senate floor after my election in 1992 and I want to make clear that I have pursued a number of different avenues to help create a more liquid credit market in rural areas. Senator Lugar, you and I are no strangers to under served capital needs of rural businesses. I helped sponsor and pass Senator D'Amato's Small Business Loan Securitization bill almost 3 years ago in hopes of helping bring more credit to rural businesses. 
In past Congresses and in this Congress I have repeatedly approached Senator Bond, the chairman of the Small Business Committee, with regard to the increasing need for rural credit. The Small Business Committee tells me that there will be inadequate funding for rural nonagricultural businesses as included in the SBA 7(a) Program. The Department of Agriculture is concerned that there is inadequate funding for its Business and Industry Program, which lends to rural nonagricultural interests. Additionally, many bankers have voiced their concerns that inadequate credit and liquidity will adversely affect their small business lending and investment programs nationwide.

Mr. BENNETT. I have read those reports as well and I know that the reasons they cite for these deficiencies include relatively fewer credit suppliers, higher costs due to lower credit demand, a lack of professional lending experience in rural and outlying areas, and a lack of liquidity in many rural lending institutions when compared to urban lending institutions. 
The amendment I was prepared to offer today sought to remedy this situation by creating a pilot project, at no cost to the Federal Government, for 1 year. If the pilot had proven unsuccessful, the project would not have been renewed. 
This solution would have expanded the authorities of an existing Government Sponsored Enterprise [GSE] to ensure reliable and competitively priced credit from existing lending institutions to rural small businesses nationwide. 
It was my belief that this was the most expedient legislative approach to take. I believe that the expansion of Farmer Mac's authority in this area makes sense because it is a logical outgrowth of activities it already conducts, such as securitizing commercial loans, operating through thousands of existing commercial credit outlets, and providing access to national capital markets for rural and nonrural borrowers alike. 
I look forward to working with the Agriculture Committee, which has jurisdiction over this issue, over the coming months to remedy this problem and I thank my colleague Senator Lugar for his willingness to address this important issue.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have been monitoring the problems associated with rural credit needs for some time. At a time when the credit availability problems of rural small business and rural infrastructure are being highlighted by various experts and studies, the very institutions that provide credit to these concerns are having their funding reduced. Solutions to these problems are being thwarted by petty bickering and turf battles that do little else than prolong the agony for rural residents and deprive them of the benefits they deserve. 
I have read with interest the recent reports from the Rural Policy Research Institute [RUPRI], the General Accounting Office [GAO], and the USDA on rural credit needs. I have also reviewed the proceedings of the Kansas City Fed's conference on `Financing Rural America.' These documents present no surprises for those of us who represent rural areas. While each study approaches its task in a unique manner, all of these reports are similar in their conclusions. They note that while rural financial markets work reasonably well, not all market segments are equally well served. They all agree that small businesses from rural areas can have a difficult time obtaining financing, have fewer credit options, and may well pay more for their credit than comparable urban enterprises. At a time when small businesses are being recognized for their valuable contributions to our economic growth and stability, small businesses are experiencing increasing credit needs. Unfortunately, USDA's Business and Industry loan program and the Small Business Administration's funding are being limited in fiscal year 1998. 
The facts are worrisome. As the RUPRI study points out, many rural areas were bypassed by recent employment growth. Existing rural employment is concentrated in slow-growth or declining industries. Job growth in rural areas, particularly rural areas that are not adjacent to metropolitan areas, is biased toward low-skill, low-wage activities. USDA has stated that `Rural economies are characterized by a preponderance of small businesses, fewer and smaller local sources of financial capital, less diversification of business and industry, and fewer ties to non-local economic activity.' This does not bode well for my home State of Utah where 25 of 29 counties are classified as rural by the USDA. 
To further illustrate, USDA's Fiscal Year 1998 Business and Industry [B&I] loan program will be straight-lined at fiscal year 97 levels. Based on data provided by USDA, current B&I loan volume is capped at about $740 million; however, USDA has applications pending for yet another $700 million, with preapplications already on file for still another $200 million. These numbers suggest that adequate private capital is not available. Again, using my home State of Utah as an example, there are over $10 million in B&I loans outstanding. However, due to USDA budget limitations, loans for almost $19 million, associated with pending applications and preapplications, will not be made. This will not be helpful to Utah's economic growth and development, especially in rural areas. Unfortunately, this story of unmet rural credit demand can be replicated for almost all of the 50 States represented by this Congress. 
All of the above mentioned reports discuss options for addressing the need for rural credit. All of them discuss one or more options associated with GSE funding, which frankly, are the most logical and persuasive alternatives discussed. I, personally, am persuaded that expansion of Farmer Mac authorities is the most effective and the least obtrusive alternative presented to date. It uses existing credit delivery systems and allows lenders to sell their qualifying loans into the secondary market. Other options discussed include expanding the authorities of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, or the Farm Credit System. I am uncomfortable in advocating expansion of a mortgage lender's authorities into commercial lending activity. I am equally uncomfortable with expanding a tax exempt GSE's authorities into direct competition with the private sector. I am open to suggestions and want to consider all options, including merging GSE's or mergers of public and private interests if such options will provide cost-effective and efficient solutions to the problems associated with rural credit availability. 
Throughout the discussion of the last several weeks, I have become poignantly aware of the strongly held feelings on this issue. I am concerned that a solution to the problems associated with improving rural credit delivery may be beyond the grasp of rural residents and businessmen if the petty bickering and turf battles are not set aside. I commend my esteemed colleague, Senator Lugar, who chairs the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry for his willingness to hold hearings on this issue. I, for one, am open to any and all reasonable options for improving credit delivery in these rural areas. I believe, as many of these reports point out, that improved economic growth will be the result and national GDP will be enhanced.

Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, we are all going to miss the Senator from Arkansas. He is a good friend, and I use that in the honest term, rather than the kind of puffery that often goes on around here. He takes the floor twice a year to espouse things with which I disagree. First, he wants to do things to the mining law that I don't want to do. And then he wants to kill the space station in a way that I don't want it killed. So I vote against him on both of these occasions, but I look forward to these because he keeps us honest with his concerns. He has not yet convinced me to back away from my commitment to the space station, but I pay tribute to his tenacity and to his integrity. 
I have answered at some length in previous debates. I will not take the time to do that now. I simply repeat, again, my commitment to the idea of venturing into the unknown even when it seems expensive and sometimes foolish, because we are never quite sure what we are going to find. But, almost always, it comes back to benefit us. 
As I stand here I am reminded of the quote, I can't give it to you exactly, of the historian who said: History is a chancy thing. America was discovered by someone who was heading for somewhere else, thought he had arrived someplace other than he had, and was named after a man who never came here. 
History is like that, chancy. We are never quite sure what is going to happen to us, but great things happen to us when we explore. We are launched on this exploration now. We are far enough along that it makes sense for us to continue. Who knows what we will find? I will not pretend to know that we will find the cure for cancer or anything else when we get out there. We will surprise ourselves. It will be chancy. But that has been our history; that has been our destiny. I, for one, want to continue it in this program. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Missouri. 
It has been pointed out to me in the study of history that the nation that was the most powerful, the most progressive, that had, in modern terms, superpower status some centuries ago, was the nation of China. One of the things the Chinese did was send their explorers around the world. There were Chinese ships that were exploring as far away as the coast of Africa, I am told. 
Then the Chinese Government decided that that was too expensive, that it was too chancy, that there would be no guarantee that they would learn anything or find anything or profit in any way and, as a cost-cutting measure, the Chinese cut back on their exploration and virtually left the field open to the Europeans. There was very little contact, of course, between the Europeans and the Chinese in that period, but the field was left open in a way that we can look back on in history and say: What might have happened if the Chinese had maintained their exploring activities and maintained their willingness to go into the future? What might have happened, had they not taken those cost-cutting measures? The history of the world would be very, very different. 
It was the Europeans who went out on their exploration after the Chinese cut back. I don't want to see the Americans cut back on their adventure and their exploration, and then have someone else step into the breach. Because I am convinced that if we cut back on our exploration of space, someone else will step up to it. Who knows what the implications could be, hundreds of years from now? 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to make a very brief statement about an action taken earlier this day when I was unable to comment--the adoption of the Smith amendment as it had to do with religious liberty in Russia. 
I know everyone talked about the importance of religious freedom and independent religious liberty, and how important it is for that value to be established in Russia. And I do not want to repeat those arguments. There is just one point I think that needs to be made here. 
The psychologists have a term `xenophobia' which they use to describe those who have a fear of strangers, or a fear of anything foreign. As we look at the long and troubled history of Russia, and then the Soviet Union, we see that one of the driving forces in that culture has been xenophobia--terrible fear under the czars of any kind of Western influence somehow creeping into Russia; terrible fear under the commissars, or Communist dictators from Lenin and Stalin all the way down through Khrushchev and Brezhnev of anything that they considered to be foreign. It was one of the major problems of the Soviet Union and one of the major difficulties that they had in becoming an accepted part of the world family of nations. 
We all rejoiced when the Berlin wall came down, when in the spirit of glasnost--or openness--Mr. Gorbachev led the Soviet Union into an atmosphere of much less xenophobia. 
The thing that distresses me the most is the piece of legislation that passed the Russian Parliament, and that is now sitting on President Yeltsin's desk, is that it is a clear return to the days of xenophobia--fear of anything from outside. 
Yes. Religious liberty is important. Yes. I voted for the Smith amendment to establish the importance of religious liberty. But I voted for the Smith amendment even more firmly because I believe the Russian people must be told in as firm a fashion as possible that if they returned to the days of the darkest period of the czars, if they returned to the days of the darkest period of the Soviet Union with an unfounded and irresponsible fear of anything that comes from beyond their borders, they will be taking a most serious downward turn in the culture and future of their Republic. 
So in that, Mr. President, I cast my vote in favor of the Smith amendment hoping to send that message to the people of Russia. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Legislative Branch bill provides $1,537,827,000 in new obligational authority, exclusive of House items, for fiscal year 1998. This is $64,947,000 below the President's request and $51,600,000 above the fiscal year 1997 level. 
The majority of the increases in the bill account for cost of living adjustments. 
Mr. President, I wish to correct an impression that is being circulated throughout the press. There is no provision in this bill for a pay increase for Members of Congress. That is the issue that is taken care of in other bills. 
The Senate items include provisions to reduce the appropriation for official mail from $10 million to $8 million in fiscal year 1998 and combine the franking allowance with the official personnel and office expense allowance--this will reduce paperwork and provide flexibility for offices to meet their needs. 
The bill eliminates the disparity in staff salaries of Senate employees versus all other Federal employees (including those of the House.) This disparity was caused by the Senate employees not receiving the 2-percent COLA in 1996, which as provided to all other Federal employees. 
Approximately 80 percent of the Architect's request for capital projects to ensure that certain repairs and maintenance are not delayed. If this maintenance is taken care of now, it should pay off in substantial cost savings in the future. 
The GAO is provided $346.75 million, which conforms to the commitment to stabilize the GAO budget and staff level (3,500 employees) after a 2-year reduction of 25 percent. This recommendation provides sufficient funds for mandatory cost increases, including the COLA. 
I want to take the opportunity now before presenting the bill to thank Senator Dorgan, the ranking member on the Legislative Branch Subcommittee, for his cooperation and his work on the bill. I have enjoyed my experience as the chairman of the subcommittee, and Senator Dorgan's cooperative spirit has been a large part of that enjoyment. I pay tribute to him and to his staff for the professional way in which they have handled this responsibility. 
Mr. President, I believe this bill continues the legislative branch's contributions toward deficit reduction and the goal of the balanced budget by the year 2002. 
Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 110, S. 1019, the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, and, further, the managers' amendment, which is at the desk, be considered as read and agreed to.

Mr. BENNETT. I further ask unanimous consent that the bill not be engrossed, that it remain at the desk pending receipt of the House companion measure. 
I further ask unanimous consent that when the House companion measure is received in the Senate, all after the enacting clause be stricken, except appropriations for the House of Representatives and House Office Buildings, and that the text of S. 1019, as passed, be inserted in lieu thereof, the Senate insist on its amendments, and request a conference with the House; and, finally, the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate. 
I further ask unanimous consent that when the House bill is passed, pursuant to the previous order, the passage of S. 1019 be vitiated, and that S. 1019 be indefinitely postponed.

Mr. BENNETT. The Quadrennial Defense Review [QDR] outlined a direction for the Air Force to consolidate force structure and reduce manpower. Included in the QDR is a proposal to transfer one active duty fighter wing to the reserve forces. General Fogleman recently informed me that the Air Force was specifically exploring a number of options to accomplish this directive. 
Because of the changes that may occur as the Department of Defense downsizes, I would expect the Air Force to alert Congress as important decisions are made, and will outline the rationale behind their conclusions. Is it the chairman's expectation that this will be the case?

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. Chairman, as the Air Force determines where fighter units will be located, these decisions will inevitably impact how our test and training ranges are utilized. Consequently, I believe it would also be reasonable for the Air Force to outline how changes in force structure will impact the use of test and training ranges.

 Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I address today an issue of significant importance to my home State of Utah. As you know, the State of Utah is largely rural. Of 29 counties in the State of Utah, 25 are classified as rural by the U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA]. For this reason, I have a keen interest in rural issues in general and, as a member of the banking committee, rural credit issues in particular. 
I have read with interest the recent reports from the Rural Policy Research Institute [RUPRI], the General Accounting Office [GAO], and the USDA on rural credit needs. I have also reviewed the proceedings of the Kansas City Fed's conference on `Financing Rural America.' These documents present no surprises for those of us who represent rural areas. While each study approaches its task in a unique manner, all of these reports are similar in their conclusions. They note that while rural financial markets work reasonably well, not all market segments are equally well served. They all agree that small businesses from rural areas can have a difficult time obtaining financing, have fewer credit options, and may well pay more for their credit than comparable urban enterprises. At a time when small businesses are being recognized for their valuable contributions to our economic growth and stability, small businesses are facing increasing demands for credit, and Small Business Administration funding is frequently being challenged. 
Historically, rural economic activity has been synonymous with agricultural production. Today, this is no longer the case. The number of farms in the United States has declined dramatically from about 6 million in the first half of this century, to about 2 million farms in 1990. While agriculture is still an important component of rural America and its credit needs are reasonably well addressed; the financial needs of rural nonagricultural business require attention now more than ever. 
While government sponsored enterprises [GSE's] have contributed to the successes of agriculture and rural housing by providing competitive and reliable credit, there has been no GSE financing for rural nonagricultural businesses. As all of these reports point out, credit options for nonagricultural business are relatively scarce, expensive, and sometimes nonexistent. Yet, as the GAO and the Fed reports point out, economic development in these areas is actually hindered by these borrowers' difficulties in obtaining capital. 
The facts are worrisome. As the RUPRI study points out, many rural areas were bypassed by recent employment growth. Existing rural employment is concentrated in slow-growth or declining industries. Job growth in rural areas, particularly rural areas that are not adjacent to metropolitan areas, is biased toward low-skill, low-wage activities. USDA has stated that `Rural economies are characterized by a preponderance of small businesses, fewer and smaller local sources of financial capital, less diversification of business and industry, and fewer ties to non-local economic activity.' 
Rural nonagricultural businessmen seek to be contributing members of our economic society. They do not seek a Federal hand out. They look for equal credit opportunities and an opportunity to participate fully in the same business activities of their urban counterparts. 
As a political body, we need to consider the plight of rural nonagricultural businesses and the great potential that they offer our economy. I bring this issue to the attention of my colleagues in the hope we can work together and review constructive solutions to this program.

 Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as we prepare to celebrate America's national holiday, I would like to take a moment and pay tribute to the founders of our country. James Madison, in particular, is one of my heroes. I didn't know much about James Madison until I went to college. I went to the University of Utah and majored in political science. I became acquainted with James Madison under the direction of G. Homer Durham, who was chairman of the political science department at the University of Utah. He had a very radical notion about education. He said the most important course in the political science department was political science 1. And he said, `Since I am the department head it follows that I should teach the department's most important course.' So as an 18-year-old freshman I sat at the feet of Homer Durham and learned about the Constitution and James Madison. I read the Federalist Papers and began a lifelong love affair with political theory and particularly the political theory that undergirds America starting with Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and the Constitutional Convention. 
As we approach the Fourth of July holiday, I am reminded of another important item which we all cherish: the American flag. The flag of the United States is a unique symbol of national unity and represents the values of liberty, justice, and equality that make this Nation an example unmatched throughout the world. The American flag is recognized around the world as an icon of freedom, representing all that we hold dear as citizens of the United States. This preeminent symbol of our Nation has flown in every conflict where American blood has been threatened and shed, and will always deserve our unbending respect and protection. 
I rise today to support a bill which protects these two sacred items: the Constitution and the American flag. Many of my Republican colleagues advocate passing a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag desecration. I admire and agree with their intent to show proper respect to our flag, but I disagree with their belief that a new constitutional amendment banning flag burning is the best way to protect the flag and punish flag burners. To this end I, along with Senator McConnell, introduce legislation which will successfully and legally prevent the desecration of our national symbol. 
Our bill provides for the imprisonment and fining of those who damage an American flag intending to incite a breach of the peace. It also punishes anyone who steals a flag belonging to the Federal Government or a flag displayed on Federal property. In a review of our bill, senior constitutional legal experts at the U.S. Library of Congress stated that if enacted, the bill would withstand Supreme Court constitutional scrutiny. I agree with this analysis and believe it is possible to punish the despicable behavior of flag desecration, while still preserving the stability of a document that has served us well for over 200 years. 
With these comments, I wish my colleagues a happy Fourth of July holiday. May we always remember the liberties and blessings which are ours due to the sacrifice and inspiration of our American patriots.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his courtesy, and I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his presentation. I think it is a very thoughtful presentation, and there are many parts of it with which I agree. There are a few, however, with which I disagree, and I appreciate the opportunity to put this disagreement close to it in the Record. 
The Senator is justified in talking about the difference between things as they are now and things as they were 4 years ago when we were debating the 1993 tax package from the President. I am not sure he is entirely correct in saying that the program voted on this floor in 1993 is responsible for the tremendous growth we have had in the economy. I would remind him and other Senators that during that same 4-year period, we constantly heard how terrible Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve were behaving and that if, indeed, Alan Greenspan did not open up and make tremendous changes in monetary policy, the economy could crater, that jobs would be lost, that we would have tremendous deficits, and all of these other things would happen. 
At some other time we can debate whether the tremendous growth we have had is the responsibility of the Clinton administration or the Greenspan Fed. The fact is, no one is really quite sure. The fact is, we have a booming, wonderful economy, and we should be grateful for it, however we apply blame or credit, which brings us to the issue that the Senator is addressing. 
Will the tax program that we are talking about continue to stimulate that growth and allow it to burgeon, or will it in some way provide brakes on that growth in the name of income redistribution? The Senator says the issue is wealth distribution and how do we distribute the wealth in the fairest possible way. That is the portion with which I would argue. 
Wealth distribution is not a static question. You do not have the wealthy at the top and the poor at the bottom. You have constant movement up and down the ladder. I always use the example of Donald Trump, who at one time was in the wealthiest 1 percent, and then he made a few bad mistakes and he was bankrupt. Then he made a few smart moves, and he is back up again. 
Read the list of the people who are the richest people in the United States and you find the list is constantly changing. If I may be personal, there was a time not many years ago when I was clearly at the bottom in this country. I had a year not that many years ago where my earnings were zero and my wealth was going down because I was living on savings, and then when they were gone, I was going deeply into debt. Fortunately, one of my business ventures worked out, and now I would be listed up in that rarefied area that the Democrats seem to want to complain about. My point being that you cannot say you have a static group at one area that is going to be benefited and a static group at the other area that is going to be hurt; you have constant movement going back and forth. 
The responsibility of the Senate is not to redistribute wealth among these supposed static groups in a way to create fairness. It is to create a program that will stimulate the growth so that there will be more money for everybody. John F. Kennedy said a rising tide lifts all ships. That is not always true in terms of skill problems and educational problems, but I think it is true in terms of economics. We want a tax program 
that will continue the dramatic growth that we have had in this country, and I respectfully suggest that that which is coming out of the committee is more geared to produce that result. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have addressed this issue before and do not want to spend a great deal of time in repetition. But I think we should focus on what we are really talking about when we talk about capital gains tax. There are many who say, `Well, the people who have a capital gain are wealthy and we are letting them off the hook if we do not tax that wealth.' What we are really talking about, in accumulated capital, is where will that capital be deployed? 
Recently there have been studies as to the number of millionaires in the United States and how they got their money. Overwhelmingly, the money comes from one of two sources: They inherit it or they start businesses. You do not become a millionaire by saving your wages. You become a millionaire by creating something in the form of a company and then seeing it grow. When you die your children inherit it, and then they fall into the first category. That has to do with death taxes. 
But millionaires come from risk-taking, millionaires come from entrepreneurial activity. Where do jobs come from? They come from risk-taking, they come from entrepreneurial activity. As I have said here on the floor, in the real world as opposed to the classroom, millionaires who are the result of entrepreneurial activity have an itch to stay entrepreneurial. Once they have seen their investment become what they call on the market a mature investment, many, many times they want to move on. They want to take their money out of a mature investment and put it into another entrepreneurial activity. But the present level of capital gains taxation prevents them from doing that, at least psychologically. 
Again, on the floor I have given examples of people who have seen their investment grow tremendously in a high-risk circumstance. They got the rewards that came from taking that risk and now they want to move on and take another risk, create more jobs and accumulate capital and wealth in this country. When they calculate what happens to them under the capital gains tax they say, `I am not going to do it. I can't afford it.' And they leave their money tied up in a mature investment, whereas the opportunity in an entrepreneurial investment is denied them by the capital gains tax. 
There is one thing that they do, and I have seen this--indeed, if I may, Mr. President, I have done this myself, to my sorrow. With the entrepreneurial itch saying let's put some money in a new startup circumstance, but feeling that your own money is locked up because of the capital gains tax, the itch becomes so strong that you put money into the entrepreneurial activity anyway, only you borrow it. And now the entrepreneurial activity has to carry not only the responsibility of a fair return, but enough money to pay the interest. 
I will not belabor it because I have given major speeches on this issue before. But I think the cap proposed by my friend from North Dakota, while well-intentioned, would in fact impede the flow of capital, it would move us in a direction that would ultimately redound to the disadvantage of the economy. I remind you once again, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who is concerned with watching money move around the economy and would like to see as much money as possible into entrepreneurial activity, has recommended to us that the ideal capital gains 
rate for this country should be zero. I am not bold enough to propose that on the floor because I know it would not pass. But I always remind people of that because that is the direction in which I think we ought to go. 
For that reason I oppose this amendment.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have come here because I have seen a series of articles that have appeared in the newspapers. I am not a believer in a conspiracy theory. But I 
think there is a movement afoot to give us a steady drumbeat of repetition of a particular theme coming out of those who are opposed to any kind of tax relief. And I picked two examples to show what this drumbeat is. 
The first one appeared in the Washington Post, written by Alan Blinder. Alan Blinder, Mr. President, used to be the Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. He is now a professor of economics at Princeton. 
He starts his presentation this way: 
I have always opposed cutting the capital gains tax, and still do. The case is simple and compelling. No one has yet produced evidence that lower capital gains taxes will lead to higher savings and investment; claims that they are just hunches. But we do know that a lower capital gains tax will shift some of the tax burden from the haves to the have-nots just when income disparities are at postwar highs. 
Then he goes on to say how terrible the capital gains tax rate is and laments the fact that he and others like him have lost the debate. 
A few days later Robert Kuttner wrote the following, again in the Washington Post. I would tell you who Robert Kuttner is, if I knew. But I am not as familiar with him as I am Alan Blinder. 
He says, referring to capital gains tax: 
. . . with the stock market setting new records, the timing is a bit off. 
It's hard to argue with a straight face that the prospect of paying capital gains tax is deterring much productive investment. 
Again, another drumbeat along the idea that cutting the capital gains tax is really nothing more than a way of putting more money into the pockets of the rich--that it will not increase investment, that it will not increase savings. Those who say that it will are ignoring the economic evidence. And these economists make this case over and over again. I submit to you, Mr. President, that they are shooting at a straw man. Either they do not understand the impact of capital gains taxes in the economy, or they don't want us to know what capital gains taxes really do to the economy because I am not going to stand here and argue with Professor Blinder on his turf. I want to take him to my turf, which is the marketplace. I want to take him to the marketplace where real people make real economic decisions in real life, and not the classroom where people argue about it. 
Let's start out with a little bit of classroom conversation, however, to set the context for this. I submit to you this truth, Mr. President: All wealth comes from accumulated capital. 
If someone somewhere does not stop spending everything he creates in the way of product and saves some of it, accumulates some of it, there will never be any wealth. Out of accumulated capital comes factories. Out of accumulated capital comes machine tools. Out of accumulated capital comes the infrastructure that then produces more wealth. 
The argument in society in the last century or so has not been over that truth. It has been over the question of who should own the accumulated wealth. 
Karl Marx, and others, said that society as a whole should accumulate wealth but that individuals should not. We have already seen one society give us an example of what happens when society holds all of the accumulated wealth and does not allow individual property accumulation. That example was called the Soviet Union, and it is the premier economic basket case of this century. It has wreaked absolute havoc in the lives of all of its people. 
Still the notion that society should own accumulated wealth has some currency in the world, and there are those who call themselves Socialists based on their notion that society should own everything and that the wealth should be accumulated by society. 
We have a different notion in this country. We go back to the writings of Adam Smith, who coincidentally wrote his book, `The Wealth Of Nations' in 1776, which was a good year for this country: The wealth should be held in private hands, that when private people accumulate wealth, they do better things with it than when society as a whole accumulates wealth. 
Why is this important? Because the capital gains tax is a tax on movement of accumulated wealth. It is not a tax on the wealth itself, it is only a tax that is levied when there is a movement of that wealth from one entity to another; or, in our circumstance, from one individual to another, one private corporation to another private corporation. 
I now give you the second great truth that applies in the marketplace. All wealth comes from risk-taking. If someone is not willing to take a risk and invest his or her accumulated wealth in that factory or that machine tool or that plow, with no guarantees that the investment is going to pay off, the wealth that comes from the factory or the machine tool or the plow will never be there. So these two principles guide what we are doing: All wealth comes from accumulated capital and all wealth comes from risk-taking. 
So, what happens when a private individual or corporation accumulates some wealth, accumulates some capital, takes some risk and creates some wealth, and then decides to move that from one investment to another? The Government steps in and says we will tax that movement. That is what the capital gains tax is all about. We will tax the movement of accumulated capital from one investment to another. 
This is what happens--real example, real world, not classroom stuff now. I will give you an example of a friend of mine who invested at great risk in a new venture. He is that kind of fellow. He is an entrepreneur. He takes risks. I'll keep the numbers very simple. Obviously there are more accounting details to this, but the illustration is accurate. He made, let us say, $100,000, and to keep it simple let's rule out the tax base. Let's say he has a cost of zero. In fact it was not that, but a gain of $100,000. 
So now he has $100,000 of accumulated wealth, but what has happened to his investment? Over the years that it has grown from zero to $100,000, it has become what we call a mature investment. That is, it is now earning 10 percent a year and that's about the prospect for this investment from now on. And this guy, because he is an entrepreneur, is restless with a 10 percent return. He wants to take some bigger risks and do some other things with his money. He sees an opportunity over here that will produce him a 20 percent return. Yes, it has a risk. He is willing to take the risk. He is willing to move his accumulated capital from company A to company B. And the Feds step in and say, `We want 28 percent of that, or $28,000.' And the States, of course, follow right along. He is going to end up, moving his capital from company A to company B, with $65,000 worth of accumulated capital instead of $100,000. 
Now, if he earns a 20 percent return on $65,000, for 3 years he will not even break even, back up to his $100,000 where he was. And the $100,000, if he had left it alone, would have earned an additional $30,000. He has to earn a 20 percent return on his $65,000 investment for 5 years just to get even with where he would be if he had left his capital alone. 
Well, you say, so what? This is a rich man, he has $100,000; why are you concerned about him? I am concerned--not about him. He can take care of himself just fine. I am concerned about the people in company B who will not get jobs because they cannot attract investors. Why can't they attract investors? Because the entrepreneurs have their money locked up in the investment that only earns 10 percent. 
He can find somebody who can buy investment A very easily. There are lots of people to say we would be satisfied with a 10 percent return in a mature company, absolutely. We will buy your stake and let you go out and run the risk to do something else. But, no, the capital, by virtue of the capital gains tax, is locked into investment A, because the entrepreneur says I can't afford the tax hit to move my investment capital from investment A to investment B. Therefore, I will not be backing the new rising company that needs funds. 
These people whom I quoted at the beginning say the stock market is going through the roof, and what do they offer as proof of that? The Dow Jones averages. How many people understand the Dow Jones averages are derived from 30 stocks? The Dow Jones Corp. picks 30 companies, baskets them together into a single average, and what happens to the prices of those 30 stocks is described as what is happening to the market as a whole. Yes, they are probably doing a pretty good job of picking some representative stocks, but understand they have only picked 30 companies. The Standard & Poor's index has 500 companies in it, and you know what? It's not going up quite as much as the Dow. Then there is the little known, little followed stock index called the Russell 2000, and as the name indicates, it has 2,000 stocks. But none of the Russell 2,000 stocks are in the Standard & Poor's 500 or even in the Dow 30. These are the new entrepreneurial companies where the jobs for 
the next decade are going to be created. Do you know what is the story in the Russell index? It is down. It is not up the way the Dow is. It is not up the way the Standard & Poor's is. It is down. 
These little companies, struggling along, entrepreneurial efforts, need money. Where are they going to get the investment? Are they going to get it from the big venture capitalists who like to back them? Maybe, if they can make their presentation. But they will find, time and again, that the venture capitalists who would otherwise be taken with their presentation and give them backing will say to them, `I'm sorry, I am locked in by the capital gains tax. I am locked in with an investment that would cost me so much in tax, if I were to sell and back you, that I will not make that money available to you.' I have personally seen this phenomenon take place. I have been present when discussions of this have gone on, and I know, very differently from the way it may appear in a classroom, that in the real market the capital gains tax at its present level is stopping entrepreneurs from moving their capital from one investment to the other and making capital available to the entrepreneurial companies that would create the jobs of the future. 
I said on this floor before and I repeat here again, I challenge every Member of this body to go home to his or her home State, gather the venture capitalists in the home State together, gather the real estate investors, if you will, in the home State together, and ask this one question: Are there deals that should be done not being done because of the capital gains tax? I have asked that question in my home State and I am told, almost with a laugh: All over, Senator. Everywhere you look there are deals that should be done, certainly could be done, but are not being done because of the capital gains tax. 
Now, ask this question: Are the deals that should be done the deals that have the greatest potential for job creation in the future? And the answer is, once again: Yes. So then I ask the question: What is going on? And I am told, look, Senator, there are so many cockamamie trade-outs being done, ways to avoid a realization of any kind of a gain that are being put together by lawyers and accountants because they want to back this in one way or another but they cannot take the hit that will come if they move their capital from investment A to investment B, so they are jerry-rigging all kinds of deals that will ultimately rise up and bite them in ways that will be detrimental. 
I started off by quoting Alan Blinder, with whom I disagree, and identifying him as a former Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. I close by quoting the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan. Alan Greenspan has a reputation of his own. He has a reputation that has brought him praise from Members of this body on both sides of the aisle. I have sat in the Banking Committee and on the Joint Economic Committee and heard my Democratic colleagues congratulate Mr. Greenspan for the deft and intelligent way he has handled monetary policy in this country. 
Mr. Greenspan tells us what the capital gains tax rate ought to be for the greatest benefit of the economy. He recommends a capital gains tax rate, not of 18 percent, as proposed out of the Finance Committee, not of 14 percent, as proposed by the Dole campaign, but zero. Because he understands the basic principles that I outlined in the beginning: All wealth comes from the process of investing accumulated capital and all wealth comes from risk-taking with that capital. The capital gains tax is a tax on that process. The capital gains tax by definition is a tax that will hold down the creation of wealth. 
Alan Greenspan understands that the greatest boon that can come for this country is the creation of more and more wealth and that is why he calls for a capital gains tax rate of zero. I think we are being very modest when we call for a capital gains tax rate of 18 percent. I hope those responsible for these articles and these comments in the Washington Post would go back to school at the feet of Professor Greenspan and learn again where wealth comes from and what we need to do in the Government to foster its creation. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BENNETT. I will not prolong this particular debate about depots, but I was passing through and heard it going on and could not resist the opportunity to make some comments about it. The issue clearly will be debated at greater length and I will have more statistics and information at that time. 
The point I want to make in this context has to do with the issues raised by the Senator from Georgia and the Senator from Oklahoma regarding readiness and capability in the depots. It is the corrosive effect of a depot operating at less than full capacity or even approaching full capacity. 
If I may, I will share with the Senate my experience at Hill Air Force Base where we have the air logistics depot that was rated No. 1 during the last BRAC process. Let it be understood there were five depots that BRAC looked at, and according to the ratings that were given these depots, Hill Air Force Base was rated No. 1, McClellan Air Force Base which BRAC said should be closed was rated No. 5, and Kelly Air Force Base, which BRAC said should be closed was rated No. 4. 
However, the expected shift of workload from Kelly and McClellan to the surviving three has not taken place. At the Hill Air Force Base they are now down to about 52 percent of capacity. There has been a lot of conversation here about how inefficient and expensive that is. I agree with all that conversation. It is ineffecient and expensive. But it is more corrosive than that in terms of what it is doing to the personnel on whom we will depend at some point for support if there is a war. 
The work force at Hill is aging. As people leave, they are not replaced. Why should they be--the capacity of the base is not being used, so as attrition comes along and people leave, they are not replaced. The people who are looking toward retirement in the next 5 to 10 years recognize they will not be replaced if this capacity problem is not solved. Their morale is down. When they speak to the people in the surrounding community who might want to apply for jobs, be trained and acquire the expertise that we will need, the present folk tell them, quite understandably and logically, `Don't bother. Don't come to work here. The Air Force has no loyalty to its personnel. The Air Force has no loyalty to this depot. They have done everything they can to close the depot by keeping work spread out at other depots around the country.' 
The time will come, and it will come relatively soon in terms of international defense issues, that is, within the next 5 to 10 years, when we will not have a work force at all. These people will have retired, they will have left, no one will have come in to be trained, and the Air Force will suddenly sit there and say, who can we get to do this work at virtually any price, at any place? Depots do not manage themselves. It takes people. Problems do not get solved by facilities, it takes people. 
The process the Air Force is following in this privatization 
in place procedure is corrosive and destructive of not only the morale but the skills of the people at each one of these depots. We would not have this problem at Hill Air Force Base if Hill Air Force Base were operating at 75, 80 or 85 percent of capacity. People would be busy doing productive, worthwhile things. 
Now they are painting rocks--not literally, but figuratively. I have been in the Army. I know what happens when the drill sergeant has you for the afternoon and has nothing for you to do. He requires that you go out in front of the barracks and pick up all the rocks and paint them and then put them back. That is not a really good morale experience to go through. I have gone through that. I think just about anybody who has gone through training in the American military has had that kind of experience from time to time. You want to spend your time in worthwhile activities, in real training, but they have you for the afternoon, they do not have anything for you to do, and military life being what it is, they will not let you go, so the top sergeant has you out there painting rocks. Well, figuratively, many of the people at Hill Air Force Base are drawing their full salary, charging the taxpayer the full cost, but they are painting rocks. Why? Because the work they should be doing is still being done on the bases that the BRAC ordered to be closed. 
We can talk about the price, we can talk about the money that is being wasted, we can talk about the inefficiency, but we should not lose sight of the corrosive impact on the morale, the expertise and the ultimate future of the work force that will be necessary to keep this country alive and strong in the defense in the future. 
I hope the members of the Armed Services Committee who address this issue keep this in mind, along with all of the other issues. We are arguing about jobs and where they will be. We are arguing about dollars and where they will be spent. However, we are in an exercise created by the Air Force's refusal to abide by the requirements of BRAC, that is terribly corrosive of the work force, and ultimately the readiness capacity of this Nation. 
It is very difficult to measure but that does not mean it is not real. It is very difficult to pin down in specifics, but that does not mean it is not serious. It is real. It is serious. It is going on, and the BRAC process must be implemented as quickly as possible in order to stop it.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I spoke on this amendment this morning when the bill was under consideration. So I will not repeat most of my arguments at this point. It is stimulated by a report this morning from the Secretary of Defense, which indicates that the Chinese Precision Machinery Import-Export Corp. has exported multiple versions of the C-802 missiles to Iran. I have notified the Senate in the past that this company has exported to Iran this particular missile for use first on ships, then for land-based operations, and today with Secretary Cohen's announcement we find that the missile will be made available to the Iranians--indeed, is available to the Iranians for use from the air. It can be fired either from an attacker or a helicopter. 
This is a reproduction from the Chinese promotional material that was used to sell this missile. 
One of the officers quoted in the briefing that the Secretary of Defense gave this morning said, with the addition of the air capability, the 15,000 American service men and women in the gulf now face a 360-degree threat from land, from sea, and from air. 
To demonstrate the power of the missile involved here, I remind the Senate that an Exocet missile 10 years ago struck the U.S.S. Stark and killed 37 American sailors. This missile is a more modern, more powerful, and more deadly version. 
Mr. President, I have been pressing the administration on this issue since the first of this year, having asked questions of Secretary Albright and submitting letters to Secretary Albright. All I have received is a comment from the State Department that they will `monitor' the situation. 
Mr. President, that is simply not good enough. There are 15,000 American service men and women within the range of these missiles in the Persian Gulf, and we need to stop this trade and stop it now. There is an ability to do this under what is called the Gore-McCain Act, which gives the President the opportunity to put sanctions on companies that violate the law and says you will not export this kind of weaponry to Iran. 
My amendment urges the administration to enforce the Gore-McCain Act and is nothing more complicated than that. 
With that, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, if I may, Mr. President, I would like to take just a few minutes on a related but different subject. We have been talking about blowing people up here this morning with landmines. I would not intrude on that debate with another issue, except that it is hot off the press this morning. 
Secretary Cohen has revealed that Chinese military companies have exported a dangerous new weapon to Iran. I have discussed this weapon on the floor before. But this is a dangerous new development, and I would like to call the attention of Senators to what Secretary Cohen has revealed this morning. 
We have here a drawing of the C-802 antishipping cruise missile that is designed by the Chinese on the basis of the Exocet missile. Here is a picture of the U.S.S. Stark that was struck by an Exocet missile 10 years ago, in which 37 American sailors were killed. The Stark was out of commission for a full year. Ten years later, the C-802 is considered to be a more lethal weapon than the one that struck the Stark. 
Here is a picture of a Chinese freighter, on the fantail of which they have loaded five missile boats which are being sent to Iran, each one of them with missile launchers, and four tubes that can be used against American shipping in the gulf. I have shown this picture to the Senate before. I have also shown this next picture to the Senate, a land-based C-802 which has been exported to Iran by Chinese companies. 
This morning Secretary Cohen told us that Chinese companies have added a final dimension to their export. We have a picture from the Chinese sales brochure of a helicopter equipped with the C-802, and the Chinese sales brochure says: `Air to Ship. The air-launched C-802, named C-801K, can be adapted to aircraft such as attackers and helicopters.' This picture out of the sales brochure shows this missile as it has been exported to Iran. 
Mr. President, there is a law against this kind of thing. It is called the Gore-McCain Act. Secretary Cohen now says that because of the actions of Chinese companies, Iranian forces can threaten American servicemen and women literally from 360 degrees--land, water, and now air. 
I intend to offer an amendment to the underlying legislation that we will take up in just a few moments calling upon the administration to enforce the Gore-McCain Act against those Chinese companies that are exporting this technology to Iran in violation of American law. The Secretary of State has already invoked the other sanctions laws by bringing sanctions against Chinese companies that have exported poison gas to Iran. I want to, here, now, apply that same principle to the exportation of these missiles. 
Again, Mr. President, I would not intrude on this debate on landmines with this information if it had not just come up this morning with Secretary Cohen's announcement that this export has taken place and that the dangerous new weapon is now has a dangerous new dimension in Iran.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Dutch John Privatization Act of 1997 with my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch. 
I want to explain to my colleagues the history of this community. The town of Dutch John, UT, was established in 1958 by the Bureau of Reclamation to house personnel and equipment during the construction of the Flaming Gorge Dam and Reservoir on the Green River. During this construction period, the town housed over 2,000 people. After the completion of the dam, Dutch John continued to serve as the residence of approximately 175 people, including Federal Government employees and others associated with the Flaming Gorge Dam and Recreation Area. 
To this day, basic services for Dutch John, as well as the operative and administrative costs for the town, have been an unnecessary financial burden for the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Forest Service. The cost of providing the full range of community facilities and services--including that of the landlord for the town--have substantially risen over the years, approaching $1 million annually. The time has arrived to transfer the ownership and maintenance of this town into local hands. 
For several years, the involved Federal agencies have worked with Daggett County officials and residents in drafting a Dutch John privatization proposal that would protect all affected interests. The outcome of this process is the Dutch John Privatization Act of 1997. This legislation would provide for the transfer of selected Federal property into private ownership; dispose several residential units, public building and facilities; provide for a transition to local government administration and reduce long-term Federal expenditures. 
This legislation would transfer approximately 2,400 acres of land, identified by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Reclamation as no longer necessary to fulfill the agencies' mission, out of Federal ownership. Residents would have the ability to purchase the homes they currently rent from the Bureau of Reclamation at fair market value. Federal agencies would retain ownership of identified needed facilities, including the U.S. Forest Service warehouse and office complex, the Bureau of Reclamation industrial complex, certain personnel housing and the heliport. 
As the Federal Government ceases to provide basic community services, such as roads, water, and sewer, local government would be required to assume these responsibilities. Daggett County would receive an annual grant from public power revenues, for 15 years, in order to offset the costs of transition while a traditional community tax base is created. 
This bill is a win-win situation. The Federal Government will initially save more than one-half million dollars per year, and after 15 years, will eliminate altogether an expensive obligation. Dutch John will be a self-sustaining community while providing necessary services for the 2 million people that visit the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area each year. 
After 25 years, Dutch John as a government-run town has become an anachronism. This legislation is in the best long-term interest of Federal, State, and local governments. I urge my colleagues to join me in saving the Federal Government the costs of administering the town of Dutch John while providing the means to start a community with a small-resort commercial base in one of the most remote parts of Utah.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the nomination that is before the Senate of Lt. Gen. George T. Babbitt, Jr. to be promoted and receive an additional star to become general in the U.S. Air Force. 
When this nomination came to the Senate at an earlier time several months ago, I notified the majority leader that I would like to be informed prior to its coming to a vote. In Senate parlance, that is called putting a hold on this nomination. It was never my intention to hold up General Babbitt from receiving his additional star. But it was my intention to focus seriously on the policy of the Air Force which General Babbitt will be called upon to implement. Accordingly, I told the majority leader that I do not want this nomination to go forward until we have had an opportunity to discuss that policy in some length. The majority leader responded appropriately to my request, and we have had a series of events that I think satisfy my requirement for full discussion. I would like to outline those for the Senate today before I make it clear that I will have no further objection to proceeding with the nomination of General Babbitt. I speak entirely for myself. There are a number of other Senators who have also put holds on this nomination. What they will do with their holds is something that they will, of course, speak to on their own. I am speaking entirely, as I say, for myself on this matter. 
I have been criticized by some Members of this body for putting a hold on a nomination for a member of the uniformed services, and was told, `No. This should apply only to civilian personnel in the Department of Defense. You are using the uniformed services for a political purpose.' 
Mr. President, if anyone has been using the uniformed services for political purposes and political gain it has been the Department of Defense, not the Senator from Utah. The Department of Defense, under instructions from the Base Realignment and Closure Commission--or BRCC--was told to close two of its five air logistics centers. That would be the best result for the uniformed services; in this case the Air Force.

Mr. BENNETT. General Babbitt agreed that he would do whatever he could within the constraints of the policy laid down by the Air Force to give us intelligent management of this problem. That is the first sign of cooperation that I have seen out of this administration since this issue first arose. 
So, Mr. President, because General Babbitt has made it clear, now that we have had our hearings in the Armed Services Committee, we have had our hearings in the Appropriations Committee, we have had our meeting with the Secretary of the Air Force, and we have had our meeting with him, that he will do what he can to address the issue within the constraints placed upon him by his civilian superiors to try to solve the problem, I am announcing my willingness to no longer insist that his nomination be held up. The purposes for which I made that insistence in the first place have been fulfilled. 
I will allow him to go forward to his additional star and his command, and I look forward to staying in touch with him in the spirit of the pledges he made to me and the other Senators this morning to see that this issue is properly resolved once and for all in the long term. 
In sum, Mr. President, I am in no way backing down from my conviction that this administration is shamelessly playing politics on this issue and has involved the uniformed services in a way that is totally inappropriate. I do not wish to be accused of doing the same thing in response because my desire is to solve the problem. I am hoping the administration will address it in the same spirit.

Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair. 
There is an old line in politics that applies in campaigning that says when you are explaining, you are losing. And there would be those who say, because of the technicalities of the explanations we have to give about this fairly technical matter, we are probably losing the issue. 
However, if you are explaining, it does not necessarily mean you are wrong. I am going to do my best to try to be as simple in my explanation today because we are not wrong on this one. This is not an issue where the Senators from the Western States are trying to do something improper for the rest of the country, something parochial just for ourselves. These are fundamental issues and they should be clearly explained and understood. 
I would like to focus on one road and one circumstance that will help explain this matter. I picked this road because it is perhaps the most controversial R.S. 2477 road in all of Utah. It has a very romantic name. Its been called the Burr Trail. I do not know who Burr was, and I do not know what trail he or she made across this land in the first place. I suppose at some point somebody will tell me all of that. Frankly, as I read about it in the newspapers and heard people talk about the Burr Trail before I became a Senator, I had visions of a footpath going through a forest. That is what a trail means to me. And then I was elected to the Senate and had to get into the details. 
This is, Mr. President, a picture of the Burr Trail. As the Presiding Officer can clearly see, this is a road. It is 28 feet wide. It is a well-traveled road. I have been on it. No, I did not need an all-terrain vehicle to get on it. I was on it in a street-legal vehicle, driving along it. It is used, whatever Mr. or Mrs. Burr anticipated, as the principal way the residents of Garfield County can get from one end of that county to another. It happens to run through the Capitol Reef National Park. It was with the full consent of the Federal Government that the western Burr Trail across BLM lands was improved. The lands in dispute have to do with the 8 miles of road that go through the Capitol Reef National Park. 
This sign the Presiding Officer cannot see, as far away as he is, says, `Entering Capitol Reef National Park.' I would call your attention to this sign as a guidepost because I am now going to show you a second picture of the Burr Trail taken somewhat after the first one, and here again is the identifying sign to show you where we are. There is one difference. If you would remember from the first picture, you will see that this is a blind curve. As you are coming down the Burr Trail here, if there is traffic coming the other way, you are not going to be able to see it. It is a blind curve. There could be an accident. Under R.S. 2477, the responsibility of maintaining the Burr Trail lies with the county. They own it. It is a right-of-way that they have received according to Federal law. The county went out and cut off 4 feet of land. As I said, the Burr Trail is 28 feet wide. As it got to this particular point, it narrowed to only 20, so the county decided to widen it to 24--not 28, not widen this curve as wide 
as the rest of the road but just take 4 feet off so you get a little bit of a view around the blind curve. They did that under their existing rights established by the Congress. 
Well, the reaction that occurred in the Interior Department would have had you believe they had gone into Yellowstone National Park and bulldozed Old Faithful. Interior officials were sent from Washington, DC, to Garfield County, sat down across the table from Garfield County officials and demanded that those officials immediately sign over their right to any meaningful management authority over the right-of-way. They also assured them that if county officials did not, they could face the full power and force of the Federal Government in Federal courts in the form of an aggressive legal action. 
This is not the only sin these county officials committed by creating an opportunity to see around the corner, by taking 4 feet off of an area that was, they understood, legitimately within their right-of-way. 
When they took this action, they did not realize they were setting off such an enormous controversy. 
County officials did some other things on this road. They also made some improvements where the washboard effect had been created. They made some improvements where there had been debris that got on the road. They did changes in a normal maintenance circumstance, and for this they are now in Federal court with the full force of the U.S. Justice Department accusing them of all kinds of terrible environmental sins. 
I am sorry, Mr. President, I do not see the terrible environmental sin, going from the first circumstance of this kind of a curve to this circumstance; of taking a road that is 28 feet wide, narrows going around that curve to 20, and saying, no, we will make it go around the curve at 24 feet. I do not know that this merits the kind of wrath that has been brought down by the Interior Department on the officials of Garfield County. But that is what we are faced with. 
That is what we are talking about here, Mr. President. It has little or nothing to do with the road. It has little or nothing to do with the county maintaining this kind of right-of-way. It has to do with is who is going to make the decisions. The Federal Government is determined they will make the decisions whether the Congress gives them the right to do it or not. They will ride roughshod over the rights of the States and the counties whether the Congress gives them the authority or not. When the Congress specifically refused to give them the authority, this Secretary of the Interior said, `All right, if the Congress won't give me the authority, I will usurp it. I will take it on my own and see if the Congress has the willingness to demand that I live up to prior agreements.' 
That is what this amendment is all about, a demand that the administration live up to prior agreements. That is what it is all about, the issue of can the States depend on the acts of Congress in terms of maintaining their existing rights. 
Mr. President, I would like to show you another picture. This one is not as controversial as the first pictures we have just seen. Those who say R.S. 2477 roads are mere trails, R.S. 2477 roads are mere footpaths, here is a picture of an R.S. 2477 road in the State of Utah. Why do I pick this particular one? Not because it is paved; there are plenty of R.S. 2477 roads in Utah that are paved. I picked this one because this is the road that millions of tourists will take when they come to the newly created Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. This is the road those tourists will have to use to come see the 1.7 million acres that the President spoke about so lyrically on the south side of the Grand Canyon last September. It runs for about 70 miles. 
If we decide that the Secretary is right and the Federal Government has jurisdiction over this road, I can tell you what the counties will decide. You take away their property rights in this road and the counties will say, `Since you have taken our property rights, you maintain the road. It is not our road anymore, let's allow the Federal Government maintain it.' This is the kind of responsibility we are going to give to the Bureau of Land Management if we accept the motion of the senior Senator from Arkansas. 
Frankly, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I do not want that responsibility. I do not want to take on additional Federal financial burdens. When there is a county more than willing and able to maintain the road, I say, why don't we let it do it? We will not let it do it because the Secretary of the Interior says, `We want jurisdiction. We want jurisdiction over this road. We cannot trust the county to maintain the road.' 
I ask you, Mr. President, does this demonstrate that the county cannot be trusted to maintain the road? 
No, the real issue is that there are a number of roads in rural Utah that the Federal Government officials want closed. That is why they want to take away the property rights of those roads away from the counties, because they wants the roads closed. They 
want the roads shut down. The impact of shutting down the roads will be that, ultimately, people will move from the county because they cannot conduct commerce anymore. Ultimately, they would like to see southern Utah rid of human beings except those who work in motels and in fast-food places, people who have tourist oriented jobs. But they want no other jobs down there because they do not want any other economic activity in southern Utah to continue.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have several matters to discuss with the Senate this afternoon. The first one I would like to touch upon has to do with the budget agreement that was reached over the weekend between negotiators on behalf of the Congress and the President of the United States. 
There has been a lot of conversation over the weekend on the talk shows about how terrible this agreement is. I have read where Democrats have attacked the agreement on the grounds that President Clinton has caved in to Republican demands. One Democratic commentator, a former staffer to the President, has said this deal guarantees the reelection of a Republican-controlled Congress in 1998. It is just awful. 
Then another commentator says this deal demonstrates how badly the Republicans have caved in to the President. It means the President can no longer be attacked for his failure to step up to the responsibility of dealing with taxes in a logical way or of dealing with Medicare in a responsible way. It is just awful. 
There are some who say, when both sides say it is just awful, that means it is truly awful. And then there are others who say, no, when both sides agree it is not what they want, it means we have finally arrived at the logical answer, somewhere down the middle. 
I think all of this is a little bit shortsighted. I want to stand and commend those who were involved in the negotiations for having accomplished something truly worthwhile. Does it do what I would like it to do in relation to the Tax Code? The answer is, `Clearly not.' We need to do far more about our taxes than this deal will do. Does it solve the Medicare problem in a responsible, long-term way? The answer is, `Clearly not.' It simply postpones the issue until we will have to deal with Medicare again. This, too, I find disappointing. In both instances we will see the details come up in the Finance Committee, and I hope the Finance Committee, within the parameters of the deal, can fashion resolutions to these problems that are better than the ones that we have seen talked about in the press up until now. 
But as we complain, one side and the other, about the deal not being what we would like, we overlook what I think is a truly significant accomplishment. For the first time in my watching of this process, either as a Member of the Senate or as an observer from the outside, we have a budget deal that does not depend upon smoke and mirrors for its budget figures to be reliable. We have a budget deal that does not say we will postpone all of the hard decisions to the fourth and fifth or sixth years. Instead, it says we will start to face the realities of what is happening around us right now. That is a very significant thing. 
The second thing I would like to comment on with respect to this deal was given reference to in this morning's Wall Street Journal in their editorial. They said the real hero of these budget negotiations is neither the administration nor the Congress, but the American economy. The reason we were able to finally arrive at a conclusion that seemed to satisfy temporarily both sides is because the economy is doing so well that the projections indicate that we will have more tax revenue than the earlier projections would have shown. I want to dwell on that for a moment. I gave a major speech on the floor a week or so ago in which I tried to get across the importance of the overall growth of the economy in our budget discussions. We talk about the budget as if everything is a sum zero game, that is, if we take it away from here, you must give it someplace else, and everything adds up to a 
single sum. 
That is not the case. The economy is like a business, constantly growing, constantly changing. I made the point in that previous speech that a sound business executive running a $1.7 trillion corporation would not have the simple choice of either raising prices or cutting spending. We hear the discussion on the floor so often that those are our only two choices in Government. We can either raise tax rates, which is the same thing as raising prices for a business, or we can cut spending, when, in fact, every business executive knows there are times when you can raise your prices and get away with it, and there are times when you should cut your prices in order to increase your market share. There are times when you do need to cut spending if it is wasteful or improper, but there are other times, when you are investing in the future, where you need to increase spending. This budget, for the first time in many years, seems to go down those roads. 
There are some areas where we are cutting tax rates, as we should--cutting prices, if you will--to increase our market share and make the economy healthier. There are other places where we do need to cut some spending, and some places where we need to increase some spending. That is what upsets so many of my colleagues on the right side of the aisle. They treat all Government spending as if it is, per se, evil, and any single dollar they can cut out of the budget they assume is good. 
They remind me a little of an executive I knew in a company who was under heavy pressure to start to produce profits in his division. He responded to that pressure, and pretty soon the profits started to come in. His boss thought he was a hero. He said, `Well, I did it by cutting spending.' 
It was a year or so later that we discovered in that company what kind of spending he had cut. He had cut routine maintenance, and the physical plant over which he had responsibility was literally falling apart because the routine maintenance had not been done. He was a temporary hero by cutting spending, but, long term, he damaged the business and did damage to the interests of the shareholders. 
Our Nation's infrastructure has some significant problems. The air transport problems are very obvious to all. The highway problems are fairly significant and obvious. We need to be doing something about that. This budget allows us to have some of that, yes, increased spending in areas where it makes some sense. Why? Again, because the economy is doing so well. 
I have been on this floor when some of my friends have berated Alan Greenspan and said what a terrible job he is doing at the Fed because he has controlled the money supply in a way that they do not like. Can we now suggest it may well be that the current growth of the economy stems from wise stewardship at the Fed, and that, indeed, the reason we can afford some of these increased spending activities called for in this budget come from an intelligent management of the economy long term. Can we also suggest that this has come from an attitude at the Federal Reserve Board that says we must put price stability above all else and it will pay long-term dividends? Maybe it is those dividends we are beginning to cash in on in this budget deal. 
There is another thought I would like to leave with you, Mr. President, in terms of the economy and how well it is doing. I have spoken on this floor before about my experience as a business executive during what many people called the decade of greed, the 1980's, when we took a small company, so small it had four full-time employees, and saw it grow to the point, when I left prior to my run for the Senate, when it had 700 employees. I have commented it was the tax policies that were pursued in those years, pursued primarily by President Ronald Reagan, that made it possible for us to grow that company. But we were attacked because it was the decade of greed, and, yes, indeed, we did do well. 
I would like to point out that that company that grew in that period from 4 employees to 700, now has over 3,000. The momentum that was set in place in the 1980's is carrying forward into 
the 1990's, and it is that company and others like it that are providing the income taxes that make it possible for us to have this kind of a budget deal. 
So, as we look at the whole thing, let us understand that there are many things about it that I do not like. There are many things about it that many of the rest of us do not like. But the reason we were able to get this degree of agreement comes from the strength of the economy, and the one lesson we should learn, as we look at this budget agreement, is simply this: As important as anything else we do around here are those things that we do that will cause the economy to grow at a more rapid rate. Whether it is increasing taxes in a certain area or decreasing tax rates in another area, whether it is increasing spending on things like infrastructure and other investments, or whether it is decreasing spending on areas where there is a degree of waste and fraud, all of these things need to be done with the primary goal of seeing that the economy will increase in size. 
As it does, a number of things happen. The demand on our social spending goes down. There is no better welfare project in the world than a job, and a booming economy creates more jobs for more people. And we see it in terms of the impact on Government. We should pay attention to those kinds of things. 
Mr. President, I will have more to say on this as the budget process goes forward, but, while the weekend talk shows were still ringing in our ears, I wanted to make this general statement. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to continue as in morning business, on another subject, for up to another 5 minutes.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am submitting today a resolution to address a matter that I consider vital to our national security. I have here a picture of the U.S.S. Stark that was disabled 10 years ago by an Exocet missile fired by the Iranians. Thirty-seven American sailors were killed in this disaster. 
I call your attention to a new missile patterned after the Exocet, only it is described by its sales brochures as having a `mighty attack capability with great firepower.' This is the C-802, an antishipping cruise missile. The sales group that is touting the mighty power of the C-802 is the Chinese. The Chinese have taken the Exocet and increased its power and increased its deadliness. 
The C-802 is being shipped. This picture shows a Chinese vessel, on the deck of which there are five smaller vessels, each one of which is equipped with four C-802's. You can see them on the back of the ships. These are the smaller ships on the back deck of this larger cargo vessel. 
Those ships are en route to Iran. The Chinese have now sold to Iran some 60 C-802's for their use in the Persian Gulf. Some 60 are mounted on 15 patrol boats. These patrol boats, again, have four missiles each. 
If one missile could damage the Stark as badly as we saw in the first picture, you see what 15 missiles could do. But the Chinese are not stopping with shipboard missiles. Here is an example of a land-based C-802, and the Chinese are now in the process of selling these to the Iranians. 
Why should we be concerned about the land-based C-802? Here is a map of the Persian Gulf. This land mass is Iran. There are 500 miles of Iranian coastal waters facing the Persian Gulf. This is the Strait of Hormuz through which a very large percentage of the world's oil must go every day, something in excess of 25 percent. The Iranians have repeatedly threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz if the rest of the world does not do what Iran wishes it to do in a variety of ways. We heard such a threat, again, over the weekend with the Iranians saying that if the Americans were to try to take any kind of retaliatory action against Iranian terrorism, they would close this Strait of Hormuz. 
With land-based C-802's, they could hide them in caves or put them in other locations all along this 500-mile area, so that any shipping coming out of Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, or Saudi Arabia into the Persian Gulf would be vulnerable to an attack from a land-based C-802. With 15 patrol boats, each one having 4 missiles, or 60 sea-based missiles, the Iranians could actually attack from either side, having the patrol boats out here on one side of the shipping lanes, with the land-based missiles on the other, and effectively seal off the world's supply of oil from the Middle East without too much difficulty. 
In personal human terms, there are about 15,000 U.S. servicemen and servicewomen within the range of the C-802 missiles in the gulf. 
Mr. President, there is a law known as the Gore-McCain Act passed in 1992 which says that foreign companies that deliver cruise missiles to Iran are subject to sanctions. I raised this issue with Secretary Albright, and I have raised it since in subsequent hearings. In January, Secretary Albright informed me that the administration will not enforce the terms of the Gore-McCain Act on the grounds that the missiles are not `destabilizing.' 
I am not quite sure what the word `destabilizing' means in this kind of a circumstance, but that is where the administration has chosen to come down. 
I believe that a nondestabilizing missile can be just as deadly to a ship as a destabilizing missile. Once a missile is fired, it knows no semantic definition, as it goes on its course for a kill. Ask the sailors on the Stark whether the presence of the Exocet missiles were destabilizing in the circumstance in the Middle East or not. Thirty-seven of them are dead. 
Given our obligation to those that we would place in harm's way in the name of this country, I believe the time has come to put this issue on the front burner. I have asked the administration about it. I have used the congressional oversight circumstance to bring it to their attention. Now, Mr. President, today, I submit a resolution outlining the sense of the Senate that the administration either enforce the Gore-McCain Act in this circumstance or take some other appropriate action.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, this time of year is budget time. Since it is budget time, it is a time when the Senate Chamber has been filled with speeches about budgets, debt, the economy, taxes, and all the rest of the subjects that have to do with our joint effort--joint, meaning Members of both parties, Members of both Houses, Members of both branches, the executive as well as the legislative--to achieve a balanced budget by the year 2002. That is a very laudable goal, one that has been put off for too long. I am delighted to be here representing the State of Utah as the Congress launches itself in this effort. 
However, as I have listened to these speeches on both sides of the aisle, it has occurred to me that there is more political sloganeering than analytical analysis that leads toward a better understanding of the problems we face. Therefore, I take the floor today in an effort to lay out what I think is a clear understanding of where we are and what we are looking at with respect to the budget, our deficit, and our future. 
One of Washington's most thoughtful and capable political reporters, David Broder, did a column on this subject in which he addressed the issue of whether or not we should have tax cuts in the middle of the debate over balancing the budget. He coined a magnificently succinct phrase. He lauded those who said we must put off tax cuts until the budget is balanced, stating it this way: `In other words, eat your spinach before you get the dessert.' 
It is a great phrase and worthy of Mr. Broder's skill as a journalist. It also happens to be wrong. 
It implies that tax cuts are without nourishment and have no contribution to the meal. They are a reward for doing your job rather than an integral part of doing your job. Much as I respect Mr. Broder and those who have echoed this sentiment in this Chamber, I think that they are in error. We must examine the whole circumstance of where we are in order to understand the role that proper tax policy can play. 
Now, in this Chamber, one very familiar image has been with us during this debate which, like David Broder's phrase, is very compelling and very easy to understand. The image is drawn by people on both sides of the aisle, of a family, sitting around the table in their kitchen, going over the family budget. The father 
says to the members of the family, `We cannot balance our family budget. Our income is not sufficient to cover the expenses.' Then the father says to the mother, and solemnly to the gathered children, `We have only two choices. We can either somehow convince the boss down at the factory to give us a raise or we can cut our expenditures. Since the boss is not inclined to give us a raise, we will have to tighten our belts, do the right thing, and cut back on our expenditures.' 
After we conger that image to mind, those in this Chamber are told the Government is the same way. We must tighten our belts, stop the spending, cut down on the expenditures just like that family. Again, it is a powerful image. It is easily remembered. It surrounded by a great deal of emotion, and it is wholly wrong, just like the spinach and the dessert. 
In the process of hearing about the families, we always see this chart. It is displayed by people on both sides of the aisle. This is the chart showing what is happening to the national debt. The national debt is so low it did not show up on the chart in the years prior to 1941, and then gradually it starts creeping up and stays about level and then suddenly it explodes and people point to this chart and remember the family, and say a family that is going into debt this rapidly is headed for absolute disaster. 
I want to ask you to consider a different image, a different table, and a different group sitting around the table, that will help us understand, in my view, what is really going on in the economy. Instead of a family sitting around the table talking about their finances, let us consider a group of business people sitting around a boardroom table of a company. The chief executive officer of the company, we will give him the title of chairman of the board, the chairman of the board calls his people together and says to them, `We have a deficit in this company of about $1 million a month. If we cannot solve that deficit problem we will go bankrupt. What can we do to deal with a deficit of $1 million a month?' 
His first expert steps up and says, `Mr. Chairman, I have examined this issue very carefully and I can tell you what it is we need to do. Without question, we can solve our problem if we simply raise our prices. We are selling $50 million a month worth of our products. So if we raise our prices 2 1/2 percent, we will make enough money to cover our $1 million a month deficit.' Case closed. All you need to do is raise your prices. 
The next expert stands up and says, `Mr. Chairman, I have been considering this. Raising prices is absolutely the worst thing you could do. As a matter of fact, I know the answer to our problem. We must cut prices. Yes, our problem is that our competition is cutting into our market share. We are losing sales right and left because our prices are too high. If we simply cut our prices by 5 percent across the board, the increased volume will do two things for us. No. 1, our total sales will go up; and No. 2, our cost of sales will come down as we get economies to spread over a larger number of units. So I disagree absolutely with the first expert. He says raise prices, and I say cut prices.' 
Then the third expert stands up and addresses the chairman in our boardroom and he says, `No, they are both wrong. The price structure is just fine. What we must do is spend more money on plant and equipment. Our factory is outmoded, our costs are enormously high in the factory. If we spend another $50 million on the factory and retooling and new equipment, we would cut our overall cost of manufacturing by more than $1 million a month, and we would get out of the deficit circumstance.' 
When he sits down, the fourth expert stands up and she says to the chairman of the board, `Mr. Chairman, they are all wrong. We do not need to raise prices or cut prices. We certainly do not need to increase spending. All we need to do is cut spending, cut the overhead. Our overhead is running about $11 million a month, and if we cut it 10 percent that would give us the $1 million a month we need to come to a break-even position.' 
So there sits the chairman of the board. He has four groups 
advising him. The four groups are saying to him, `raise prices, cut prices, increase spending, cut spending.' He thanks them all for their efforts. They leave. He is there, left alone with his assistant who does not have a great deal of experience in the business, and looks at the chairman of the board and says to him, `OK, you have four options. Which one are you going to take?' Because we are dealing with a wise chairman who has a great deal of experience in the free market system, he smiles at his assistant and says, `All four.' 
Yes, Mr. President, all four. When you manage a business that is constantly changing from day to day, as every business is, and you realize that you cannot put in a static pattern and then leave it forever, you realize that you have some products that are not price sensitive, and you can raise the price and thereby increase your margins without having any punishment in the marketplace. You have some products that are, perhaps, overpriced or need a lower price in order to increase their hold on the market, so you cut the prices on those products. 
Yes, you have some increased spending for plant and equipment, research and development. It is the future of your business that depends on your increased spending in those areas. Of course, there are always areas where you have to cut spending. 
In Government terms, what we are saying with this pattern is, if this were the Government sitting around that table instead of a business, there would be some areas where you would cut taxes, some areas where you would raise taxes, some areas where you would cut spending, and some areas where you would raise spending. It is not the simple either/or circumstance of the family sitting around the kitchen table. It is the very challenging management problem of a business sitting around the board table and trying to figure out how to maximize its profits and, at the same time, make the right kind of investments for the future. 
With that new image in our minds, let's address what is, I think, the fundamental question here: How do we manage the economy intelligently? Particularly, the challenge is, how do we manage an economy--think of it in business terms--that is doing $7 trillion worth of business every year? Just think of this. If you were the chief executive officer of a business that was doing $7 trillion worth of business every year, how would you manage that challenge? You obviously would have to look at all four of the options I have outlined. 
Well, in order to understand how to manage this economy, we start by asking ourselves, where are we? You cannot manage a business without accurate data, without accurate information and reports. In other words, we can't do the business of the country without accurate information. 
I submit to you, Mr. President, that while this chart is enormously popular and enormously emotional in the message that it sends, like the vision of the family sitting around the kitchen table, it is not adequate. No, the numbers are not inaccurate; the numbers are correct. But the question is: Debt compared to what? 
If I may repeat an example I have given on the Senate floor before to illustrate this point, I will take you back to my own business career. When I was hired as the chief executive officer of the Franklin Institute in Salt Lake City, that company had debt of $75,000. When I left, prior to my run for the U.S. Senate 6 1/2 years later, the company had debt of $7.5 million. If you were to put that on a chart like this, your reaction would be: Bennett is a really irresponsible executive. When he took over the company, the debt was way down here at $75,000, and when he left, it was way up here at $7.5 million. Aren't we glad to be rid of him? But you have to ask yourself `the debt compared to what?" 
When I took over as CEO of the company, it had four employees, it had sales about $250,000 to $300,000 per year. At the $300,000 figure, the debt was 25 percent of sales. And we were not getting a margin of 25 percent of sales on our profit. The debt of $75,000 threatened the very existence of that company. When I left the company and the debt was $7.5 million, the sales were over $80 million. We had more than $7.5 million in cash on the balance sheet. The only reason we didn't pay the debt off is there were prepayment penalties built into some of the mortgages we had signed, and it was financially more beneficial to keep the cash than to pay the prepayment penalties. So the mere size of the debt had nothing to do with the measurement of my stewardship as CEO of that company. 
I will say, as an aside, that since I have left the company, the sales have now gone to over $400 million. It is a very clear cause and effect that getting rid of me caused the company to more than triple. 
Let us, therefore, in the Government context, take this chart down and put up another one relating to the example I have given from the business world--debt compared to the size of the company, or, in this case, the size of the country. What is the size of the country? Here we have a chart that shows gross domestic product, GDP, or the size of the Nation's economy. Back in the 1940's, the economy was about a trillion dollars in 
inflation-adjusted dollars, 1992 dollars. You can see the steady growth up, so that now, in 1996, as I say, we are a $7 trillion economy, headed toward $8 trillion by 2002. 
Under those circumstances, this chart is suddenly going to look a little different when you compare it to gross domestic product. This is the result that you get on this chart. Federal debt, as a percentage of our gross domestic product, looks a little different than Federal debt in nominal dollars. We reached the highest point of debt in our history during the Second World War, at 130 percent of gross domestic product. As soon as the war was over, it started coming down and continued to come down until it leveled off at around 30 percent of gross domestic product in the 1970's. It started back up in the mid-1970's and dramatically back up in the mid-1980's. 
This is a comforting chart in that it says that the previous chart is not wholly accurate when you compare debt to GDP, and a discomforting chart when you realize that our debt is rising as a percent of our economy for the first time in peacetime in our history. Always before, the debt has been tied to a war. And when the war is over, debt as a percentage of GDP comes down. For the first time in our history, it has started to go up in peacetime; that is a very disturbing trend. I will deal with that in just a moment. 
Now, the question is, why? Why is the debt starting to come up? There are those on the other side of the aisle who have a very quick answer, summarized in two words: Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan is the one who caused all of this to happen. Look how the debt exploded during the Reagan years; it is all because of the disastrous Reagan tax cuts. It seems to me that we cannot, in this body discuss the tax cut that happened in terms of the marginal rate in the 1980's, without automatically adding in front of the phrase `tax cut,' the words `disastrous Ronald Reagan,' as the words to describe it--as if it is all one word, a legal term of art. 
I want to discuss whether or not the `disastrous Reagan tax cuts' are responsible for this rise in the national debt. Let's take a look at who pays the income taxes in this country and, also, what the history has been of the tax rate. Here is the history of Federal tax receipts and personal tax rates on this chart. The red line on the bottom is Federal tax receipts expressed, again, as a percentage of gross domestic product. This is what we are measuring everything against, this chart showing the lines going up. 
Do you notice a clear trend, Mr. President? Virtually from the end of the Second World War until now, Federal tax receipts have remained rock solid, within a narrow band, no lower than 18.5 percent and no higher than 19.5 percent of gross domestic product, averaging around 19 percent year after year. That is where it was, 19 percent, when the top marginal rate under Harry Truman was 91 percent. Then we had a tax cut. The rates went down slightly. John F. Kennedy recommended that it come down to 70 percent, and many people in this body were scandalized, saying we can't afford that heavy a tax cut, we can't afford to lose the revenue. So it came down from 90 percent to 70 percent. What happened to the receipts? They didn't change. 
Well, you had this one blip that Lyndon Johnson put through to help pay for the Vietnam war in the tax rate, and it showed up with an upward blip in the tax revenue. But quickly the tax revenue went back to the 19 percent line and the tax rate stayed at 70 percent until the time came to drop it to 50. When the tax rate dropped from 70 percent to 50, what happened to the tax revenues? They stayed solid. As a matter of fact, they went up a little when the drop of 70 percent to 50 percent happened as the marginal rate. 
Then Ronald Reagan convinced the Congress to pass the `disastrous Reagan tax cuts.' The marginal rate came all the way down to 28 percent. What happened to the revenues? They stayed right solid at 19 percent. Bill Clinton said, `We have to get more revenue to balance the budget,' and he forced the marginal rate, 
with Congress' help, back up to close to 40 percent. Actually, when you add Medicare on top of it, it is more than 40 percent. What happened to the revenue? Nothing. It stayed around 19 percent. 
You cannot blame the `disastrous Reagan tax cuts' for the increase in the debt as a percentage of gross domestic product, because they had little or no effect on the tax receipts as a percentage of gross domestic product. Those are the facts. 
Now, I said in my example that the businessman will be asked both to raise prices and cut prices. One of the interesting debates we have around here is that Members of the Republican Party stand up and accuse Bill Clinton of pushing through the `largest tax increase in history.' Then the Members of the Democratic Party stand up and say, `That's not true, the largest tax increase in history was put through by'--the same two words, Mr. President--`Ronald Reagan.' 
Who is right? Well, if you take nominal dollars, the Republicans are right. The Clinton tax increase was the largest in history. If you take constant dollars, adjusted for inflation, the Democrats are right. Ronald Reagan's tax increase was the largest in history. Now, he didn't call it a tax increase; he called it `revenue enhancements,' which infuriated conservative groups around town that looked upon him as their hero. 
Reagan did exactly the thing that the businessman in my example did. He both raised prices on some products and cut prices on others. He raised taxes on gasoline, for example, while cutting tax rates on incomes. And what happened to the economy in the Ronald Reagan years? Let's go back to this chart. 
As I say, this chart is the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product. The reason for all the fancy colors is not just to help keep you awake, Mr. President, but to demonstrate the differences in the various administrations. Understand that something that is done in one President's administration doesn't necessarily produce a result in that administration. Many times, the effects are felt years later. Nonetheless, to give us some guidance, here we have the growth of the economy during President Eisenhower's administration. It started up more vigorously in John F. Kennedy's administration. Why is that? That is the period of time we came down from 90 to 70. I don't know whether there is a direct cause-and-effect correlation, but it is certainly a significant enough issue to look at. We dropped the top marginal rate, and the rate of growth in the country goes up through Kennedy and remains through Johnson. Then you get a recession. It is flat in the last year of Johnson's administration and in the first year of Nixon's administration. Incidentally, Mr. President, that is the only year on this chart where we had a balanced budget--1969. 
It is an interesting correlation. It was flat. Then it starts to go up. But you get a recession that hits you; Nixon-Ford. Here is this recession, and Jimmy Carter becomes President. As we come out of that recession and get the advantage of the recovery out of that recession in his first 2 years, hits the 3d year, and gets another recession, and it becomes flat again. Ronald Reagan was President while we had what the economists called the `double dip.' The Carter recession; then they came out of it in 1981, and then the more serious recession that followed, and seriously it came down. But once that recession was over, the rate of growth that came out of those years for the balance of Reagan term in the first 2 years of Bush's term was historically one of the finest we have ever had. Is there any reason for that? Well, that just happens to coincide with `the disastrous Reagan tax cuts.' This line that says percentage of GDP, unchanged by the change in tax rates and corresponds with the GDP that is going through the roof. Nineteen percent of this kind of growth produces a whole lot more revenue to the Government than 19 percent of a recession. 
We cannot blame the tax policy relating to the top marginal rates for the deficit and our problems. It is very clear that the deficit is not driven by income tax policy. 
If I might digress for just a moment, I would like to explain one of the reasons why the change in the income tax marginal rate does not produce a change in the percentage of income that comes in. This next chart demonstrates that because it tells us who pays the income taxes in this country. 
The top 1 percent of households produce 13.8 percent of the income in this country. Many people say that is very unfair and they want to do something about it. But that is where we are. The top 1 percent of households produces 13.8 percent of the income. They pay 28.7 percent of the income taxes, or more than twice the percentage of the income that they receive. If you go to the top 5 percent, they get 27.8 percent of the income and pay 47 percent of the income taxes. In other words, the taxes that are paid on this chart, nearly half of them are paid by people in the top 5 percent of our wage earners. If you go down to the top 10 percent, this goes to 60 percent of the income taxes. What that means is that when you change this rate, the people who earn the most income, over here, have options as to what they will do with their money, and they will change their investment pattern to adapt to the Tax Code, consequently avoiding things that are high tax and moving into areas that are low tax, the result being that the percentage that they pay remains constant as measured in terms of GDP. 
So what you want to do, again back to this chart, is make sure that the GDP is going up as rapidly as it was during the Reagan years in order to maximize your income because your income is going to remain a constant percentage of that GDP by virtue of who it is that pays the income tax. 
Back to this chart, briefly. The bottom 50 percent pay virtually no income taxes at all. The bottom 50 percent gets roughly 15 percent of the Nation's wealth and they pay less than 5 percent of the Nation's income taxes. They, however, pay payroll taxes. They don't pay income taxes, but their payroll tax burden is inordinately high. 
At this point, Mr. President, I would call the Senate's attention to a piece that appeared in the Washington Post on the 15th of April written by our colleague from Nebraska, Bob Kerrey, and ask unanimous consent that it appear at the end of my remarks.

Mr. BENNETT. Senator Kerrey has summarized the problem for the people in the bottom half of income earners superbly well, and pointing out that they actually pay a higher effective rate on their income than people who pay income taxes down in this particular area of the chart. They do it in the form of payroll taxes, and that, as I have said on this floor many times before, is 
just one of the reasons why a complete restructuring of the Tax Code is absolutely necessary. But this is not the time. I don't have the time today to discuss that issue all over again. I am sure I will have a speech on that subject when we get into that later on. 
If the deficit is not caused by tax policy, the tax policy is producing roughly the same amount of income regardless of what we do with it, and indeed, if the tax policy causes the gross domestic product to increase rapidly, let's look at the spending side. That is the only other place that the deficit can come from. 
There are those in the Chamber who say, `Well, it is all defense spending.' Back to Reagan again, `He is the problem because of his runaway spending for defense.' 
Let's look at defense spending again by our same measure as a percentage of gross domestic product. The defense spending--we left these years out because this is the Second World War and the aftermath of the Second World War. Here is the Korean war. The green bars are Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and so on all at the way through different colors. Here is what we are spending in the defense budget in the Korean war. When the Korean war was over it dipped off, and then, starting here in the mid-1960's, the Vietnam war. Again there was a peak in 1968, the last year of Lyndon Johnson's Presidency. And then the spending tapered off and went down still further in the Carter years, and then Ronald Reagan did, indeed, call for a cold war buildup in his attack on the Soviet Union, and you got a bulge. But notice at the highest point of spending for the cold war buildup, it was substantially lower than at any time in the Vietnam war and less than half the spending in the highest year of the Korean war. 
Now with the result of the cold war buildup having produced the destruction of the Soviet Union, we are reaping the peace dividend that people have been talking about for so many years. And the spending came down during President Bush's administration, and continues to come down during President Clinton's. It is now, as you go across the chart, at the lowest level it has been since 1940 as a percent of gross domestic spending. 
Spending on defense even in the years of Ronald Reagan's buildup could not be responsible for the budget gap. It simply wasn't that significant. You put it in historic context and it is below historic levels in the other conflicts we have been examined. So, if it is not defense spending, it must be nondefense spending--nondefense discretionary spending--that has done this. Let's look at that. 
Here is nondefense domestic discretionary spending from 1962, to 2002 projected. Notice where it hits its highest point. It hits its highest point during the Carter years. 1976 is the year Jimmy Carter is elected; 1977 his first year, 1978; the highest point in 1978 tapers off a little bit. If we go back in history, we find that this was a time of great domestic spending expansion. Again it started in the Nixon-Ford years, carried over into the Carter years, and then began to come down. It is back up--1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, the Clinton years. While not competing with the Carter years, his spending is coming back up after having gone down. But this is not the picture of disaster. This is a picture of some stability in spending in this area. 
So if it is not defense spending, and it is not nondefense spending, what is it? 
Now let us put up the chart that deals with entitlements. Here are entitlements as a percentage of GDP. The yellow portion of the chart shows actual entitlements. The pink portion is the baseline projected for the years ahead through the year 2007. You will notice there is a serious increase right here--late 1970's. This again was a period when Congress significantly expanded Social Security SSI and Medicaid. It was at the same time, a period of recession, when you come over to this chart and find that the GDP is shrinking. 
So Congress is authorizing more spending while the economy is shrinking, and that produces these spikes. When the economy 
recovered, it starts to come down. But then you get another recession, and now it becomes even more serious in this recession that shows up in the first part of the Reagan term. Then the Reagan growth takes off, and you get that rapid growth period and you get a period where entitlement spending as a percent of GDP begins to come down. 
But when the growth slows down and you get into the recession that hits in the end of the Bush Presidency, beginning of Clinton, what happens? Entitlement spending goes up. Then you realize what is built in, and what is happening to our demographics. And you see the baseline that the Congressional Budget Office says is going to occur from here on in, and you are into historic highs. 
This is where the problem lies. It is not in defense spending. It is not in nondefense discretionary spending. It is in entitlements. And here is where it is showing up. 
We will put up another chart that shows the contrast between discretionary spending as represented by the red line and entitlement spending as represented by the gray line. In this gray line, we have added another component that has not been in any of these figures up until now, and that is interest on the debt. 
It is interesting. Here in the 1960's, John F. Kennedy is President. The amount of mandatory spending is substantially less than half the amount of discretionary spending. No big deal. The lines cross just about the time that we have been talking about in the mid-1970's when the debt started to go up as a percentage of gross domestic product. They stayed pretty much the same. And then with the recession that hit in the early 1980's, the gray line starts to take off, leaving the red line somewhat constant, going up but not all that much. Clearly the problem is in the gray line. Clearly the challenge that is creating the deficit is not on the tax side, not on the spending for normal Government activities represented by the red line, and clearly the problem of the deficit is the gray line which is mandatory expenditures combined with interest which is in and of itself a mandatory expenditure. 
So that is where we are. Our challenge is to get the economy growing as rapidly as it did during the Reagan years, and then on the other hand begin to turn that gray line down so it can become a little bit flat. And that combination can bring us a balanced budget. 
How do we do that? Get the gross domestic product growing more rapidly, and get expenditures under control. 
Those are our twin challenges. 
I take you back to the image that we had at the beginning of this presentation, back into the boardroom where the CEO is sitting with his experts and they are telling him what he can do to manage his company more intelligently and solve the company's deficit problem. Remember the first recommendation he had, `Raise prices.' At the risk of offending some of the Members of my own party, I think there are places in this Government where we can raise prices. I think there are things we can do--if we want to use the Reagan euphemism, revenue enhancements--where we can charge more for the services we are rendering. That is heresy to people who say never ever raise taxes. I am one who says I won't ever vote for an increase in the marginal tax rate, but there are, all around the Government, things that could be raised, raised prices on those products that are not price sensitive and get a little more revenue into the Government. 
Then, the second expert told the CEO, `Cut prices.' We are being told, no, if you try that in the Government, that is dessert, not spinach. There is no nourishment to that. I think we have shown clearly that, properly done, cutting tax rates in the right places in the right way can do what we need to do to increase the revenue of the Government by increasing the gross domestic product. Where is the best place to start on that? Clearly, for me it is capital gains. 
Oh, says somebody, if you cut the rate on capital gains, you are going to benefit the rich because only the rich have capital gains. 
As I have shown you, Mr. President, the rich pay most of the income taxes, period. The issue is not: Are you going to benefit the rich? The issue is how are these people going to allocate their capital in the way that will produce the greatest benefit to the economy as a whole? I say to any Member of this body, go back home, gather the venture capitalists, the real estate investors, people who are involved with moving capital around in your home State, and ask them this question: Are there deals that should be done that would improve the economy in this State that are not being done because of the current capital gains tax rate? If you ask that question, as I have asked it in my State, the answer will be: Every day deals that should be done are not being done because of the capital gains tax rate. 
You have capital locked into mature investments which, if the capital gains tax rate were to come down, would immediately flow into entrepreneurial investments, thus creating new jobs. Alan Greenspan, who has been praised by Members of both parties for his deft handling of the monetary policy in this country, has said repeatedly on the record that the best capital gains tax rate for maximum benefit to the economy is zero. I would be happy to see that, but I am not going to put that proposal on the floor because I realize it will not pass. But if we were to do something about the capital gains tax rate, we would see the proper allocation of capital into the economy to produce the kind of growth that we need. 
People say, `Oh, no, the stock market is going crazy and a capital gains tax adjustment would simply drive the stock market still farther and still higher and the only people that get rich are the rich.' Some portions of the stock market are going up. The Dow is going up. The Dow consists of 30 stocks. The NASDAQ, which consists of substantially more, is not going up nearly as rapidly as the Dow, and the Russell 2000, which consists of 2,000 companies down at the lower level, companies that are not in the Dow, they are not in the Standard & Poor's 500, they are down below that. The companies where the entrepreneurs are investing their money, and where the real new job growth in the future is going to come, is down substantially. 
The Russell 2000 index, which hit its peak in January of this year at around 370, is now down to 340. If that drop were on the Dow rather than the Russell 2000, we would have financial analysts jumping out of windows, saying look how much trouble we are in. 
What that tells us is people are taking their money out of entrepreneurial activity and putting it into the huge stocks that they think can weather the coming storm. If we were to do something about the capital gains tax rate, people would be willing to put their money into the entrepreneurial sector of the economy and we would be building a base for future growth in the gross domestic product that would be enormously beneficial for us in the long run. 
So back to my example. The first person said to the CEO, `Raise prices.' I say yes, there are places where we can raise revenue in the Government even now. The second person said to the CEO, `Cut prices.' I say yes, there are areas where we can cut tax rates and get benefit, where it is not dessert. It has just as much nourishment as spinach and probably tastes a good bit better. Then, of course, you will remember the third expert said to the CEO, `Increase your spending, because you have an aging plant and aging equipment.' The fact is, we need to increase spending in the Government in some areas. 
Our highways are in trouble; our airport and airway system could use some infrastructure spending. We are taking the money that is in the trust funds for both of those functions and we are spending it for something else. I think we need to take a long look at places where we are being penny-wise and pound-foolish in the long term, as far as some spending initiatives are concerned. I know that to some this sounds like heresy, coming from someone on the Republican side, but it is sound management and for the best of our country. 
Finally, we come to the final recommendation that was given to our CEO and that we hear around here a great deal, `You have to cut spending.' The answer is clearly, yes, we have to cut spending. Here is a chart that is not the past but the future, that demonstrates the challenge that we face. Like every estimate, it can be wrong, but it is the best estimate that we have. This is dealing with the two largest entitlement programs that we have, Medicare and Social Security. In the first 1996 set of bars, you see that Medicare, the red, is between 2 and 3 percent of gross domestic product; Social Security, the green, between 4 and 5. Ten years later, in 2005, Social Security remains stable, right about the same place. But Medicare, if nothing is done to deal with it, will have grown significantly. Then go out 10 years more. Social Security has now grown fairly significantly and Medicare has caught up with it. In 2025, Social Security has grown again very dramatically, but Medicare has outstripped it. And, in the year 2035, Social Security has grown some more and Medicare is going way past it. 
This will not be of any concern to me. I will not be here in 2035. I may be here in 2025--my genes are such that I can expect to live to that year. But these young pages who are here on the floor will be in the height of their earning years in 2035, and they will be facing entitlements, in these two programs alone, which will eat up 15 percent of gross domestic product. 
If you remember, what was the line on revenues on the previous chart? It was 19 percent of gross domestic product is all we get with our tax system. If 15 percent of gross domestic product goes to two programs alone, that means there will be nothing left for anything else. And, as the debt goes up as a percent of GDP, interest becomes an increasing problem and you quickly will be at the point in these years, the years when these pages will be looking for jobs or hoping to support families, when the Government will not have any money for anything other than entitlements. That is the future if we do not do something to get this under control. 
My time has almost expired. This was not a speech to lay out detailed solutions. It was an attempt to put the debate in the right context, get it out of the context of the family sitting around the kitchen table. It is to understand that this economy operates more like a business and that it is a major economic entity that has to be managed intelligently. But it is very clear that entitlements have to be managed, along with the tax problem, 
 and the other spending problems. We must get entitlements under control or we cannot solve this puzzle. 
I suggest I would be willing to vote for means testing of entitlements; changing the definition of an entitlement, if you will, to this: You are entitled to this money if you need it. Absolutely the Government has it there for you. They are holding it for you, and as soon as you need it, the Government will give it to you. Instead of saying, `You are entitled to Social Security payments, Ross Perot. You are entitled to Medicare, Donald Trump.' 
I say, `Ross Perot, if you ever fall on evil times, Medicare will be there for you. Donald Trump, if you ever go back into bankruptcy, you can draw your Social Security check, absolutely. You are entitled to it if you need it.' 
The other issue we have to face, of course, is the question of cost-of-living adjustments. Built into this projection is the assumption that the present cost-of-living adjustment formula is accurate and fair. The Boskin commission has looked at that and said, no, the cost-of-living adjustments are overstated by at least 1.1 percent. We are going to have a debate about that on this floor. There are many people on both sides of the aisle who say, politically it would be crazy to try to do something about the way cost-of-living adjustments are calculated, let us just leave it as it is. I say to you the numbers say we cannot leave it as it is. We have to deal with reality. 
Social Security is a wonderful program. It was put in place in the 1930's. Medicare is a wonderful program. It was put in place in the 1960's. We now live in the 1990's in an entirely different economy facing an entirely different kind of future. I suggest that ultimately what we want to do, as we deal with the challenge of our budget and our Nation's fiscal sanity in the future, is take a clean sheet of paper and say, `The tax system that was designed 60 years ago no longer meets our needs. Let us write a new one. The retirement program that we put in place for our senior citizens 60 years ago no longer meets our needs. Let us write an entirely new one. The health care plan we put in place for our senior citizens 30 years ago no longer meets our needs. Let us write an entirely new one.' And see if we cannot, as good managers, devise a system that will take care of the poor, take care of the elderly, deal with the challenges of the flow of capital in our country, and at the same time see to it that we get back to the rate of growth that we enjoyed during the Reagan years while holding the spending down. 
All we need to do is see that the economy grows more rapidly than the Government does. That is all we need to do. That has to be our lodestar. We do not have to freeze the Government. We do not have to dismantle the Government. All we need to do is say we will follow policies that show that the economy will grow more rapidly than the Government will grow. When that happens--let's go back to the chart on debt as a percentage of GDP--we can see the bars start going in the right direction again. Once we get the discipline where the economy grows more rapidly than the Government, this trend will turn into this trend. The debt will start to come down as a percent of GDP in peacetime as it historically has, and our children can have confidence that we will have discharged our governmental stewardship intelligently. 
Mr. President, I recognize that this has been lengthy. I do not apologize for the length because of the importance of the subject. I felt that all of this information which is counter to much that has been said on this floor on both sides of the aisle is important to put into this debate. I hope my colleagues who disagree with me will come to the floor and respond. But I hope the responses will be in terms of intellectual analysis and fact rather than political sloganeering on both sides. The issue is too important to be left to sloganeering. The issue is too important to be left to posturing for the 1998 elections, in which I have a rather strong personal interest myself. The issue has to do with generations yet to come of our children and our grandchildren. We owe it to them to do more than shout political slogans to each other but to see to it that we address this issue on the basis of the reality of where we are and where it is that we can go. 
With that, Mr. President, I thank you for your time and attention and yield the floor.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until the hour of 2 p.m. to accommodate a number of Senators who have requested time to speak. It is my hope an agreement will be reached this morning to begin consideration of S. 495 regarding the unlawful use or transfer of chemical weapons. If an agreement is reached, Senators can expect a couple of hours of debate beginning probably around 2 p.m. on the bill, with a vote later this afternoon. 
Therefore, Senators can expect rollcall votes during today's session of the Senate. As always, of course, the majority leader will notify Senators as agreements are reached. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today I withdraw as a cosponsor of S. 525. 
I recognize the need to address the challenge represented by millions of uninsured children. In addition, I am in favor of any effort to discourage tobacco use, which is our Nation's No. 1 health problem. For these reasons, I initially agreed to assist Senator Hatch. 
However, after a complete review of the actual language of the bill, I find that it moves in the wrong direction. Accordingly, with great regret for any problems this may pose for my colleague and friend, I have taken my name off the bill as a cosponsor.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank you for that commercial. I must, in the spirit of full disclosure, report that I am not a graduate of Brigham Young University but of the University of Utah, which happens to be ranked in the top three in the current basketball season along with the University of Kansas and the University of Kentucky. I wish the Final Four could include Utah, Kentucky, and Kansas, but I am afraid Utah and Kentucky will have their showdown prior to the Final Four and only one of the two will make it. If it is not Utah--as I am confident, of course, that it will be--I hope, for the sake of my friendship with the Senator from Kentucky, that it will be Kentucky that goes to the Final Four with Kansas. 
But the very fact that we can have this conversation about the NCAA underscores the importance of what we are talking about with respect to football. These teams will get to the Final Four in basketball on the playing field and not in the boardroom. The decision will be made on the basis of how good they are and how entertaining they can be on television by virtue of their skill, rather than how sharp the negotiators were that put together the stacked deck in advance of the final event. 
I have a chart here that reports what happened in the last bowl circumstance. Every team in color, whether it is the two in yellow, the two in orange, or the two in red, appeared in an alliance bowl. 
The two teams in white, No. 2 and No. 4, that did not appear in an alliance bowl, appeared in the Rose Bowl, which is now part of the alliance. Only one of the top seven teams did not appear in a lucrative alliance bowl--and that happens to be the team from BYU. 
Rather than go on in a parochial fashion, as the Senator from the State in which BYU appears, I would like to summarize this circumstance from a source that is clearly not parochial and not particularly biased to BYU as a school. 
I am quoting from the article that appeared in Sports Illustrated on the 16th of December, 1996, entitled, `Bowling For Dollars.' In the article they made it very clear what the real criteria was here. Quoting from the article: 
Sunday's selections shed revealing light on the alliance. . . , It was the shunning of Brigham Young, however, despite the fact that the Cougars have a higher ranking and a better record than either of the at-large teams chosen (Nebraska and Penn State) by the alliance, that served to trash two widely accepted myths. 
Myth No. 1: The purpose of the alliance is to determine the true national champion. 
Sports Illustrated says: 
Not even close. The purpose of the alliance is to avoid the creation of NCAA-run national playoffs. Such playoffs would put the NCAA in charge of the beaucoup dollars the event would generate. The alliance exists to keep the power and the money in the hands of the alliance bowls and the four conferences that receive guaranteed berths in those bowls. 
A fairly direct statement to the point raised by my friend from Kentucky. 
Now, Sports Illustrated goes on: 
Myth No. 2: The alliance bowls exist to give fans the best possible games. 
Bowls are businesses, with major corporate sponsorship and huge television deals. Their purpose is to fill stadiums, generate TV ratings, and create precious `economic impact' on their communities in the days leading up to the games. 
Now, Mr. President, comes the paragraph that makes it clear that Sports Illustrated is not necessarily friendly to BYU in every circumstance, but summarizes why this decision was made. 
BYU fails, not only on the strength-of-schedule issue but also on the economic-impact side. Bowls, particularly the Sugar Bowl, thrive on bar business. One of the tenets of the Mormon faith is abstinence from alcohol. You do the math. In the French Quarter, they don't call the most famous thoroughfare Milk Street. `We used to go to the Holiday Bowl, and our fans would bring a $50 bill and the Ten Commandments, and break neither' says BYU Coach LaVell Edwards. Nebraska fans, on the other hand, travel like Deadheads, and spend like tourists. 
Choosing bowl teams based in significant part on the rabidity and spending habits of their fans isn't fair to the audience watching the bowls at home. For all its flaws, BYU would even be a more intriguing opponent for Florida State than a team the Seminoles have already beaten. Unfortunately, money rules all matchups. 
Mr. President, BYU did go to a postseason game--the Cotton Bowl. The Presiding Officer from Kansas and this Senator from Utah entered into a friendly wager, which fortunately this Senator from Utah won when BYU beat the team from Kansas. 
Satisfying as that victory was for Brigham Young University, the point made by Sports Illustrated is still important. It is the fans on television who support the tremendous amount of money available to these alliance bowls, by tuning in and being available as an advertising audience. 
It is those fans who were deprived of the opportunity of seeing the best game available on New Year's Day. 
So for that reason, I am delighted to join in this effort to see to it that we do something to see that the antitrust laws apply here and that a conspiracy in a boardroom does not take place to siphon off the heavy money to one group at the expense of not only the other group but also of the fans.

Mr. BENNETT. The Senator from Kentucky is exactly correct. One of the reasons, I am sure, why the Senators from Wyoming are joining in this effort is that under the rules of the Western Athletic Conference, Brigham Young would not take that money home by itself. It would be shared with the other schools in the conference, one of whom posted a sterling record themselves, the Wyoming Cowboys. They were frozen out of any bowl appearance at all on New Year's Day. They cannot even salve that particular wound with the money Brigham Young would distribute throughout the Western Athletic Conference with participation in an alliance bowl. 
As I said before, the money comes primarily from television revenues, and by creating a restraint-of-trade circumstance to hold those television revenues for a certain set of conferences, the leaders of the alliance have damaged every other conference in the country, including schools like Wyoming, which would have received a significant amount of money had it been available to the Western Athletic Conference. 
The message out of the alliance is: WAC need not apply, regardless of how their teams are or have ever been. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to add one more statement for the edification and information of Senators. The Senator from Wyoming referred to his team's record of 10 and 2. One of those two was a loss to Brigham Young University literally in the last seconds with a field goal that no one expected anybody could make that caused the game to go into overtime, and then Brigham Young won in overtime. 
If that had gone the other way, it would have been Wyoming that would have earned the position that BYU was denied. They would have beaten the fifth ranked team, would have had a 10 and 1 record and would have been a clear choice for an alliance bowl. 
It was BYU's victory over Wyoming that pulled BYU to that level. That is why I am happy to join with him in saying we both got robbed.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that at 3 o'clock today the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Merrick B. Garland, to be U.S. circuit judge, and for it to be considered under the following time agreement: 3 hours equally divided in the usual form. I further ask unanimous consent that immediately following the expiration or yielding back of the debate time, the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination, and immediately following that vote, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate resume legislative business. 
It is my understanding this has been cleared on the Democratic side.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, some general observations prior to getting into the details of this resolution, I think, are in order. As this matter has come before the Nation in the form of press reports, television commentary, newspaper analyses, et cetera, something that is very disturbing to me has happened. That is, a single cloak of suspicion regarding illegalities and improprieties has been cast over all aspects of anything relating to campaign financing, campaign fundraising, and campaign expenditures. Somehow, anything related to raising money or spending money in a campaign has now become tainted, and we find people in the press and people in this Chamber casting aspersions that, in my view, are inappropriate and uncalled for. 
I would like to set the terms of the discussion in this fashion. I suggest that, of course, the first dividing line is between that which is legal and that which is illegal. Many times in the press reports no one is making this dividing line. They are attacking anything dealing with fundraising as if it were all the same and all in the same pot. We should make it clear, we should understand that many of the things that are done for political fundraising are perfectly legal and, in my view, perfectly appropriate, while there are other things that are clearly illegal, and obviously anything illegal is not appropriate. 
If I may, I was disturbed by some of the comments made on this floor with respect to the actions of the majority leader, primarily by the minority leader. The suggestion was left in the minds of some people that the majority leader was being accused of doing something illegal or improper by urging people to attend a Republican fundraiser and urging people to support 
the Republican Party. Not only was it not illegal nor was it improper, it was perfectly appropriate for the majority leader of the Republican Party to engage in this kind of activity. Just as, to be completely fair about it, in my view it was perfectly appropriate and perfectly proper for the senior Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], in his role as the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, to engage in fundraising activity on behalf of the Democratic Party in the last campaign. The Senator from Connecticut has not been attacked on the floor, as the majority leader was, but he has been attacked in the press, as people have tried to cast the cloak of impropriety that I described over all fundraising activities. 
I will stand here and defend the right of the senior Senator from Connecticut to do what he has done on behalf of the Democratic National Committee as being perfectly appropriate as well as legal, just as I defend the right of the majority leader for what he has done in fundraising activities that are perfectly appropriate as well as legal. 
Now, on the legal side of the line there have been activities that have taken place that, in my view, while legal, are not appropriate. It is, perhaps, legal for the President to have had the kind of extensive contact with campaign donors in the White House that we have seen reported in the press. The President has suggested that every President has met donors in the White House, and therefore this is perfectly OK. I will agree, once again, that previous Presidents have on occasion met with donors to their party or to their particular campaigns while in the White House. It is my personal opinion that the scale and the organized effort that went into bringing people into the White House, whether it is for overnights in the Lincoln bedroom, organized and orchestrated by the President's own hand, or for the coffees, as they were called, has reached a level of unprecedented pattern of activity, and I consider it to be inappropriate. 
I will stipulate that it apparently was not illegal. That does not mean we should not comment about it, we should not express our opinions about its appropriateness. But, clearly, it does not call for the appointment of an independent counsel. It is something we can talk about in the political arena. It is on the legal side of the line. If we think it is inappropriate, we should say so. If we think the pattern of activity in this area is just overwhelmingly improper, we have the right to say so. 
But we must recognize, once again, that some of that activity may clearly not have been illegal. 
Drawing the line and coming over to the side of that which is illegal, I find, once again, there are degrees of illegality. Let me give you an example that has been heavily reported in the press: the receipt of a $50,000 check by Maggie Williams, the chief of staff to the First Lady, while Ms. Williams was in the White House. That apparently is illegal. 
Naturally, we take breaking of the law seriously. I don't think we need an independent counsel, however, to investigate Maggie Williams accepting a $50,000 check while in the White House, and I don't think it is worth some of the furor that has been created in the press. If she broke the law in that instance, I think the Justice Department and the FEC, whoever is the appropriate legal authority, can handle that without any difficulty and does not require an independent counsel and, frankly, in my view, may not even require the tremendous hue and cry that has risen in this area in the press. 
Again, I do not mean to minimize someone who violates a regulation or restriction, but there is a difference between violations that are either inadvertent, relatively innocent or springing out of a lack of understanding of the rules to those violations that, in my view, are truly sinister. We should not be talking about an independent counsel unless we have moved from the legal side of campaign funding and those things that are perfectly appropriate, toward those things that are perhaps inappropriate and improper, across the line to those violations that are inadvertent or relatively minor. We still don't have the necessity of calling for an independent counsel until we cross over into the territory of those infractions that are 
truly sinister and have serious implications about misuse of power in very high places. 
It is my opinion that there have been enough violations in very high places in areas that I think are truly sinister that an independent counsel is, indeed, called for. But before I get into the details of that, I want to make my position perfectly clear that I do not think we should appoint an independent counsel because people in the press, or people in this Chamber, get all exercised about activities in the three areas I have just described. None of them is serious enough to justify an independent counsel. Let's focus on the fourth area I have described, which I consider to be the truly sinister areas. 
Mr. President, with that general statement and overview, I am prepared now to turn to my colleague from Michigan and yield such time to him as he may require from his 30 minutes so that we keep the time balanced in this debate.

Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I am interested in the comments by my friend from Michigan. He is a distinguished lawyer. I have never had the experience of going to law school. But I must respond out of experience relating to the political circumstance. 
He decries at length `no reference to Members of Congress' and gives us an example out of the life of Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House, in saying, why does not the resolution call on Janet Reno to investigate the Speaker? 
Mr. President, if Janet Reno were to decide that there was further action that needed to be taken with respect to Mr. Gingrich, I doubt that she would run into any resistance in the White House to that decision. I doubt that the President would think that was not a good idea for her to do that or send her any kind of direction or subtle hints saying, `Do not pursue Mr. Gingrich.' 
The reason we have an independent counsel operation is because the Attorney General is indeed subject to pressure from the White House. And there is no such pressure with reference to Members of Congress, particularly Members of Congress of the opposing party. 
In this body, both the Senator from Michigan and I sat with Dave Durenberger. Dave Durenberger found out directly that there was no problem in the Justice Department coming after a Member of Congress. 
There are Members in this body who were here when Harrison Williams, known as `Pete,' was pursued by the Justice Department and his own party and ultimately went to jail. 
In the structure of our Government, with the separation of powers, there is no pressure on the Attorney General in the executive branch that would prevent him or her from going after a Member of the legislative branch, but there is clear pressure within the executive branch that could prevent an Attorney General from going after a member of the executive branch. And that is why the independent counsel statute was created. 
I think the omission from the majority leader's resolution with respect to Members of Congress is a recognition that the independent counsel was never intended to go after a Member of Congress and it would be inappropriate to go after Members of Congress to put that in. It would fundamentally change the nature of the independent counsel circumstance. 
Now, Mr. President----

Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend from Michigan for correcting my legal lack of understanding. And I do stand corrected and accept that instruction. 
I say to him, and to any who feel, as he apparently does, that Mr. Gingrich should be included in this, that I would be happy to have Mr. Gingrich included in the resolution if indeed there were evidence suggesting there was something that had not already come out in the proceedings that have already gone forward. 
The reason I am supporting this resolution is that I feel there is information that is being hidden within the executive branch, coming from somewhere. I do not know whether it is coming from the White House. I do not know whether it is coming from the executive office of the President. But from somewhere, there seems to be some kind of pressure being applied to the Attorney General to keep her from proceeding with the appointment of an independent counsel, as Members of this body individually have urged her to do, including Members of the Democratic side of this body, who have urged the Attorney General to proceed with the appointment of the independent counsel. 
For example, the senior Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] has said it is time for an independent counsel. I am sure my friend from Michigan would not stand to censure the senior Senator from New York for making that expression. He has expressed that freely, openly, and publicly as is his right. 
All the resolution does that is offered by the majority leader is give other Members of the Senate the opportunity to make the same expression in a vote for a sense of the Senate--not binding, not with a force of law, simply making public the fact that they agree with Senator Moynihan in his calling for a independent counsel. 
Now, why is it that we feel there are things that need to be examined with an independent counsel that have not been? There are many, and our time is limited, but let me go quickly, Mr. President, to one example of something that I think calls out for the attention of an independent counsel. On the 13th of September, 1995, there was a meeting in the Oval Office, not in the Democratic National Committee, not in some other governmental office, in the Oval Office in the White House. President Clinton, of course, was there and with him were four other individuals--James Riady, not a Federal employee, an executive, indeed, an owner of the Lippo Group; Bruce Lindsey, who was a Government Federal employee and is the Deputy White House counsel; Joseph Giroir, Lippo joint venture partner and adviser and a former partner of the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas, again, not a Federal employee; and John Huang, a former executive with Lippo but at the time of the meeting he was a Federal employee. So here you have the President, two non-Federal employees and two Federal employees. The discussion is whether or not John Huang will move from his position at the Department of Commerce to become vice chairman of finance of the Democratic National Committee. So here is the discussion in the Oval Office, including the President, regarding the future role of John Huang, taking place in the presence of two of Mr. Huang's former associates in the private world. 
Mr. Huang made that move from the Commerce Department to the Democratic National Committee where he raised, according to the Democratic National Committee, $3.4 million, $1.6 million of which has had to be returned by the Democratic National Committee because they have been determined to be either inappropriate or illegal. 
Now, when you ask the question, do we know everything we need to know about Mr. Huang and his activities stemming from that meeting in the Oval Office presided over by the President of the United States, we have Mr. Huang taking the fifth amendment, refusing to tell us anything further on the grounds that it might incriminate him. He joins with Charlie Trie, Pauline Kanchanalak, Mark Middleton, and Webster Hubbell in taking the fifth amendment, saying they will not cooperate with the investigation on the grounds that it might tend to incriminate them. There are others who have not taken the fifth amendment but who have left the country, including John H.K. Lee, Charlie Trie, Pauline Kanchanalak, Arief and Soraya Wiriadinata, Charles DeQueljoe, and Mr. Riady. 
Of the four people who were in that meeting along with the President, one has taken the fifth amendment and the other has left the country. Roughly half of the money that Mr. Huang raised has already been returned by the Democratic National Committee on the grounds that it was either illegal or inappropriate. I think this summarizes the fact that we need much further investigation into, (a), what was decided at that meeting, and (b), what was done subsequent to that meeting as a result of those decisions, but of the four non-Presidential participants in that meeting, half of them are unavailable to us to give us a version. 
There are many more examples. I see my friend from West Virginia has arrived. I will reserve such additional time as I have to summarize this later, and I yield the floor.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the admonition by the senior Senator from West Virginia and repeated by the Senator from Vermont with respect to meanness. I have made every attempt during this presentation to make sure that there is none in any of the things that I have said, and to remind Senators in my opening comments that I think many Members of this body have inappropriately been stigmatized by the press and others for doing that which is perfectly appropriate and perfectly legal. 
I must once again make reference to what I consider to be an inappropriate attack on the motives of the majority leader that was mounted by the minority leader earlier during this debate. I think that is inappropriate. The majority leader is acting out his good motives, even though there may be some who disagree with him. 
As to the argument that this resolution somehow exempts Members of Congress and somehow exempts members of the Republican Party from any action on the part of the Attorney General, I point out the effective language of the resolution which says, `It is the sense of Congress that the Attorney General should make application to the Special Division of the United States Court of Appeals to the District of Columbia for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate allegations of illegal fundraising in the 1996 Presidential election campaign.' 
There is nothing in there that says she shall not exercise this right with respect to a Member of Congress, that she shall not go after a Republican nominee, that she shall not do any of the other things that are simply an expression that she should do it with respect to the Presidential campaign, and no reference in that resolve portion of even Democrats rather than Republicans. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time to the majority leader.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle have so often reminded us during the debate, there is a mechanism going forward in the Governmental Affairs Committee to investigate all aspects of the 1996 campaign, congressional as well as Presidential. This is clearly not the function of an independent counsel. 
The function of an independent counsel is to investigate allegations of the most serious and difficult kinds of lawbreaking. I know of no such allegations that would require a special counsel in the area outside of those that we have talked about during the debate. Therefore, I intend to vote against this resolution because it does not address the problem that we face. Whatever problem is there will be clearly handled, and handled competently, by the Governmental Affairs Committee.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I announce that today the Senate will resume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 22, the independent counsel resolution. By previous order, from 10:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., the Senate will conclude debate on Senate Joint Resolution 22, the independent counsel resolution, and Senate Joint Resolution 23, the Leahy resolution. Following debate on these resolutions, Senators should anticipate stacked rollcall votes at approximately 11:30. 
Following disposition of these resolutions, the Senate may proceed to either the certification of Mexico or the nomination of Merrick Garland. Additional votes are, therefore, possible during today's session following the stacked votes. 
The majority leader has asked me to remind Senators that this is the last week prior to our adjournment for the 2-week Easter recess, so he would appreciate Senators continuing to cooperate and adjusting their schedules accordingly for the scheduling of legislation and votes. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend from New Mexico not only for his statement here today but for his leadership on this issue. I remember, when he first called me several Congresses ago and said he was getting involved in this and would I be interested in helping him, I was delighted to do what I could to help him because when the Senator from New Mexico leads out, helping is always pretty easy. With him as the leader, things always move well and strongly and in the right direction. 
I can report that in the State of Utah we have not been as focused on the six pillars of character as they have been in the State of New Mexico, but we have not been lax in this particular area. 
1996 was Utah's centennial year, 100 years since we had achieved statehood, and the Governor of Utah, in the spirit of the Character Counts initiative, called for a discussion of values. He created the Governors Commission on Centennial Values. As a result of that creation and the discussion that occurred, we now have in Utah 12 values in common that we talk about. I will read them and get them into the Record so we can understand how this effort to get character into the school curriculum and into the lives of our young people is going forward all across the country. 
In Utah we value families. We value a commitment to our community and country. We value integrity. We value honesty. We value respect for self and others. We value lifelong learning. We value caring service. We value work. We value personal responsibility. We value respect for the rule of law. We value justice, fairness and freedoms, and we value respect for the environment. 
Those are the 12 values that came out of the Governor's Centennial Commission, and I believe they are certainly compatible with the six pillars of character that are supported by the Character Counts coalition. Perhaps now that our centennial is past and we are into 1997, we can meld these two efforts and get the Character Counts curriculum into the schools in the manner that the Senator from New Mexico has done so well in his own State. 
Mr. President, I am honored to be one of the cosponsors of this effort, 
to join with my friend from New Mexico and to recognize, once again, his leadership and service in this because this has been, for him, not just something to make a speech about on the Senate floor and then forget; it has been something that he has pursued with vigor in his own State and kept alive on the part of the rest of us, who joined with him in the initial effort. 
I hope that all Senators will recognize that this is not just motherhood and apple pie, a quick thing to talk about and then move on. `Our Nation is indeed at risk,' to use the phrase that came out of the educational effort done during the Presidency of President Reagan, and headed by an educator from Utah, Terence Bell. It is at risk not only because our young people have deficiencies in their education in technical skills, it is at risk because there are deficiencies of the moral education of our young people. We have to have something like Character Counts to help us move in the direction of reducing that risk. I am honored to be a part of the effort and pledge that I will do what I can to see to it that the Senator from New Mexico and the others in this program are given the support they need.

<TEXT>
Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to visit on this subject. My mind goes back to a little history lesson, which many probably know but I would like to rehearse, just as a background for this. 
The Constitution was written primarily by one man, James Madison. After it went through the convention in Philadelphia, James Madison went back home to Virginia to campaign for its ratification. 
Ratification of the Constitution really depended on two States. Yes, it required that it be ratified by three-fourths of the States, but if New York and Virginia had not ratified, it would not have mattered if every other State did because those were the two dominant States in the confederacy and without their ratification and joining the new federation, created by the Constitution, the country would not have survived. 
So, Madison's role in getting ratification by Virginia was as important to the survival of the Constitution as his role in writing it. He had a significant opponent in the State of Virginia, arguably the most popular and powerful political figure in that State, five times, I believe, Governor of that State, a man named Patrick Henry. Patrick Henry took the stump in opposition to the Constitution, put his full prestige and oratorical powers behind the forces that were in opposition, and his reason was, among others, that the Constitution did not include a list--or, in 18th century language, a bill--of rights. 
It is not necessary, said Madison in the debates, because the rights of the individuals of this new country, created by this Constitution, are all implied in the Constitution itself. They do not need to be listed. If they are listed, they will be limited only to those rights on the list. So the best thing we can do, said Madison, is ratify the Constitution as it stands, rather than talk about a list or Bill of Rights. 
Patrick Henry wasn't buying it. And he was powerful enough in the State of Virginia, that he could have blocked ratification of 
the Constitution by virtue of his political power. Well, Madison being the practical politician he was, as well as the theoretician, said to the voters of Virginia: I'll make a deal with you. If you will ratify this Constitution, I will run for Congress and in my first term as a Member of the House of Representatives, I will propose a Bill of Rights. And Madison prevailed in that debate, Virginia ratified the Constitution, it became the basic document upon which this country was built, and Madison was true to his political promises. He came to the House of Representatives and Representative James Madison of Virginia proposed 12 amendments to the Constitution, every one of them outlining rights of individuals. Ten of those were adopted and have come to be known as the Bill of Rights. 
As a historical footnote, the 11th one that was lost to history for over 200 years got discovered a few years ago and ratified. So that the so-called Madison amendment now, which was No. 11 of his 12 listed amendments to the Constitution, as the Bill of Rights, is now also part of the Constitution. The 12th one is gone and deserves to be gone, it is so tied to that period of time it has no relevance to us today and nobody wants to revive it. 
The first of those amendments offered by Representative Madison was, of course, the amendment outlining freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to petition the Government for redress of your grievances. That is his generation's term for lobbying, Madam President--lobbying is a protected, constitutionally recognized activity that is a key part of our democracy. I like to remind people of that, as they stand up and talk about the evils of lobbying. Heaven help us if the day ever comes when citizens are denied the right to petition the Government for redress of their grievances or are told that they cannot hire an advocate more articulate than they are, to do it for them. That would diminish our constitutional rights. 
That is all in that first of those amendments offered by Madison. Patrick Henry lost the battle in terms of the ratification, but this country owes Patrick Henry a tremendous debt of gratitude for his forcing James Madison into that political deal and putting down on paper those rights that we have listed for us in the Bill of Rights. 
What does that have to do with this debate? What does that have to do with this discussion about campaign finance reform? I stand here, not as a lawyer, but I hope as one who can read the English language and one who has made something of a study of the Constitution throughout his life. I put myself in the context of that debate between Madison and Henry, and I say: Mr. Henry, would you be satisfied with the reassurance of the following words: 
Congress shall have the power to set reasonable limits on the amount of contributions that may be accepted by, and the amount of expenditures that may be made by, in support of, or in opposition to, a candidate for nomination for election to, or for election to, Federal office. 
I think Mr. Henry would say, `I will accept James Madison's assurances that all of our rights are, by implication, in the Constitution, before I will accept the notion that Congress has the right to set reasonable limits on what people do in support of or in opposition to a candidate.' 
Now, it is presumptuous of me to try to put words in Patrick Henry's mouth. I don't think any of us in this body is a good enough orator to make that attempt. But I, for one, feel that the spirit of Patrick Henry says we have to be a whole lot more specific than this, if we are going to amend the fundamental document that stands as the basis of this Nation.

Mr. BENNETT. As I read the language of this amendment, the determination of what is reasonable and what is not reasonable is left to the Congress. And under those circumstances, I can see a Congress of incumbents deciding that it was eminently reasonable not to allow anyone to oppose them. 
Indeed, if I may quote, to the Senator from Kentucky the rationale currently being given by the White House for the excesses to which they went in extracting expenditures which now have had to be returned in the millions of dollars. Their rationale was that they were facing the possibility that the Republicans would win the election, and that that possibility was so overwhelmingly devastating to the future of the country that they had no choice but to go to the absolute limits of propriety and, on occasion, beyond in order to prevent that from happening. 
If someone believes that is reasonable, certainly I agree with the implications of the question from the Senator from Kentucky that Members of Congress might agree that it is reasonable to put such low limits on the amount that could be spent in opposition to an incumbent that, in fact, the net result would be zero in support.

Mr. BENNETT. I agree completely that the Congress might do that. Now, to be honest, I would have to say to my friend from Kentucky, the outcry that would arise from the press, the groups who watch what we do, would be very, very severe if Congress were to do that, and they would scream that that was not reasonable and would demand that the limit be raised. 
But you would create, in that circumstance, a political thicket, to use a phrase that the Supreme Court, I understand, has used on occasion, wherein the threads of intelligent debate would be lost completely. You would spend all of your time in that election arguing whether a $5,000 limit or a $10,000 limit or a $100,000 limit, or wherever it might be, was the right limit, and you would never spend your time talking about the important issues facing your country. 
Frankly, we are in a microcosm of that right now. We are arguing about the things that get in the way, I think, of more substantive issues.

Mr. BENNETT. I think it would enhance the power of the press enormously, but I say this to my friend from Kentucky. If we had those kinds of limits, I think the people on the editorial page would begin to hear from the people on the business page, or, that is, on the management side of the paper, saying Congress has just prevented us from selling ads to anybody on any public issue--and there is very significant revenue connected with this--and we think you editorial writers ought to ease up to the point where we can begin to get some of the advertising dollars back that we used to have. 
In that circumstance, I agree with my friend from South Carolina, that as a practical matter in a campaign, this speech is not monetarily free. I draw a distinction between `monetarily free' and `philosophically free.' I believe when I buy an ad in a newspaper, as the purchaser of that space, I am, therefore, philosophically free to say whatever I want. Indeed, I have heard radio ads where, in advance of the ad, the radio commentator has come on and said, `The ad you are about to hear contains language which this radio station is forbidden to broadcast under normal circumstances, but it is a political ad, and, therefore, the station cannot censor it in any way,' and people are warned that the ad they are about to hear comes under the freedom of political candidates to say whatever they want. 
The ad then used words that, in fact, the station would never otherwise allow. I can say, the candidate who purchased the ad got about 2 percent of the vote, but he was out for the shock value, and he got it in the State of California. Then 
after the ad was run, the station announcer came back, once again, to disclaim any connection with this but to say we had no choice, since this was a political speech, to allow it to go forward untrammeled and unchanged. 
If you want free speech, the Senator from South Carolina is right, in today's world, you have to buy space on the media in order to have it, but if we put limits on the amount of money that can be spent, the net effect of that is to destroy my right to have free speech and to turn the debate over to the commentators who have access to the airwaves and the newsprint without any limitation.

Mr. BENNETT. Certainly it would be a logical extension of the reasoning behind this. I agree with my friend from Kentucky that would be the case. 
My friend from Kentucky raises another issue with respect to the language of this amendment, when it refers to expenditures that may be made in support of, or in opposition to, a candidate. 
Let us suppose this circumstance, Madam President. Let us suppose that a corporation--we will call it the ABC Corporation so as to not taint any existing company--purchases half an hour of television time for a news broadcast; in other words, it becomes the sponsor of `The McConnell-Bennett Hour,' assuming for just a moment that both my friend from Kentucky and I have concluded our service in the Senate honorably and are looking to extend our careers in the public arena. 
And McConnell-Bennett, sponsored by the ABC Corp., has a half-hour news show. 
In that, McConnell proceeds to say nice things about the Senator from Texas, who has joined us on the floor. And the Senator from Texas has an opponent who immediately calls the network and says, by putting `The McConnell-Bennett Hour' on, the ABC Corp. has made an expenditure in support of the Senator from Texas. If the ABC Corp. would just pull their support and sponsorship of that program, McConnell would not have the opportunity to say all those nice things about Gramm. And Gramm's opponent says the expenditures made by the ABC Corp. in sponsoring that program are in violation of the Constitution. 
If this sounds somewhat silly, Madam President, it is because it is. 
I yield to my friend from Kentucky.

Mr. BENNETT. If I may, Madam President. I have just thought of an example that I think is a real-life example and not one of the theoretical examples we have been talking about. 
I hope I am not offending anyone to say that the new magazine called the Weekly Standard, in my opinion, is not making any money. I know enough about the business world to look at the number of ads in the Weekly Standard and know what it costs to produce the Weekly Standard to say that the Weekly Standard is at the moment a loser financially. 
I also know enough about the business world to know that Rupert Murdoch, who is funding the Weekly Standard, hopes that that will change. I know that he is not doing this strictly out of the goodness of his heart. And he has sound past history behind him. 
Sports Illustrated, published by Time magazine, did not make any money for years and years and years while it built a constituency for its product. It is now, I understand, the most profitable publication Time magazine has. Undoubtedly, Rupert Murdoch is hoping for a similar track record for the Weekly Standard. But as of now, the Weekly Standard is not making any money. 
Anyone who reads the editorials of the Weekly Standard knows that it is in support of candidates for nomination for office. And Rupert Murdoch is bankrolling it. He is bankrolling it with corporate funds. These are not his personal dollars. He is bankrolling that magazine with corporate funds. 
Suppose we pass this amendment and put limits on candidates to the point where they felt they could not get their message out, and a candidate then went, under cover of night, to Rupert Murdoch's office and said, `Rupert, I am in terrible trouble. Will you please editorialize in the Weekly Standard on my behalf and reprint 400,000 copies and send them as promotional issues to every voter in my home State?'--a corporate contribution made in the name of seeking circulation improvement. It is not an unreasonable scenario. 
And the point that it illustrates is the point that the Senator from Kentucky has made since the day I walked in this Chamber and heard him address this issue. And that is this: Somehow, some way, somewhere the inventive American mind will find a way to spend money on political campaigns no matter what we do. Somehow, somewhere--I love his analogy: Like putting jello on a rock, the thing will find someplace else to go. 
It seems to me, if we want free, honest, open, fair, direct elections, we should focus on the issue of disclosure rather than limits, because the limits have proven time and again throughout our history never to work. 
We talk about how terrible this present situation is. 
Madam President, I lived through the Watergate era. Indeed, I lived through the Watergate era much closer to the Watergate scandal than I wanted to be. 
When I ran for the Senate in 1992, the entire campaign against me mounted by my Democratic opponent was that I was somehow tainted by my association with all of the figures in Watergate. And there are still occasions when I am in these parades on the Fourth of July in the rural towns of Utah where people who are not my political friends holler out, `Hey, Watergate' at me hoping the taint will still stick. Fred Thompson and I are probably the two Members of this body who know more about Watergate from a personal inside experience than anybody. 
Virtually the entire system that we have right now was constructed in response to Watergate. And we were promised at the time it was constructed in a way that it would solve all of our problems. We were promised that with the creation of political action committees, special interest money would disappear. We were promised that with limitations on individuals, we would get democracy like we have never seen it before in campaigns. We were promised that everything would go away if we would just simply adopt these reforms in the name of clean elections. 
Twenty years later, what do we hear? From the same people who made those promises, we are told if we adopt this constitutional amendment all will be wonderful, everything will now suddenly take on a rosy hue and there will be no corruption in American politics again. 
Madam President, I did not believe them then. And I do not believe them now. And I think the track record of the last 20 years indicates that I was right not to believe them then. I hope we do not have a track record for any of us to find out from actual experience that we should believe them now. 
Let me conclude with a personal experience. Everybody always says, no, you should not tell your personal stories. But this is a story I know the best. 
I looked at all of the proposals for campaign reform that were around when I ran. And I realized very quickly they were designed for one purpose--to protect incumbents. Of course, you want to have a spending limit if you are an incumbent. The challenger cannot take you on if there is a spending limit. I ran against an incumbent Congressman. 
What did that mean? That meant when he put out a press release, the taxpayers paid for it because he had a press Secretary that was on his congressional staff. When I put out a press release, I had to pay somebody out of campaign funds in order to write it and disseminate it. 
When he went to see someone in the home State after traveling to Washington, the taxpayers paid for it because he had a travel allowance. When I came to Washington to try to see somebody to raise some money for myself, I had to pay for it myself out of my campaign funds because I did not have any travel allowance. And so on down the list. 
Plus the fact, he had all those years of being invited to Rotary clubs and Kiwanis clubs and Lions clubs to be the speaker. I have been involved with trying to line up speakers for clubs. You are always delighted when you can get someone like a Congressman to come talk to you. I had not been to any of those clubs. None of them was interested in talking to me. 
So you know what I had to do, Madam President, in order to get anybody to listen to me in that campaign? I had to buy them lunch. When I filed my FEC report, I had $86,000 for food. Because the only way I could get anybody to listen to me: I bought them lunch, I bought them breakfast, I bought them dinner. They would come with no intention of voting for me, but they wanted the free meal. 
I just hoped if I could get in the room long enough and talk to them, maybe I could pry a few of them away. 
I started out in that first campaign for the Republican nomination, and there were four of us running for the Republican nomination. One candidate was at 56 percent, in first place. I was at 3 percent, in fourth place, and there was a 4-point margin of error, so I could possibly have been minus 1. 
Would the incumbents have loved a spending limit faced with the opportunity that Bob Bennett might challenge him? Absolutely, absolutely. And a spending limit would be marvelous because then I could not spend all that money for lunch because I simply could not have done it. 
Now, I have said facetiously to some of my Republican friends around here, look, we were opposed to this when we were in the minority. Now that we are in the majority, why are we not for it, because it will return our incumbents and hold the other side down, because their challengers cannot beat us. I am afraid I am not that cynical. I still remember what it is like to be a challenger and the recognition that if we are going to have free and open elections, we have to give the challengers the opportunities to take on the incumbents, and the opportunities to take on the incumbents on the part of the challenger means that the challengers have to have the opportunity to raise the money to pay for the press secretary that the taxpayer pays for for the incumbents, to pay for the travel budget that the taxpayer pays for for the incumbents, to pay for the lunches so they can get in before the audience, that the incumbents get for free. If we put this limit on and say we are going to hold everybody to the same limit, we have just automatically said we are going to take care of the incumbents. 
The only thing that makes any sense to me in terms of campaign finance reform is to increase the level of disclosure, not put any limits, recognizing the reality of what the Senator from Kentucky says, that the money will find a way to be spent. The more limits you put on it, the more you make sure it is the rascals who survive and the naive who get caught. The only way you will get the naive, the fellow who has not figured out all of the ins and outs, who has not worked his way through all of the labyrinth and opportunity to serve in public office is to remove the ins and outs and wipe away the labyrinth. 
I am sure we will have more to say on this as it goes on. I see my friend from Texas has something to say, as he always does. I will listen with interest, as I always do. 
I will leave it at this, Mr. President, but I will return at some future point. I end this as I began. 
Patrick Henry was right when he said, you nail it down, you put it on paper, and you make it very clear. James Madison was right when he caved in to Patrick Henry on that argument, and did it in writing, the Bill of Rights, instead of accepting the assurances that everything would be OK. 
I cannot accept the assurance that Congress will automatically come up with what is the right definition of reasonable. I cannot accept the assurance that expenditures made in support of or opposition to a candidate will be reasonably handled by the Congress. I cannot support putting that kind of language into the Constitution of the United States and thereby creating a circumstance of uncertainty over which lawyers will argue for the next 200 years. 
I was part of the majority that defeated this amendment the last time it came up. I will be part of what I hope will be the majority that defeats it this time. I yield the floor.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, when I came here as a freshman, I remember the first parliamentary situation I got snarled up in, and the man who stepped up to help me unsnarl it and begin to understand the way the Senate worked was the senior Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford]. He sits on the other side of the center aisle from the side I sit on. We have not cast very many votes in the same way. But he has been an unfailing source of good humor and good fellowship, and he has become a close friend. 
I remember, as I contemplate this occasion, one night when I was called upon for late service in the Chair. As things happened that night, the two leaders, for one reason or another, could not seem to get together, and the hour went on and on and on, and they could not call anybody to relieve me in the Chair. I was there until almost midnight. Absolutely nothing was happening on the floor; indeed, nobody was on the floor--except the Senator from Kentucky, who had duty himself that night on behalf of his party. I remember asking him, as a freshman seeking wisdom, as I was looking up in the gallery, `Why are they here at 11 o'clock at night or 11:30 at night, with nothing going on?' They sat there patiently in the gallery. Senator Ford said, `Because the zoo is closed.' 
He has been a delight to be around. I serve now on a task force with him, and I appreciate his candor, his directness, his clear honesty, and his great respect for this institution. This is the kind of Senator we need in terms of this respect. 
There are many who come here who do not recognize the great honor it is to be here and sometimes bring a degree of dishonor to this body and the work it does on behalf of the people. Senator Ford is not in that category. He is in the other category of those who will be missed on both sides of the aisle, a good friend whom we shall look forward to seeing for many years to come even after his service here has ended because we find him such good company and such a fine, fine friend. 
Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, during this debate, we have heard time and again from some of the opponents to the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that we are getting toward balance without a constitutional amendment. The President has proposed a balanced budget by the year 2002. The Republicans have called for a balanced budget by the year 2002. Why do we need a constitutional amendment when we have the result before us? 
I wish to point out that we do not have this result before us. We have the same kind of rhetoric about the balanced budget that we have had for years and years. I will focus primarily upon the President's proposal for a balanced budget by 2002 and express why I do not believe that it will achieve that result and why we need the discipline and the balanced budget amendment in the Constitution to get that result. We are not getting it now. 
If I may, Mr. President, I will show some charts. Here are the levels of deficits outlined in the President's budget. If you look at that chart all by itself, it looks fine. It shows a downward trend. What it does not show is that, in the first year of the President's budget, in 1997, he calls for the deficit at $125 billion, up sharply from fiscal year 1996. So if we are going to have a balanced budget, we start by increasing spending from last year to this year, we start by going from $106 billion, up to a deficit of $125 billion. We stay in that neighborhood through 1998. We stay in that neighborhood in 1999. We don't start coming back to the level of where we are today, at $106 billion, until the year 2000, and we do not see a significant reduction in the deficit from its present level until the year 2001. 
Now, there will be cynics among us who will say that it's not a coincidence that the year 2001, which is the first real year of reduction from where we are now, happens to be the first year that Bill Clinton will be out of office, and the deficit reduction will come only under his successor and successive Congresses. 
We have seen examples of how serious the President is about these outyear budgets. Outyears, Mr. President, is a term that we in Washington use for the future. Folks back home don't understand the term `outyears,' and so maybe they don't understand what we mean when we say this problem will come in the outyears, or we will get it solved in the outyears. What they really mean is we will deal with that tomorrow. I have said on this floor before that I am afraid when it comes to budget matters, the theme song for this administration comes from the musical Annie: `Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love you tomorrow, you're always a day away.' That is what we see here in this deficit level proposed under the President's budget. It will come tomorrow. It will come after the President has left office. It will be future Congresses that will have to deal with that. 
Now, I sit on the Appropriations Committee, Mr. President. As a member of that committee, I see the budget requests that come from members of the executive branch. Last year, I sat on the subcommittee chaired by the Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond, and we had coming before us on that subcommittee a number of agencies that talked about their budgets. One of them was the Veterans' Administration. I have here what Secretary Brown of the Veterans' Administration had to say formally and on the record with respect to his budget. Senator Bond, the chairman of the subcommittee, questioned him about the drastic cuts in the outyears, 
and asked the question: `What is going to happen when you have to make these drastic cuts?' We got an answer from Secretary Brown that says, `I am not going to have to make those cuts. The President has assured me that I will not.' 
Reading along, Senator Bond said, `So you are saying that these outyears mean nothing. It is all going to be negotiated in the future. So we should not worry about the President's budget plan. He does not intend to hold you to those significant decreases in spending. This 7-year budget plan is a sham. It has no substance is what you are saying. You are not planning to live with that budget.' 
That is the statement from the chairman of the subcommittee. This is the response from the Cabinet-level officer in the President's administration to that statement. He says, `I am not planning to live with it. I am not planning to live with your budget * * * nor am I planning to live with the President's line.' 
If the Cabinet officers are not planning to live with the budgets laid down by the President, what credibility should the Congress give to the budget laid down by the President? 
The Secretary said--lest we think the Secretary is speaking on his own, I am quoting from his testimony--the Secretary said, `The President understands that. I talked with him personally about it, and that is one of the reasons why he gave me his personal commitment that he was going to make sure that the Nation honors its commitments to veterans and that he will negotiate the budget each and every year. So the main point that is realistic up there is the President's 1996 budget and his 1996 budget request. We all know what is going to happen to that, but the outyears and the tough decisions will be made each and every year.' 
He said on the record to the Appropriations Committee of this Congress that the only number he was willing to live with was the President's number in 1996 and the rest of it would be left to the future. If I may, tomorrow we will deal with that. Tomorrow, and tomorrow is always the day away. 
Lest you think this was an isolated incident, I take you to another hearing that occurred in that same subcommittee on which I sat. This has to do with NASA. I am a great supporter of NASA. I believe we get our money back tenfold that we spend in NASA in terms of the technology spinoff that takes place, the jobs that are created. I think NASA is a place where we should continue to spend money. It is the same thing. NASA was going to have a nice budget for the near term, the present budget, and then there would be drastic cuts in the outyears. 
Senator Bond said to Dr. Goldin, Administrator of NASA, `Now, I understand you have been told that the numbers should be expected to change for the outyears, so there is no need to defend any specific funding level in his budget, nor any likely programmatic consequence of such funding levels. Is that your understanding?' Dr. Goldin, Presidential appointee, Administrator of NASA, said, `Yes, and based upon assurances I have had by discussions with the administration, I expect that as the clarity comes into focus, the outyear budgets will change.' 
We all know which way they will change. They will go up. As I say, I am delighted by that because I am a strong supporter of NASA. But I am not delighted by the sleight of hand that occurs in the overall budget figures which we saw in the first chart where the President says, overall, yes, we can continue spending at a level higher than we are spending today for all of the years that I am in office and then we will project that the savings will come. This is what we are being told is the budget. This budget proves that we do need a budget amendment. This budget shows we do need the discipline which would come from writing something into the Constitution. 
Mr. President, I have one other chart that I want to share with you and others who may be watching which puts this whole debate into a different perspective. I have used this chart on the floor before. It is a slightly different chart than many we have 
seen. This is not a chart of the debt in absolute terms. This is a chart of the debt in relative terms. 
Frankly, to me, as a former businessman, the relative terms make more sense. If you take the debt as an absolute number and do not have anything to compare it to, it frankly doesn't mean much. I have used this analogy on the floor before. But I have learned since I have been in the Senate that there is no such thing as repetition. So I can use it again with a perfectly clear conscience. 
Taking a business with which I was involved before I came to the Senate, when I went to work for this business as its chief executive officer it had debt of $75,000. That debt, given the size of the company, was sufficient to sink the company. They were doing a total of $250,000 in business, a total volume $250,000 a year, and they owed $75,000 in debt. They were in serious trouble. There was no way they could pay that debt off with $250,000 in total volume because their margin on that total volume that they could keep after they bought the raw materials for their product was relatively small. They were in deep trouble at $75,000 in debt. 
When I left the company prior to my run for the Senate, that company had $7.5 million in debt. And if all you looked at was a chart that showed $75,000 to $7.5 million, you would say this company is clearly going broke, and what terrible stewardship Mr. Bennett provided as the chief executive officer of the company if he allowed the debt to rise from only $75,000 to $7.5 million in only 6 years. When we had $7.5 million in debt, the company was doing $80 million in annual revenue and we happened to have about $20 million in cash. You say, `Well, why would you have any debt if you had $20 million in cash?' It was left over from the period of time when we had to mortgage some of the buildings in order to get some built and there were prepayment penalties on the mortgages. So it made more sense to the shareholders for us to keep the cash than to pay the prepayment penalties on the mortgages. So the size of the debt frankly was not the key issue. The question was, how big a debt do you have compared to the financial strength of the company? And $7.5 million in debt compared to the financial strength of the company when I left it was frankly nothing at all to be concerned about, whereas the $75,000 in debt when I began there was threatening to destroy the company. 
So I have taken the national debt and expressed it not in absolute terms, not in the debt where it was in this year and how rapidly it has risen to where it is now, but as a percentage of the economy, gross domestic product, the total production of goods and services in a year. And you will see that the greatest time of debt in the history of this country as a percentage of gross domestic product, or GDP as we abbreviated it, was at the height of the Second World War. This is 1945. Our debt stood at 130 percent of our total year's output of goods and services. 
Now, you will notice that at the end of the war the debt as a percentage of GDP started falling and kept falling fairly dramatically, and kept falling and kept falling and it bottomed out in the mid-1970's. It got down to about 30 percent of GDP, from 130 down to 30, and then something started to happen. 
And then something started to happen. It started to happen before Ronald Reagan became President. It started to happen before the defense buildup under Caspar Weinberger. It started to happen before the tax cuts that were passed by this Republican Senate in the early 1980's. The debt started during the Jimmy Carter years, and it started back up. And for the first time in our history we saw the debt increasing as a percentage of GDP during peacetime. Prior to that, the debt always came down during peacetime, and only went up during wartime, as a percentage of GDP. 
What happened? Was it Jimmy Carter's fault? Was it the Republican Congress' fault? Frankly, it was the kicking in of the automatic increases of entitlements in an aging population that started the debt to increase as a percentage of the gross domestic product. No politician was responsible for it, and no politician can take credit for having solved it until we muster the courage and the strength on this floor to address the issue of the automatic nature of entitlement increases. 
We have been unable to do that. We have talked about it, but we have been unable to muster the necessary political courage. We meet in the cloakrooms, we meet in the dining room where we talk to each other, and we tell each other this is what we have to do, and then we do not muster the majorities to do it. There is one way to make sure we will muster the majorities to do it and start this back down, which is where it needs to be moving. The way to do that is to write into the Constitution, the basic document that governs all of our activities, the requirement that we balance the budget, and have no deficit. As the economy grows, even if the debt stays exactly where it is, it will diminish as a percentage of GDP as it did in the 30 years between the end of the Second World War and the time when it started back up. We can go back to that downward trend if we just keep the debt where it is. And the only way we keep the debt where it is is to balance outlays with income every year. I say the time has come to put the requirement that we do that into our basic document, the Constitution, at which point we will then have a balanced budget. 
Mr. President, there are many other things I could say about all of the debate that has gone on on this floor. Frankly, much of what I have heard in the debate on this floor I think is irrelevant to the core issue. I can comment on the various amendments to the balanced budget amendment that have been raised. I will not because these issues have been dealt with by my colleagues in great depth, and I see no point in repeating all of that. 
I am a reluctant convert to the idea of a balanced budget amendment. I have made that point clear before. I do not like amending the Constitution. I have voted against amendments to the Constitution that many of my colleagues thought were meritorious simply because I think the Constitution is so significant a basic document that we should exhaust every other remedy before we consider amending it. 
It is with great reluctance that I make an exception to that position with respect to the question of the balanced budget. If we do not have the discipline written into our basic document dealing with this issue, our past history shows that we cannot control the impact of the entitlement increase on future generations. 
So for that reason, I announce, with all my misgivings about amending the Constitution, that in this case the issue is so important, the challenge is so significant that an amendment to the Constitution is called for. That is why I intend to vote for the amendment that is before us, why I have voted and will continue to vote against any crippling amendments to that amendment and hope that the rest of the Senate and ultimately the rest of the country will come to realize that the only way to start these yellow lines going back down again in a significant, historic trend is to write a basic requirement into the Constitution of the United States. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, in the last Congress, by coincidence, on my birthday, President Clinton announced the creation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, taking 1.7 million acres in the State of Utah and creating a national monument under the authority of the Antiquities Act of 1906. This, frankly, caught a number of us by complete surprise --well, maybe not complete surprise, because we had seen reports in the newspaper that this might be coming. But whenever we spoke to anybody in the administration about it, we were constantly told that no decision has been made. 
Congressman Orton, the Democratic Congressman in the district in which this land was located, was told `nothing is imminent.' Even 24 hours before the announcement was made, people in the White House were insisting that nothing was coming down on this particular subject. And then, as I say, on the morning of my birthday, I received a phone call from Leon Panetta, not to wish me happy birthday, but to inform me that the President would indeed be creating a new national monument in Utah under his authority as outlined in the Antiquities Act. 
The process by which the monument was put together was entirely closed to any elected official. No one from the State of Utah who holds elected office--not the Governor, neither of the Members of this body, not the Members of the other body, no one--was allowed to make comments or be involved in the process of creating the monument. We now know, however, from press reports that members of what is called the environmental community were involved in writing this proclamation. They had access to the White House, to the Department of Interior, and to administration officials that the rest of us were denied. 
Out of this closed process came the national monument and, with it, frankly, Mr. President, considerable antagonism and disappointment on the part of many people in Utah--if polls can be believed, a large majority of the people of Utah--at the way they were treated in this matter. `Not to worry,' we were assured by the President at the Grand Canyon. And I was assured personally on the phone by Leon Panetta that there would be protections of the rights of ordinary citizens written into the pattern of the way this monument would be managed. 
Mr. Panetta outlined those to me, and I wrote them down. Then, when the President appeared on national television, I followed my list and saw that the President was going down the same list. That is, he made exactly the same promises that Mr. Panetta had made as to the way things would be handled in the monument. 
Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill. It will be known as the Grand Staircase-Escalante Resource Protection Act. Its sole purpose is to codify the promises the President made when he created the monument. I said to my staff, `Do not put everything in this bill you think we must have. Just make sure the act is entirely just what the President promised he would do.' 
Let me give you some examples of what I mean. On this chart we have the President's statement made on September 18 when he said: `Families will be able to use this canyon as they always have. The land will remain open for multiple uses, including hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, and grazing.' 
Many of the people who have reacted to the creation of the monument have made it clear that there should never be multiple uses on this land. They say that this would be incompatible with its designation as `wilderness.' But the President did not designate the land as wilderness. He designated it as a national monument, and he specifically promised--these are his words--that `The land will remain open for multiple use . . .' This was taken off the transcript that was available to us the day the President made his statement. 
Another promise the President made is on this chart. It is a little bit longer, but to the people in Utah it may be even more important. He said, `Mining revenues from Federal and State land help to support your schools.' 
He was speaking to the people of Utah. 
I know the children of Utah have a big stake in school lands located within the boundaries of the monument that I am designating today . . . creating this national monument should not and will not come at the expense of Utah's children. 
That is a very important commitment made by the President. It has to do with the fact that almost 200,000 acres in this monument are owned by a trust that administers these lands for the benefit of Utah's schoolchildren. Under the monument designation, conceivably the trust would lose that ownership unless there can be a pattern of swapping out school acres for other acres outside the boundaries of the monument. 
These are a few of the President's promises. 
There was another one which I do not have on the chart but that struck me personally. The President said, `We will appoint an exchange working group, including Congressman Orton and the two Senators as well as the Governor and others, that will examine this issue of school trust land.' 
It has now been 6 months since the President made that statement, and no such group has been proposed by anybody. It has been 6 months since the President made that proclamation, and we don't see any indication that he intends to instruct people to follow through on the promise that the people will be able to use the canyon as they always have. And we see no indication that the people in the administration are taking any steps to make Utah's schoolchildren whole for the income that they will lose as a result of the creation of this monument. 
If I were to pick up the phone and call the White House today and ask for Leon Panetta to remind him of the pledge he made to me, I would be told, `Mr. Panetta doesn't work here anymore.' So I have decided to take the promises that the President made in this speech, which was before the entire country on national television, and write those promises into law. Many people have said, `Oh, you are going to do terrible things if you write those into law. You are going to undo every protection that is important to this monument.' To them I say, if you do not like these promises, argue with William Jefferson Clinton. Don't argue with me because they were his pledges; not mine. 
Some groups have seized on some language that I have in the bill describing what will be permitted in the monument and say, `You go far beyond the President in the things you allow. Where did you get the idea that mining and timber and those kinds of things should be allowed?' My answer is, I took the definition of `multiple use' that is in the FLPMA handbook produced by the Department of the Interior and reproduced it, neither subtracting nor adding anything. I made no attempt to put my judgment as to what `multiple use' means. I used the manual that is produced by the Department of the Interior to define what `multiple use' means. 
By virtue of the introduction of this bill, we will now have 
hearings. There will be hearings both in the House and the Senate. I am told that a companion bill will be introduced on the other side of the Capitol. 
I myself point out that these hearings are open, unlike the process the President followed, which was closed. These hearings will allow those who disagree with me--and I heard from some people this afternoon who disagreed with me quite vehemently--an opportunity to come before the Congress and tell the Congress what they think the President meant when he used these words. These hearings will give the Department of the Interior the opportunity to come before the Congress and tell the Congress what they think the President meant when he used these words. If they can make a plausible case to the Congress, I am perfectly willing to amend the bill and accept changes. The thing I am not willing to do is to accept, as some have said, that `This was merely a campaign speech. The President should not be held to honor any commitment he made in that speech because it was in the heat of the campaign.' 
We are talking, Mr. President, about 1.7 million acres of land in my State. That is a land mass bigger than some of the States represented by Senators who sit here in this Chamber. We are talking about a major action that impacts the future of the people of southern Utah. That being the case, we must codify what the President said so that these commitments are kept whether they were made in a campaign speech or not.

 Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Sybil Shumway Stewart, Utah's 1996 Mother of the Year. I want to recognize her for the decades of service to her community, her church, and her family. We have been proud to have her represent our State this past year. 
Sybil Shumway was born in Trenton, UT, on April 1, 1920, the youngest of four daughters, raised under the most humble of circumstances during the Great Depression. Sybil's father was a schoolteacher who taught in Cache County schools and was respected throughout the community. From the earliest age, her parents instilled in her the fundamental values of hard work, honesty and integrity, sacrifice and service. 
As a student in junior high school, Sybil recalls her civics teacher detailing the rise of Hitler and Nazi Germany and subsequently learned to cherish and value the freedoms many of us often take for granted. She committed herself at that time to serving her community and country. She also recognized the importance that she teach her own children to cherish these same values. 
Sybil graduated from Logan High School and Utah State University in 1942. Her desire to give something back to her community led her to pursue an occupation as a schoolteacher. While she only taught for a short while, she sees many of her students today. Her students never fail to express their appreciation for the skills they learned in her home economics class. 
On Valentine's Day 1943, Sybil Shumway received an engagement ring in the mail from a young Army Air Corps lieutenant named Boyd Stewart, whom she had dated in college. They were married on May 21, 1943, while Boyd was home on weekend leave. They embarked on their life together and left that night for Randolph Field in Texas where Boyd was stationed as a flight instructor. After 20-plus years of Air Force duty and more than 30 years of running two farms, their marriage is still going strong almost 54 years later. 
Sybil and Boyd raised 10 children; 6 boys and 4 girls. They taught their children the value of hard work and service to their fellow men. They instilled in each of them a love of God, country, community, and family. Sybil and Boyd's children went on to become schoolteachers, government administrators, successful business owners, elected officials, community activists, farmers, Scout leaders, a published author, and a world record holder. Five of their six sons served in our Nation's Armed Forces. Four of those sons served as missionaries for their church. Most important, following the example of their mother, those 10 children are now devoted parents to 41 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren. Indeed, Sybil's legacy and example will live on for generations to come. 
In our world today, success is unfortunately often measured by great wealth, an expensive education, and the recognition and honors of men. Sybil Stewart has proven that the greatest success one can have is within the walls of their own home. I congratulate her on the completion of her term as Utah's 1996 Mother of the Year. I know that to her family however, she will always be the Mother of the Year.
