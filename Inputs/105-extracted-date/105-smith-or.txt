Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, among the provisions included in the tax package we voted on today is a provision of great importance to the charitable giving community: an extension of the enhanced deduction for contributions of publicly-traded stock to private foundations. Although extending this deduction benefits many and is a useful tool for providing funds for charitable purposes, this deduction alone is not enough. 
In this era of ever-tightening fiscal constraints, we have asked our communities to do more and more for those less fortunate. Charitable organizations in our communities have become an integral part of the safety net for the poor and homeless and significant sources of assistance for education, health care, child development and the arts. 
To meet the increasing deficit in unmet social needs, the government cannot merely expect the private sector to fill the gap, but must provide the leadership for the use of private sector resources through changes in the Tax Code. One source of untapped resources for charitable purposes is the contribution of closely held corporate stock. Under current law, the tax cost of contributing closely held stock to a charity or foundation is prohibitive, and it discourages families and owners from disposing of their businesses in this manner. 
Earlier this year, I was joined by Senators Feinstein, Wyden, Baucus, and Gorton in introducing legislation that would provide an incentive to business owners to use their corporate wealth for charitable causes. S. 1412, the Charitable Giving Incentive Act of 1998, would permit a closely-held business to transfer its assets into a 501(c)(3) charitable organization without paying the 35 percent corporate level tax. Thus, the recipient charity would receive the full benefit of the gift. Identical legislation has also been introduced in the House by Representatives Dunn, Furse, Nethercutt, Hooley, Paul, and Smith of Oregon. 
In addition to this bipartisan congressional support, we have garnered support from the charitable community. It is my intention to reintroduce this legislation in the 106th Congress, and I look forward to working with the Finance Committee Chairman Roth, Ranking Member Moynihan and my Senate colleagues to legislate changes that will make it easier for the citizens of this country to give to charitable causes.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, as we take up the Omnibus appropriations bill, I would like to take this opportunity to express my extreme disappointment that the Agricultural Job Opportunity Benefits and Security Act amendment, known as AgJOBS, was eliminated from the Omnibus bill. 
The bipartisan AgJOBS amendment received a veto proof majority vote of 68-31 when it was added to the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill earlier this year. We had a golden opportunity to reform the current bureaucratic H-2A immigrant visa program that has made fugitives out of farmworkers and felons out of farmers. The amendment would have created a workable system for recruiting farm workers domestically and preventing our American crops from rotting in the fields. 
Unfortuantely, the Clinton Administration was content with the status quo and threatened to veto the Omnibus bill if the balanced AgJOBS amendment was included. 
Mr. President, I find the Administration's veto threat quite troubling since the Omnibus appropriations bill contains a multi-billion dollar disaster relief package for traditional program-crop agriculture to help deal with losses sustained as a result of the world financial crisis. 
The disaster relief goes to producers who already have a long history of reliance on federal assistance, yet the farm disaster bill does nothing to help producers of labor intensive commodities--fruits, vegetables, and horticultural specialties--who are not supported by the government and who are facing a crisis of nationwide labor shortages created by our own government. This crisis has been exacerbated by our current unworkable legal foreign worker program. 
A farmworker shortage ultimately affects America's ability to compete in the world agriculture market. According to the United States Department of Agriculture data, about three off-farm jobs are sustained by each on-farm production job. Therefore, nearly three times as many U.S. workers will lose their U.S. jobs as the number of foreign farmworkers kept out of the United States increases. 
Mr. President, I also cannot understand the inconsistency of the Administration enacting the H-1B high-tech worker bill and not enacting H-2A reform as embodied in our AgJOBS bill. 
Our AgJOBS bill contains worker benefits far in excess of those provided by the H-1B high-tech worker bill. Our bill guarantees above-prevailing wages for lower wage occupations, free housing to both U.S. and foreign workers recruited from outside the local area, reimbursement of inbound and return transportation costs to both U.S. and foreign workers recruited from outside the local area, and penalties that include lifetime program debarment for violations. The H-1B requires only the prevailing wage without any housing or transportation benefits and provides a maximum penalty of a 3-year debarment. 
Mr. President, we cannot continue to allow our farmers and farmworkers to be trapped in a system that rewards illegal labor practices and punishes the most vulnerable. 
As we address reform of the H-2A immigrant visa program early next year, I hope my colleagues will work with me to finally safeguard basic human rights, provide a reliable documented work force for farmers, and reward legal conduct to both farmers and farmworkers.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President. In these closing days of the 105th Congress, I would be remiss if I did not pay tribute to those who toil everyday behind the scenes to make our lives easier. I am speaking of the very dedicated and professional group of public servants who comprise the Congressional Research Service. Access to reliable information--and the ability to get it quickly--is critical to the effective functioning of the Senate, and I am particularly grateful to the Congressional Research Service employees for their professional and timely responses to the many requests for information they receive from Senators and their staffs. 
It is difficult for me to imagine this institution's functioning without access to reliable information, and it is with deep appreciation that I commend researchers of the Congressional Research Service for responding quickly, pleasantly, professionally and with attention to detail to the many requests received from my office. It is this type of dedicated service that government employees all too often perform, and no one hears anything about it. This is a group of people who take their commitment to the Congress and the American people very seriously. And they deliver. 
Mr. President, the Congressional Research Service provides a truly unique and indispensable service to the Congress. It has certainly made my first term as a U.S. Senator easier and more productive. I congratulate all of the workers there on their fine work and extend to them my heartfelt thanks.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for a High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) designation for the State of Oregon. On October 1, 1998 Senator Wyden and I sent letters to the Director of the Office of the National Drug Control Policy, General Barry McCaffrey and Attorney General Janet Reno requesting the designation. 
High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (also known as HIDTAs) were authorized in 1988 by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 and are administered by the Office of National Drug Control Policy. HIDTA designations are granted to regions that are centers of illegal drug production, manufacturing, importation or distribution and have harmful impacts on the entire country. Once a HIDTA has been designated, increased funding is granted to the State, design strategies to combat drug threats are adopted and these designs are then strategically implemented. The Office of National Drug Control Policy's HIDTA Program has been profoundly successful in those regions where it has been implemented. 
Mr. President, the State of Oregon is in desperate need of this designation. Western States--California, Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, and regions in the Rocky Mountains--have received designations to help them combat tremendous drug trafficking challenges. Oregon has been too long without assistance, fighting national and international traffickers. 
This request is not idly made. It comes following more than a year of work with local and federal law enforcement agencies, and the U.S. Attorney's Office. There experience, dedication and tireless commitment to eliminating drug production, trafficking, and use is to be commended. Unfortunately, they have insufficient resources to combat this scourge in Oregon or the country. I appreciate their coordinated efforts and have learned through meetings with them and extensive work in my State that we must act--and act now. 
I am proud to report that in our first meeting of the HIDTA steering committee, of which I am a member, the Department of Defense announced it was sending Joint Task Force Six to Oregon to engage in a drug threat assessment. As we speak, Task Force Six is conducting its study in our state and will present its report to us at our next steering committee meeting on October 29, 1998. Having requested a copy of the threat assessment for Washington State's HIDTA Program in the Seattle-Tacoma areas and met with Washington State Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) specialists, I am confident our request will be accepted. The obstacles we face in fighting drug production and trafficking are similar. 
Oregon's central location along the Interstate 5, and its proximity to the coast, render it particularly vulnerable to those who move heroine, cocaine and marijuana. For many years traffickers have moved large quantities of illegal drugs along interstate 5, highway 101, highway 97 and interstate 84. Crackdowns along interstate 5 have been successful, but the insufficiency of resources has produced an unbalanced, under-powered drug defense. Drug shipments from Central America moving along these routes continue to increase, while Pacific Rim countries feed the problem through Oregon ports. These drug shipments are then trafficked throughout the continental United States. 
This flow, from sources outside Oregon, has introduced a criminal element into the fabric of Oregon society. They came to produce and sell drugs, and stayed to enjoy the climate, the abundance of space and breathtaking beauty, as well as the serenity and tranquility of our fields and forests. These very qualities that make Oregon unique are also the qualities that drug traffickers found beneficial to their trade. 
The facts are indisputable. In 1991, only 7 years ago, there were 39 drug-related deaths in Oregon. There were 221 such deaths in 1997. Methamphetamine use among incarcerated adults increased from 30 percent in 1991-1992 to 49 percent in 1996-1997. 
Children are the most victimized. There were 629 juvenile arrests for drug offenses in 1991, and 2,392 in 1997. The number of juveniles treated in drug treatment centers increased from 1,742 in 1991 to 4,028 in 1996. The Oregon Public School Drug Use Survey Key Findings Report states that since 1990, marijuana use by eighth graders--eighth graders--mind you!, has tripled, while marijuana use by eleventh graders has increased 68 percent. General illicit drug use by eighth graders has doubled since 1992, and over the same time period increased in eleventh graders by 21 percent. 
I have given this problem much thought in the past few months. While I am confident that a HIDTA designation is vital to our ability to deter drug trafficking and production, this problem has been further exacerbated by the current Administration's failure to focus and its diminished emphasis on the international component to the war on drugs. That is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act of 1998 (S. 2522) which calls for an additional $2.6 billion investment in international counter narcotics efforts over the next three years. This bi-partisan legislation restores funding to international interdiction and eradication efforts that were all but abandoned in 1993. Without decreasing domestic funding or effort, this legislation recommits the nation to fighting drugs with a comprehensive international approach. 
We, Oregonians, are committed to the welfare of our State. We will drive the criminal elements from our borders. Finally, Mr. President, we have no choice but to fight. We have no alternative but to win. I thank the chair.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I was inspired to come to the floor to respond and to support the words of my friend from Arizona as he spoke very eloquently and emotionally about the plight of the people of Kosovo. Growing up as a little boy, I have to tell you, I saw, with all Americans, reports and film footage from the Second World War where we saw a holocaust carried out in a previous decade. And I reacted with horror at things that I saw that humankind could do to one another. 
It just seemed to me, at a young age, that if we had the ability to stop holocausts in our time that we should. I know we cannot be the policemen of the world, but I am here to tell you we are right now in Bosnia. We supported our President. And we are maintaining peace in Bosnia. But right next door we are witnessing a holocaust unfold before our eyes, and we apparently are paralyzed in our efforts to respond. 
Winter is coming, and tens of thousands of Kosovar Albanians are in the hills and will soon die if something is not done to ensure their rights, to ensure their safety, and to stop the bloodshed. 
Mr. President, I want to suggest that one person is solely and directly responsible for the catastrophe unfolding before our eyes, and that is President Milosevic of Serbia. He has indicated no willingness to negotiate a solution that will allow the Kosovar Albanians to exercise their legitimate political rights. He is interested in one thing and one thing only--the consolidating and maintaining of his power on that country and region. And he apparently will do anything to ensure that this remains the case. 
Mr. President, for months the United States and our allies have stood by and watched one onslaught after another in Kosovo, rendering enormous tragedies in that land; and yet we just respond with critical statements in the face of Serb offenses. For months the United States has told Milosevic that we will not let him get away with in Kosovo what he has done in Bosnia, but yet we do nothing. We do nothing to stop his onslaught. For months, the United States has threatened the use of force if Mr. Milosevic does not take necessary actions to withdraw his forces from Kosovo and to begin a serious process of negotiation. 
I am saddened to say the other day a reporter just outside this Chamber asked me if we were doing nothing as a country in the face of this holocaust because of the President's internal difficulties, because of his unwillingness to wag the dog, if you will. I cannot think of anything more indicative of why we need to make sure our Commander in Chief can respond, to have a Commander in Chief that can respond with the integrity of his office. And here we sit paralyzed in the face of unfolding, unspeakable tragedy. 
I am here to say one thing to Mr. Milosevic: Our patience in the U.S. Senate is running out. I join the Senator from Arizona, and many others, in saying time has run out and that I will support vigorous and, if necessary, unilateral use of force against Serbian installations in Kosovo and in Serbia proper. It is time for American leadership in Kosovo. It is unfortunate that we have thus far not seen evidence of this from the Clinton administration. 
If it is up to Congress to provide the leadership, so be it. I welcome Senator McCain's call for action. I understand the former majority leader, Bob Dole, has made the same call. And I join them today in support of America doing something unilaterally, if necessary, to take action to stop this tragedy, this unfolding holocaust. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to transfer the administrative jurisdiction over certain lands within or adjacent to the Rogue River National Forest and to clarify the authority of the Bureau of Land Management to sell and exchange Oregon and California Railroad grant lands (O and C lands) in Oregon. The bill represents a thoughtfully crafted compromise agreed to by the majority and minority in the other body, and the O and C counties and the timber industry in my state. 
Title I of the bill would consolidate the management over certain parcels of federal land by transferring jurisdiction over these parcels between the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The status of any O and C lands transferred will not change, regardless of which agency has jurisdiction over the lands following the transfer. This is not a land exchange in the traditional sense, but rather the transfer of jurisdiction between two agencies of lands already in federal ownership. It is my understanding that the Administration supports this transfer. 
Title II of the bill provides that, over successive ten-year periods, there will be no net loss of acres designated as O and C lands. These lands are somewhat unique in the federal inventory, and are managed in accordance with the Act of August 28, 1937, and other applicable federal statutes. 
There have been concerns on the part of the O and C counties that the O and C lands will be used by the federal government in land exchanges and sales, thereby diminishing the total acreage over time. Since the counties rely on revenues from these lands, it is important to clarify that it is the intent of Congress that the acreage remain constant.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, the wintering Canada goose population has increased ten times in the last twenty years, to 250,000 geese in the Lower Columbia River and Willamette Valley regions. The result has been large numbers of geese grazing on private agricultural fields of wheat, corn, grass seed, and many other crops, leading to huge financial losses for farmers. Farmers have been meeting since the early 1980s with local wildlife officials to create coordinated resource management plans to relieve depredation, but with no results. In 1997, the first Pacific Flyway Council plan was assembled to deal with agricultural depredation by migratory Canada geese. Farmers met with state and federal wildlife officials and other interested parties from Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and California to create a plan that all parties could agree to--as a first step. This funding will implement some of the priorities of that plan.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment requiring the Secretary of State to report on actions taken by our Ambassador to the United Nations to push the nations of the Western Europe and Others Group to accept Israel into their group. 
As you may know, Israel is the only nation among the 185 member states that does not hold membership in a regional group. Membership in a regional group is the prerequisite for any nation to serve on key United Nations bodies such as the Security Council. 
In order to correct this inequality, I am introducing `The Equality for Israel at the United Nations Act of 1998.' I believe that this legislation will prompt our United Nations Representative to make equality for Israel at the United Nations a high priority. 
I am proud to be joined by Senators Brownback, Allard, Bond, Grams, Dodd, Sessions, Collins, Wyden, D'Amato and Thomas as original cosponsors of this important legislation. 
Mr. President, Israel has been a member of the United Nations since 1949, yet it has been continuously precluded from membership in any regional bloc. Most member states from the Middle East would block the vote needed to join their own regional group. 
The Western Europe and Others Group, however, has accepted countries from other geographical areas such as the United States and Australia, for example. 
This year United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan announced that `It's time to usher in a new era of relations between Israel and the United Nations * * * One way to rectify that new chapter would be to rectify an anomaly: Israel's position as the only Member State that is not a member of one of the regional groups, which means it has no chance of being elected to serve on main organs such as the Security Council or the Economic and Social Council. This anomaly would be corrected.' 
I believe it is time to back Secretary General Annan's idea with strong support from the United States Senate and I ask all my colleagues to join me in sending this message to the UN to stop this discrimination against Israel.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, we have all watched the events in Kosovo with alarm and distress over the past several months. The situation on the ground continues to deteriorate and no progress has been made on a negotiated solution to the conflict. 
Serb paramilitary groups and Yugoslav army units are conducting offensives in Kosovo that have the effect of driving tens of thousands of Kosovar Albanians from their homes. Innocent civilians have been killed. Villages throughout the province have been razed. Humanitarian workers in Kosovo are in great danger as they try to fulfill their mission of delivering food, medicine, and other necessities to the refugee population. 
In fact, just recently, in a despicable act, three aid workers with the Mother Theresa Society in Kosovo were deliberately killed by Serbian forces as they attempted to deliver humanitarian assistance to Kosovars that had been displaced by the conflict. Fighting has occurred on the border with Albania, highlighting the potential for this conflict to spread throughout the Balkans, and even involve Greece and Turkey, two of our NATO allies. 
Mr. President, I lay the blame of this disaster on the shoulders of one man: Slobodan Milosevic. Mr. Milosevic, currently President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, rose to power in 1989 by exploiting and manipulating Serbian nationalism in Kosovo--a process that led directly to the horrific war in Bosnia and resulted in the death of tens of thousands of Bosnians of all ethnic groups. In his desperate effort to hold onto power, Milosevic has reverted to his old tricks: he is using the status of Kosovo--a province which is overwhelmingly populated by ethnic Albanians--to consolidate and perpetuate his authority and position. 
The six-nation Contact Group charged with monitoring events in the former Yugoslavia has issued various sets of demands since the crisis began in February--demands which Milosevic repeatedly ignores. I am aware of the diplomatic effort underway to start the process of negotiating a settlement. Yet no solution will endure that does not guarantee the Albanians in Kosovo their full political rights and civil liberties. 
Mr. President, for several years, the Clinton Administration has maintained a policy of upholding the so-called `outer wall' of sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The FRY is what remains of socialist Yugoslavia, and consists of two republics, Serbia and Montenegro. 
The outer wall denies United States' support of FRY membership in international organizations. It denies United States' support for FRY access to economic assistance provided by international financial institutions. And the outer wall withholds full United States diplomatic relations with the FRY. 
The Administration has stated that the FRY and Mr. Milosevic must fulfill five conditions before the outer wall of sanctions is lifted. The amendment that we have before us today requires the President to certify these five conditions are met before any action is taken to lift or to weaken the outer wall. 
These five conditions as laid out by senior officials of the Clinton Administration are as follows. First, all succession issues due to the break-up of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia--in particular, the division of assets and liabilities--must be resolved with the other republics that emerged from the dissolution of that country. Second, the FRY must comply with all of its obligations as a signatory of the Dayton Accords. Third, the FRY must cooperate with the War Crimes Tribunal that is investigating and prosecuting war criminals in the former Yugoslavia. Fourth, the FRY must make substantial progress in implementing democratic reforms. And finally, the FRY must make progress in resolving the situation in Kosovo. 
When discussing `progress' in Kosovo, I want to emphasize that progress does not mean the end of the Serbian policy of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Nor does it mean Serbian paramilitary forces ceasing their operations directed at civilians in Kosovo. That is not progress. Progress is a negotiated settlement that allows ethnic Albanians to exercise their political rights. 
Let me be clear: the problem here is Mr. Milosevic, not the Serbian people. The Serbian people must not be blamed for the irrational policies promoted by Milosevic. I want to be helpful to those in Serbia who are courageously opposing the detrimental policies propounded by him. These individuals are trying to establish independent media that will provide unbiased reporting to the Serbian people; they are working to strengthen the democratic opposition, small though it is, to Milosevic's stronghold on power; they are trying to develop a civil society based on the rule of law. They need our help--and they deserve our help. 
But Mr. Milosevic--and the Serbian people--must understand that Milosevic either needs to comply with the five conditions laid out by the Administration or his country will continue to be isolated into the next century. 
Before continuing, Mr. President, I must take note of the positive developments that have occurred this year in Montenegro, Serbia's partner in the FRY. Montenegro has made great strides in implementing necessary reforms to make the transition from a socialist state with a centrally planned economy to a free market democracy. 
Events in Montenegro prove that democracy can take root and flourish in the FRY, but requires leaders that are committed to a pluralistic, multi-ethnic state. It is in our interests to support Montenegrin President Djukanovic in his effort to consolidate and accelerate the democratic reform process. Though Mr. Milosevic has made every attempt to frustrate President Djukanovic's efforts, the Montenegrin people have spoken--and their choice is democracy. 
Mr. President, the amendment we have before us clearly states exactly what Mr. Milosevic needs to do for his country to join the family of Western nations. This is not a secret to him. It has been the position of this Administration for several years. What is new, however, is that this amendment prohibits the FRY from joining international organizations, such as the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and prohibits the FRY from gaining access to assistance from international financial institutions until each of these five conditions are met. 
What we are asking for is responsible behavior. Before lifting the outer wall of sanctions--which in effect is a reward for Serbia--we should expect nothing less. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. President, I understand that these amendments may be accepted by the managers of the bill. So I will not ask for the yeas and nays. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues who are conferees for the Fiscal Year 1999 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill to retain the Senate-passed funding level for the Army Corps of Engineers' fish and wildlife mitigation measures on the Columbia River. 
The Senate approved $95 million for this program, which is vitally important to ongoing efforts to restore the salmon and steelhead runs in the Columbia and Snake Rivers. Unfortunately, the House-passed bill slashed funding for the program to less than $8 million, enough for just two studies already underway in the Basin. The House Committee justifies this action by claiming that the funds spent to date have not recovered the salmon. Further, the House report states that since a major decision on the long-term operations of the federal dams on the system is supposed to occur in 1999, we should just wait for that decision before we spend any more money on salmon recovery efforts in the basin. 
Given the life cycle of the salmon, waiting even a few years is simply not an option. Inaction on our part could push the salmon closer to extinction, which is unacceptable to those of us in the Pacific Northwest. We must also be realistic about the possibility that the 1999 decision could be delayed. And unless a regional consensus is developed soon on how best to proceed, the decision--whenever it comes--is bound to be controversial and subject to challenges. 
Work on these fish mitigation measures, for which most of the funding will be reimbursed through power revenues, must continue while a long-term solution is developed and implemented. The House approach to this issue fails to recognize that most of the funding is earmarked for important mitigation facilities at dams not being studied for permanent drawdown or by-pass, including McNary Dam and Bonneville Dam, as well as for important mitigation analysis studies. Information from these studies is needed if we are to make an informed decision on the long-term operation of the system. 
Let me state emphatically that I am opposed to removal or drawdown of dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers, which would destroy navigation on the river, affect irrigation, and eliminate up to 40 percent of Bonneville's generating capacity. There are those in the region who view this an `either/or' proposition: either the river is operated for salmon, or for economic activity. I say we can operate it for both. 
The Columbia River truly is the lifeblood of the Northwest. The Basin drains approximately 259,000 square miles, and encompasses two countries and seven states in its approximately 1,200 miles to the Pacific Ocean. 
In this century, we have harnessed the River for a variety of human activities and benefits, including navigation, water supply, power supply, and flood control. At the time many of the great public works projects in the Basin were constructed, fish and wildlife impacts were not fully considered. We are now struggling with the best way to mitigate these impacts while still meeting human needs. The consequences of these decisions could affect the livelihoods of most Northwest residents. 
I know that there are those who oppose funding certain activities on the River that they view to be of questionable value. I think our colleague, Senator Gorton, performed a great service for the region with his 1996 amendment to the Northwest Power Planning and Conservation Act to require that an independent, 11-member scientific panel review projects proposed to be funded by that portion of BPA's annual fish and wildlife budget that implements the Northwest Power Planning Council's fish and wildlife program. I would support the expanded use of scientific review panels for other fish and wildlife funding proposals within the Columbia River Basin. 
In closing, Mr. President, let me reiterate my fervent hope that Senate conferees on this bill will stand firm on the $95 million appropriation this body has already approved.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, in 1995, when I was privileged to serve as President of the Oregon State Senate, I was invited by State Representative Margaret Carter to tour Portland Community College, which was located in her district, in the heart of Oregon's largest city. As I represented a rural Eastern Oregon district, I looked upon this tour as a valuable learning opportunity. And what I learned was that PCC was offering a lifeline for many economically disadvantaged students who were seeking to build a better future for themselves and their family. 
I was so impressed with the work of PCC, that when I was elected to the United States Senate, I approached PCC with the idea of each year giving one of their students the opportunity to serve as an intern in my Washington, D.C. office. 
The student selected to serve as the first PCC intern was Tracie Mitchell, whose final day in my office is today. I just want to take a minute to salute Tracie, not only for her outstanding work in my office, but also for the outstanding accomplishments at home and in her career. Through the programs at PCC, Tracie, a mother of two wonderful children--Ruben and Shea, earned a degree in Microelectronics, and has gained employment at Tektronix, one of Oregon's outstanding high tech companies. 
I know that Tracie is anxious to return to her children, her job, and her classes at PCC, and I thank her for her service to my office and to all Oregonians. If she has learned as much from her internship as my office as learned from her, then I know this summer has been a very rewarding experience.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senators Wyden, Craig, Graham of Florida, Bumpers, Gorton, Hatch, McConnell, Mack, Kempthorne, Santorum, Faircloth, and Thurmond to offer the Agricultural Jobs, Opportunity, Benefits and Security Act of 1999, also known as AgJOBS. 
Our bill will create a streamlined guest worker program to allow a reliable supply of legal, temporary, agricultural workers. 
Why is this necessary? Currently, in this country, we have a process for guest workers that is terribly broken. The H-2A program, if I could show you graphically, has a 6-page application for each worker, with 325 pages of instructions as to how to fill it out. As a consequence, all of the foreign workers who are in this country are here either illegally or having been grandfathered in through earlier amnesties. 
It is estimated by the GAO that 40 percent of those who are here are illegal. As a consequence of that, the GAO has said there is not a farm labor supply problem because we have all these illegal aliens here. I am simply saying, and I am doing it on a bipartisan basis, we owe this country something better than a system that relies upon illegal immigration. We ought to give these foreign workers the dignity of being here under law, with some basic human standards and some benefits to which they ought to be entitled when they are here. It is for that reason that Senator Wyden and I have approached the farm community and asked them to give as much as they can, to help economically to fix this program. I believe they have responded. It is for that reason there are so many Republicans and Democrats on this bill. 
I know there are still some misgivings. I know my friend from Massachusetts has misgivings; the Senators from California do. But what we want to do is get this bill to a conference committee with some place markers so we can provide a forum where this can be further refined. Let me tell you the kinds of features Senator Wyden and I share in a common desire to ultimately change American law in a very fundamental way in order to avoid a very large crisis for consumers, for farm employers, and for farm workers. 
We are proposing in this bill the establishment of a national registry which will replace the current system that so few are able to use, even if they could afford to use it. This is going to be a registry for domestic workers only, in a way that will allow farmers to know where they can go for workers and where they can have legal status. In exchange for this, there will be added to the current system--we are going to preserve all the basic rights that are guaranteed; all the labor guarantees that are there will remain there. We are going to have a prevailing wage rate, something that reflects a level that the agricultural community can afford, and also one that gives probably in excess of 1.5 million farm workers a pay raise. We are not talking about the minimum wage, we are talking about a prevailing wage plus 5 percent. 
In addition to that, we are talking about a transportation allowance and a housing allowance. These are things that we owe those who come here to this country to do agricultural work. These are things which my friends on the left have been asking for, for a long, long time. I am here to say the time is now to say yes. We are saying yes to that. We are doing it on a basis, though, that recognizes the economics of the farmer also, because the truth is, most of the agricultural employers in this country are not big corporate farms, they are mom and pop who are trying to make a bottom line. They do not even control, in most cases, the price that they get for their commodities. 
We believe--Senator Wyden and I and Senator Graham of Florida, who has been so helpful on this, and others on the Democrat side--that we have found the middle ground here that wins for consumers but, more important, wins for agricultural workers and also for farmers. 
With that, I yield time to my colleague from Oregon, whose help I appreciate very much, Senator Wyden.

If we don't succeed in this, we are frankly not going to say that we are content with the status quo. The status quo is not acceptable. These people are here in this country illegally. There ought to be a way in which they can be here legally to do this work, which they want to do, and which we need them to do in order to avoid a serious crisis on the American farm.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I want to publicly thank my colleague, Senator Wyden, for his leadership on this issue. He and I recently faced a tragedy in our State that, frankly, left us speechless and groping for a way to respond to an unspeakable tragedy--that of a young person, troubled, from a good family, but in possession of weapons and willing to use them on his parents and his fellow students. 
In the face of that kind of violence--a young man who would violate four gun control laws to do what he did--Senator Wyden and I, frankly, struggled to find out how we can respond to this, how we can, as public servants, lay down a new marker, provide a new barrier for stopping this kind of violence. Also, how can we do it in a way that doesn't impose the Federal will upon the States, but provides a carrot, and not a club, for them to enact laws that would have captured this young man and prevented a horrible tragedy from being visited upon our State and the city of Springfield. 
We are not alone in this. Arkansas, Mississippi, and Pennsylvania have also suffered these kinds of tragedies. So it is a growing national concern. The reason I commend this legislation so strongly to my colleagues is because it is, in fact, bipartisan because it does enjoy the support of gun control advocates and antigun control defenders. As my colleague described, what this does is simply put in place a new safety net, so that if a young person does bring a gun to school, they will be detained--not to be just released to their parent's custody, but actually to undergo an evaluation in terms of their psychological health and their safety to the community at large. 
It is unfortunate that this has to occur, but it has to occur because, at the end of the day, no other communities should suffer this consequence again. So I commend my colleague for his leadership. I also want to thank Senator Hatch, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senator Sessions, for their input into this amendment; it was considerable. We worked it out with them. I think we have, in the end, an amendment that doesn't fix the situation entirely, but it goes a long way toward accomplishing that very thing. 
I thank all my colleagues for indulging us. I ask for their support. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Wyden, Craig, Graham of Florida, Gorton, Bumpers, Hatch, McConnell, and Mack to introduce the Agricultural Job Opportunity Benefits and Security Act of 1998, also known as AgJOBS. Our bill will create a streamlined guest worker program to allow for a reliable supply of legal, temporary, agricultural workers. 
Mr. President, we are facing a crisis in agriculture--a crisis born of an inadequate labor supply. For many years, farmers and nurserymen have struggled to hire enough legal agricultural workers to harvest their produce and plants. The labor pool is competitive, especially in my state of Oregon, where jobs are many and domestic workers willing to do farm work are few. The General Accounting Office even confirmed that there have been local, regional and crop-based labor shortages and losses. 
Labor intensive agriculture is the most rapidly growing area of agricultural production in this country and we can only expect the demand for agricultural labor jobs to continue to rise. When coupled with the lowest unemployment rates in decades and a crackdown on illegal immigration, the agriculture industry--and ultimately its consumers--face a crisis. 
Currently, the H-2A program is the only legal, temporary, foreign agricultural worker program in the United States. This program is not practicable for the agriculture and horticulture industries because it is loaded with burdensome regulations, excessive paperwork, a bureaucratic certification process and untimely and inconsistent decision-making by the U.S. Department of Labor. Also, as reported by the recent Department of Labor Inspector General, the H-2A program does not meet the interests of domestic workers because it does a poor job of placing domestic workers in agricultural jobs. 
I am proud to announce legislation that is the product of a bipartisan effort put forth today by several of my colleagues. With their help, we have been able to develop a consensus solution that will create a workable system for recruiting workers domestically and preventing crops from rotting in the fields. The bipartisan support for this bill reflects months of hard work by members of both parties. 
Mr. President, as we introduce this balanced bill, we have two goals in mind--to make it easier for employers to hire legal workers to harvest their crops, and to ensure that workers are treated fairly in the process. These workers deserve the dignity of legal status when they are here doing work that benefits all of us. 
I'm very concerned that workers are protected, but let's not forget that growers have been victimized by this process too. In order to feed their families--and ours--the growers need to harvest their crops on time, meet payroll, and ultimately maintain their bottom line. Without achieving those things, farms go out of business and the jobs they create are lost along with them. So it is in all of our best interests--workers, growers, and consumers alike--that growers have the means by which to hire needed workers. I believe our legislation will help achieve that goal. 
Mr. President, let me briefly summarize the improvements our bill makes over the current H-2A program. 
First and foremost, all of the labor protections currently in place for workers have been preserved. In fact, they have been improved substantially. Domestic workers under the new program will now receive unemployment insurance and all complaints filed by workers will be investigated by the Department of Labor. Also, foreign workers under the new program will retain their ability to transfer to other H-2A farms once they've completed work with their current employer. These provisions will ensure that the rights of workers--both foreign and domestic--continue to be protected. 
We've also improved the housing provision in the existing H-2A program, currently another barrier for many farmers. For instance, in my state of Oregon, our strict land use laws prohibit building on farm land. This means that many farms do not have housing to offer and therefore cannot use the H-2A program. Under our new bill, we allow employers the option of providing a housing allowance to workers if housing cannot be provided. This change will make it possible for many more farmers to use the guest worker program, and guest workers will still receive housing benefits. 
To be fair to domestic workers, we also created a process that would make agriculture jobs available to them first. The bureaucratic and untimely labor certification process of the H-2A program will be replaced by a registry which uses existing DOL job bank computers to match domestic workers seeking jobs with employers seeking workers. If job openings still exist, then employers will be allowed to bring in temporary foreign workers to fill the open jobs. 
In order for employers to offer these and other protections, the program has to be more practical to use. In our bill, we have streamlined the impractical time-frame requirements for applying to the program. Currently, farmers must apply for H-2A workers 60 days before they think they will need workers. In a very unpredictable industry, this requirement is a barrier for many farmers. In our bill, we have reduced this time period to 21 days, making the program much more responsive to the unpredictable nature of agriculture crops and much more practical for use by farmers. 
Our legislation makes many other improvements to the existing H-2A program--for both employers and workers. As a result, we can expect more growers to use it, and consequently, we can expect more domestic and foreign workers to benefit from the ample wage and labor protections afforded by it. 
Let's not make fugitives out of farmworkers and felons out of farmers. That is the effect of our current guest worker program. 
I urge my fellow colleagues to join Senators Wyden, Craig, Graham, Gorton, Bumpers, Hatch, Feinstein, McConnell, Mack and me as we introduce this important bipartisan legislation.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, when General George Marshall was asked during World War II if America had a secret weapon, he said, `Yes. Our secret weapon is the best darned kids in the world.' 
This morning, Mr. President, I traveled to Arlington Cemetery to attend the funeral service of one of those best darned kids. I speak of Major General Marion Carl, who was acknowledged as one of America's greatest military aviators, and who was tragically murdered in his Oregon home last week during an attempted robbery. 
I did not have the privilege of knowing General Carl. But one cannot read the words of those who did know him or the summaries of his long and courageous service to our country, which included stints as a World War II fighter ace, a military test pilot, and a squadron commander in Vietnam, without concluding that General Carl was a true American hero.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, Senator McConnell and Senator Biden, my friends, who have shown leadership on this issue, I thank you publicly for doing that. It's been a remarkable afternoon as we've debated this issue. In fact, the debate has been somewhat limited because I think there's a whole lot of unanimity and that perhaps the Senate may have acted precipitously in the past. 
I appreciated Senator Glenn's willingness to share with us some of the history and motivation that went into the markup of the Arms Export Control Act. I don't think anyone here doubts his sincerity and the accuracy of what he said. However, I think all of us who have risen today to defend wheat farmers recognize how seriously we have failed in some regard. We have not kept a nuclear genie in the bottle on the Indian Subcontinent, and now we see the bizarre spectacle of the American Government poised to wrestle American farmers to the ground because our law does not control arms half a world away. 
I am pleased to rise as a defender of Oregon farmers. I suppose the motivation of everyone here is absolutely appropriate. I have additional motivation in that the farmers that we're talking about are my neighbors. 
I come from Eastern Oregon, a place of rolling hills of wheat. And so when I consider this issue, I see their faces. And I know how much they're suffering as we speak, because last time I checked, wheat in the Port of Portland was selling at about $2.75 a bushel. I don't know when it has been that low and to have the threat of sanctions come on top of it is truly--truly a double jeopardy. I am pleased with what the Senate is doing today and I am happy to be an original cosponsor of this amendment. Again, I am thankful to the Republican and Democratic leadership for changing at least a small portion of the Arms Export Control Act. 
Let me indicate how important this is as a country issue and a city issue. This year alone about 40 percent of the U.S. soft white wheat comes from the Pacific Northwest. Again, this year alone that crop amounts to about $255 million. Sales of this magnitude for the rest of the year will simply go to another country if we don't act as we are today. 
In addition to that, this will have an effect on the city of Portland. So far this year, wheat sales in the Pacific Northwest have resulted in about $10 million. So, this is an issue that brings country and city together in a very significant way. 
Now, Mr. President, I am pleased to tell you that in a recent conversation with President Clinton, he emphasized his willingness, even his great desire to sign this legislation. So we are doing something here, acting unitedly as Americans and with our president. 
I am also pleased to tell you that a couple days ago I met with the Foreign Minister of Pakistan and Special Envoy of the Government of Pakistan. We discussed the need for Pakistan to develop with America a new way of rebuilding our relationship. I indicated to him that I felt it important to keep the door of commerce open as we acted in this Congress on sanctions legislation. I also let him know that they should also act to reach towards us as well. He gave me his assurance that purchasing soft white wheat from the Pacific Northwest would be a priority over similar purchases from other countries. 
Mr. President, it's been a pleasure to stand with so many Senators who care about our farmers. I count myself chief among them. I thank them for their support and ask for their votes in the Senate and for the state of Oregon. I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, before I begin, I would like to thank my colleague, Senator Jeffords, for his leadership on this bill. 
Mr. President, I believe the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act reestablishes our commitment to the young people of our Nation by focusing on one of our Nation's founding principles--opportunity. 
By improving the quality of teacher training and recruitment, increasing the purchasing power of students through Pell grants and other forms of student assistance, and by improving access to higher education for students with disabilities, this legislation provides opportunity for the young people of our Nation to seek a higher education. 
While I could continue to talk about the many merits of this bill, there is one issue that has been of great concern to me and to the students and parents of my State, and that is the rapidly rising cost of tuition. Even as we battle--successfully-every year to give more and more of our Nation's children an opportunity to seek a higher education by expanding Federal financial assistance, the cost of tuition continues to increase far beyond the Consumer Price Index--thus offsetting out efforts to expand education opportunities. We are winning the yearly battle but faring not nearly so well in the war. 
In the 1997-98 school year, average undergraduate yearly tuition and fees for public 4-year institutions of higher education were $3.111, representing a 97-percent increase from the 1988--89 school year. For private 4-year institutions, tuition and fees that same year were $13,664, representing an increase of 71 percent. As a result, students and families have become increasingly dependent on Federal financial aid in the form of grants and loans. In the 1996-97 academic year, Federal loan programs provided over $30 billion in financial aid to students. 
Even as we have continued to provide assistance to our students over the last 10 years, a troubled trend has developed. Student financial aid in the form of loans is disproportionate to the amount of financial aid received through grants. In the 1996-97 academic school year, 60 percent of Federal, State and institutional students financial aid was distributed through loans. 
The combination of a decline in Federal grants and an increase in tuition cost for both public and private institutions has forced many students and families to seek Federal loans to pay for a higher education. I believe our goal in expanding the availability 
of student loans can't be simply to replace disappearing grants and subsidize vast tuition increases. Our goal is to expand opportunity. And so, providing money is not enough; we must control costs. Some have suggested that Federal incentives may be one way to control rising tuition rates. While this may not be a popular suggestion, we cannot afford to continue this cycle and this game of cat and mouse with our Federal education dollars. 
Earlier this morning, my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, addressed this issue in great detail and made some excellent points with respect to access and affordability. Basically, we're pricing parents and students out of the education marketplace by limiting the number of Federal grants. It is my hope that we can work together to change this disparity in the ratio of loans to grants and to find ways to streamline the existing student financial assistance structure so that the good we do here on a bill like this isn't undermined by tuition rates which increase even more quickly than our ability to adequately meet the financial needs of our students. 
However, in the meantime, I am pleased that the chairman, Senator Jeffords, has included a sense-of-the-Senate provision in this bill on behalf of myself and Senator Wyden that expresses these concerns. 
Mr. President, it was once said that `education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself.' I believe this bill represents our commitment to our students by providing them with the access, assistance, and the opportunity for a higher education. Education--the process of learning--is what drives us, fulfills us, and inspires us to achieve, and I believe it is our collective responsibility as legislators, and as citizens of this country, to sustain it. Again, I thank my colleague, Senator Jeffords, the members of the committee and their staff for their work on this important legislation.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from Oregon in offering this amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Bill on the handling of Department of Defense aviation accident investigations. In November 1996, 10 Portland-based Air Force reservists were killed in a mysterious C-130 King-56 plane crash. For nearly 2 years, Senator Wyden and I have been working with the Air Force and the families in order to find an explanation for how this tragic accident occurred. We have learned more since asking that the Air Force renew its investigation, and we are confident that we will soon know the cause of this accident. I wish to thank the Air Force for reopening its investigation and for its subsequent efforts. We owed that to the families of these Air Force reservists, that their widows and children be given the information needed for understanding. 
I am pleased to have joined my colleague from Oregon in seeking answers for these families still struggling with their losses and ensuring greater responsiveness to the families of our military personnel in the future. This Wyden/Smith amendment will create a task force to review aviation accident investigations and identify areas for improvement. I will also ensure that families be provided with regular reports regarding ongoing investigations. 
My thoughts continue to be with the families of the victims from the C-130 accident in November. I thank them for bringing this to our attention and I commend them on their patience and strength. I also thank my Oregon colleague, Senator Wyden, for his leadership on this issue. I appreciate the efforts of Air Force officials and look forward to working with them in the future to protect our service members and their families.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today with my colleague, Senator Wyden, I introduce legislation to restore equity in the Medicare payment rate otherwise known as the Average Adjusted Per Capita Cost (AAPCC) formula under Medicare. This formula, which is implemented by the Health Care Financing Administration, determines the payment rates made to health maintenance organizations (HMOs) that offer coverage to Medicare beneficiaries. 
Mr. President, prior to the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, AAPCC rates were determined by calculating the five-year average of per-capita Medicare fee-for-service spending by county, as well as the graduate medical education (GME) and disproportionate share (DSH) payments. Since Medicare utilization rates, GME and DSH rates vary from county to county throughout the United States, those areas that have low Medicare utilization rates subsequently receive a lower payment than other areas where Medicare utilization rates are much higher. In 1997, those rates varied from $286 in Gilliam County, Oregon to $748 in Dade County, Florida. 
The result of such disproportionate levels in payments to HMOs is a disproportionate amount of benefits provided to Medicare beneficiaries. For example, HMOs that provide coverage for Medicare beneficiaries living in Los Angeles, California or Dade County, Florida receive a significantly higher payment; therefore, they can afford to provide additional benefits such as prescription drugs, eye glasses, and dental coverage. Meanwhile, HMOs that provide coverage to beneficiaries in Portland, Oregon receive a lower payment rate and cannot afford to provide such additional benefits. Mr. President, this is blatantly unfair, and unacceptable. Medicare beneficiaries deserve the same access to the same benefits, regardless of where they live in this country. 
To address this discrepancy, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included three main provisions to change the calculation of the AAPCC payment rates. First, a minimum `floor' payment of $367 was implemented to provide assistance to those rural counties with low Medicare utilization rates. Second, a blended rate was established to benefit low and mid-level payment counties to slowly bring them up to a more equitable level. Third, a minimum two percent `hold-harmless' was established so that all counties, even those at a higher payment level, are guaranteed at least a two percent increase in their current payment rates. 
As a member of the Senate Committee on the Budget, I was proud to support these provisions; however, the only component of this proposal that has been implemented, is the guaranteed two percent increase for all counties due to budget neutrality restrictions. While the two percent increase is a good start in restoring some equity to the payment system, beneficiaries living in rural counties in Oregon and throughout the country will not have access to Medicare+Choice options if we cannot find a way to provide funding for the blend component. This was the original intent of Congress, and I believe we have a responsibility to implement all three of these provisions in order to restore equity to the Medicare system. 
The legislation that Senator Wyden and I are proposing today would remove the budget neutrality provision used in calculating the blended capitation rate for Medicare+Choice organizations. To put this simply, we propose to fund the blend. Under this legislation, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would submit to Congress a legislative proposal outlining ways in which to restructure federal Medicare expenditures in order to implement the blend. We believe this is a fair and fiscally responsible way to address this matter and look forward to the Finance Committee's consideration of this issue in the year ahead. 
Mr. President, I would like to commend my colleague, Senator Wyden, for drafting this legislation and for the work of Stephanie Kennan of his staff on this bill. He has been a strong proponent of Medicare reform both as a member of the House of Representatives and as a member of the Senate Committee on the Budget. I thank him for this opportunity to join him in this effort.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of Amendment No. 2796 to the Defense Authorization bill, a Sense of the Senate Resolution which was introduced by myself and Senator Wyden. I want to thank the managers of the Defense Authorization bill for allowing us to bring this important amendment to the floor for consideration. This Sense of the Senate speaks to an issue that is a source of great concern to all Oregonians. But not only should it be of importance to citizens of my state, this Sense of the Senate should also be important to any American concerned about having a say in how the federal government handles nuclear waste and other environmental problems partially overseen by the Department of Energy. Simply put, radioactive waste seeping through the soil or being discharged into the air recognizes no state boundary. 
Although such situations can be found in other parts of the country, the amendment before us today speaks specifically to the Hanford nuclear reservation, located in the southeastern part of Washington state. Hanford was operated by the federal government as a plutonium development facility for four decades. Today, this site is the worst Department of Energy environmental hazard in the country. Millions of gallons of radioactive waste sits at the Hanford facility, much of it stored in underground tanks that are leaking an unknown amount of material into the soil as I speak. 
Currently, there are cleanup efforts underway, jointly operated by the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the state of Washington. Every year the Congress appropriates money for this cleanup effort, and I am a strong supporter of this funding. However, as an Oregonian, I believe that my state should also be a part of this ongoing process. Although the Hanford site is in Washington state, it is just 35 miles north of Oregon, and it lies next to the mighty Columbia River, which forms much of the border between the two states. Any failure to clean up this facility adequately will be felt not only in Washington but in my state as well. Thousands of Oregonians live within 50 miles of this site. Thousands more live down the Columbia River, which is not only home to countless species of wildlife, but also a key transportation and recreation resource as well. 
For these reasons, I am pleased that the Department of Energy and the state of Washington and Oregon entered into memoranda of understanding concerning Hanford last August. With the implementation of this agreement, Oregon will be a participant in the major decisions regarding Hanford that have potential repercussions for the health and safety of Oregonians. The amendment Senator Wyden and I have introduced simply encourages the continuation of this kind of cooperative decisionmaking regarding the future of the Hanford site. As acknowledged by the Department of Energy and the state of Washington by the memoranda of agreement, Oregon has a huge stake in this process. It is a point worth reiterating, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important Sense of the Senate resolution.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, immediately following the tragedy that occurred at Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon, Senator Wyden and I went to the floor of the Senate to express our great sadness and outrage that a community in our state would be subject to such an act of violence. Perhaps what is equally disturbing, is the fact that Oregon is not alone. From Jonesboro to Springfield, the virus of school violence has been indiscriminate. 
While we will never forget these tragic events, it is time for us to turn our grief and our anger into action. I believe it is our responsibility as legislators, governors, school officials, law enforcement, parents and students to work together to determine the sources and solutions to this complex problem. 
To address this issue, Senator Wyden and I have introduced legislation, S. 2169, to encourage states to require a holding period for any student who brings a gun to school. If states pass a law requiring the 72-hour detainment of a student who is in possession, or has been in possession, of a firearm at school, they will receive a 25 percent increase in funding for juvenile violence prevention and intervention programs. 
As we have learned from recent events, students who bring guns to school are suspended temporarily because communities often lack the personnel and resources to detain them in juvenile justice settings. By providing states that pass laws requiring detainment an increase in funding for prevention programs, schools will have additional resources to address the growing severity of violence and juvenile delinquency. States may use such additional funds for prevention and intervention programs that include professional counseling and detention in local juvenile justice centers. 
Mr. President, it has been said that `the foundation of every state is the education of its youth.' If we do not fulfill our promise of providing a strong and safe foundation for our students, education will not be possible. I believe this legislation is an important step in building a strong foundation, and I encourage my colleagues to join Senator Wyden and me in cosponsoring S. 2169.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, this coming weekend the President of the United States will travel to my home State of Oregon to deliver the commencement speech at Portland State University. As Oregon's junior Senator, I welcome President Clinton. I look forward to seeing his remarks and want him to know he is welcome in my State. 
While in Portland, he will find a vital, vibrant community, like much of the Nation, which has enjoyed very good economic times. Because of this, the President might leave Portland thinking his administration's policies, even those regarding natural resources and the environment, have been good for Oregon. And if he does that, if he has that impression, he will be sadly mistaken. 
During the last recess, I traveled through the rest of Oregon. I returned from Washington last weekend having spent 5 days in eastern Oregon. I went to the communities of Condon, Boardman, Hermiston, Pendleton, LaGrande, Baker City, Ontario, Nyssa, Burns, John Day, Enterprise, Milton-Freewater, and Ione. 
This region is the home to honest, hard-working people. It is a region that is also home to some of the most breathtaking scenery on the Earth. It is a region of forests and rivers, mountains and valleys. It is a region where people earn their living from the land. But it is a region in dire economic straits. It is a region which is fighting for its survival. 
Many States have what I term country-city divides, conflicts between rural and urban areas. I happen to be the first Senator elected in Oregon who has lived in rural Oregon in nearly 70 years. I take the issues with respect to all of my State very seriously. I take the issues that affect rural Oregon very personally. 
I would like to report to my colleagues on the State of rural Oregon, the rest of Oregon, today, and to invite the President not just to go to Portland but to come with me to John Day, to come with me to Nyssa, to come with me to Burns, OR, and to see for himself an area of my State that has been terribly damaged by many of his administration's policies. 
These are Oregonians who have made their living off the land for generations. They are now being forced out of business by policies of this administration. These policies are often driven by emotionally generated, questionable science to institute severe restrictions on agriculture, forestry, grazing, and mining on both public and private lands. 
Mr. President, there are people in the administration now who talk with straight faces, without blinking, about tearing out the Columbia River dams. These are assets built by the Federal Government in the Second World War. They were built to serve a multiple of purposes. They were built to provide public safety from spring flooding; they were built to provide irrigation for agriculture; they were provided to move crops from country to city, the city of Portland, the Port of Portland, where 40 percent of the wheat in the West goes right through and down that river. 
They were built also to produce electricity. Heaven forbid, people need electricity. They were built specifically to provide the production of metals for weaponry in the Second World War. But now we are being told that all of these values must be subordinate to the single value of supposedly protecting the environment. They want to blow up these dams. 
I am afraid I probably motivated some of my environmental opponents when I told them that when they blow the dams I will be on top of them, because I feel very strongly that the multiple of public values that are to be served by these are still worthy values. And there are many things we can do to make them more environmentally friendly, and we are doing that as we speak. 
Well, that is an aside. But the people that I know in rural Oregon are good stewards of their land. After all, they need their land for their livelihoods, and they desperately would like to pass 
it on to their next generation, to their children. Moreover, these people make their living by producing food and wood fiber that all Americans need and use in our everyday lives. 
I sometimes begin to think that we are so removed from rural communities in our modern society that we think we do not need farmers because there is a Safeway down the street, we do not need foresters because there is a lumber yard down the street, and we forget this connection. 
As we forget this connection, we begin to enact laws that shut down all of our basic American industries of mining, grazing, farming, forestry, fishing, drilling--all of these things that we have done that have produced this American standard of living. 
I fear as we shut these things down, we will then lament the day when our economy takes a very serious downturn. And it is difficult to reverse, because even in this room, Mr. President, everything around us is the product of the Earth in one way or the other. It came out of the Earth, and we bring these materials into commerce to produce products. Well, we all use them.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. For all the talk of a postindustrial service economy, Mr. President, people's most basic needs are still food and shelter. 
Let me offer some facts and figures to help put things in perspective. Eleven of Oregon's thirty-six counties had double-digit unemployment in March, including Grant County with a rate of nearly 20 percent, Lake County at 15 percent, Wallowa County at 14.4 percent. It is about to get much worse. 
For example, Mr. President, people do not like the way a clearcut looks, but nature has a way of clearcutting, too. It is called a forest fire. We have them very commonly in my part of the world, and yet even the salvage of burnt timber is not being allowed to be harvested in my State now. That makes no sense. 
And 122 mills have shut down in Oregon since 1990. Timber receipts to Grant County for roads and schools declined from a high of $12.4 million in 1992--$12.4 million--to $1.9 million in 1997. What are we saying about schools? What are we saying about roads? 
The amount of timber harvested from our public lands has been reduced by approximately 80 percent. Under the President's Northwest Forest Plan, only 3 million of the 24 million acres--or 12 percent of the available acreage--is open for sustainable timber production. All this despite the fact that tree growth rates exceed harvest rates by 85 to 90 percent. 
The Clinton administration would have us believe that they need to take over the management of Oregon's natural resources because we are incapable of doing so. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, Oregon has some of the toughest land use laws in the Nation. Despite the utilization of forest lands for agriculture, urbanization, and infrastructure, 91 percent of the forest land base that existed in Oregon in 1630--in the year 1630--91 percent of that land still exists as forests and for growing trees. 
Mr. President, the final visit of my week in eastern Oregon was to the Ione High School commencement, where I had the privilege of delivering the graduation address. Ione is a small community, and its class of 1998 is also small. There were nine graduates. Yet nearly 500 people packed the high school gymnasium on a Friday evening to lend their support as a community to these outstanding young people. 
As I looked at the graduates, I could not help but wonder what future there was for those who wished to live and work and raise a family in eastern Oregon. Will there be jobs for them? Will there be good schools for their children? Will this administration sentence them to a future with no option but to move to a city, to an urban area, in order just to make a living? 
I returned from that trip, Mr. President, with a commitment to redouble my efforts on behalf of the good people of rural Oregon and to do everything within my power to ensure that their communities and their way of life will survive. 
Finally, the next indignity to be visited upon rural Oregon involves the implementation of the Glenn amendment which now may invoke unilateral sanctions that unjustly impact our farmers. I think the distinguished Senator who has just left the Chair has a bill, I think Senator Murray has a bill, and I have a bill to address this very issue. Now, I know Senator Glenn and I know he is a good and decent man, and I know his bill was designed to deter nuclear proliferation. I am all for it. It didn't work. 
Now we are about to witness the incredible spectacle of wrestling ourselves to the ground. The government is about to impose sanctions that will ultimately not hurt Pakistan because the truth of the matter is our competitors love this. The people that will be hurt are the people of rural Oregon, Washington, Idaho and others, who will lose 40 percent of their markets to U.S. sanctions on U.S. farmers that have had no ability to deter nuclear nonproliferation. 
I hope my colleagues will look at a bill which I am proud to cosponsor. It is a bill by Senator Lugar that has a `stop, look, and listen' provision to this whole episode of unilateral sanctions, which in effect makes war on our own people. I think we need to stop and look at this very, very seriously. 
Mr. President, I indicated how devastated wheat farmers will be in the rural parts of Oregon, Idaho, and Washington by the sanctions now about to be imposed by the Clinton administration by the Arms Export Control Act. Food aid under this act is supposed to be exempted. It is important that credits and credit guarantees for export of wheat also be exempted. 
For that reason, I am introducing legislation this morning to exempt credit guarantees from any sanctions to be imposed.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be in a period for morning business until 11:15 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the tobacco bill, and it is expected that a Republican amendment will be offered regarding attorneys' fees. It is hoped that a short time agreement can be reached on that amendment so that remaining amendments can be offered and debated throughout today's session. At 12 noon, the Senate will proceed to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the modified tobacco committee substitute. Assuming cloture fails, the Senate will continue debate on the tobacco bill. The Senate may also consider any other legislative or executive items that may be cleared for action. Therefore, rollcall votes are possible throughout today's session of the Senate. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a class of students from Lincoln High School in Portland, Oregon which, as a direct result of months of study and several well-earned victories, won an honorable mention as one of the top ten finalists in the We the People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution national finals, a competition on the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. After working diligently to win competitions in their home state, these outstanding young Oregonians participated in a three day national competition to demonstrate their remarkable understanding of Constitutional principles, and their relevance to contemporary issues. 
Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People program has provided curricular materials at elementary, middle, and high school levels for more than 75,000 teachers and 24 million students nationwide. While demonstrating the importance of cooperative and collaborative work, the program teaches students a practical meaning of Democracy and fosters the development of informed, responsible participation in civic life. In addition, this valuable curriculum gives young people the resources necessary to generate their own political interests, beliefs, and values essential to becoming effective participants in a democratic government. 
I commend the hard work and accomplishments of this award-winning class of students from Lincoln High School: Alyssa Anne Aaby, Rebecca Mae Allen, Milo Twohy Dochow, Ian James Dunlap, Joshua Josef Hansen, Andrea Marina Hart, Thomas Hugh Hendrickson, Misha Andrew David Isaak, Laura Elizabeth Kanter, Aaron Matthew Lande, Andrew Benjamin Lauck, Dugan Alan Lawrence, Marcus Page Lindbloom, Brenna Rose McMahon, Maren Christine Olson, Galway Peter O'Mahoney, Nicholas Albert Peters, Emma Rachel Pollack-Pelzvner, Jennifer Lewis Rosenbaum, Jay Boss Rubin, Karen Deborah Rutzick, Margaret Suzanne Schouten, Kennon Harris Scott, Andrew Paterson Sheets, Maghan Marie Simmons, Kristin Kiele Sunamoto, and Evan Miles Wiener. These outstanding young people represent the vast potential of the youth in our country, and the promise and opportunity for our nation's future.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today with a very heavy heart. Yesterday, Senator Wyden, my colleague from across the aisle, and I were confronted with news of a tragedy in our State that was, frankly, in my mind, quite unimaginable. 
The Willamette Valley of Oregon is perhaps one of the most beautiful places in the world. It is surrounded by mountains with snowcaps and clear streams running through it. It is filled with farmers and loggers, college professors and students, people working in State government. It is truly an Eden on Earth. 
But yesterday, a most mindless and senseless act was committed that leaves me, frankly, speechless. A young man, obviously very troubled, on the way to school killed his parents and then took three weapons into his school cafeteria at Thurston High School in Springfield, where he opened up and killed 1 student and injured nearly 30 others. This occurred before a wounded student tackled him and held him to the ground. 
I don't have words to express the outrage I feel or the heartache that I feel for the families, for the victims, for this community, for my State, for my country, at this outrageous and despicable act. 
Yesterday, Senator Wyden and I were asked to be on program after program, and we declined, because it was not a day for pontificating about policy or political posturing. It was a day for grief and mourning. I reach out to my State. I cannot be there physically, but my heart is with you and I am in agony with you. It becomes all of us here and in any place in government not to pick a single issue and say that is why, but to look at the strings that run from Springfield to Jonesboro or in any other community in this State and to find out what is happening with the youth of America whereby they solve their problems by resorting to this kind of violence. 
We must have the courage to face all of the possibilities. It isn't just the school. It isn't just the gun. It isn't just the family. It isn't any of these things in isolation, but it is all of them together. 
I, for one, reach across to my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, and every other member of the Oregon delegation in this Congress, and to our Governor, and to school officials and to parents in Oregon and across this country and say, let's figure it out and let's try to prevent it from occurring again. This does not belong in America. The answers start with us. 
The answers start in our hearts and in our homes, in our legislatures, in this Capitol building, but it starts with us as individuals to find out how to say no to this in the future and to prevent it. We are doing many things to punish, and those are appropriate things. It is time to do more to prevent. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to establish the conditions under which certain Federal agencies may enter into a memorandum of agreement with non-federal entities concerning management of the Columbia River and Snake River Basin in the States of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. 
This bill is not an endorsement of the draft Three Sovereigns agreement, but arises from ongoing concerns I have about the proposal. The livelihoods of many Northwest residents are at stake in upcoming decisions about Columbia River operations, and they deserve a voice in this process. 
The bill formalizes public input to federal agencies involved in the proposed `Three Sovereigns' agreement, or any similar agreement, by creating an advisory committee representing: local governments; customers of the Bonneville Power Administration; upstream ports; fishing interests; shippers; irrigators; environmentalists; forest land owners and grazers. This committee will advise the federal agencies on matters to be addressed under the agreement, including the economic and social impacts of any proposed recommendations. 
Currently, two significantly different drafts of a `Memorandum of Agreement for Three Sovereigns' Governance of the Columbia River Basin Ecosystem' are out for public comment. However, the public comment process was so ill-defined initially that I had to write one of the chief proponents of the agreement to request that this process be better defined. Further, it has been reported to me that at the public meeting held in Pendleton, Oregon, on the draft agreement, there was no clerk reporter to record people's comments in detail. This has not given those who depend on the river system much confidence in their ability to provide input into any forum established under a Three Sovereigns' agreement. 
Developing a successful regional solution to management of the Columbia/Snake River system will involve a broad range of stakeholders. While not a perfect model, the 1994 Bay-Delta Accord in California has been successful, in large part, because the water users and environmental groups were parties to the Accord. The bill would not, however, require changes in the draft memorandum of agreement itself, or impose conditions on the states or the tribes. But it is appropriate for the Congress to establish certain conditions for federal participation in any such agreement. 
In addition to establishing this advisory committee, the bill requires each federal agency that is a signatory to the Three Sovereigns' agreement to publish and make available to the public, including over the Internet, all scientific data used to formulate recommendations and all methodologies used to prepare cost-benefit analyses. 
The bill also provides a mechanism to resolve disputes among federal agencies involved in the Three Sovereigns' agreement. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will designate an official who, at the request of a non-federal party to the agreement, will have the authority to reconcile differences between the federal agencies on any issue before the Three Sovereigns. In this manner, the non-federal signatories are not caught between differing federal agencies. 
The Three Sovereigns' agreement, if signed, would establish a process that is very similar to the statutory obligations of the Northwest Power Planning Council with respect to fish and wildlife recommendations. Therefore, the bill requires the Council to report to the Congress annually on how the recommendations on fish and wildlife activities under any agreement would be coordinated and reconciled with the Council's statutory responsibilities. 
Finally, to enhance budget coordination among federal agencies regardless of whether an agreement is entered into, the bill requires that the President's annual budget proposal include a cross-cut budget showing proposed spending for activities in the basin by the federal agencies. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and to support stakeholder involvement in the development of a regional solution to Columbia and Snake River issues.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation requiring the Secretary of State report on actions taken by our Ambassador to the United Nations to push the nations of the Western Europe and Others Group (WEOG) to accept Israel into their group. 
As you may know, Israel is the only nation among the 185 member states that does not hold membership in a regional group. Membership in a regional group is the prerequisite for any nation to serve on key United Nations bodies such as the Security Council. In order to correct this inequality, I am introducing `The Equality for Israel at the United Nations Act of 1998.' I believe that this legislation will prompt our United Nations Representative to make equality for Israel at the United Nations a high priority. 
I am proud to be joined by Senators Wyden, Brownback and Thomas as original co-sponsors of this important legislation. 
Mr. President, Israel has been a member of the United Nations since 1949, yet it has been continuously precluded from membership in any regional bloc. Most member states from the Middle East would block the vote needed to join their own regional group. The Western Europe and Others Group, however, has accepted countries from other geographical areas--the United States and Australia for example. 
Recently United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan announced that `It's time to usher in a new era of relations between Israel and the United Nations . . . One way to rectify that new chapter would be to rectify an anomaly: Israel's position as the only Member State that is not a member of one of the regional groups, which means it has no chance of being elected to serve on main organs such as the Security Council or the Economic and Social Council. This anomaly would be corrected.' 
I believe it is time to back Secretary General Annan's idea with strong support from the United States Senate and I ask all my colleagues to join me in sending this message to the UN to stop this discrimination against Israel.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of S. 1723, I rise today to support the American Competitiveness Act. 
Mr. President, the H-1B immigrant visa program is not the preferred avenue of hiring by our U.S. high tech companies. Hewlett-Packard, which is one of Oregon's largest high tech employers, currently employs more than 65,000 people in the United States and uses only 140 H-1B visas. Of these 140 H-1B visas, 17 of them have Ph.D. degrees and the remaining of them have at least an equivalency of a Masters degree. 
Our American companies would prefer to invest in Americans and retain the current domestic workforce. These companies collectively already spend, and will continue to spend, billions of dollars each year on training and educating American workers. Notwithstanding the current workforce, they are unable to fill key personnel slots, and it is critical in order to remain competitive, that they have access, through the H-1B visas, to these foreign-born professionals. 
According to the American Electronics Association, the U.S. electronics and information industry creates high-skilled, high value-added jobs. The rapid advances in computer technology have increased demand for trained specialists like computer engineers, computer systems analysis, database administrators, and computer support specialists. 
Even the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that demand for these occupations will more than double by 2006. Oregon's largest employer in the state is Intel. And with more than 10,000 employees in Oregon, Intel's job growth has grown 167 percent since 1990, creating almost 40,000 jobs worldwide. 
In this age of a global marketplace, it is imperative that American companies have access to a legal supply of skilled professionals in the United States so that they can continue to grow and expand in the United States. 
Failure to increase the H-1B cap will create significant uncertainty about the U.S. government's commitment to enable American companies to compete and participate effectively in the global economy. These companies will be faced with the tough decisions to either stay in the U.S. without a sufficient number of highly skilled staff or possibly move their research and development facilities overseas. 
Mr. President, the American Competitiveness Act raises the current cap for temporary foreign workers to 95,000 in fiscal year 1998 and contains a five-year sunset for the additional H-1B visas. While raising the temporary H-1B cap, the American Competitiveness Act also increases education and training in the high technology field for American citizens and establishes a data bank on the Internet that matches domestic applicants with available technology jobs. 
Mr. President, I commend Senator Abraham for his leadership on this issue and urge my colleagues to support the American Competitiveness Act.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National Peace Officers Memorial Day, a day to commemorate and acknowledge the dedication and sacrifice made by the men and women who have lost their lives while serving as law enforcement officers. 
The men and women who serve this Nation as our guardians of law and order do so at great personal risk. There are very few communities in the United States that have not been touched by the senseless death of a police officer. 
In Oregon we have seen our share of loss. In January in a standoff between the Portland police and a man with a high-powered SKS military rifle, Colleen Waibel, a 17-year veteran of the Portland Police Bureau, was shot and killed. Two other officers, Kim Keist and Sgt. James Hudson, were wounded in that same standoff. In July of last year, Thomas Jeffries, a Portland police officer, was shot and killed. In 1984, a Washington County sheriff's deputy, Robert Talburt, also died in the line of duty. 
Mr. President, because of the dedication and sacrifice of our Nation's police officers, our communities are safer and our children have a better chance of receiving their education in a crime-free environment. 
Today, more than 15,000 peace officers are expected to gather in our Nation's Capital, together with the families of their recently fallen comrades. The National Peace Officers Memorial Day provides our country an opportunity to show these public servants that their efforts on our behalf and those of their fallen comrades are greatly appreciated. 
To the surviving families of those officers who have paid the ultimate price, this day will show that their sacrifice will always be remembered. 
Mr. President, I am a proud cosponsor of Senate Resolution 201 designating May 15, 1998, as National Peace Officers Memorial Day. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Kempthorne, myself, and others, in recognizing this important day. 
I thank the President.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, colleagues, and ladies and gentlemen, I rise today to introduce legislation to change the Tax Code to put stay-at-home moms and dads on an equal footing with two-income families. My legislation is cosponsored by Senators Hatch, Grams, Wyden, and Abraham. This legislation that we introduce will increase the current $500-per-child credit to $1,500 per child for children up to 6 years of age. This credit would replace the current dependent care tax credit with real money that directly benefits families and restores equality and fairness in child care. 
Mr. President, there are many proposals to reduce tax burdens, many of which I wholeheartedly support, such as the elimination of the marriage penalty. But I must confess some frustration that I felt on the night our President gave his State of the Union Address when he spoke at great length about child care. He made a proposal, about $20 billion worth, that contained many laudable provisions and parts of which I could support. But it contained a very glaring omission, in my view. The Clinton administration policy is both a direct and indirect subsidy to the marketplace day care industry. The administration seeks to help only a small portion of working parents, ruling out those who wish to stay at home to take care of their child and those who do not want to use marketplace day care. Government policy ought not to discriminate in this manner against the best form of child care where the child is taken care of by his or her own parents or family member. 
A few months ago Renee Anderson of Medford, OR, sent me an e-mail commenting that government spending will not give tax relief to parents of preschoolers who take care of their own children.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Renee, like many mothers and fathers, sees most government spending as `day care' and not `child care.' Child care, she says, is something that every family does. Day care is the activity undertaken out of either preference or necessity that some families are able to choose or forced to choose. 
A recent Wirthlin poll shows that care by a child's own parent or immediate family member is rated as the most desirable form of child care, with child care by a family's mother ranking the highest. 
Census Bureau statistics show that many families--nearly half of those with children under 6 years of age--pass up a second income and care for their children themselves, and yet where is the tax relief to help ease the burden of child care expenses for families that choose to take care of their children in their homes? It simply is not there. This legislation will eliminate the current discriminatory tax policy and replace it with one that is fair to all families regardless of the child care choices they make. 
I hope many of my colleagues can join in supporting this legislation. I know it competes with many other proposals, but I, frankly, can think of no greater priority that we ought to have than helping mothers and fathers take care of their children, for truly the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that controls the future. There is no more important responsibility that any of us as mortals undertake than to rear a child. So the Federal Government ought to not get in the way of that but ought to reduce its take and leave more resources to mothers and fathers to leave them at home where they can serve real human and child needs.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the Credit Unions for Kids program, an effort which began in my state of Oregon but which has since spread to more than 35 states across the nation and has served as an outstanding example of community service. 
The Credit Unions for Kids program represents credit union employees and members in Oregon and Southwest Washington who have volunteered their resources and time in raising $1.7 million to benefit the Doernbecher Children's Hospital Foundation. Last year, Oregon ranked first in the average dollars raised per credit union on a nationwide basis. 
This is a day for celebration, not only for this donation, but for the generosity exhibited by a twelve-year fund-raising effort undertaken by the employees, families, and members of the credit unions in Oregon and Southwest Washington. This combined effort serves as an example to the businesses, communities and corporations in the Pacific Northwest and throughout the nation that anything is possible, even fulfilling the dream of a new children's hospital, one floor at a time. 
For a moment, I would like to focus on the recipient of this donation--the new Doernbecher Children's Hospital which replaces a very old and outdated facility on the campus of Oregon Health Sciences University. This four-story, 250,000 square-foot facility houses 120 beds, including the medical/surgical units, a pediatric intensive care unit, the Kenneth W. Ford Cancer Center and the Doernbecher Neonatal Care Center. The hospital also has a 16-bed floor dedicated to inpatient and outpatient cancer treatment. 
Perhaps what is most impressive about this facility is the focus on the need of the children and families whom it will serve. Designed by Doernbecher staff, parents and patients, the hospital has places for families to gather together, facilities for families who wish to cook their own meals, and patient rooms that have extra beds so that parents may stay with their children. There are separate playrooms, outdoor play structures and a schoolroom. There are large and numerous windows welcoming natural light. There is artwork of birds and frogs, sculptures, painting, and poems. 
One particular poem, `Naknuwisha' which appears in the waiting room of the hospital and is a Sahaptin term among the Yakima, meaning `to care for something precious, particularly children who need our help' was written by Kim Stafford in 1996 and serves as a constant reminder to all who enter the hospital that this is a place for children, and a place where healing and hope begin: 
Naknuwisha 
young friend, 
be part of something old-- 
be home here in the great world 
where rain wants to give you drink 
where forest wants to be your house 
where frogs say your name and your name 
where wee birds carry your wishes far 
and the sun reaches for your hand-- 
be home here 
be healed 
be well 
be with us all 
young friend. 
Mr. President, this beautiful new hospital is the foundation of a commitment made by the community, families, friends, physicians, and by businesses who have given the gift of time and resources to turn a dream into a reality. I am proud to recognize the Credit Unions of Oregon and Washington, and to congratulate them on their contribution to this facility and this day of celebration of the opening of the Credit Unions for Kids floor of the Doernbecher Children's Hosptial. 
Congratulations, and thank you.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998. The conference report before us reauthorizes various agriculture research programs at land-grant colleges and universities through 2002. In addition, it provides for $600 million over five years for a new competitive grants program for research in key areas such as agricultural genome, food safety, nutrition, new and alternative uses of agricultural commodities and products, biotechnology, natural resource management, and farm efficiency. This bill also contains important provisions which authorize funding for crop insurance, rural development, and to restore food stamps to certain legal immigrants. 
The critics of S. 1150 most often question the costs of the various provisions included in the conference report. However, it is important to note that our investment in agricultural research provides a tremendous return to our economy, generating economic growth and tax revenue through increased agricultural productivity. This return is estimated to be between 35% and 50% nationwide--and even greater in Oregon. Additionally, in terms of constant dollars, federal spending on agriculture research has declined over the last ten years while other non-defense research spending in such areas as health, space exploration, and the environment has increased. As an added assurance that these funds will be spent in the most efficient way possible, the conference report contains provisions which increase the accountability of these research projects, making them subject to competition, requiring more stakeholder input, peer and merit review, and greater collaboration amongst the research institutions involved. Further, the benefits of other important provisions contained in this bill, such as funding for crop insurance, rural development, and restoration of food stamps to certain legal immigrants, far outweigh the arguments against this legislation. I am especially pleased with the food stamp provision which allows the resources of private charitable groups, such as the Oregon Food Bank, to reach a wider spectrum of our communities. What better way to use these funds than to enhance our food production, feed our nation's hungry, and protect America's farmland? 
Currently, some of the most important work in the area of agriculture research is being done in my state, where more than 140,000 jobs are tied to farm production, In just one example, research at Oregon State University facilities on wheat strains and diseases has resulted in an estimated $8 million in increased wheat productivity per year. Results of their studies are shared with other states like Idaho, Montana, Utah, Kansas, and Colorado, presented at national and international symposiums, published in scientific journals, and communicated through industry newsletters. Again, this is just one of the many valuable research projects undertaken in my state by OSU through this partnership of federal and state funds. 
Agriculture in my state is diverse--reflecting the varied geography, soil, an climate types of Oregon's beautiful mountains, valleys, coastline, deserts, and forests. There really is no such thing as an average farmer in my state. He or she may be a large scale wheat grower, a small orchardist, a producer of high quality nursery plants, or a family farmer maintaining cranberry bogs. Despite the varied backgrounds of Oregon's farmers, all of them, and I think this would apply to farmers across the country as well, are working hard to maintain America's leadership in agricultural production despite unrelenting pressure from all sides--pressure to continue to produse the world's safest food supply while competing with imports that may be heavily subsidized, produced with pesticides illegal in the U.S., or even, as was widely reported in the media just yesterday, not even meeting our food safety standards. 
For the small family farmer, who still exists in my state, this pressure is compounded by the struggle to maintain the way of life which fed our grandparents and their parents before them. Everyday they defend their farm, perhaps part of their family for generations, for encroaching development, inheritance taxes, and complicated and ever increasing governmental regulations. Breakthroughs brought about as a direct result of the research dollars we will be voting on today may mean that family farmers in Southern Oregon may be able to squeeze enough productivity out of their land to hold onto their farms for a few more seasons. Or it may mean that a grass seed farmer in the Willamette Valley can export more grass straw to Japan due to a quality assurance program. Or it may mean a farmer in the Columbia Basin can use fewer pesticides on pea plants due to new, more pest resistant strains or new growing techniques. For them, the components of this bill represent the American research and technological know-how that has kept them ahead of the curve--and hopefully, with your support today, will continue to do so into the future. 
Let's give our farmers the tools they need to continue to produce a safe and bountiful food supply for our families. The conference report before us reaffirms the traditionally strong Congressional support for American agricultural leadership. This legislation enjoys overwhelming bipartisan support and I urge my colleagues to join me in casting a vote in favor of S. 1150.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to participate in the design, planning and construction of the Willow Lake Natural Treatment System Project for the reclamation and reuse of water by the city of Salem, Oregon. This project is an innovative approach to an ongoing sewer overflow problem. It will not only provide environmental benefits for the city and the Willamette Valley, but could also provide irrigation water for the local farming community. 
This natural treatment system is one component of the city's recently adopted Wastewater Master Plan. Currently, the city has a combined sanitary sewer system. Unfortunately, each winter season during the wet weather, sewer overflows spill into Salem-area creeks and streams, as well as the Willamette River. 
The proposed natural treatment system, working in conjunction with the city's wastewater treatment plant, will provide Salem with the ability to meet regulatory requirements by storing and treating all wastewater from Salem's sewer system and significantly reducing wet weather sewer system overflows. The finished system will meet Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) standards, and be fully operational by 2010. Although the specific site has not yet been selected, I am hopeful that any land needed for the project will be acquired on a willing buyer-willing seller basis. 
The natural treatment system proposed includes both overland flow treatment and constructed wetlands treatment. The overland flow system will include grassy swales and poplar trees to provide a high level of wastewater treatment. The constructed wetlands will include shallow ponds with wetland-type vegetation, and provide both treatment and storage. This system will be capable of producing between 10 and 20 million gallons per day of high quality effluent during the summer months that could potentially be used as a source of irrigation water for the farming community in the area. A separate feasibility study will have to be conducted before a determination is made on whether to use this water for irrigation purposes. Any application of this water would have to be in accordance with state water quality standards and the requirements of the food processing industry. 
This bill would authorize the Secretary to participate in this project under the Bureau of Reclamation's existing Title XVI water reuse program. This program requires a feasibility study for all projects authorized, and caps the federal cost-share of the construction costs. Under the Title XVI program, the city would have title to the project, and be responsible for all operation and maintenance costs. 
This project will provide multiple benefits for the environment. It will naturally treat wastewater, provide habitat for fish and wildlife, improve water quality in Salem-area streams and the Willamette River, and reduce wintertime sewer system overflows. As water supplies tighten throughout the western United States, we need to look at innovative, cost-effective programs such as this to reuse water as efficiently as possible.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, the situation in Bosnia and the continued participation of U.S. soldiers in the NATO operations is an issue about which many Senators have very strong opinions. 
I agree with my colleague from Idaho that the decision to keep U.S. troops there is one that the administration did not adequately discuss with the Congress. The past actions of the administration on this question, promising twice that American soldiers would come home by a date certain and twice breaking that promise, rightly gives the Senate reason to wonder if the administration is serious about its commitment to withdraw U.S. soldiers from Bosnia. 
However, I want to be clear about what this amendment does. Simply, it punishes Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. These are three countries that have all met the criteria for NATO membership and have chosen the path of democracy and freedom after 50 years of Communist domination. I remind my colleagues that the troops from Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are, as we speak, standing side by side with American soldiers serving in Bosnia. Earlier this year, all three countries publicly stated that they were willing to commit troops if the U.S. showdown with Iraq led to military action. I am convinced that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will be among our strongest allies in NATO, and preventing them now from fulfilling this role simply does not serve American interests. 
I support a vigorous debate on the merits of U.S. participation in the NATO force which is keeping peace in Bosnia, but I do not believe that the resolution of ratification to enlarge NATO is the appropriate place for this debate. 
I think Senator Craig's concern that NATO should not be reformulated into a peacekeeping organization is right on target. NATO is the most effective collective defense alliance in history, and to maintain its critical article V capabilities we cannot allow the NATO mission to drift towards peacekeeping and nation building. The amendment offered by Senator Kyl, however, on Tuesday, approved by a 90 to 9 vote, clearly states the U.S. view of what the mission of NATO should be and what it should not be. 
However, I cannot support delaying action on NATO enlargement until Congress has authorized the U.S. troop presence in Bosnia. 
My colleagues well know, in December of 1995, the Senate approved the Dole-McCain resolution on the deployment of U.S. forces to Bosnia by a vote of 69 to 30. Since then, the Senate has, on at least two occasions, approved appropriations to support U.S. troops in Bosnia. I understand that many Senators do not want U.S. forces in Bosnia, but the Senate has had the opportunity to speak on this issue and we will again in the future. Now is simply not the time, and the expansion of NATO ought not to be the vehicle. So I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment of my friend from Idaho. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I find it very humbling to be among these giants as a newcomer to this body. I feel something like the student questioning the wisdom of his professor because when it comes to names like Pat Moynihan, John Warner, and Sam Nunn, these are men whom I admire and whom I have read about for years in history books. 
Yet, I rise to oppose this amendment for reasons that I think are very, very important. I wonder as we consider the feelings of the Russians--and I am not saying those considerations are illegitimate, but what are the feelings of the Pols, the Czechs, and the Hungarians? Do they have no right to qualify to self-determination to be a part of the western alliance? I have had officials from all of those countries tell me that if they had to choose between the EU or NATO membership, they would take membership in NATO; whether right or wrong, they are afraid of Russia. I believe they have a right to qualify to be a part of the west. And, yes, strong economies are so important; but, frankly, they recognize that security precedes strong economic growth. 
Madam President, the European Union may be many things, but it is certainly not a substitute for U.S. leadership in Europe. The EU has proved time and again that it is incapable of acting together on matters of foreign and security policy. Its military arm, the Western European Union, refuses to take action when European interests are threatened and, instead, turns to NATO or individual member states to address problems on the continent of Europe. 
The political vision of the European Union extends no further than its trade interests, shown most recently by its rush to reengage the regime in Iran and its refusal to jeopardize commercial contacts by even mentioning the civil rights record of the Chinese government. 
In contrast, for 50 years, NATO has been the defender of freedom and democracy and has shown that it is willing to make the necessary sacrifices to assure the success of these valued principles. In its membership, NATO includes two countries that will apparently never be in the European Union--the United States and Canada. It includes Norway, which rejected EU membership in a public referendum, and it includes Turkey, whose application to the EU has been repeatedly rebuffed. 
How ironic it would be if we pass an amendment here that says before these countries can be in NATO, they must be in the EU, but, by the way, Turkey, which is a member of NATO, apparently will never be a member of the EU. Austria, Finland, and Sweden are all members of the EU, with continued neutrality policies. It is not just the different missions of NATO and the EU that made denying NATO enlargement to EU membership untenable, but the different membership of the two organizations lead it to take varying positions on issues of importance to both. 
Further, the economies of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are growing faster than almost all of the countries of the European Union. Consider some recent statistics that demonstrate the disparity between these 3 countries and the current EU members. In 1997, Italy's estimated economic growth rate was 1.5 percent, Germany's was 2.2 percent, France's was 2.4 percent. Meanwhile, Poland's growth rate was an astounding 7 percent. Hungary's economy grew by a healthy 4 percent. Growth in the Czech Republic was less impressive in 1997, due to severe flooding in that country, but their economy is expected to rebound in 1998. 
The European Union's regulation, taxes, subsidies, and labor laws could very well hurt the economic development and growth potential of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. The pursuit of membership in the EU should be a careful decision made by countries in Central and Eastern Europe and should not be a requirement for NATO membership. Even if these countries elect to seek EU membership, the European Union has made it clear that it will take years for them to conform their legislation to the multitude of EU laws and regulations. 
In short, the amendment of my friend from New York is a delaying tactic that runs counter to U.S. security interests. Therefore, I oppose any effort to link NATO enlargement to membership in the European Union, and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty provides that NATO members, by unanimous agreement, may invite the accession to the North Atlantic Treaty of any other European state in a position to further the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area. The resolution of ratification notes that only Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have been invited by NATO members to join the Alliance. No other agreement or document, including the July 8, 1997 Madrid Summit declaration of NATO, or the Baltic Charter signed on January 16, 1998, should be construed otherwise. 
Much has been said about these documents, but I am not certain that all of my distinguished colleagues have read them carefully. In Madrid, NATO's Secretary General stated `In keeping with our pledge to maintain an open door to the admission of additional Alliance members in the future, we also direct that NATO Foreign Ministers keep that process under continual review and report to us. We will review the process at our next meeting in 1999.' This is not a promise, a commitment, or any other guarantee that countries in Central and Eastern Europe will be invited to join NATO--it is merely a statement that enlargement is a process that should be reviewed by NATO regularly. 
Further, the Baltic Chapter, signed this past January by the Presidents of the United States, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania declares that the U.S. `welcomes the aspirations and supports the efforts of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to join NATO. It affirms its view that NATO's partners can become members as each aspirant proves itself able and willing to assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership, and as NATO determines that the inclusion of these nations would serve European stability and the strategic interests of the Alliance'. Mr. President, this last statement is important--the Baltic Charter clearly states that including any new members in NATO must serve the strategic interests of the Alliance. All candidate countries will be evaluated on these criteria. 
The United States should not support the invitation to NATO membership to any further candidates unless the Senate is first consulted, unless any proposed candidate can fulfill the obligations and responsibilities of membership, and unless their inclusion would serve the overall political and strategic interests of the United States. During Foreign Relations Committee hearings, both Secretary of Defense Cohen and Secretary of State Albright expressed the Administration's understanding of the need for consultation with the Senate prior to any future rounds of expansion. 
I strongly oppose, however, mandating a period of time during which the United States is not permitted to pursue a policy of NATO enlargement that very well may be in our national interests. The decision to enlarge NATO should be based not on an arbitrary timeline, but should be the result of a thoughtful process--based on consultations with the Congress--that considers the security interests of NATO and the qualifications of candidate states. 
I strongly oppose the Warner Amendment.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, while my colleague from the Democratic side is getting prepared to respond to the Hutchison amendment, I will simply say that it is painful to me to not be on her side of an issue. I am one of Senator Hutchison's greatest fans, but I simply must oppose her amendment simply because NATO has for so long been a place where contending European countries have come together in a common purpose and not pursuing national agendas for their common defense. There are many places, many forums, in which dispute resolutions currently take place, and to turn NATO into something that is no longer a place for common defense but a place for nationalistic resolution I think would do a grave disservice, even an undoing of NATO, and dissipate its strength. 
I plead with my colleagues, as appealing as this amendment sounds on the surface, I think it would be very hurtful to the future of Europe. I point out that whether or not you can point to Greece and Turkey, I suggest that NATO membership of those two countries has caused them not to come to greater blows in the recent past and I hope will yet be an influence for them not to come to blows in the future. 
I think, clearly, NATO has served a historic purpose, in its informal way, of contributing to Prussian-French rapprochement and healing. The same can be said as between Britain and Spain, between Spain and Portugal. Many of the boundary disputes that have raged in Europe for centuries have begun to dissipate, in large part, because of NATO and because it brings all of these countries together in a common purpose and for the good of all of Europe. 
Madam President, I thank you for the time and yield the floor to my colleague.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. To my friend from Texas, I do not suppose in the abstract there is anything wrong with anything being discussed in NATO. But I would simply fear that we are changing its complexion, turning its focus away from a collective alliance for security and into a place for dispute resolutions. 
I think, those European countries, as I have discussed this issue with them, they have said to me, well, this is the place we come together, not the place where we come to divide again. And I think they would quickly say, let us leave this to the United Nations, let us leave this to the European Union, let us leave it to other bodies where these kinds of resolutions can be sought.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. If the Senator will yield, as I understood the Senator from Texas, her original idea was that we should say to the American Ambassador to NATO to raise it with the NAC and to present this idea, that they discuss a dispute resolution. And in that, I think you said it is even OK for the Ambassador to say, `I think that's a bad idea; I think we need to settle that right now. If this is a bad idea, let's say so.' And I would hate to begin a debate with our European allies by saying we want to discuss what we think is a bad idea even though the Senate somehow thinks it is a good idea. It is either a good idea or it is a bad idea. That is why I would say no.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise to encourage my colleagues to vote against the Hutchison amendment. I do it with reluctance because of my admiration of the Senator from Texas. But I believe her amendment, though much different than her original proposal, nevertheless remains a bad idea, because it essentially changes NATO from a system of collective defense to a dispute resolution. There are other forums for such resolutions, such as the OSCE. And these things should be resolved anyplace but NATO. 
Second, I believe this amendment would undermine the authority of the North Atlantic Council. Its mission needs to remain on defense. 
Third, NATO would become a catalyst, even a magnet, for alliance tensions and border disputes. It must not become that. 
Finally, we should keep the focus on NATO on what unites Europe in NATO; and that is common defense, not on what divides Europe, which are border disputes and ethnic hostilities. 
With great respect for my colleague from Texas, I nevertheless rise in opposition to her amendment and ask my colleagues to oppose it.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I would like to associate myself with the words of the Senator from Delaware and just tell my colleagues, the advocates of this amendment, I support it. I believe the Poles, Hungarians, and Czechs would support it, too. These are nations that know something about prisoners of war and missing in action, gulags, and all the horrors that go with totalitarianism, and I fully expect that they would want us to accede to this. 
I appreciate the Senators offering this amendment. I think it helps. And part of the reason to expand NATO is to heal these countries. Part of the healing comes from addressing issues like this. We will find they will do this with us and without any resistance to it. 
I thank the Senators who are offering this amendment.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Kyl. The Senator just took away some of the business I wanted to do. 
I am very pleased to be added as an original cosponsor of this amendment. 
Mr. President, I think the Clinton administration made a serious error in allowing the other NATO countries to reopen the strategic concept issue. The current document agreed to in 1991 needs no alteration. The approach taken under President Bush's strategic concept has served NATO well for the past 7 years and would have served equally well for the next 7. That said, what is done is done. The administration failed to prevent the French and others from opening a Pandora's box. 
Negotiations on the strategic concept for the purpose of amending it will commence this summer, and I expect that a document will be agreed upon by early next year. Senator Kyl's amendment establishes a vision for NATO's future. It does so by emphasizing those aspects of the current NATO policy which the United States finds most important. For instance, the Kyl amendment makes clear that NATO, not the European Union, not the OSCE or any other United Nations-type organization, must remain the principal foundation for collective security in Europe. 
It also takes note of the broad range of threats that will face the United States and our NATO allies in the post-cold war world and calls upon NATO members to ensure that their forces can be rapidly deployed and sustained during combat operations. 
Taken together with paragraph B of the current condition 1 of the resolution, which calls upon NATO military planners to put territorial defense above all other priorities, this amendment makes clear that the United States expects every NATO member to pursue the capability of operating with the United States in any contingency under any circumstance. 
Finally, it reaffirms the key tenets of current NATO nuclear policy. I find this paragraph of the Kyl amendment particularly important. 
In conclusion, Senator Kyl has identified the 10 most important aspects of NATO's current strategic concept which must be preserved. His amendment sets forth the Senate's expectations that any future revisions to the strategic concept must reflect these 
principles. I welcome his contribution to the resolution of ratification. It provides a much-needed vision for the future course of the NATO alliance. The administration can expect that I for one will hold it to the policies established under the Kyl amendment during the course of future negotiations of the strategic concept. 
Again, my thanks to Senator Kyl. I think his amendment is forward looking. It is visionary. Unlike so many amendments offered here today which are sort of in the category of `thou shalt not,' this is in the category of `thou shalt do.' So I thank Senator Kyl for that and his leadership. I am proud to be a cosponsor with him. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. One other question. 
It seems to me, as we look at the numbers that the Senator is presenting, $125 billion versus $1.5 billion, and changing circumstances, I would remind the Senate that the $125 billion was predicated on the Congressional Budget Office based upon an invasion by Russian forces of Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic, and that it would require the full advanced positioning of the U.S. military. If that were to occur, those numbers are probably right. The much reduced number of $1.5 billion is a reflection, according to the GAO, of the current political situation and, therefore, isn't an accurate estimate. 
But I would say this: I don't think we should hamstring now our ability as the Senate and as the Congress to respond to whatever things might occur. But it seems to me, we would be doing just that if we were to accept the Harkin amendment.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I was once asked by a mother in a town meeting I had in Oregon why her son or daughter should put his or her life at risk for a Hungarian or Pole or Czech through the expansion of NATO. I think it sometimes helps to think in human terms like that. My answer to her was that the surest way not to put her son's or daughter's life at risk was, in fact, to expand NATO. 
It is a very troubled area in world history. In a tough neighborhood, good fences make for better neighbors. I have fought to expand NATO because I think to leave the vacuum, to leave muddled `international speak' out there at the border was a mistake. 
I think the answer I gave to that mother can also be given to my friend from Iowa. The Senator is concerned about the bill going up. I am concerned about that, too, but I think the surest way that the bill not go up is to expand NATO. I think if we did not expand NATO, and the worst kinds of scenarios you could construct actually occurred, we would be spending far more than $1.5 billion--whether Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were in NATO or not because I don't think this time we would stand idly by. I certainly hope we would not. 
So the surest way, I think, we can assure the American taxpayer that Senator Harkin is rightly concerned that we won't spend $125 billion to expand NATO, is to define the terms of the future, not just react to them, make them, expand NATO, make this commitment, and I believe it means we will not be spending the kind of excesses that I also fear with the Senator from Iowa.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, with all respect for my friend from Iowa, I believe the Harkin amendment attempts to strangle NATO's expansion because it cannot prevent NATO expansion. This amendment places unreasonable restrictions on expenditures by limiting our assistance to new NATO members to 25 percent of all assistance provided to these countries by current NATO members. 
I urge my colleagues to read carefully the resolution of ratification that we have before us. Condition two requires the President to certify that the United States is under no obligation to subsidize the national expenses necessary for Poland, Hungary, or the Czech Republic, to meet those countries' NATO commitments. 
Let me be clear on this point. In signing the Protocols of Accession with these three countries, the United States has not signed up to foot the bill for their membership in NATO, and Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic understand that it is ultimately their responsibility to make the necessary improvements to their military structures. 
Now, my friend from Iowa knows that in the past, the U.S. Congress has authorized and appropriated funds for countries in Central and Eastern Europe to assist in their efforts to meet the criteria for NATO membership. 
Approving this resolution, however, in no way restricts the congressional prerogative to make this decision on an annual basis. In other words, why draw an arbitrary line now? We are going to do this on a regular basis anyway as circumstances change. 
If in the future years we determine that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic do not warrant or do not need the U.S. assistance, we will not authorize and appropriate it. I trust that future Congresses will be able to make this decision based on the circumstances in their time and will not need artificial percentages to dictate how our assistance should be appropriated. 
I also confess concern about the signal that would be sent if the Senate adopted the Harkin amendment. Does approval of this amendment mean that the United States would only need NATO 25 percent of the time no matter what our security interests may be? Does it mean that the United States is interested in only 25 percent of NATO's activities, exercises, and planning processes? Does it mean that the United States would participate in just 25 percent of NATO operations despite any potential threat posed to the alliance? I think these questions demonstrate why arbitrary ceilings simply do not belong. 
Mr. President, I suggest that we allow the Congress to make funding decisions based on our foreign policy interests and that we reject any effort to tie our assistance to countries in Central and Eastern Europe to that provided by our NATO allies. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose the Harkin amendment, which I do today. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, we have confirmed the nomination of an outstanding judicial nominee to the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. Garr `Mike' King is a consummate professional, who is universally respected within the Oregon legal community for his integrity and professionalism. His long and distinguished legal career as a trial lawyer began as a Deputy District Attorney with the Multnomah County Oregon District Attorney's Office. He helped draft the Oregon Rules for Civil Procedure and wrote the arbitration rules used in Multnomah County. Since 1971, as a partner with the Portland firm of Kennedy, King & Zimmer, he has handled a variety of cases, including commercial litigation, professional malpractice, products liability, and employment litigation in an exemplary fashion. In addition, Mr. King has been active in the U.S. District Court mediation program, has served as an arbitrator through the American Arbitration Association and, in 1995, was elected to the Board of Regents for the American College of Trial Lawyers. 
Mr. President, I am confident that Garr `Mike' King will bring to the U.S. District Court for the district of Oregon the same dedication, professionalism, and integrity that has exemplified his entire legal career.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I rise to speak on my sense-of-the-Senate amendment regarding the use of tobacco revenues to restore solvency to the Medicare Program. During the markup of this resolution, my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, offered a very similar amendment that stated it was the sense of the Senate that any tobacco legislation should increase the cost of a pack of cigarettes by $1.50. I voted in favor of this amendment. However, like Chairman Domenici, I believe we should use these revenues, not for new programs, but to save Medicare. I stated in the Budget Committee meeting that we were voting on amendment after amendment of very popular, and I am sure well-polled, ideas. When it comes to educating children or taking care of children, providing for schools and all of the other ideas that in the abstract we find very, very appealing, I found the arguments compelling--except for one thing. We have made some serious promises to the American people with respect to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid--entitlements upon which people, frankly, have come to depend. These programs are in extremis. So, while it would be easy to vote for all of these well-polled ideas, I think it is important that we stand up for the promises of the past. 
As we all know, there is a way to protect Medicare and also to address the issue of smoking. The use of tobacco products by children and teenagers has become a public health epidemic. According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than 16 million of our Nation's children will soon become regular smokers. This is a national tragedy. I hear some of my colleagues, even on my side of the aisle, say we should not do this through price. I have to say, in my opinion, all the regulation, all the education materials we can print and provide the schools are fine and good, but next to peer pressure 
the teens feel to smoke, these things amount to very little --except when you go after price. It is an economic deterrent that may well save them from this vicious habit, a habit which ultimately could take their lives. 
Of the 16 million children I have talked about who become regular smokers, approximately one-third of them will die from tobacco-related illness. As this population ages and becomes eligible for Medicare, the health-related costs will escalate. In fact, a report by Columbia University says that tobacco use costs Medicare approximately $10 billion per year and the total economic cost of tobacco-related health costs is more than $100 billion per year. Regardless of the outcome of the tobacco settlement in Congress--and I am one who intends to vote for a settlement. Whatever we can get through this Congress that will help to change these disturbing, shameful trends, I intend to vote for because I believe it is our responsibility to ensure that we provide all the deterrence we can towards this habit and at the same time ensure that the Medicare Program that will bear much of the burden of this habit remains solvent by any and every means, as long as the means are contributing to the end that tobacco use by this generation and generations to come will be on the decline. 
Whether we end up with a tax on cigarettes of $1.10 or $1.50 a pack, these revenues should be used to restore what has already been lost; in this case, Medicare dollars due to tobacco-related health care costs. 
I thank my colleagues. I hope they will vote for my amendment. I hope we will have a tobacco settlement. And I hope we will keep yesterday's promises first and restore a degree of solvency to Medicare. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise to associate myself with the comments of my friend from Wyoming and as a strong supporter of the Sessions amendment, a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, on the importance of at-home parents and the Government role in child care. 
I am a proud cosponsor of this amendment and thank Senator Sessions, the Senator from Alabama, for his leadership in this area. The Clinton child care policy is always a direct or indirect subsidy to the marketplace day care industry. The President only seeks to help a small portion of working parents, ruling out those who wish to stay at home and take care of a child and those who do not want to use the marketplace day care. 
Government policy ought not to discriminate against the best form of child care--where a child is taken care of by his or her parents or family. I believe that the Federal Government should subsidize the family, just as it subsidizes the workplace, giving money back to the family. The family can make the best choices in child care. At best, President Clinton's day care policy is only a subsidy of another workplace, the institutionalized day care industry. 
Mr. President, I will soon be introducing legislation to 
change the Tax Code to put stay-at-home parents on at least an equal footing with two-income families. My legislation will increase the current $500 per child tax credit to $1,500 per child for children up to 6 years of age. This credit would replace the current dependent-care tax credit with real money that directly benefits families and restores equality and fairness in child care. 
I think this is an important piece of legislation, Mr. President. And if, in fact, we go forward in this session of Congress and the President's idea comes forward--an idea that costs roughly $20 billion--then I suggest my bill ought to replace it. My bill ought to replace it because it does not discriminate between stay-at-home parents or those who choose to work. It affects each of them equally, because they all have children and needs with respect to those children. 
Mr. President, I thank again Senator Sessions for bringing this important issue to the floor as part of the budget resolution. I urge every Senator to strongly support his amendment. I yield the floor.  
Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I sent an amendment to the desk earlier today to modify my original amendment numbered 2180. This amendment simply provides an exception for federally funded research projects being conducted on marijuana. This is to ensure that the National Institute of Drug Abuse at NIH and other agencies may continue their important research on the long-term effects of drug use, and possible alternatives to the persistent use of marijuana. 
This amendment addresses an issue which has become a great concern to me and to many in my State--legalization of marijuana for medical use. While this is simply a sense of the Senate to prohibit the use of Federal funds for medical use of marijuana, I intend to work with my colleagues on legislation on 
this issue following the budget resolution. While this is not a new issue for the State of Arizona, or for the State of California, which have already passed laws and put them in place following the passage of Proposition 215, there are other States, including Oregon, Maine, Alaska, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia, which are facing similar ballot measure proposals. 
In my State of Oregon alone, five ballot measures have been proposed which would legalize the use of marijuana in varying degrees, from an outright legalization of the drug to legalization for medical purposes. California and Arizona have already passed legislation legalizing medical use of marijuana and are already experiencing the adverse effects on their communities. In California, for instance, the law has become almost impossible to enforce, as the law enforcement community has had difficult times suppressing illegal marijuana use and its sale. With the opening of `pot cafes' in that State, it is impossible to prove whether patrons are there for medicinal or recreational use. 
At a time when illegal drug abuse is on the rise, legalizing the use of marijuana in any form, medical or recreational, sends a mixed signal at best to our children, particularly when there are prescription drugs in the marketplace such as Marinol. 
While the effectiveness of these prescription drugs is varied, I believe it is our responsibility to encourage a healthy alternative to marijuana that is effective, safe, and can be regulated like any other prescription drug in the marketplace. I would be interested in working with any of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have an interest in this issue, particularly those who want to keep drugs, such as marijuana, out of the reach of our children. 
In a study released by the National Institute of Drug Abuse at NIH, marijuana is noted as the most commonly used drug in America. In fact, 18 million Americans used it last year alone. In fact, smoking marijuana over a long term has the same damaging effects on the brain as long-term use of cocaine and heroin and produces the same lung damage and potential cancer risk as smoking cigarettes, even though marijuana smokers smoke less. 
Perhaps even more disturbing is that the National Institute of Drug Abuse also reported that 23 percent of all eighth graders in the United States used marijuana in 1996 and that marijuana use overall has steadily increased since 1993. 
Mr. President, while this is a sense of the Senate and it is only a start, I believe this is our opportunity to voice our opposition to these efforts to legalize the use of marijuana in our States. Through these laws, we are proceeding down a dangerous path by sending a mixed signal to our children that marijuana use is an acceptable alternative. It is not. It is dangerous. It is deadly. 
I thank the Chair and encourage my colleagues to adopt this amendment. 
Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.

Mr. President, I happened to be sitting in the Presiding Officer's chair when the distinguished Senator from Texas came and spoke of her concerns about NATO expansion and expressed some of her regret that some of the debate had been cast in terms of, those who are opposed are somehow less than patriotic or pursuing appeasement. I want her to know that while I am a strong advocate for NATO expansion, I view with appreciation and respect all my colleagues who, for reasons of their conclusions and conscience, have decided that this is not appropriate. 
The Senator from Texas has made some points that I think are valid parts of this debate. I would like to respond to the point, however, that she made about the advisability of having a formal dispute resolution process in the NATO alliance. 
On the surface, I think this may strike some as a very good idea because within the alliance there are long and historic disputes between member countries. 
I note that it is a matter of historical record that NATO membership has been one of the primary ways in which longstanding enemies such as Germany and France have been able to resolve these historic enmities, I think in large part because of NATO. This is also occurring on a daily basis as Greece and Turkey--two NATO allies of ours--struggle to remain peaceful neighbors; also between the Spanish and the Portuguese, issues of borders and islands are being resolved; between the British and the Spanish there are ongoing discussions about the island of Gibraltar. All of this is occurring between NATO members. 
I believe there is a very informal process going on that because you are a NATO member you don't attack your allies. This is a powerful peer pressure, if you will, that exists in a nonformal way in the NATO alliance. 
Why shouldn't there be a formal process? I will tell you this: If it isn't broken, don't try to fix it. Moreover, what NATO does is have all of us who are members who have disparate national interests focus on one common theme, which is common security, a secure alliance, so that all of a sudden you get Germans and Frenchmen--hopefully Hungarians and Czechs--countries that have had disputes over the past--all of a sudden they will be working together for a common goal of mutual defense. 
Now, if all of a sudden we say we recognize you have these internal problems or national disputes and we want you to take those into NATO, then what have we done? We have all of a sudden taken a defensive alliance and turned it into a mini European United Nations. I suggest that is the wrong thing to do for NATO. NATO needs to keep its purpose as a defensive alliance and it must not become a vehicle, a formal vehicle, for resolving national disputes. It has been a way in which we cooperate and get along and focus on common purposes and solving common problems, not as a vehicle for bringing our national interests and resolving them within this alliance. 
I suggest, while on the surface this amendment sounds very good, it would operate in a very destructive fashion for NATO's well-being in the future. There are already institutions for resolving these kinds of differences, dispute resolutions. NATO must never be one of those. 
Now, I have said this with the greatest respect for the Senator from Texas. I know of few people who are more thoughtful and more dedicated to their task in the U.S. Senate than Senator Hutchison. She is a great woman by any measure. I say that even though I intend to vote and lobby against her amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Today I wish to speak from the heart about a decision we will make as U.S. Senators about one of the most solemn issues that we will face, and that is whether or not we will expand NATO to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. 
I would like to put some personal context into what I am about to say. Like you, Mr. President, I grew up in a time when we could accurately be described as children of the cold war. Unlike you, I did not serve in Vietnam, but grew up under the threat of nuclear annihilation. 
I remember as an elementary school child going through drills where the teacher would tell us to get under our desks and hope for the best. It was a time when, frankly, we were taught to be afraid. 
I was too young to remember the Hungarian uprising in 1956, but I was old enough to remember the Prague Spring of 1968. I remember holding my breath as I watched the Solidarity movement develop in Poland and wondering how long it would be until Soviet tanks snuffed out that breath of freedom. 
And I remember with amazement and with emotion the night when this Nation sat transfixed at the falling of the Berlin wall. I never thought that would happen in my lifetime, and yet it did. I remember how courageous I thought it was of President Ronald Reagan when he went there, like his predecessor, John Kennedy, and spoke about the wall and challenged Mr. Gorbachev to tear it down. 
As a child of the cold war, I now come, as a Senator from Oregon, to this decision about what we do in Europe, whether we now expand NATO. Though an Oregon Senator, I grew up fairly close to here in Bethesda, MD--my father and mother moved our family from Oregon to Maryland so my father could work for General Eisenhower, in his administration. 
At the beginning of the Kennedy administration, my cousin, Stewart Udall, was nominated as Secretary of the Interior. And I suppose because of that correlation between a Republican and a Democrat administration and family ties that went across the aisle, my family participated in a number of the inaugural events for President John F. Kennedy. 
I remember it was a very cold January day. I remember, with my family, hearing words that struck me then as important. John F. Kennedy called out to my generation--our generation, Mr. President--of Americans to accept the torch of liberty. At least that is what I heard. I was only 8 years old, but even though that young, I felt his words' impact. I would like to begin by quoting some of his words that he spoke that day just outside of this building.  
We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans--born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage--and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this Nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world. 
Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty. 
This much we pledge--and more. 
Well, that set a standard for this country, a high water mark, if you will. And many criticized this as imperialistic rhetoric. But neither that President nor any since him have suggested that we aspire to territory--what we do aspire to is freedom. 
Prior to winning the cold war, a hot one had ended. And then we won the Cold War. 
As World War II ended, an agreement called Yalta was struck, signed by Churchill, Stalin, and Roosevelt. It promised newly liberated countries of Eastern and Central Europe that they would have a chance at freedom and free elections. Mr. Stalin broke his agreement and the countries of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and many more were denied the promise offered at Yalta. 
I suggest one of many reasons that we should expand NATO is that we have a moral obligation to live up to the terms that were made at Yalta but went unfulfilled, especially with these three countries, as I said, which openly rebelled against Soviet domination. 
Whether you agree with expanding NATO or not, I believe the crux of the issue is two questions. As we stand at the end of this century I ask you, has human nature fundamentally changed from this century's beginning to its end? I ask you the second question: Is the world better because of the standing and position of the United States in the world as a leader of the free world? I suggest the answer to the first question is, human nature has not fundamentally changed but that the world is a better place because the United States of America has lived up to its international responsibilities. 
I have been throughout my life a student of history. I have particularly enjoyed European history. As I look at the Balkans today and I see the turmoil and the terror that rage between the Balkans, the Croats and the Serbs, I am reminded that the Balkans are but a microcosm of Europe as a whole throughout its history. As I look at this century and European history, I see the United States of America as having twice been drawn into European civil wars over the first 50 years. But for the last 50 years we have been waging peace. And we have done it through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
And lest you think this does not matter anymore and it is over and we can go home, I remind you, looking further back in history, you will see since the 1600s when Europeans began to settle in America establishing colonies in Virginia, Massachusetts, and throughout the eastern seaboard--since that time there have been nine major European wars. In every one of them, Americans died. We were drawn into them. America has a role in European history. We have come out of Europe; we are even a European power. I suggest to you that Europe has been at peace for 50 years because America did not retreat and become isolationist. NATO has been called the most successful military alliance in history, and so it is. 
I believe that all the discussion about the costs of NATO expansion--we have heard wild estimates that are undoubtedly false, and we have heard other estimates that are as low as saying that over 10 years America will pay $400 million to participate in this portion of NATO expansion. I believe the latter. I have to say, if history teaches us anything, it is that nature abhors a vacuum and we can either fill that vacuum with our values or leave it there for the mischief of others. How can we morally say to the Hungarians, the Czechs, and the Poles that even though we won the cold war and they were at play throughout it, that we now want to walk away from this victory without leaving our values, democratic institutions, the spreading of private property, of free elections, and great dreams for these nations? I don't believe we can. 
I do know that history teaches us that waging peace, or peacekeeping, is always less expensive than war. So when a mother in Oregon asks me, why should we expand NATO and put at risk the life of a son or daughter to die for a Czech, a Hungarian or a Pole, my answer to her is that in order that your son or daughter not die in that cause, we should expand NATO. 
Now, where does this leave Russia? I am not anti-Russia; I am hopeful for Russia. But as part of NATO expansion, the Clinton administration has held out to Russia, along with our NATO allies, the Russia-NATO Founding Act. I happened to be present in Paris when this was signed. Now, there are parts of this that give me 
heartburn, but there are parts that give me great hope, because with this Founding Act I think what we have done is held out to Russia the opportunity to develop in the best of ways and to become a part of the Western community of European nations. But if it does not develop that way, what we are doing by expanding NATO is hedging against the worst kinds of developments there. I think we must do that. I think we owe it to our friends, the Czechs, the Hungarians, and the Poles. But more, we owe it to ourselves, as defenders of peace and liberty in the world. 
I began with the words of John F. Kennedy and I will end with them, also, again from his inaugural address. I will say it is my view that America is the indispensable nation. Europe needs what we bring in its history. They need us in Bosnia to help keep the peace. They need us in NATO in order that they not begin fighting again. I believe NATO is really responsible for the Franco-Prussian rapprochement that has occurred since the founding of NATO. I believe NATO's existence has helped to settle disputes between the British and the Spanish. It is helping to settle disputes between the Hungarians, who are offered membership, and the Romanians, who still want membership in NATO. In instance after instance, you will see where NATO membership provides a vehicle for these kinds of differences to be worked out. And they are long-lasting cultural, ethnic, religious kinds of differences which have manifested themselves throughout European history in bloodshed. NATO means that those things don't occur. Again, waging peace is always less expensive than waging war, either in terms of treasure or especially in terms of human life. So we are, I think, the keeper of the peace, and it is in our interest that we remain so. 
In America, we often talk about the American dream. But really it isn't America's dream, it is a human dream. It is a dream that all people aspire to. It is just that we enjoy it in great abundance--life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And we must continue to keep that dream and to defend it in the world for our sakes, not just theirs. 
So said President John F. Kennedy in 1961,  
`To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view, but we shall always hope to find them supporting their own freedom. 
I believe we should expand NATO for that reason, because these people deserve freedom. They can secure it with our help. With that security will come capital and investment so that their labor can be busy, so that their dreams can be realized, and so that American opportunity there can also be expanded. Security goes before economic investment. It always has, and it always will. Capital is something like a river. It will take the course of least resistance to seek the highest rate of progress. 
I don't believe our option is to expand NATO or to leave it as it is. I believe NATO desperately needs new blood. We desperately need the new voice of freedom that Poles, Hungarians, and Czechs will bring because they have known the opposite of freedom for too long. Some of us become complacent as to what that means. We need their blood, we need their spirit, we need their sense of freedom, so that we can keep NATO fresh and alive. Our option in the end isn't expanding NATO or not. But ultimately, if we don't expand, I believe we will disband, and that will leave a vacuum that will be filled by the values of others when history calls us to fill it on the basis of ours. 
I believe America is a better world because we are not isolationist but because we are internationalists who care not for territory or treasure but for freedom and liberty. 
Mr. President, the United States is engaged in an ambitious effort to reshape the political and security structures of post-cold-war Europe. The goal is to build strong states, stable democracies, prosperous economies, and friendly governments across the breadth of Europe. We are joined in this endeavor by our NATO allies and by newly democratic people yearning for the opportunity to pursue political freedom and economic prosperity. 
This effort should fulfill the stolen promise of Yalta, and provide the formerly captive nations of Central and Eastern Europe with the opportunity to pursue democratic institutions and economic development of their own choice. This is accomplished first and foremost through the enlargement of NATO to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. 
NATO has proven its value over the past half century as a mechanism through which the United States has been able to exercise leadership in Europe. By its unequivocal commitment to the collective defense of its members, NATO successfully withstood the communist threat posed by the former Soviet Union during the cold war. Though confronting communism is no longer NATO's primary purpose, a secondary function--the cementing of relationships between former adversaries in Europe--is equally as relevant in the post-cold-war period as it was after World War II. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, as well as other countries in Central and Eastern Europe that aspire to join NATO, have worked to alleviate historical grievances and build relationships with their neighbors based on mutual trust, respect, and cooperation. In doing so, stability in Europe has been enhanced and the likelihood that European nations will return to the competitive policies that led to two World Wars in the first part of this century is greatly reduced. It is in the interests of the United States to encourage and foster these developments. 
Last May, I travelled with President Clinton to Paris for the signing of the NATO-Russia Founding Act. After witnessing this historic event, I was left with a profound feeling that NATO was holding out a hand to Russia, and that addressing legitimate issues, such as international terrorism and drug trafficking, could be well served by NATO and Russia acting together. However, it is incumbent upon Russia to use this opportunity in a responsible manner. The consultative mechanism established by the Founding Act should be one that furthers the interests of both NATO and Russia, and is not used to infringe upon internal Alliance matters. 
It is also imperative that the goals of the Founding Act are implemented 
in a manner that does not weaken the principal function of the Alliance or threaten the interests of Central and Eastern European countries that aspire to NATO membership. 
Mr. President, I take this opportunity not to simply state my support for the inclusion of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into NATO, but also to address the issue of imposing a pause on NATO enlargement for several years. Before I do so, however, I emphasize that neither NATO, nor the United States, has invited any country other than Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to join the Alliance. Proceeding with future rounds of enlargement is a decision that all members of NATO will certainly face, but is a question that is not before the United States Senate today. 
In Article 10, the North Atlantic Treaty clearly lays out the process by which NATO may invite additional countries to join the Alliance. This provision states `The Parties may, by unanimous agreement, invite any other European State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area to accede to this Treaty'. Of course, any such revision to the North Atlantic Treaty requires the advice and consent of the United States Senate, which is what brings us here today. 
I wholeheartedly agree with my colleagues who want to ensure that NATO remains a strong, military alliance of democratic nations. However, I firmly believe that Article 10 of the Treaty sets a high standard for the inclusion of new members--not only must a country be in a position to further the principles of democracy, but must be a contributor, not just a beneficiary, of security. The possibility of Alliance membership has been a source of hope to countries in Central and Eastern Europe and an important incentive for democratic and economic reform. Were the United States to impose an artificial time period when NATO's door will be shut--despite the qualifications of a country for membership--would send a signal to these countries emerging from communist domination that their historical affiliation is more important to NATO than their ability to contribute to security and stability in Europe. 
History awaits American leadership at this propitious moment. We cannot be certain what the European security environment will look like in three, five, or ten years, but if we act now, we will be better prepared for any outcome. We should not be overly consumed with the picture of Europe as it looked during the last century. It is up to the United States to outline a vision of what we want Europe to look like in the next century. That vision is a democratic, undivided, Europe safe for American commerce and friendly to American values. That vision includes Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in NATO. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today we have an opportunity to confirm the nomination of an outstanding judicial nominee to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The fact that Susan Graber is scheduled today for a floor vote is a great honor, but one that does not surprise me. Justice Graber has earned an excellent reputation among her colleagues on the Oregon Supreme Court and throughout the Oregon Bar. She has earned this outstanding reputation not only because of her legal scholarship, but also because of the high professional standards she has consistently displayed in her advocacy in private practice and during the years she has served on the bench. I am confident that Justice Susan Graber will bring to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals the same dedication, professionalism, and integrity that has been the hallmark of her legal career. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this outstanding judicial nominee.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I thank Senator McConnell for his leadership on this issue. I also thank Senator Feingold and Senator McCain. 
I would like to point out to the American people, this is not a debate between good people and bad people. I note, however, that many who are for this bill have stated that those who are against it are hiding behind the first amendment. I don't propose to hide behind it. I propose to stand up today and defend it. Let me read to you, for the Record, what the first amendment to the Constitution says: 
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. 
We are talking about the whole second half of this amendment, about how people petition Government for the redress of grievances, how they speak about Government. It is amazing to me that some of those who are for this bill point out how money is buying offices. My friend, the Senator from Washington, pointed out how she was outspent 3 to 1, but she is here! I notice Senator Feinstein is here. She had an opponent who spent, I think, nearly $30 million of his own money! I do not yet know of a President Ross Perot, though he's one of the biggest advocates of this and spent millions of his own trying to make his case. 
The point is, this is a legitimate issue for the people to decide. Then the attack is made on soft money, and PACs have become a very bad word. Do people remember that PACs were created as an outgrowth of Watergate, to clean up campaign finance? This is a product of Watergate. If you break down what it is a PAC is--some of them I don't really like because they stand for things I don't like. But some of them I do like; for example, the National Right to Life PAC. They talk about wealthy people? I look at that organization and I see humble folks who are defending a principle that is sacred to them. These are not wealthy people, but they are enjoying their right to speak. 
I want to make one other candid admission to the American people. Republicans spend an awful lot of time attacking the Democrat use of union money, compulsory union dues that are used in attacks on Republicans. We attack their major asset. The Democrats attack the Republicans' major asset, which is in some cases the use of PACs, or soft money. Any campaign finance reform that does not include both of these elements will disserve the American people and I will not vote for those things, because at the end of the day what will happen to America is what happened to Oregon in a recent election cycle. 
We had a well-meaning public interest group that, through our initiative system, instituted a campaign finance law not unlike McCain-Feingold. It applied to State candidates. Let me tell you what happened. Contributions to candidates directly, were severely restricted and, in a nutshell, candidates could not raise enough money to communicate with the people whose attention they were trying to get. But the money wasn't taken out of politics; it simply left direct democracy, which is disclosable to the public, and it went back into the smoke-filled rooms. Then various groups colluded and figured out how they could influence elections, not with a candidate, but about a candidate. And they did it with the luxury of knowing that they were not accountable to the American people, they could not be held accountable, so they could say or do 
anything they wanted. 
So what we went through in Oregon, before our State supreme court declared it all a violation of the first amendment, was a cycle whereby candidates, were terribly frustrated, and so were our citizens. In the end, I have to say, what we should be encouraging is not a return to the smoke-filled rooms; we should be encouraging people to contribute directly to candidates and to fully disclose it. 
I have to say that I have experienced this also on a personal level; I have run for the U.S. Senate twice. The first time I ran, I put a lot of my own money into the race. And, folks, I didn't win. And then I ran again, and I did win, and I won with the contributions of perhaps more individual contributions than have ever been raised by an Oregon candidate for Federal office in our history. So you cannot buy elections. 
During my first election I had one conservative PAC director tell me that during January of 1996 it was the best time he could remember in Washington because there were no liberals here. They were all in Oregon, beating the stuffings out of me. They said horrible things about me. I didn't like it. It wasn't fun. But you know what, I am standing here today defending their right to say it. But don't tie my hands and say I can't respond to it, because you, the people of this country, will then be the ones disserved by all of this. 
So, if you really have concluded that we have too much political speech in this country, insist that this Chamber disenfranchise soft money and unions, and then you are talking about something. But before you do that, ask yourself the question, do we talk too much about politics in this country? Is it a bad thing that we are doing? I believe the answer to that is no. And if you want the proof of it, open up Newsweek or Time or U.S. News & World Report on any given day in any week and you will see the bodies of people in other countries in the gutters of their streets, because they have not learned how to fight with words and not with bullets. 
So, let's be careful as we talk about amending the most important document that we have. Don't fall for the easy way out, that somehow we are not affecting speech. We are. I have seen it in Oregon and we will see it in this country if this passes in this form. So I stand today proudly, not to hide behind the first amendment but to defend it, and thank the leader for this time, and I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment in its current form.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, in recognition of Black History Month I come to the floor to honor a little-known member of the Lewis and Clark expedition that explored the Oregon territory. Expedition historians tell us that an African-American by the name of York accompanied Lewis, Clark and the Shoshoni woman, Sacagawea on the long journey ending in the area of what is now Fort Clatsop, OR. 
Throughout the Lewis and Clark expedition, York served as a valuable translator, helped to strengthen Native-American relations, and guided several successful trading ventures. It has been said that on numerous occasions, York risked his life so that the expedition could continue. York's contributions were numerous, and according to the Lewis and Clark Heritage Foundation, when the party reached the Columbia River, a decision had to be made whether to head to the north shore of the Columbia--Washington State--or cross the river to the south side--Oregon--where Indians had said that game could be found. An actual vote of the members was recorded, representing the first American democratically held election west of the Rockies that included the vote of a woman, Sacagawea, and a black man, York. 
Today, a mural in the southwest corner of the Rotunda of Oregon State Capital in Salem depicts the expedition that Merriwether Lewis and William Clark, Sacagawea and York made through the Louisiana and Oregon Territories. I want to join all Oregonians today in celebrating Black History Month and celebrate the contributions that African-Americans have made to American history.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, the people of the United States revere the American flag as a unique symbol of our great nation. It symbolizes the national unity that exists among diverse people, the common bond that binds us and makes us Americans. We are a nation that is defined by democracy. The flag symbolizes this democracy not only to ourselves, but to all other nations. It is through this democratic process that we feel free to exercise and enjoy the many liberties guaranteed to us. 
Over the years, Congress has reflected respect and devotion to the American flag. In 1931, it declared the Star Spangled Banner to be our national anthem, and in 1949, established June 14 as Flag Day. In 1987, Congress designated John Philip Sousa's `The Stars and Stripes Forever' as the national march. Congress also has established detailed rules for the design and the proper display of the flag. Today, we have an opportunity to add one more important gesture of support for our national symbol, to pass an amendment that prohibits the physical desecration of the Flag of the United States. 
Since 1990, 49 states have passed memorializing resolutions calling on Congress to pass a flag desecration amendment for consideration by the states. 
Public opinion surveys have consistently shown that nearly 80 percent of all Americans support a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag desecration and do not believe that freedom of speech is jeopardized by this protection. Among the grassroots groups that endorse this legislation is the Citizens Flag Alliance, an alliance comprised of 119 civic, patriotic and veterans organizations, including The American Legion, AMVETS, the Knights of Columbus, the National Grange, the Grand Lodge, Fraternal Order of Police, and the African-American Women's Clergy Association. 
This amendment, grants Congress and the states the power to prohibit physical desecration of the flag, but does not amend the First Amendment. 
If we want to embrace the will of the American people, if we want to reserve the flag's unique status as our nation's most revered and profound symbol, and if we believe the flag is important enough to protect from physical desecration, then we should pass this Constitutional amendment. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, colleagues, I rise today in support of the nomination of Judge Ann Aiken to the Federal district bench in Oregon. 
Before I comment on her nomination, though, I would like to thank and compliment my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch. I have gone to him repeatedly about the three vacancies in the State of Oregon and the challenges they create in our judicial process. Since my time here, against some opposition, Senator Hatch has in every instance acted responsibly, and helped me to move the Oregon nominees along so we can fill these vacancies and get rid of a considerable backlog that we have in our State. 
I would also like to thank the majority leader for scheduling a vote today so we can vote up or down on this and other nominations. And I would like to thank my colleague, Ron Wyden, who, before my admission to this body, was laboring here on behalf of Judge Aiken. 
To my colleagues on the Republican side, those who may have a question about the qualifications or the decisions or the political leanings of Judge Aiken, I would like to point out to you the impressive list of letters and phone calls I have received from both Democrats and Republicans on her behalf. They include Senator Mark O. Hatfield; Senator Wyden; Deanna Smith, chair of the Oregon Republican Party; Mark Abrams, the chairman of the Oregon Democratic Party; John Kitzhaber, the Governor of Oregon; Hardy Meyers, Oregon Attorney General; Jack Roberts, Oregon Republican State Labor Commissioner; five former Governors of both parties; 20 former presidents of the Oregon Bar Association; the Oregon Association of District Attorneys; the Oregon State Police Officers Association; the Lane County Peace Officers Association; the Eugene Police Employees' Association; and all the presiding judges under whom Judge Aiken has served. It is an impressive list of people, all attesting to her worthiness and qualification to be a Federal judge. 
I believe that they based their decision to support Judge Aiken for the very reason I based mine--on her very impressive record of public service. She has served the people of Oregon both on and off the bench through her dedication to the health and safety of children in Oregon and throughout our country. She has served on numerous councils and boards of directors. To note a few, she was recently elected to the board of the National Network of Child Advocacy Centers. She is a current member of the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges. She is a current member of the Relief Nursery board of directors. This charitable institution is particularly near and dear to my heart and is a private organization that provides preschool classes, parent education and respite care for families at risk for child abuse. 
This organization reaches out to all at risk children and families in our communities, and Judge Ann Aiken is a champion of this private-public partnership. 
In addition, since 1993 she has been a member of the Task Force on Child Fatalities and Critical Injuries, and a member of the Lane County Domestic Violence Council. 
While I have not served on these councils with Judge Aiken, I would like to take a moment to explain why I believe that she is an excellent nominee for the U.S. District Court for Oregon. 
I first came to know Judge Aiken in 1994. We were both appointed by a Democratic Governor to serve on the Governor's Commission on Juvenile Justice when I was the Senate Minority Leader in our State legislature. I worked with her on this commission to address the issue of juvenile crime. Among a handful of appointees, she stood out as a superstar. I was impressed with her fairness, her experience, and her insight as to how we can work to help the people of our state, particularly our young children. 
Over the course of the next election cycle, I became the Oregon State Senate President. And with her involvement, and the work of this commission, we produced a bill called Senate bill 1. It produced some of the toughest juvenile crime laws in this country. 
Since that time, Oregon has revisited the whole issue of crime in a dramatic way through a number of ballot initiatives and legislative actions--and crime is falling in my State. Although these initiatives occurred after 1995, Judge Aiken has been tough on crime throughout her career, and I would encourage my colleagues to review her record of strict sentencing practices. 
In 1993, Judge Aiken sentenced a 28-year-old woman who was involved with a brutal beating and murder of a 70-year-old man to 20 years in prison--twice the amount of time as was called for by the Oregon state sentencing guidelines. 
In 1995, Judge Aiken sentenced a repeat child molester to the maximum sentence of 58 years in prison. 
In 1995, Judge Aiken sentenced a 43-year-old man to 31 years for felony sex abuse crimes involving two girls aged 7 and 9, invoking a law that permits judges to double the prison term normally afforded by State sentencing guidelines in cases with aggravating circumstances. 
Before our recess, my friend and colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, raised some concern about one particular case that troubled him. I will admit to you that it troubles me. But I want Senator Enzi and all of my colleagues to know that their criticism of Judge Aiken in this case should not be of her but of the Oregon law that applied at that time, because she followed the law. And some of my colleagues, frankly, appropriately, criticize judges who become frustrated legislators and use their judicial robes to write new law. Judge Aiken simply did not do that. She followed the Oregon law. 
It involved a very horrible case. It involved a circumstance where a man, 26 years old, Ronny Lee Dye, was convicted of first-degree rape of a 5-year-old child and was sentenced to 90 days in jail and 5 years of probation plus the payment of a $2,000 fine. 
With the judicial guidelines that she had to operate within, she had a choice to make. She could send him directly to prison to serve out a 5-year sentence or she could put him in a county facility where he would receive sex-offender treatment. She made a judgment. Her judgment was that the society of Oregon would be better served if this man had treatment. You can call that into question now, but she followed the law. 
Later, this man was arrested for drunk driving and ultimately served a 5-year term in prison. 
I ask myself in this case, however, would I have made that call? Maybe not. But she did. And she did it according to the direction of the Oregon guidelines that were given to her. But my complaint was with the law that allowed that, not with her discretion in trying to establish what was in the best interests of 
society and justice. 
Finally, Mr. President, I note that one of the reasons that Judge Aiken appeals to me as a person and as a judge is a reason very personal. As I have come to know this woman, I have come to know this mother of five sons, and she is a good mother. 
I am one of 10 children. My mother has five sons. And while my mother did not always act perfectly on the issues of justice and mercy, she acted nearly so. And it seems to me that what I see in her are some of the qualities that I would want on the Federal bench. Because a mother of five sons knows how to arbitrate family difficulties and what it means to raise honorable citizens to serve in our society. 
So I ask my colleagues to see this woman's record in its totality---not by the outcome of one case. I would never come to this floor and advocate for anyone who was soft on crime. And if this woman's record indicated that, I would not support her in this effort today. But it does not. It represents a person who is tough on crime, who has served to make her State's laws tougher and who has a record of putting away violent people for a long time. 
I wish that one case were different, but it is not. But the man has served prison time and has received sex-offender treatment. And now the issue is, should we confirm Ann L. Aiken to the United States district court? I say affirmatively and with conviction, yes. 
I ask for your support of her and thank the President for this time. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank my colleague from Wyoming for this exchange this morning, and appreciate the genuineness of his concern. 
I simply rise to say that Judge Aiken has admitted that early in her career that was a judgment she made, under the statute and within the guidelines, and that in hindsight she would have made a different decision. I simply say that to judge her entire career on the basis of this one case would not be fair. It would not be fair to her, would not be fair to my State, and I think would not be fair to the judicial system of the United States. 
I think Caren Tracy, who has served as a local prosecutor in many cases in Judge Aiken's courtroom best describes her strict sentencing practices by stating, `With regard to crimes of violence, violations of trust relationships, and crimes against children, Judge Aiken delivers sentences that include periods of incarceration that are significantly longer than any other judge on the Lane County Circuit Court Bench. She has a mastery of the Oregon sentencing guidelines which enables her to ensure maximum incarceration for individuals deserving of such sentence. 
Sentences of thirty to forty years for child sex offenders and criminals who commit acts of violence are the norm for her courtroom. I never have any concerns, as a prosecutor, coming before her for sentencings on significant crimes. The bottom line is she is not a light hitter.' 
I believe that statement reflects Judge Aiken's career in its totality and reflects her commitment to serving justice. I encourage my colleagues to support her nomination and am confident that she will reflect credit upon this country and reflect credit on the criminal justice system. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Temporary Agricultural Worker Act of 1997. I am joined by Senators Craig, Gorton, and Roberts. Our bill would create a streamlined guest worker pilot program which would allow for a reliable supply of legal, temporary, agricultural immigrant workers. 
Mr. President, we are facing a crisis in agriculture--a crisis born of an inadequate labor supply, bureaucratic red tape, and burdensome regulations. For many years, farmers and nurserymen have struggled to hire enough legal agricultural labor to harvest their produce and plants. This issue is not new to Congress. In the past, Congress has introduced legislation to address this urgency, but no workable solution has been implemented. The agriculture industry cannot survive without a reliable and legal supply of agricultural workers. The labor pool is tight and shortages are developing because of the limited domestic workers willing to work in agricultural fields. 
The United States has historically been faced with a need to supplement the domestic work force, especially during peak harvesting periods. Since domestic workers prefer the security of full-time employment in year-round agriculture-related jobs, the shorter term seasonal jobs are often left unfilled by domestic workers. These domestic workers also prefer the working conditions involved in packing and processing jobs, which are generally performed indoors and do not involve the degree of strenuous physical labor associated with field work. 
Labor intensive agriculture is one of the most rapidly growing areas of agricultural production in this country. Its growth not only creates many production and harvest jobs, but also creates many more jobs outside of agriculture. Approximately three off-farm jobs are directly dependent upon each on-farm job. 
Currently, the H-2A program is the only legal temporary foreign agricultural worker program in the United States. This program is not practicable for the agriculture and horticulture industry because it is loaded with burdensome regulations, excessive paperwork, a bureaucratic certification process, untimely and inconsistent decision-making by the U.S. Department of Labor, and costly housing requirements. The H-2A program has also been very small in relation to the total number of U.S. farm workers. It is estimated that out of the 2.5 million farm workers in the United States, only 23,496 H-2A job certifications have been issued by the Department of Labor this year. In my State of Oregon, only 12 sheepshearers and 62 sheepherders are currently using the H-2A program. 
It is time we address the shortfalls of current policy, and I believe that our bill is a meaningful step in that direction. 
Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today would not replace or interfere with the current H-2A program, but would supplement the H-2A program with a two-year pilot program that examines an alternative approach to recruiting agricultural workers. The pilot program will be limited to 25,000 participants per fiscal year and would protect the domestic workers' rights and living standards. 
Mr. President, let me briefly summarize the provisions of our bill. 
The bill would establish a procedure by which an agricultural employer anticipating a shortage of temporary or seasonal agricultural workers may file a labor condition statement, or attestation, with the state employment security agency. The attestation would provide specified terms and conditions of employment in the occupation in which a shortage is anticipated. Employers would also be required to file a job order with the local job service and give preference to all qualified U.S. domestic workers. 
The Department of Labor would enforce compliance with the labor condition requirements of the program and could impose back pay, civil monetary penalties, and debarment from the program for violators. 
The alien guest workers are issued an identification card, which is counterfeit- and tamper-resistant, with biometric identifiers to assure program integrity. 
A portion of the alien guest workers' earnings would be paid into an interest-bearing trust fund that would be rebated to the workers upon evidence of timely return to their home country. This would ensure that the aliens return to their countries of origin after the temporary job is completed. The alien guest workers could also be debarred from future participation in the program for violating the conditions of their admission. 
Our bill is endorsed by over 50 agriculture-related associations including the National Council of Agricultural Employers, American Farm Bureau, and the American Association of Nurserymen. 
I urge my fellow colleagues to join Senators Craig, Gorton, Roberts, and me as we introduce this important legislation today.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Senate companion bill to H.R. 2515, the Forest Recovery and Protection Act introduced by my good friend and colleague, Congressman Bob Smith. My bill focuses on the western forest and Bureau of Land Management lands where there has been the most fire and disease damage. 
Let me tell you what the forest lands are like in Oregon. On the eastside of my State, disease and bug infestation have ravaged forests, creating dangerous conditions for catastrophic fires. In 1996, I witnessed firsthand fires that burned vast acres of forest land and threatened many homes. This was a situation that didn't have to happen. 
And yet, the political beliefs of a few have seemed to guide forest policy back in Washington, DC--where bureaucrats with personal agendas seem to rule the roost and sound public policy fails to get heard. 
Teddy Roosevelt said: `The nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next generation increased, and not impaired, in value.' 
This legislation is a thoughtful approach to forest management--it includes accountability through reports to Congress, performance standards for forest inventory and analysis, and calls for the elimination of bureaucratic red tape and unnecessary delay that prevents on-the-ground results. 
Concerns that environmentalists have about cutting of timber are addressed by ensuring that all forest health activities are carried out in compliance with existing forest plans. The legislation also prohibits entry into wilderness areas or other areas protected by law, court order, or forest plan. And finally, the bill provides for priority treatment of areas of greatest risk of destruction or degradation by severe natural disturbance. 
The bill has a local component which gives the local community and concerned citizens the ability to identify Federal forest lands in need of recovery and allows them to petition the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct forest recovery projects in the identified areas. In addition, money is provided to those agencies responsible for the forests at the local level with the necessary tools and incentives to address forest health problems in pro-active ways. 
Furthermore, this legislation requires the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to commence a 5-year national program to restore and protect the health of forests located on Federal forest lands. The program includes the following components: Within 1 year of enactment, standards and criteria must be established for designating and assigning priority ranking to forest lands in need of recovery or protection; a requirement that the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register the proposed decisions on lands to be recovered or protected. 
The bill also calls for no new forest management plans, but instead enhances existing ones. The bill requires that all forest health plans be carried out in compliance with existing forest plans; sets up an independent Scientific Advisory Panel, consisting of experts in forest management, to evaluate the Advance Recovery Projects which are basically pilot projects in areas of significant recovery or protection need as identified by the Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture. 
And finally, one of the most important components of this legislation is the inclusion of local citizens and the prioritization that directs more money on the ground. This component allows local citizens to petition the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture in identifying problems in forests, such as dead and diseased timber; provides more money to the local levels of the agencies responsible for the forests.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I thank the Chair for this opportunity to recognize the month of November as National Adoption Month and to speak on this very important issue--one that is very close to my heart--and is at the very heart of my own family. 
As legislators, we work to enact laws to improve and protect the lives of the American people. 
However, there are occasions when our policies can hurt the very people we are trying to protect. In this instance, it is our children. 
Last year, in my State of Oregon, 221 parents adopted children from foreign countries, including China, Romania, Korea, India, and Thailand. 
During that same year, Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act that included a provision which, until now, seemed rather innocuous. 
But for parents like Gary and Laurie Hunter from Myrtle Creek, OR, who are adopting a daughter from China, it has become a bitter pill in the adoption process. 
Simply, the provision requires that all incoming immigrants receive certain immunizations before entering the United States. 
While this may seem like a logical public health law, it raises serious concerns about the health and safety of children receiving vaccinations under substandard conditions in foreign countries. 
Many of these countries do not practice the same sanitary health conditions as the United States. 
For example, some countries lack adequate medical records for children living in orphanages and do not have access to sufficient supplies of sterile needles, creating an even greater risk to the health of young adoptive children entering the United States. 
Today, I am proud to be a part of a Senate which has passed legislation, H.R. 2464, to repeal the provision requiring immunizations prior to entry into the United States, and protect the children who have yet to become citizens of this country. 
This bill will exempt internationally adopted children 10 years of age or younger from the immunization requirement, and allow parents 30 days to immunize their children. 
Importantly, immunization will not occur overseas in an orphanage, or in an immigration office, but upon entering the United States, under the supervision of a family physician in a safe environment. 
There is a tradition in the Senate, to begin the day with a prayer from the Senate Chaplain. 
Today, I would like to take a moment to end my statement with a short phrase from the Common Book of Prayer, a phrase that I hope will encourage and inspire my colleagues in these last few days of the 105th Congress to continue the work which we have been charged to do by the American people:  
We have left undone those things which we ought to have done; and we have done those things which we ought not to have done. 
Madam President, I am proud to stand before my colleagues today to say that with the passage of this important legislation, we have done those things which we ought to have done. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, several months ago, one of my constituents, Gilbert Miller, a retired Air Force senior master sergeant, walked into my Medford, OR office to share an idea with me. After doing some research, he discovered that some military reserve component members who had honorably served their country as Selected Reservists were not eligible for funeral burial flags. In response to this inequity, and in recognition of Veterans' Day, I rise to introduce a bill authorizing the Department of Veterans' Affairs to issue burial flags to deceased members of the reserve component. 
Mr. President, National Guard and Reserve units and individual members increasingly share the day-to-day burden of our national defense. Their service is routinely performed in a drill or short active duty tour status alongside an active component service member. Their status, however, does not make their contribution to our national defense any less important or less critical. Simply put, many requirements could not be met without the direct involvement of Reserve forces, either in a drill status or on short active duty tours. 
In view of this reality, I believe it is time to expand the current law regarding burial flags to include these members of the total force. Therefore, my bill permits the issuance of a burial flag to those National Guard and Reserve members who honorably served in the reserve component. 
Mr. President, I would like to thank the Non Commissioned Officers Association and all the veterans' groups for their support of this bill. 
Finally, Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to our veterans as we prepare to celebrate Veterans' Day. Each day as I drive to work at the U.S. Senate, I cannot help but notice the beautiful monuments of our Nation's capital. These monuments were built to honor great people and great events, and each has its own inspirational story to tell. What you will find in the stories is that the greatness of our country and of its leaders was founded in the willingness of common men and women, our veterans, to risk their lives defending the principle of right. Serving both at home and on foreign soil, their service must always be remembered. 
Working in Washington in this great institution and among these beautiful monuments, I frequently am reminded of the sacrifices of our veterans. Even outside of Washington, in almost every town across America, there are monuments dedicated to our veterans. I urge each American to discover their story, not only from a historical perspective, but also through the eyes of the veterans living in their communities, where you will find common men and women who simply did the right thing when called upon. And because of them, we live in a world where there is more peace than ever before. They deserve our thanks.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise to introduce with Senator Feinstein legislation that will provide incentives to taxpayers to use their wealth for charitable causes. In this era of ever-tightening fiscal constraints placed on congressional ability to authorize discretionary funding, we have asked our communities to do more and more for those less fortunate. Charitable organizations in our communities have become an integral part of the safety net for the poor and homeless and significant sources of assistance for education in every community. 
To help charities take advantage of those donors who wish to contribute significant wealth for charitable purposes, we are introducing the Charitable Giving Incentive Act. This legislation will change current tax law to encourage prospective donors to contribute a controlling interest in a closely-held corporation to charity. 
When a donor is willing to make a gift of a controlling interest in a company, a tax is imposed on the corporation upon its liquidation, reducing the gift that the charity receives by 35 percent. The Smith/Feinstein bill would eliminate this egregious tax that is levied upon the value of these qualifying corporations. We sincerely hope that this will directly encourage meaningful contributions to charitable organizations that help a variety of causes. I ask that my colleagues support this legislation and look forward to its being considered by the Finance Committee in the near future.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise with a pleasant report today. There are very serious things that occur on this floor in this great Chamber of debate. This is also serious, but very pleasant to report. 
This past Saturday history was made in our country. It occurred in my State. It occurred because a young woman by the name of Liz Heaston appeared in a men's football game at Willamette University. She became the first woman in college football history to play in a game. 
Before a crowd of 2,500 people, Liz kicked 2 extra points in what helped Willamette University defeat Linfield College 27-0. 
Liz is a starter for the Willamette University soccer team. And at the last minute she was asked to fill in for the team's regular kicker who was injured. She did it with great aplomb and obviously very effectively. 
After the game, Liz merely said, `I was out there to have fun and do my job on the field for the team. That was enough for me.' 
It isn't enough for me to just acknowledge this, but I wanted to come to the Senate floor today to pay tribute to her and to say in this day and age anything is possible. 
I commend her for being the first woman to play in a men's college football game. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Lott amendment and in opposition to the McCain-Feingold bill. It is not without some reservation that I take that position. I have the greatest esteem and respect for the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Arizona. I know their motives in all of this are good and honorable. 
I just happen to come from a State, however, where we enacted a bill not dissimilar--not identical, but not dissimilar--to the McCain-Feingold bill. My State legislative process went through an entire cycle with Byzantine kinds of rules applied before our State supreme court, a very liberal supreme court, threw it all out as unconstitutional, as violating the right of freedom of speech. 
Now, Oregon is a State that is known for good clean government, good clean many things. We have in our State no allegations of corruption, or frankly they are very infrequent. We have voter turnout that often exceeds 80 percent. We have a very healthy democratic system in my State. 
Notwithstanding that, in 1994 there was an initiative that came to our ballot, very similar to McCain-Feingold, that applied to State legislative and gubernatorial races. I will admit that it passed by a large margin. I said to myself, why would it pass by a big margin if we have a good thing going here, frankly, good government in our State? I think it is simply because people don't like to be inconvenienced by democracy sometimes, and I know how they feel. I don't like to see negative ads and I don't like to be imposed upon sometimes, but frankly, democracy sometimes is uncomfortable. It is sometimes messy. 
On first blush it appeared to be a very good bill. However, when it came to its enactment, our secretary of state tried to explain it to all the legislative candidates. Everyone was wondering how you can run for public office. There were limits placed upon what a candidate could raise. There were limits placed upon what a citizen could contribute of $100. And the net effect of it all is that a State legislative office seeker could raise about $20,000 to $30,000, and that would buy maybe a couple cracks at communicating with his constituents. 
The interest in the process didn't leave. It just simply vacated the open air of democracy and went back into the smoke-filled room. I am talking about organized labor and I am talking about big business. They, then, ran campaigns about candidates in the most slanderous and scurrilous of ways. For those campaigns, no one was accountable, no one was responsible. And in the end, I believe our democracy in the 98th cycle was dumbed down and disserved. Importantly, our Supreme Court, as I mentioned, declared it all unconstitutional. They did so correctly. 
Now, when I ran for the U.S. Senate I ran in a special election against my friend, now my colleague, my former competitor, Ron Wyden, a Member of this Chamber. He and I became the focus of the entire country in contesting for the seat formally held by Bob Packwood. Let me tell you what happened. Both of us were running hard-hitting campaigns. Then we became the victims, and I believe myself especially, by what I term `drive-by shooting' on our democratic process. I had, in the course of several weeks time, $1 million of the most scurrilous kinds of ads run against me and I hated what they said. 
I remember my little boy sitting watching television when I happened to be there and seeing one of the ads that they ran, and he turned back to me with wide eyes and tears in his eyes and he said, `That was a very bad ad, Dad,' and it was. 
You might think because of that I would want to shut down the ability of the unions to participate I don't want to do that, but I don't want to shut down the right of people like me and you to respond to these kinds of attacks. That is what these kinds of limits will do. 
I truly believe that banning soft money is unconstitutional for many of the same reasons our State supreme court found it unconstitutional. I believe the U.S. Supreme Court would find such attempts here to be unconstitutional. Limit it--you may be able to do. But if you limit it, and I may even be able to vote for some form of limitation as we apply limits on contributions directly to candidates, perhaps there can be some constitutional limit on soft money. But if you do that, then there should be no more compulsory element left in this process. 
Frankly, the huge loophole is this loophole provided by compulsory union dues. Unless the Lott amendment passes, I can't go any farther, because I saw what happened. It happened to me, and it happened to Republicans and Democrats alike in the State of Oregon. They had campaigns run about them and they were grossly unfair. I don't want to support campaign finance reform that will dumb down our democracy in that way. Indeed, I believe some of the best things that we could do are to require voluntarism in this process and then to put some reasonable spending limits or caps on soft money contributions and then to require candidates to disclose on a daily basis the source of their contributions 3 months out from a campaign so that the public knows if one candidate is getting too much from business or another candidate is getting too much from labor. Then they can decide whether that is significant to them when they cast their sacred vote. 
In my view, the cure for bad democracy is not less of it but more of it and more open. I don't see that we provide for that in the McCain-Feingold bill. I see many things resulting, as they did in Oregon, which left my State in one election cycle, I believe, poorer for it. 
So I plead with my colleague, vote for the Lott amendment, and then let's talk seriously about some things that we can do to make this whole process fair for both sides. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. 
Mr. President, today in America, too many teenagers have access to too much tobacco at too many stores and retail outlets. The result? Each day 3,000 more young people start smoking and get addicted to lethal tobacco products. 
As Congress considers legislation to reduce teenage smoking and to address the growing public health concerns associated with the use of tobacco, I want to propose a concept that goes to the heart of the problem--keeping tobacco products out of the hands of kids. While there are numerous well-intentioned suggestions as to how to best achieve this goal, I believe that the proposal I am introducing today goes to the heart of the problem--holding both those who sell tobacco accountable and those who illegally purchase tobacco responsible. It demands the participation by store owners, clerks, parents, kids, and local law enforcement. 
The proposal is a simple, direct approach: require those who sell tobacco to be licensed and trained, and hold children who illegally purchase tobacco responsible for their actions--by notifying their parents, imposing fines and community service, and restricting access to driving privileges. 
With this legislation, we have an opportunity to take some incremental and immediate action today, to empower our communities in the fight against teenage tobacco use. The Tobacco Use by Minors Deterrence Act elicits cooperation among families, communities, the retailers, and law enforcement officials in the fight against tobacco use by children. Importantly, this legislation gives retailers a new leadership role and places greater responsibility on parents and minors. 
First, this bill establishes a self-funding State license program for retailers to sell tobacco products, similar to liquor licenses. Second, it imposes strict penalties on store owners and employees for selling tobacco products to minors. Third, it requires employee training on all tobacco laws. Fourth, it subjects minors who are caught purchasing or using tobacco products to punishments that are meaningful to them, including the option of fines, parental notification, community service, and possible loss of driving privileges. 
In my State of Oregon, restrictions on the distribution and sale of tobacco products are some of the strongest in the nation. This legislation echoes Oregon's commitment by making it more difficult for retailers across the Nation to make a profit from the illegal sale of tobacco products to children. 
Just how important is it that we take immediate action? Each day that we wait for the pending FDA lawsuits, and each day that we spend talking about doing something to reduce tobacco use by our Nation's children, 3,000 more young people begin smoking. I want you to think about that for a moment. Each day, 3,000 children start smoking---that's more than 1 million children each year. To put this into perspective, the Centers for Disease Control [CDC] estimates that 16.6 million of our children today will become regular smokers, and almost one-third, approximately 5 million children, will die from tobacco-related illness. In my State of Oregon, 191,688 children under 18 are projected to become smokers; 61,340 of those youth will die. It is time to recognize teen tobacco use for what it is--a public health epidemic. 
In addition to the loss of life associated with tobacco use, there is a significant cost to our public health system. Currently, health care costs caused directly by smoking total more than $50 billion each year. We cannot afford to wait any longer. Because the longer we postpone empowering communities, families, and law enforcement officials, we do so by sacrificing the health and life of our children.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the Senate floor this morning and talk about a development in Russia that is of concern to this body because of the action we took earlier this summer. 
Earlier in the year the Russian Duma passed a law which would reintegrate a Stalinist system when it comes to freedom of conscience, freedom of religion. Four religions: Judaism, Buddhism, the Russian Orthodox Church, and Islam were identified as sanctioned by the Russian Federation, but left out all Protestant religions, the Catholic religion, and any other minority faith that is currently operating there according to international treaty and according to Russian law, previous Russian law and the Russian Constitution. 
These new groups would be treated in minority fashion, in that they could not own property, they could not operate schools, have missionaries there, publish Bibles or distribute them or employ people. They would be required to get rid of bank accounts and to register with the state. What I am describing is a huge setback for Russia, back into Stalinist times. And so, this body took very courageous action. It voted 95 to 4 to withhold foreign aid to Russia, should this be enacted. I was delighted after we did that, that President Boris Yeltsin was good to his word and vetoed that legislation. After that, however, he participated in a compromise bill, which an honest reading would tell a person is of no difference. 
The upper house of the Duma, yesterday, passed compromise legislation. The President is expected to sign it, and unfortunately, the worst things that could happen to religion in Russia could still happen. There is reason to believe that the Russian Government will implement this law differently than it is actually written. It is for this reason that I have worked with Senator Mitch McConnell, and other members of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, to modify our bill in a small, but significant way. 
The word `enact' will be changed in conference to `implement' in order to give the Russian leaders some latitude in interpreting this legislation. The foreign operations bill language will now allow the Russian Government 6 months to enact the new legislation in a manner that will not discriminate against minority religions before a decision is made to withhold foreign aid. 
I come to the floor today to plead with my colleagues to support this language. I would tell you that the people we represent would not be amused by our inaction or our unwillingness to do something. This isn't about trade, this isn't about freedom of contract, this is about taking tax dollars from the American people and giving them to a government that is reimposing Stalinist restrictions. Imagine going to a townhall in your State, or mine in Oregon, and talking to Catholics who are watching the spectacle of their church being removed from Russia--and then trying to explain why Russia should get American tax dollars as foreign aid. 
I thank the Chair for this time. I thank my colleague again from Indiana. I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the Chair. 
I thank my colleague from Montana and my colleagues from Washington and Idaho who have joined me in resisting the Bryan amendment. The Senator from Nevada is my friend, but I believe on this issue he is very wrong. If he were to prevail, this would force great injury on my State. 
Mr. President, I would like to take just a couple of minutes to speak against the amendment from the junior Senator from Nevada. This amendment calls for a $10 million reduction in funds for new road building, the elimination of the purchaser credit program, and a further reduction on logging in roadless areas. I strongly oppose these provisions. 
Timber sales are vital to the long-term viability of local communities throughout the West. Under existing law, 25 percent of the gross receipts from Federal timber sales go to local communities. These funds are used for local schools and roads programs. Without a viable forest road maintenance, repair, and construction program, the timber sale program would be significantly limited. The big losers will be local communities. 
Shared receipts are an integral part of local government revenues in the West. There is no practical way to separate these payments from the other payment programs without having dramatic negative consequences on local communities. The necessary dollars to offset the loss of revenue caused from the reduction in timber sales would not be forthcoming. 
Mr. President, Federal timber sales have declined precipitously, primarily from limitations placed on the Forest Service by environmental considerations and species protection efforts for spotted owls, marbled murrelets, and various species of salmon. In 1987, the timber sale program provided more than 12 billion board feet of timber; 10 years later, less than 4 billion board feet were sold. 
It does not take an accountant to determine the serious implications this has had for the budgets of rural communities. Two-thirds of all timber harvested in national forests come from small businesses. Those small operations are generally headquartered in the rural areas, providing jobs and stability to their communities, not to mention needed revenues to sustain local programs and services. 
The Bryan amendment would dramatically limit forest road 
construction, putting additional pressures on the timber sale program. Since 1991, total new road construction built by the Forest Service or by timber purchasers has declined by two-thirds. Spending on both new road construction and reconstruction has been cut in half over this same period. 
Most supporters of the Bryan amendment are unaware that the Forest Service will spend many times more on reconstruction and repair of existing roads than they will on the construction of new forest roads. Indeed, most of the funding appropriated by Congress each year goes toward the reconstruction of existing roads. In 1996, more than 2,800 miles of roads were reconstructed, while only about 450 miles of new roads were constructed. 
Reconstruction activities protect watersheds through improved road design, road placement, and sediment control. Road construction funds are being used for watershed protection as part of the President's forest plan for the Pacific Northwest. According to the Forest Service, forest roads allow critical access needed for the suppression of up to 10,000 wildfires per year and reforestation of the burned-over lands. 
The Bryan amendment will quite simply prevent the President from keeping the environmental and economic commitments made in the Northwest forest plan. 
The Forest Service has invested significantly in technology transfer applications for road building. Examples cited in this year's Forest Service budget proposal are: wetland development and riparian restoration through modification of culverts and other drainage structures, retaining soil through innovative design of gravity walls, and lower water crossings for roads to minimize disturbance, provide fish passage, and avoid damming and channeling during peak flows. 
Mr. President, the Forest Service is continuing its efforts 
to reduce the number of roads. In recent years, the Forest Service has annually reduced more than three times as much road mileage as compared to new construction. In 1996, the Forest Service reduced 1,400 miles of roads. For the past 6 years combined, the Forest Service has reduced over 18,000 miles of roads. 
The Bryan amendment also calls for the elimination of purchaser road credits program. Eliminating purchaser road credits would have serious implications for local communities. 
Under the purchaser credit program, timber sale contracts require the purchaser to reconstruct or construct roads and bridges. Purchaser credit is an off-budget means for the Forest Service to rebuild and repair existing roads and occasionally to build new roads at a significant savings to the taxpayer when compared appropriated funds. 
Timber companies receive credits equal to the value of the road work required under a timber contract. The credit can be applied against the price paid to the Government for the timber harvested. These companies reflect the cost of building roads in their submitted bids. 
As funds for road construction have been reduced in recent years, purchaser credit has become a vital tool to accomplish road work in all regions of the country, especially reconstruction. About 80 percent of the program is used each year for reconstruction on roads, especially for safety and environmental improvements. 
Proponents of this amendment project positive Federal budget effects from the elimination of purchaser road credits. Elementary economics tells us that purchasers will simply bid less for the timber than they would of the credit were in place in order to offset their increased costs, while the Federal Government will net virtually the same amount. 
The Bryan amendment would 
further restrict the construction of roads in roadless areas. Road construction in roadless areas of the national forests are, for the most part, limited to emergency situations. Indeed, few if any miles of roads have been built in roadless areas of the national forests in recent years. However, building some roads in roadless areas is necessary on occasion to allow access to treat insect and disease outbreaks, to monitor forest health, or for wildfire management. 
Finally, Mr. President, there is no subsidy associated with timber sales or road construction. For new road construction and reconstruction associated with timber sales, costs are fairly apportioned. These costs are fully offset by timber revenues, resulting in net profits averaging more than $400 million per year over the last 6 years. 
According to a recent economic analysis released by the Price Waterhouse accounting firm, `the forest roads program does not contain a subsidy for timber purchasers--it provides an efficient and effective mechanism for financing road construction and reconstruction.' 
Forest Service timber sales are sold using an open, competitive auction system process. All sales are sold at fair market value, with costs associated with the timber sales, including road work, apportioned and built into a minimum bid price, which sets the floor on the value of the timber sale. 
Mr. President, I would like to close by quoting from a September 9 editorial in Oregonian which addresses the merit of Senator Byran's amendment.  
We think timber sales should be based on good plans and sound scientific analysis of their effects. This amendment, however, more closely fits the agenda of those environmentalists opposing all commercial timber sales in the national forests than it does the interest of good planning. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against the Byran amendment. 
In the interest of time, I will summarize so we will leave to Senator Kempthorne some time. I am reminded of the statement I heard from one Senator--everything that can be said has been said but not everyone has said it. So I guess it is my turn. I would like to let Senator Kempthorne have a chance to be on record also. 
I could focus on the many points Senator Craig laid out very well as to why this is not a subsidy, why this all nets out in the end for the advantage of the forest, for the advantage of the taxpayer and for the advantage of local communities in the rural Northwest. I suggest to you that President Clinton came to my State, held a big timber conference, made some promises as to the level of historic timber harvest that would occur, along with a whole lot of environmental protection. 
Part of that promise was that inclusion of these purchaser road credits would continue, that roads would be maintained so that there are not big blowouts, that there would be the ability to suppress fires, that there would be the ability to continue to harvest where it is economically and environmentally responsible to do so. 
I was very heartened the other day to find two of my State's leading newspapers--these are not conservative newspapers; these are liberal voices in my State, the Oregonian and the Register-Guard out of Eugene--said the Senate should maintain the funds on these roads. 
Well, let me quote from the Oregonian. They said Forest Service road funding, `which consists of road resurfacing, culvert replacement and other environmentally vital drainage improvements, these environmentally responsible activities are badly underfunded. It would be perverse to cut these budgets in the name of stopping new roads.' 
I agree. If you just focus on the economics, this washes out to the taxpayer. If you focus on the environment, we are not talking about much new road building. We are talking about maintenance of roads for people to use, for forest health to be provided, for the environment to be protected against washouts of these roads. We are talking about people who want to hunt in our national forests. All of these things are critical to this debate. 
But, in the end I want to emphasize what the Senator from Montana said. There is a human element here, for crying out loud. There are people who breathe air and have blood in their veins and have children and have dreams and who want a future, who love to live in the country, who understand what it means to be stewards of the land and who also understand that this is a chain saw at their way of life. This is a chain saw aimed at the heart of Northwestern rural communities. It has to be stopped. 
I care about protecting the environment. I just happen to believe that people like wood products, too. I happen to believe there can be a balance between the environment and our economy; between providing for animal and human needs. This goes at the heart of stopping that kind of balance. 
I plead with my colleagues. You have interests in your States where I need to learn. I want to know what it is that helps your people, your human element. But if you want to know what affects mine, this does. 
Even the leading liberal papers of my State agree with me. The New York Times doesn't understand the issue. They are on the other side. Today I stand with the people of Oregon, who understand the balance of the environment and our economy. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, former Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles once stated that `Of all the tasks of government, the most basic is to protect its citizens against violence.' While this has been one of our biggest challenges, Congress has the ability to also strengthen those laws that deter violence and provide protection to those whose careers are dedicated to protecting our families and also our communities. 
With that intent, I rise today with my colleague, Senator Hatch, to introduce the Federal Judiciary Protection Act, a bill to provide greater protection to Federal law enforcement officials and their families. Under current law, a person who assaults, attempts to assault, or who threatens to kidnap or murder a member of the immediate family of a U.S. official, a U.S. judge, or a Federal law enforcement official, is subject to a punishment of a fine or imprisonment of up to 5 years, or both. This legislation seeks to expand these penalties in instances of assault with a weapon and a prior criminal history. In such cases, an individual could face up to 20 years in prison. 
This legislation would also strengthen the penalties for individuals who communicate threats through the mail. Currently, individuals who knowingly use the U.S. Postal Service to deliver any communication containing any threat are subject to a fine of up to $1,000 or imprisonment of up to 5 years. Under this legislation, anyone who communicates a threat could face imprisonment of up to 10 years. 
Briefly, I would like to share an example illustrating the need for this legislation. In my State of Oregon, Chief Judge Michael Hogan and his family were subjected to frightening, threatening phone calls, letters, and messages from an individual who had been convicted of previous crimes in Judge Hogan's courtroom. For months, he and his family lived with the fear that these threats to the lives of his wife and children could become reality, and, equally disturbing, that the individual could be back out on the street again in a matter of a few months, or a few years. 
Judge Hogan and his family are not alone. In April of this year, the wife of a circuit court judge in Florida was stalked by an individual who had been convicted of similar offenses in 1994 and 1995. Mrs. Linda Cope, the wife of Circuit Judge Charles Cope was leaving a shopping mall one afternoon and as pursued by a man named Stelios Kostakis. As she left the parking lot, she realized that she was being followed and attempted to lose Kostakis by taking alternative routes and speeding through residential streets. In a desperate attempt, Mrs. Cope cut in front of a semitrailer truck, risking a serious accident and possible loss of life, to escape. Even after this third offense, stalking the wife of a circuit court judge, he was sentenced to only 6 months on probation and $150 in fines and other court costs. 
In September 1996, Lawrence County Judge Dominick Motto was stalked, harassed, and subjected to terrorist threats by Milton C. Reiguert, who was upset by a verdict in a case that Judge Motto had heard in his courtroom. After hearing the verdict, Reiguert stated his intention to `point a rifle at his head and get what he wanted.' 
Mr. President, these are only a few examples of vicious acts focused at our Federal law enforcement officials. As a member of the legislative branch, I believe it is our responsibility to provide adequate protection to all Americans who serve to protect the life and liberty of every citizen in this Nation. I encourage my colleagues to join us in sponsoring this important legislation.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Wyden, for yielding. I publicly commend my senior colleague from Oregon, with whom it has been my great pleasure to stand on this issue and ask for justice for our State. I want to point out a very pivotal role that Senator Strom Thurmond played in breaking a logjam, if you will, for the State of Oregon. For a very long time now, Senator Wyden and I have been trying to get answers from the Air Force for widows and orphans, literally, as to why their loved ones, these airmen, perished in this tragic accident. For one reason or another, we were stalled and put off at every turn. 
It was Senator Thurmond who, when he heard of Senator Wyden's hold on this nomination--and, frankly, my encouragement of that--that he intervened in our behalf. I acknowledge it. I thank him. He asked me to go immediately with him to the cloakroom where we got on the phone with the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force. 
We laid out the terms of a deal that will include a new investigation into C-130 air transports generally, and this one in particular. It was promised to Oregon's families, that these widows and orphans would be given the information they need as to why this accident occurred. It was promised that a member of the National Transportation Safety Board would be a part of this investigative team. And I think that is important for the Air Force that has, in my State, lost some credibility. I thank the Air Force for their promise to provide to our State, and this issue generally, the kind of investigation that was conducted for Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, who perished in an accident in Bosnia. 
So, I thank the Air Force for responding. I regret it took this level of intervention, but I compliment my senior colleague for his leadership on this. I have been proud to stand with him. I am grateful to Senator Thurmond. I am thankful the Air Force has come around to help us on this issue. I only hope that out of all of this will come information that will protect our men in the Air Force who fly C-130 air transports from this ever occurring again to anyone else. 
With that, I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to vote for the confirmation of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I am pleased to rise as one of the cosponsors of Senator Gorton's amendment. Many here, including the Presiding Officer, spent the last year campaigning, and, frankly, I made education one of the cornerstones of my campaign. 
Everywhere I went there was frustration at the local level about Federal redtape, bureaucracy, burdens and costs that were imposed upon our common desire to educate our children. I said over and over again that I believed in local control. Now it is time to put to the truth what we said in how we will vote. 
I am proud to cosponsor this with Senator Gorton because it does exactly what we ought to be doing. 
Madam President, this amendment focuses the area of education on reform, returning the control of our education dollars back to where it belongs, at the local level. This amendment simply block grants the funds from the Department of Education for K through 12 and gives it to local schools. 
As my colleague, Senator Domenici, stated, we keep adding regulations, adding programs, adding money. 
But when we get to the end of the equation, we end with a negative result and subtracting from education. 
This amendment gives us the opportunity to give schools the flexibility to improve the quality of education at the local level, to improve the basic skills of reading, writing and arithmetic. 
Madam President, this is an opportunity for us to do the right thing, not only by reducing the bureaucracy that exists in our school education system, but to provide our schools with the flexibility and the funding to achieve a higher standard. 
I urge my colleagues to support this. I urge government at all levels, who care about education, to do so by showing, in an affirmative way, that our interest is in an educated child, our interest is not in adding to well-funded bureaucracies. I urge support of this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced a bill, S. 1072, that corrects an unintended loophole in the Plant Patent Act of 1930 dealing with the coverage of plant parts. The 1930 act covers the whole plant but did not address plant parts, resulting in a loophole whereby some growers, particularly in foreign nations that do not have plant breeders' rights laws, are reproducing U.S. patent-protected varieties without authorization. They then export the harvested materials--plant parts--such as flowers and fruits, to the United States. The loophole has been created by new production and transportation capabilities unforeseen 67 years ago. 
As a result, American plant breeders are losing royalty income that supports continued research and breeding of new and improved varieties. Domestic growers who are paying legitimate royalties are also finding themselves at an unfair disadvantage to foreign growers producing patented varieties illegally. 
The Plant Patent Act of 1930 has historically offered a strong incentive for research and breeding activities, which is the foundation for a progressive and growing U.S. horticultural industry. 
This legislation amends the Plant Patent Act to expressly cover plants and plant parts by inserting at the end of 35 U.S.C. 163, the words `or any parts thereof.' This solution provides relief to U.S. breeders and growers, and would help ensure that the United States remains an international leader in the development of new and useful plant varieties. It will enable plant and patent holders the opportunity to protect their patent rights and continue investing in research and development. S. 1072 is also consistent with the 1991 International Union for the Production of New Varieties of Plants, which extends plant breeders' rights protection to harvested material.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I have a prepared statement, but I am going to divert from it and frankly just speak from my heart, from my experience. My experience is not long in this Chamber. But my experience among the people of Oregon is very recent. And my experience there with people causes me to rise in opposition to the amendment of the Senator from California. I am reluctant to do that for a personal reason. I am one of Senator Feinstein's great admirers. She may not know that, but I think she is a terrific human being. But I have an obligation to speak as best I can for the people who elected me. 
I believe this may be an imperfect process. Maybe it should not be a rider to a bill. But I am very aware that for 25 years this issue has been debated in this Chamber, and we have had study after study after study, and what we are beginning to develop is a feeling among the electorate that when going for justice in the ninth circuit, that justice will be denied. So I think there is a lot of frustration on the part of many of us here that we have to do whatever we can and stop studying and stop delaying and start doing. So I feel very strongly about this. 
I have heard many arguments today that have merit on a procedural basis. Yes, maybe many of the legal profession oppose this. But many people support this. 
We have heard charges of gerrymandering. I have a map of the United States and the circuit courts of this country. They are saying we are gerrymandering on the west coast of the United States, but I notice that nearly every State on the east coast of the United States is in a different circuit. There are five circuits that cover the Eastern United States, and those circuits have the lowest reversal rates, taken together, of any region in the country. I think we need to change it. 
So I rise to support what Senator Gregg is doing. I thank him for that. I thank him for his leadership. He doesn't have a dog in the fight of the ninth circuit, but a lot of us do. So I thank him for that. 
I join my colleagues in opposition to this amendment to strike the provision in this bill to divide the Ninth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. This may not be the most perfect solution to a difficult problem, but I believe that it provides a platform from which to relieve the caseload and reversal rate of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Serving more than 45 million people and spanning 1.4 million square miles, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals handles more than 8,500 filings a year--with a reversal rate of 96 percent. By the year 2010, the ninth circuit population will increase in size by 43 percent. 
While my colleague from California may argue that this is an issue for further study, I would like to remind my colleagues that the Senate has studied this issue for almost a quarter century and has reported legislation to split the ninth circuit on three separate occasions. Clearly, the time has come to act. 
I want to conclude by reading the comments of some judges who support what is happening here, because some have been read to the reverse. 
Mr. President, we are not simply legislating without just cause. The judges that serve in the ninth circuit have given us cause to act without further delay. Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain from my state of Oregon has stated: 
We (the ninth circuit) cannot grow without limit. As the number of opinions increases, we judges risk losing the ability to know what our circuit's law is. In short, bigger is not necessarily better. The ninth circuit will ultimately need to be split. 
I replaced a great senator, Senator Mark O. Hatfield who served in this Chamber for 30 years. He said: 
The ninth circuit's size has created serious problems: too many judges spending more time and money traveling than hearing cases, a growing backlog of cases which threaten to bury each judge, a dangerous inability to keep up with current case law, a breakdown in judicial collegiality and, most importantly, a failure to provide uniformity, stability and predictability in the development of federal law throughout the Western region. It is increasingly clear that these problems cannot be solved by the reforms already implemented by the Court. These arguments adequately state the case for the division of the circuit. We delay at our peril. 
Mr. President, justice delayed is justice denied. I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that corrects a Forest Service mapping error on the border of the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area [HCNRA], in northeast Oregon, that has led to the closure of an important access road. The bill will restore public access to Hells Canyon, while preserving additional wilderness acreage for the enjoyment of generations to come. 
In 1975, Congress created the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area which includes the Wilderness Area and overlooks the Snake River and the Oregon-Idaho border. Along the western rim of Hells Canyon lies Forest Service Road 3965. The 1975 act directed the development of a comprehensive management plan for the HCNRA and specifically addressed the need to analyze road access on the western rim of the canyon. The 1982 Comprehensive Management Plan, developed with extensive public participation, provided for continued motor vehicle use of Road 3965 for recreation and fire prevention purposes. The road existed prior to the HCNRA designation, but upon the discovery that the road crossed into the designated wilderness area, the road was closed. 
The Forest Service inadvertently erred in its location of the wilderness boundary in question. This legislation will, therefore, adjust the wilderness boundary to bring it in line with what Congress intended when the wilderness was established. This correction will actually increase wilderness acreage. 
For decades, Oregon residents have traveled this service road to experience the natural beauty of Hells Canyon. The recreation area is an important part of our heritage, and public access to it is vital. I look forward to the Forest Service managing the road with continued sensitivity to all cultural, environmental, and economic impacts.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am saddened to note the passing of Holly A. Cornell of Charbonneau, one of Oregon's leading citizens, who died at his home on July 1 after a long illness at the age of 83. A July 7 memorial service for Mr. Cornell was held at the LaSells Stewart Alumni Center on the Oregon State University Campus in Corvallis. 
Mr. Cornell, a founding partner and the `C' in what became Oregon's own CH2M HILL, was the international engineering and environmental consulting firm's first employee. He returned to Corvallis after World War II to co-found the firm that was to become Cornell, Howland Hayes & Merryfield [CH2M]. He managed numerous water, wastewater and industrial projects for CH2M, and opened the firm's Seattle office. He also served as director of technology, president and chief executive officer and chairman of the board. 
Among his many accomplishments were ushering CH2M HILL into the computer age, and managing complex projects such as the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District's pollution abatement project. At the time of Mr. Cornell's 1980 retirement, CH2M HILL had grown from a four-partner office in a second-floor Corvallis office to an international consulting firm employing 1,900 professionals in 20 U.S. offices and two overseas locations. 
His legacy, which is one of the Nation's largest employee owned companies, has become a $1 billion a year business which employs more than 7,000 employees in 120 worldwide locations. 
Mr. Cornell is the second CH2M HILL founder to pass away. Fred Merryfield, the Oregon State engineering professor who conceived the idea for the firm, died in 1977. The other founders are retired, but remain active in CH2M HILL affairs, in their communities and in their personal lives. 
Ralph R. Peterson, CH2M HILL's president and CEO, said, 
It was my personal pleasure to work with Holly from the time I joined the firm in 1965 until Holly's retirement in 1980. Of course, he excelled at whatever job he undertook, but what I remember most of Holly during those times are the lasting relationships he forged with clients, on projects: clients and projects like to Boeing 747 Assembly Plant in Everett, Washington; and the Denver Water Board's Foothills Water Treatment plant in Denver. These became landmark projects, but what is truly impressive is that those clients are still valued CH2M HILL clients today. 
Mr. Cornell was born in Boise, ID in 1914 and earned a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Oregon State College in 1939. He earned a master's degree from Yale and worked for the Standard Oil Co. in California before being called to active Army duty in 1941. Mr. Cornell served with distinction in the Army Corps of Engineers in Europe during World War II and received the Bronze Star medal. He was executive officer of an engineer group under Gen. George Patton that repaired Germany's famed Remagen Bridge, enabling Allied forces to cross the Rhine. 
Mr. Cornell was active in numerous professional societies including the American Consulting Engineers Council, the American Society of Civil Engineers, the American Water Works Association, and the Professional Engineers of Oregon. The latter society recently named him Oregon Engineer of the Year. He also was active in a university fraternal organization, Phi Delta Theta, and several honorary societies including Phi Kappa Phi and Tau Beta Pi. 
Mr. Cornell enjoyed golf and travel. His wife, Cleo, preceded him in death. He is survived by a son, Stephen Cornell, Seattle; a daughter, Cynthia Wildfong, Castle Rock, CO; and three grandchildren.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, on the Fourth of July, as Americans were celebrating their cherished freedoms upon which this country was founded, the Russian Federation passed a bill which, if signed into law, would restrict freedom of religion in that country in a lamentable way. 
This bill is ironically titled, `On Freedom of Conscience and on Religious Associations.' It first passed the lower house of the Russian Duma in late June. 
The bill would, among other things, limit the activities of foreign missionaries and grant unregistered religious groups significantly fewer rights than accredited Russian religious organizations such as the Russian Orthodox Church, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism. 
Mr. President, this bill awaiting signature now on President Yeltsin's desk would severely limit the very existence of what Russia terms `new faiths.' These `new faiths' include many Protestant faiths--Evangelicals, fundamentalists, Pentecostals, SDA's, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, and even the Catholic Church. These faiths will be persecuted as religious minorities under this proposed law. 
Congress has already taken a number of steps to send signals to President Yeltsin about this bill. Many Members of both Houses have signed letters to President Yeltsin and to President Clinton. From the Vatican to former President Jimmy Carter, the reaction to this law has been strong and unwavering. 
I rise today to send an even stronger signal. My amendment would withhold funds appropriated in the foreign operations bill to Russia unless the President of the United States determines and verifies in writing to the Congress that the Government of Russia has enacted no statute that would discriminate against religious minorities in the Russian Federation. 
Mr. President, I realize, as do all Senators, that Russia is a sovereign country. We cannot tell Russia what to do as a country. We can, however, elect not to send foreign aid to a country that would discriminate against religious beliefs in so fundamental a way. 
This will be the clearest and strongest message that can be sent to President Yeltsin. Should he decide to enact into law this discrimination, we then will send no American funds, none of our taxpayers' hard-earned moneys, to that country in the fiscal year of 1998. 
In the modern world, for most religions, the kind of deprivation of status that the Russian bill would enact, should it become law, is a major encroachment upon religious freedom. 
Many international agreements have already been signed that require signatories to guarantee religious freedom. For example, sections of the Vienna Concluding Document of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe commits participating States in the Helsinki process to grant religious freedom as part of their Constitution. 
Mr. President, the Russian Federation is a signatory to that Vienna document. Furthermore, the bill on President Yeltsin's desk would not only violate this and other international agreements; it would also violate Russia's own Constitution which guarantees religious freedoms we as Americans have come to hold as so dear and so fundamental. I know some might argue, Mr. President, that we should not take these kinds of actions; that we are trying to help Russia build democracy, and we are and want to do those things, but I would say to them that religious freedom is the cornerstone of democracy. Indeed, a democratic foundation without that cornerstone of religious freedom is a democracy that is built upon sand. 
I hope that all Senators will join me in sending a strong signal to President Yeltsin that American dollars will not find their way to support any country that treats religious freedom in such a manner. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, it is with considerable pride I share with you today an educational program that is bringing hope and insight to students in Oregon. It is characterized by voluntarism, authentic educational programs, and community involvement. The program itself, and its individual parts, serves as a model for educational reforms throughout our Nation. 
The Oregon State University Summer Agricultural Institute, which is currently in its 8th year, consists of teachers taking a week long course designed to enhance their understanding of agriculture in Oregon. After a day of initial study at the university, teachers are immersed in authentic, hands-on learning. They visit actual working farms and ranches, processing plants, forestry sites, and dairy farms. Additionally, each teacher spends 1 night with a family that owns and operates a farm or ranch. Teachers in the program also experience a day of role reversal as they become the students of boys and girls involved in Future Farmers of America. The teachers learn how relevant and meaningful learning takes place in the lives of these young people as they farm and raise animals. 
Teachers must pay a small fee for the class but the overwhelming majority of costs are met through donations. These gifts of money, time, and resources by agricultural communities in Oregon provide the financial backbone of the program. 
The institute ends with a dinner where teachers are given the opportunity to share their reflections on the week. During this evening it is common for teachers to share an increased sense of appreciation for agriculture. The advanced level of education possessed by farmers and ranchers, their commitment to responsible stewardship of the land, and their incredible work ethic leave the teachers not only impressed but touched. One teacher tearfully remarked, `Oregon's land is in good hands. Thank you.' 
Teachers leave the week with the necessary knowledge and motivation to develop meaningful curricula related to agriculture in Oregon. Lafona Jensen, the chairwoman of the program, Karen Stephenson, the coordinator of the program, and Dr. Lee Cole, the instructor of record, are individuals making a genuine difference in the lives of young people in Oregon. 
I strongly encourage States with similar agricultural interests as Oregon to look closely at this program. The Oregon State University Summer Agricultural Institute is a model for communities desiring to design educational programs that promote authentic learning and an appreciation for the important role agriculture plays in our society.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I thank Senator Wyden for his remarks and diligence on this issue. 
Mr. President, on November 27, 1996, as Senator Wyden has related, a Portland-based HC-130 airplane of the 304th Rescue Squadron, with the call sign of `King 56,' crashed off the coast of California, killing 10 of 11 people on board. 
I read the account of this tragedy, as related by the sole survivor of this accident, T. Sgt. Robert Vogel, and I was both moved and proud knowing that under extreme stress and knowing of their peril, this Oregon-based crew performed exactly as trained, and followed procedures and worked together until the very end. 
Almost 8 months has passed since this accident, and still the Department of Defense officials are unsure of the cause of the accident. Never learning the cause of this accident and the risk of having a similar accident occurring to another C-130 crew is simply unacceptable to Senator Wyden and myself. That is why we have asked experts from the National Transportation Safety Board to perform an additional review of the accident investigation and the accident procedures conducted by the Air Force. This review is still in progress. 
Although the cause of the accident is unknown, what we have learned is that there were very unfortunate shortcomings in the way the Department of Defense dealt with the families of the `King 56' crash victims. 
The shortcomings relate both to the way the Department manages accident investigations and the way the Department performs casualty notifications. That is what this amendment by Senator Wyden and myself has intended to address. We are simply asking the Department to evaluate its procedures against models used by the Federal Aviation Administration and to report to Congress whether these procedures would be beneficial and should be adopted also for military use. 
I thank Senator Wyden again for our work together in trying to correct the shortcomings in the Department of Defense accident process and to do a better job assisting the families generally, but specifically those families associated with `King 56.' 
I urge the Air Force to continue to question this accident so that none of us in any State has to experience a similar tragedy as Oregon has. Our volunteer men and women in the Armed Services 
deserve no less. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield back the balance of my time.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the remarkable life of Kirsten Frohnmayer. Kirsten, the daughter of University of Oregon president Dave Frohnmayer and his wife Lynn, died last week after a courageous battle with Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic disease that also claimed the life of her sister, Katie. 
Kirsten lived much of her 24 years on Earth with the knowledge that she was battling a vicious disease. Yet she never gave up, and she never allowed herself to wallow in despair. Rather, as her family and friends have testified, she maintained an optimistic spirit that inspired countless men, women, and children. Kirsten also willingly volunteered to undergo experimental medical procedures, in hopes that others with the same disease might benefit from what doctors learned through the procedure.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, one of the threshold rights that we as Americans hold dear is the right to worship God according to the dictates of one's own conscience. It is for that reason that many Christians and people of all faiths are disturbed by news headlines about the persecution of Christians, specifically, and other religious minorities generally in the nation of the People's Republic of China. 
This body is about to engage in a great debate on the issue of China and how the religious minorities of that great nation are treated by its government. Many of us are concerned about this issue and find it appalling to read accounts of the persecution of Christians in that nation. I, for one, believe that the best way to help China change its internal affairs toward religious minorities is not by escalating a trade war or military competition with them, but rather to engage them and to focus the spotlight upon this issue in every forum that we can find. I think businesses have an obligation to do that, and I believe we, as U.S. Senators, have an obligation to do that. 
For that reason, today, I rise to offer this amendment, which is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, that will focus on the issue of religious persecution in the People's Republic of China. Specifically, it says that: 
It is, therefore, the sense of the Senate that:

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation to authorize financial assistance to the Tumalo Irrigation District for the construction of water system improvements for the purposes of efficient utilization of water and to increase water for in-stream flows in Tumalo Creek and the Deschutes River basin. 
The district will conserve approximately 40,000 acre feet of water per year upon completion of the project. This conservation will allow the diversions from the Deschutes River and Tumalo Creek to be reduced by about 32,000 acre-feet. This increased in-stream waterflow will improve water quality, fisheries, increase opportunities for recreation, and enhance fire protection with the possible installation of hydrants. 
This legislation also has the added benefit of local funding with 50 percent coming from the district, State, and community. This project will be completed in phases with the recommended total appropriation at $15,000,000. 
I am proud of the district's work to improve in-stream flows. This is a positive solution to the inefficient and environmentally unsound system now in place. Oregon has long demonstrated its ability to identify innovative and progressive solutions, and I believe that this legislation will allow the Tumalo Irrigation District to proudly continue that tradition.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, we have just heard about the history and origins of the 1897 Organic Act of the U.S. Forest Service. I would like to describe what our forests were like a century ago and compare this to where we are today as a nation of enlightened forest stewards. Consider the following turn-of-the-century snapshot of the condition of the Nation's forests and wildlife that confronted our early conservation leaders: 
Wildfires commonly consumed 20 to 50 million acres annually--an area the size of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware combined. 
There were about 80 million acres of cut-over land that continued to be either idle or lacking desirable tree cover. 
The volume of timber cut nationally greatly exceeded that of forest growth. 
There were no provisions for reforestation in our system of laws. Aside from a few experimental programs, long-term forest management was not practiced. 
Also at the turn of the century, wood was still relatively cheap. Because of this, large quantities were left behind after logging. Sawmills were inefficient. The use of wood in buildings was based on custom, rather on sound engineering. Huge volumes of wood simply rotted. 
Massive clearing of forest land for agriculture continued. In the last 50 years of the 19th century, forest cover in many areas east of the Mississippi had fallen from 70 to 20 percent or less. In the last decade of the 19th century, America's farmers cleared forests at the average rate of 13.5 square miles per day. And much of this land included steep slopes that were highly erodible. 
Formerly abundant wildlife species were severely depleted or nearing extinction. 
Now compare the unfortunate realities that the country faced at the turn of this century with a snapshot of how our forests look today as we prepare for a new millennium: 
Following two centuries of decline, the area of forest land has stabilized. Today, the United States has about the same forest area as in 1920. 
The area consumed by wildfire each year has fallen 90 percent. And this trend is continuing even with some severe fire seasons over the last couple of summers. 
Nationally, the average volume of standing timber per acre in United States forests is about one-third greater today than in 1952. In the East, the average volume per acre has almost doubled. 
Populations of whitetail deer, wild turkey, elk, pronghorns, and many other wildlife species have increased dramatically. 
Tree planting on all forest lands rose significantly after World War II, reaching record levels in the 1980's. Many private forest lands are now actively managed for tree growing. 70,000 certified tree farms encompass 95 million acres of privately-owned land. 
The tens of millions of acres of cut-over land that existed in 1900 have long since been reforested. Many of these areas today are mature forests. Others have been harvested a second time, and the cycle of regeneration to young forests has started again. Eastern forests have staged a major comeback. We are seeing an increase in forested acreage throughout the Eastern States. 
Finally, forest growth nationally has exceeded harvests since the 1940's, with each subsequent decade generally showing increasing margins of growth over harvests. By the early part of this decade, growth exceeded harvest by 34 percent and the volume of forest growth was 360 percent greater than it had been in 1920. 
Recreational use on national forests and other public and private forest lands has increased manyfold. 
The efficiency of wood utilization has improved substantially since 1900. Much less material is left in the woods. Many sawmills produce more than double the usable lumber and other products per log than they did in 1900. Engineering standards and designs have reduced the volume of wood used per square foot of building space. Preservation treatments have substantially extended the service life of wood. These efficiencies have reduced by millions of acres, the area of annual harvest that otherwise would have occurred. 
These comparisons demonstrate what huge strides have been made in forest management between the turn of the century and today. It is important that we recognize the Forest Service for its contributions to this progress. In my home State of Oregon, which has some of the most productive forest land in the world, the Forest Service has been a responsible partner in managing our Federal lands. 
In fact, Forest Service employees in Oregon last year endured several physical attacks against their operations. Not only did arsonists burn the Oakridge Ranger Station to the ground, but they also destroyed a Forest Service truck at the Detroit Ranger Station. I want to thank those Forest Service employees in Oregon for enduring such deplorable acts of terrorism, and also recognize the agency's hard work all over the State. 
Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to commend the U.S. Forest Service for helping improve the stewardship of our natural resources over the last 100 years. The agency's efforts to use sound science and its ability to look forward have become a worldwide model for balancing the growing needs of our land. While we may not agree on every issue, I look to the Forest Service for equally successful leadership in the next 100 years.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I would not be surprised if Senator Thurmond did not even know my name, and there is no reason that he should. He had served in this body and had run for President before I was ever born, and I want him to know that I was uncomfortable in presiding here in seeing time pass by with too few people rising to pay tribute to his name and the heritage of political service he leads to this country. 
I, as a little boy, moved with my father and mother from Pendleton, OR, to Washington, DC. My dad worked for Dwight Eisenhower, and as a little boy I became interested in political affairs and public life, and for all of the memory of my life I remember hearing the name of Strom Thurmond. I remember him as a Democrat. I remember him as a Republican. I remember him always following the dictates of his conscience in pursuing issues as he saw them to be right. 
I, therefore, join with all who pay tribute to Strom Thurmond. I thank him for his service to our country. I thank him for his repeated reminders to us and the Republican conference of the first constitutional responsibility that we have--to provide for the common defense. As the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee he does that ably, and I, for one, hear his message and am anxious to support him in providing a strong national defense. 
I just had occasion to travel with the President of the United States to Europe where we witnessed the signing of the Russia-NATO agreement. I also participated in the ceremonies for the 50th anniversary of the Marshall plan. These are great contributions that America is making to world affairs and to peace. It occurs to me that none of this would have been possible absent a strong national defense. Indeed, providing for an American role in leadership, because we as Americans understand our international responsibility and understand that the world looks to us. Indeed, it looks to leaders like Strom Thurmond to support our military services in making sure that we are the leaders of peacefulness throughout this very hostile and difficult world. 
Senator Thurmond, I come to the Senate today to say thank you. I never served in the military and I suppose every man would like one day to have his grandson ask him, `What did you do in the war, Grandpa,' and I will not be able to say I served in battle like you did, but in a sense here in the U.S. Senate we go to war every day, but nobody dies, because we have found a way in this country, in this deliberative body, to fight without bloodshed. It will be my great pleasure that when my grandson sits on my knee and asks what did I do to contribute to the public life of this country, one of the things I will say is I served with Senator Strom Thurmond. 
Thank you, sir. I salute you and I commend you and I want to say publicly it is a high honor and a great privilege to serve as your colleague in this body of the U.S. Senate. 
Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation to transfer 320 acres of Oregon and California grant lands currently under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management [BLM] to the city of Grants Pass, OR. I am pleased to introduce this legislation because it exemplifies how I believe our government should work. I believe government works best when the local community has an opportunity to participate in making decisions important to them. 
Since 1968, the city of Grants Pass has leased 200 acres of BLM land to operate the Merlin Municipal Solid Waste Facility under permit by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality [DEQ]. The current lease ends April 14 in the year 2000 and, pursuant to BLM's national policy, the lease will not be renewed. The city of Grants Pass has made an incredible commitment of time, manpower, and financial resources over several years to address and minimize the environmental concerns of the Merlin landfill. The long-term management and resolution of these environmental issues can best be handled by the city of Grants Pass through ownership of the property. 
The 120 acres not part of the Merlin landfill are described by BLM as `scab lands' and are not subject to timber harvest. In addition, if the additional 120 acres are retained they would be landlocked or without access. For these reasons, the BLM recommends that these 120 acres be included in the land transfer. The 120 acres and any of the 200 acres not used for solid waste management will be retained exclusively for public use. 
The reason for this legislation is simple: Existing Federal law providing for the transfer of Federal land either does not cover Oregon and California grant lands, presents administrative procedural requirements, or does not provide the United States with the necessary environmental liability safeguards. 
The Grants Pass land transfer legislation is supported at all levels of government--local, State, and Federal. This legislation is a companion bill to that of my good friend and colleague from the House, Congressman Bob Smith, and is being heard today before the House Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands. I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.

I think there are many on my side of the aisle who care a great deal about issues with respect to children. I am one of those who has kind of bucked the tide in my party and signed up as a cosponsor, with enthusiasm, to the Hatch-Kennedy bill, which raises the tax on tobacco to provide expanded Medicaid to children. I also have great sympathy for many of the points Senator Dodd is making. I believe we should fully fund Head Start. I am told it takes $10 billion to do that, not $14 billion----

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I am interested in that, but I am not interested in breaking this budget agreement, if it means that we are breaking our promises to the American people. Republicans and Democrats alike--neither side, frankly--are thrilled with every provision of this budget, but the truth is, a lot of promises are being kept with this budget. 
Ultimately, it comes into balance, but in addition to that, we are protecting essential programs, we are cutting taxes, and we are balancing budgets. I think that is what America expects. I think that is what they want, and overriding all of our individual little concerns, I think they want us to keep our word on balancing the budget. In defense of this Congress, I think it is important to point out that since 1990, funding for Head Start has tripled. It ought to do better, but it ought not to do so at the expense of the promises we have made to cut the tax burden on the American people. 
In addition, children's programming is a priority in this budget. We have funded Head Start at the President's requested level of an additional $2.7 billion over 5 years. We provided $1 billion for this program last year and an additional $4.5 billion for child care through the welfare reform bill. So it is not like we are insensitive to this. In fact, many of us would like to do more. It is just the vehicle being chosen, and this vehicle, the Dodd amendment, will, frankly, in the end violate this bipartisan agreement, and that we cannot do, because to get a majority, we need to keep this promise to ourselves, to our constituents, and keep faith with the leadership and with the White House. 
Thank you, Madam President.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, in that I only have 3 minutes remaining, I am going to put aside my written remarks and, frankly, speak from the heart. 
I rise today, first, to thank Senator Santorum for his leadership on this issue but, more important, to stand with those who stand for the principle of life today on this very important bill. I have consistently supported this principle and have tried to listen with some care and compassion to those who advocate the other view. I heard them say things like, `Let's make abortion safe, legal, and rare,' except for the fact that when it comes to doing anything to make it rare, I seldom see them helping us in this endeavor. Conversely, I have tried very hard to reach out on issues of education and prevention to try to make abortion rare. 
Today presents us with an opportunity not to end abortion but simply to ban one incredibly gruesome procedure and to make all unborn American children safe from this procedure. 
It is clear, because of testimony that has come out, that the partial-birth abortion is anything but rare in this country, and today we need to make it impossible. 
I refer to the statement by the Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, a man much admired for his service in health care in this country, who said: 
Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect the mother's health or her future fertility. On the contrary, this procedure can pose a significant threat to both. 
As I ponder partial-birth abortion, I come to the conclusion that Americans must be bigger than this procedure performed on the most innocent among us. We are bigger than this, and I believe that Americans today in the United States will rise above this procedure to make it unlawful and to contribute towards the common desire of those who are pro-life and pro-choice to make abortion rare. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise in appreciation for the leadership of the chairman, the Senator from North Carolina, on this issue and as member of his committee I rise in support of the ratification of the CFE Flank Agreement. 
The CFE Treaty has been remarkably successful in reducing the cold war arsenals of conventional weapons in Europe. To date well over 50,000 tanks, artillery pieces and aircraft have been destroyed or removed from Europe. This treaty serves as an important mechanism to continue balanced force reductions in Europe, to build confidence among European States, and to provide assurances that NATO expansion will in no way threaten Russia. 
In addition to the Europe-wide national ceilings on specific categories of military equipment, the CFE Treaty established a system of four zones inside the map of Europe with separate subceilings. The three central zones are nested and overlapping, the fourth zone is the flank zone. The flank zones include Russia's northern and southern military districts that, during the cold war, were areas of heightened tension with NATO. NATO has corresponding limits on its Northern and Southern Flanks. 
The CFE flank zones limit the amount of equipment a country is permitted to deploy in certain areas of its own territory. The outbreak of armed ethnic conflicts in and around the Caucasus in 1993 and 1994, most notably the large scale offensive launched by the Russian Government in Chechnya, led to Russian claims for the need to deploy equipment in excess of treaty limits in that zone. 
Under the CFE Treaty, mechanisms exist that would allow parties the flexibility to make temporary adjustments in the size or location of their military equipment holdings with proper notification. However, in 1994 the Government of Russia signaled its intention to violate the treaty if such restrictions were not permanently relaxed. 
In early 1995, Clinton administration officials adamantly insisted that Russia must meet its obligations under the CFE Treaty on schedule. By May of that same year, those rigid statements demanding compliance soon collapsed into a frenzied effort to renegotiate the treaty on terms that would be acceptable to Russia. 
Aside from the embarrassing spectacle of Western concessions in the face of Russian arms control violations, the NATO alliance was further undermined by a United States-Russian side deal that failed to gain the support of our allies. A key element of the final compromise on this treaty is a confidential side statement which U.S. negotiators provided to the Russian delegation in order to win their approval of the Flank Document. An interim United States-Russian proposal--known as the Perry-Grachev understanding--led to yet another embarrassing retreat, this time from our own NATO allies. Finally, after 11th hour negotiations, the agreement before us today was accepted by all 30 parties to the CFE Treaty. 
In order to understand the process through which this treaty was approved, I strongly recommend that any interested Senator review that short document, which is available in the Office of Senate Security on the fourth floor of the Capitol. After reading that document, the purpose of the numerous restrictions contained in the resolution of ratification--particularly paragraphs 3 and 6--should be abundantly clear. 
The committee resolution reverses the affects of this side agreement by prohibiting United States participation in any negotiations which would allow Russia to violate the sovereignty of its neighbors. As further assurance, the resolution requires the President to certify, prior to deposit of the instrument of ratification, that he will vigorously reject any other side agreements sought by the Russians or any other country. 
I believe that the proper approach for the United States would have been to insist on Russian compliance 18 months ago. However, the 30 parties to the treaty were willing to reach a compromise consisting of the document before the Senate today. In all likelihood, if this treaty is rejected, it will be renegotiated on less favorable terms. With that in mind, and because of the 14 conditions included in the committee's resolution of ratification, I am willing to recommend support for this treaty. 
The treaty is an acceptable first step in resolving the difficult challenge of adapting a cold war era treaty to post-cold-war realities. It is one part in a series of efforts underway to redesign the security architecture of Europe, and as such it is an important step toward the larger goal of NATO enlargement. 
The CFE Treaty and the Vienna-based organization that oversees its implementation are important pieces of the geopolitical landscape of Europe and the former Soviet Union. With the end of the cold war, decisions made in the context of the CFE Treaty affect U.S. security on the margins. But for countries such as the Baltic States, Ukraine, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, such decisions can affect the very sovereignty of these newly independent countries. 
Russia--still the largest military power in Europe--has used its armed forces in recent years in both Georgia and Azerbaijan. Russia uses its military presence in Ukraine and Moldova to influence the sovereign governments of those states. Russian Government officials have made open threats of military invasion against the Baltics. Finally, less than a year ago, a bloody war in Chechnya was brought to an end. That war was characterized by wide scale Russian atrocities, the intentional targeting of civilians, and casualties possibly in excess of 100,000 people--mostly innocent men, women, and children. It is against this back drop that the countries on Russia's periphery watch any revisions to the security guarantees contained in the CFE Treaty. 
Mr. President, I understand my time is up. 
On this basis, this treaty has been negotiated. Again, with the leadership of the chairman, I urge support from the Senate and thank you for this time.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I would like to take this time to recognize 34 years of public service by Mayor Bill Smigley of Veneta, OR. I personally would like to thank Mayor Smigley for his commitment and hard work and wish him all the best in his retirement. 
Mayor Smigley served as city councilman for 18 years and mayor for 16 years, but has also shown a life-long dedication to improving not only his community but the State of Oregon. His service as chairman of Lane Council of Governments and his 16-year contribution to the League of Oregon Cities is a testament of his commitment to making Oregon's future brighter for all of us. 
I speak on behalf of many Oregonians across the State who look to Mayor Smigley's public service as a source of inspiration and hope that even in his retirement he will continue to work on future endeavors that will benefit our great State.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I appreciate this opportunity to speak briefly on this issue before the Senate. I begin by thanking my colleagues, Senator Ashcroft and Senator Dorgan, and their staffs for their leadership on this issue. 
As yet, only one State, the State of Oregon, my State, has passed legislation to allow assisted suicide. In 1994, Oregon voters approved ballot measure 16, called the Death With Dignity Act, which exempts from criminal and civil liability physicians who assist their patients in committing suicide. Since its approval, a ruling in March by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has prevented the law from taking effect, leaving the ultimate decision to the Supreme Court of the United States. 
However, I believe it is our responsibility to address this issue before other States, including New York and Washington, have to face the dilemma that now confronts Oregon. Oregon has taken the initiative in meeting the health care needs of our most needy and vulnerable citizens. Through the implementation of the Oregon health plan, I was a legislator who helped to enact and to pass and to fund that act. However, ballot measure 16 threatens the lives of those we have worked so hard to help. 
The Oregon health plan rations medicine in an honest way. What it does is rank the procedures that promote and provide preventive medicine. I am concerned, as an Oregonian, as an American, as a taxpayer, that this system that has been enacted with the very best of motives will provide a slippery slope that will make the right to die into a duty to die. In a time when we have few health care dollars and so many of those dollars are expended late in life, I fear the financial incentive that is built into the system if soon the right to die becomes, under financial extremis, a duty to die. 
Now, lest you think that I am exaggerating in my fears, the Oregon Medicaid director has recently publicly stated that once the legal issues have been resolved, Oregon will begin subsidizing physician-assisted suicide through the Oregon health plan. As one of Oregon's Senators, I cannot, on ethical, moral and other grounds, allow this to happen when I have the opportunity to prevent it. 
H.R. 1300 and Senate 304 is legislation that is not an attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court. Rather, this legislation is to determine whether we should require the American taxpayer to pay for these services through Medicare, Medicaid, the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program, health care services provided to Federal prisoners under the military health care system. 
The potential legal practice of physician-assisted suicide sets a standard for our entire Nation. We should, instead of subsidizing a path to death, try to strengthen the quality of hospice and end of life care. Let's offer support, not suicide, as the acceptable and responsible, viable option. 
Mr. President, my colleagues, it is with great concern and with a heavy heart that I ask your support in passing this important and timely legislation. Oregon is a beautiful State in which to live, to visit, to raise a family. I ask today that you do not help Oregon become a State where people now come to die. 
As I have said to the people and press of Oregon, the only thing that we should be killing around here is Federal funding for assisted suicide. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I urge their support for this legislation. 
I yield the floor and the remainder of my time.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to join 19 of my colleagues as a cosponsor of the tax limitation amendment, a proposed amendment to the Constitution to require a two-thirds vote of the House and Senate to raise taxes. 
I stand here as an elected representative of the State of Oregon. A State that last year added a three-fifths vote of its legislatures as an amendment to its State constitution in order to raise taxes. 
This requirement stipulates that when Government seeks to raise taxes, to increase what it takes out of its citizens pocketbooks, there ought to be more than a narrow agreement--and, indeed there ought to be a broad consensus. 
Oregonians believe that before there is to be an increase in taxes, there has to be a firm belief by a supermajority of its elected representatives that this is necessary. That is why we amended the State constitution to require just such a supermajority in 1996. 
Further, a two-thirds vote requirement fits with the spirit of the Federal Constitution. Supermajority voting requirements are found throughout the Constitution. Some people say to me, `Well, you don't need a supermajority voting requirement. We rule by majority in this country.' But the truth is our Founding Fathers knew there were times when it had to be otherwise. That is why in articles I, II, V, VII, VIII, IX, and XXV there are supermajority voting requirements. These are applied to things like motions to consent to a treaty, to override a Presidential veto, or to vote in the case of a Presidential disability. 
Further, the 16th amendment, which provided for the Federal income tax, had to be approved by a vote of two-thirds of Congress and three-fourths of the States. It is logical that an amendment to extend this tax burden would require a supermajority vote. 
Our Founding Fathers saw reason to check the simple majorities used in deciding issues in a democracy. In the Federalist Papers, Hamilton, Madison, and Jay all cautioned that simple majorities can lead to mob rule. 
Indeed, our Founding Fathers were particularly sensitive to protecting our citizens from unjust taxation. Indeed, our break from Great Britain stems from a fight over unjust taxation. 
Ours is a nation born out of a tax rebellion. And the spirit of that rebellion still beats in the heart of Americans. 
Now some may say we don't need this amendment because the people can simply vote against lawmakers who keep increasing taxes. 
In the Federalist Papers--Federalist 51--however, James Madison said: `A dependence on the people is no doubt the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.' And that's what this proposed amendment is: an auxiliary precaution against overtaxation. 
I believe it is imperative, now that the balanced budget amendment has been defeated, that any action to increase taxes require a supermajority of both Houses. In my opinion, without this two-thirds rule, politicians too easily fall back on tax increases in order to balance the budget. 
Really, there are just three options for balancing the budget: You can cut discretionary spending, cut entitlement spending, or you can raise taxes. 
As for No. 1--there simply isn't enough discretionary funding to cut, in order to balance the budget. 
As for No. 2--entitlement costs are spiraling out of control and each year the Clinton administration shows that it is unwilling even to educate the American people as to the hard choices that lie ahead. 
This leaves No. 3--raising taxes--as the last option. And that option is the one I would like to see made more difficult to undertake. Yet at the moment it only takes a simple majority--50 plus 1 in the Senate--to raise taxes. 
Indeed, the 1993 Clinton tax bill, the single largest tax increase in the Nation's history, passed by this slim margin of 50 Senators, plus the Vice President acting as President of the Senate. 
As I have said, many States have already passed similar legislation to make it harder to take more in taxes out of the citizen's pocketbook. This legislation works on the State level. It is needed at the Federal level. And this fact is unmistakable. 
In most of those States where a supermajority is required to raise taxes, taxes as a proportion of personal income have declined. In those States without the supermajority, taxes as a proportion of personal income have risen. 
I think most Americans believe they are already paying too much in Federal income taxes. What some call tax day--April 15--is next week. 
Let me take a moment and put things in perspective for you--how taxes have risen over the last few decades. 
What we call tax freedom day--the day that the money you earn starts going into your own pocket and not the Government's, has changed. In 1950 it was April 3. 
This year it will be sometime in mid-May. 
In fact, today the average family pays more in taxes each year than it does in food, shelter, clothing and medical care combined. 
Add up the taxes--local, State, and Federal--for most it takes half of what people make. Can't we in Government discharge our legitimate public obligations on such a percentage? I think we can, I think we should, and we must. 
I want to see our Government balance its budget. But I also want to see this trend of increasing taxation come to an end. I believe that this tax limitation amendment is the surest way to do that. 
And I urge my colleagues to support the tax limitation amendment. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the remainder of my time. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, ever since the pioneer days, when entire communities would gather to help in the building of a barn, Oregon has had a rich tradition of neighbor helping neighbor. This heritage of neighbor helping neighbor is alive and well in countless Oregon cities and towns. 
I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding example of the difference that can be made through volunteerism. The Capitol Lions Club, along with other Lions Clubs in the Salem-Keizer area, are helping our young people learn about patriotism through a project where small flags are presented to first-grade students. 
Capitol Club members buy lumber, cut it into small blocks, drill holes in the blocks, put Lions' decals on them, and place small 4- by 6-inch flags in them. Lions members then go in to classrooms, to present the flag to students, along with a presentation on the importance of a flag, and a brochure on flag history and etiquette. 
This year, 2,575 first-graders and their teachers in Oregon public and private schools will benefit from this outstanding program. As one Salem first grade teacher said, `The children are very excited to have their own little flags to take home. They have their special little places for them, I know that it is still real important to them.' 
Mr. President, I'm proud to be one of those Americans who feel something stir in my heart everytime I see our flag flying in the wind. What better way to ensure a bright future for our country than by ensuring that the timeless value of patriotism is alive and well in our young people.

 Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, my home State of Oregon lost one of its most distinguished citizens last Thursday, with the passing of George Pasero. 
For the past half century, generation after generation of Oregonians have opened up their newspaper and turned to the sports page to read what George Pasero had to say. As a reporter, columnist, and sports editor for the Oregon Journal from 1946 to 1982, and then as a part-time columnist for the Oregonian, George earned a reputation not only as a respected and keen observer of the world of sports, but as a professional, fair, and compassionate person. 
In these days where it seems that the sports world is full of million dollar salaries and million dollar egos, George Pasero liked to focus on the true joys of sports. Let me share with you some very eloquent words from one of the final columns George wrote before his death: 
`Dismiss for one evening the egomania, greed, and disrespect for authority that have so marred the high levels of professionals,' George wrote about a banquet honoring Oregon athletes. `Think here of your neighbor kid happily going out to soccer practice, all the basketball shooting you see on driveways, all the evenings of Little League and hamburger dinners, the prep football players with mud-caked uniforms on a rainy, cold Friday night.' 
Mr. President, I am just one of countless Oregonians who will miss George's insights and wisdom. Sharon joins with me in sending our condolences to his wife, Jeanne, his daughter, Anne, his sons, John, Mark, and Jim, and his five grandchildren.

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Thank you, Mr. President. I would also like to thank Senator Leahy. 
Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue that is both very controversial and personal; therefore, I do not have a prepared speech, but wish to speak from the heart. 
Much has been said here today about Senator Mark Hatfield's leadership on the issue of international family planning. In fact, I occupy the seat that Mark Hatfield sat in for more than 30 years. Like Mark Hatfield, I am pro-life. As a State Senator, I advanced pro-life legislation in the Oregon State senate, and have never been afraid to stand up for the principles of the sanctity of life. 
As a candidate in two races for the U.S. Senate in one calendar year, no other issue was brought up more frequently than the issue of abortion. As I have stated throughout my career as a legislator, I intend to continue my support of pro-life issues and to work constructively with Members on both sides of the aisle on legislation to reduce the incidence of abortion on a national and international level. 
For these reasons, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to join in my support of Senate Joint Resolution 14. While the debate on this resolution has centered on the issues relating to abortion, the underlying question is whether the $385 million that has already been appropriated for international family planning will be released on March 1, 1997 or whether it will be released on July 1, 1997. Regardless of the outcome of this vote, the money will be released. 
According to research conducted by the Guttmacher Institute, the World Health Organization, and other independent researchers, the release of these funds on March 1, 1997, will significantly reduce the incidence of abortion in developing countries that receive assistance through USAID. Therefore, as a pro-life Member of this body, I encourage my colleagues to vote yea. 
I understand and share the concerns of those who have suggested that this money is being spent for abortion services. This concerns me greatly, particularly as the law of the United States prohibits the use of Federal funds for abortion services. To address these concerns, I reviewed the USAID audits and am assured that this funding is in fact being used for family planning services, not abortion. For this reason, I also encourage a yea vote. 
In addition to sharing my support for this resolution, I would also like to take a moment to express my frustration on this issue. While I certainly respect those who may not support my pro-life position, I am so often disappointed that there is little effort to educate about the options to abortion and ways to make abortion less frequent. The focus is often on the legal and the safe but never the rare. Similar frustration stems from those who advocate for life. It is unfortunate that the effort to advocate and encourage family planning does not equal the effort to discourage abortion. Today, we have the opportunity to address this inequity and to encourage and protect family planning both nationally and internationally. This is a vote to support life, and tomorrow I will vote as my predecessor Mark Hatfield, in favor of this resolution. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.
