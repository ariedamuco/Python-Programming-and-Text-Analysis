 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I very much regret that once again--for the 3rd Congress, that's six years--the Congress has refused to take action on brownfields legislation because of unrelated and very controversial issues related to the Superfund program. 
As I have for three Congresses, on the very first day of the 105th Congress, along with ten other Senators, I introduced S. 18, a bill to encourage brownfields revitalization efforts. Brownfields are abandoned, or idle, former industrial properties which may or may not be contaminated. Brownfields exist in cities, suburbs and rural areas. Their reuse can result in badly needed jobs and significant revenues along with environmental cleanup of hundreds of thousands of communities across the country. One section of S. 18 established an exemption from potential Superfund liability for developers who clean up brownfields but had nothing to do with any contamination that might be present. These provisions merely clarified that Congress did not intend the specter of Superfund liability to deter the purchase and redevelopment of brownfields properties. This simple clarification has long enjoyed broad-based, bipartisan support. 
Mr. President, on November 7, 1997, I also introduced S. 1497. This bill is in some ways analogous to the brownfields bill, in that it provides an exemption from Superfund liability for homeowners, small businesses, and non-profit organizations which sent only municipal solid waste to Superfund sites. 
Mr. President, S. 1497 was, so to speak, dedicated to Barbara Williams, and all those like her, who got caught up unfairly in a litigation web that the Congress never intended when Superfund was written. Barbara Williams is the owner of Sunny Ray Restaurant. Ms. Williams was sued and asked to pay for cleanup of a Superfund site, though she only disposed of mashed potatoes and other restaurant waste at that site. She has testified before the Environment and Public Works Committee twice. 
Mr. President, I find it appalling that this woman was stuck in a Superfund lawsuit, brought by industries that had polluted the site but did not want to pay to clean up their mess. S. 1497 included a provision clarifying that Congress did not intend parties such as homeowners, pizza parlor owners, or girl scouts--that disposed only of household, or household-like trash--to be subject to suit under Superfund. Like brownfields liability exemptions, these exemptions for innocent parties enjoy broad, longstanding, bipartisan support. 
Mr. President, this is the third consecutive Congress we have negotiated comprehensive Superfund reform, but failed to pass legislation. In the 103rd Congress, the Committee marked up a comprehensive Superfund reform bill that boasted unusually broad-based support, and reported it out on an 13:4 vote. But for reasons which had little to do with Superfund, for reasons that were blatantly political, the bill was not enacted into law. In the 104th Congress, consensus evaporated, and the Republican Majority introduced comprehensive reform bills that can only be described as extreme. In the 105th Congress, the parties got closer, yet, despite the hundreds of hours of work by our staffs, did not get close enough. I personally spent weeks negotiating painstaking details of this complex statute. But unfortunately, rather than resolve remaining differences, the Committee elected to proceed to a partisan mark-up. Indeed, it reported its Superfund bill, S. 8, almost entirely along party lines, with the vote on final passage at 11:7. 
Mr. President, the Committee may or may not take up comprehensive reform again in the 106th Congress. Given GAO's August, 1998 report finding that EPA has already selected remedies at 95% of non-federal Superfund sites, I question whether this effort is at all worthwhile. But the battle lines are beginning to be drawn. It is reported that some are urging industry to spend as much as did the tobacco industry--some $40 million--to have their way. 
But while my Republican colleagues persist in an all or nothing strategy, I urge that this body be cognizant of the price exacted by this approach. This posture essentially takes our nation's cities and small businesses as hostages in a war over Superfund. And the consequences are very real. 
The nation's Mayors estimate they lose between $200 and $500 million a year in tax revenues from brownfields sitting idle, and that returning these sites to productive use could create some 236,000 new jobs. They, as well as developers and bankers, say immediate action is imperative, since new tax laws provide incentives for brownfields redevelopment, but expire in 2001. In short, the window is narrow during which brownfields reform will make any difference at all. Each day Congress fails to act on brownfields liability, it deprives our cities of unique redevelopment opportunities. 
And as for municipal solid waste, as Mrs. Williams testified, neither her lawyer's fees nor her settlement costs are covered by insurance, nor are they business expenses she can deduct. She must make enough money to pay these penalties on top of her other bills and her payroll. Each day Congress fails to free Barbara Williams and requires that she pay still more lawyers' fees, Congress adds to her burden, or as she testified, expands the `cloud' cast over her head. 
Mr. President, I submit that holding these non-controversial, practical and entirely beneficial bills hostage to an ideological fight over the Superfund program is not in the public interest. I am very disappointed that for the sixth year in a row, we withheld action on legislation that could provide enormous benefits to the public. This is what gives government a bad name.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I support this resolution, which is essentially a technical change that will facilitate enforcement of the Budget Act in the Senate. 
This resolution would update the following figures for purposes of enforcing points of order in the Senate only. First, aggregates for revenues, budget authority, outlays, and Social Security revenues and outlays. Second, Section 302(a) allocations for Senate committees. 
The resolution does not include functional totals or reconciliation instructions. It would not endorse the spending priorities included in the Senate-passed resolution, or any other spending priorities, for that matter. Also, it would not apply to the House of Representatives. It therefore it not a budget resolution in any sense. 
The allocations and aggregates in this resolution are based on CBO's August baseline estimates, updated for enacted legislation and some technical corrections. The resolution is based on legislation enacted as of today. However, it includes a provision allowing the Chairman to revise the aggregates and allocations once more based only on legislation enacted through the end of the session. This means that each committee, and the Senate paygo ledger, will start the year with a clean slate. 
Mr. President, since Congress has not adopted a budget resolution for FY99, the Senate is now operating under the budget resolution approved last year for FY98 and beyond. This has the effect of limiting the availability of points of order to enforce the basic rules of the Balanced Budget Agreement. 
For example, when the Senate considers legislation proposing revenue reductions or new mandatory spending, the Senate's `pay-as-you-go' rules require that all costs be offset in the first, the first five, and the second five years of the budget resolution in effect at the time. Since we are now operating under last year's resolution, there is now no point of order available based on the failure of such legislation, for example, to offset all costs in the first year after enactment. This resolution would address this problem. 
So, Mr. President, I support this resolution. It is not a budget resolution. It does not propose a set of spending priorities. It is simply a technical change that will help us enforce the basic structure of the Budget Enforcement Act.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the confirmation of Cardell Cooper to be the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. I thank the members of the Banking Committee, Chairman D'Amato, and Ranking Member Sarbanes for moving Mr. Cooper's nomination swiftly through the Committee. 
Mr. Cooper served with distinction as mayor of East Orange, New Jersey from 1990 to 1997. Prior to serving as mayor, from 1988 to 1990, Mr. Cooper was County Administrator for Essex County, where he was responsible for day-to-day management of the one of the largest and most urban counties in New Jersey. 
As a mayor and county administrator, Mr. Cooper was on the front lines. His practical experience, coupled with his passion for public service, makes him an excellent choice for this post. He knows the critical difference that development programs can make to communities and their residents, and the importance of forging strong partnerships between local, state and federal governments. His commitment to local economic development programs serving our young people, such as YouthBuild, and urban environmental initiatives, such as the brownfields program, will fuel his efforts to help our urban leaders succeed. Through his work with the Conference of Mayors, he has built solid relationships with mayors across the country and enjoys bipartisan support. His endorsement by the Conference of Mayors is a testament to the leadership he has provided. 
Mr. President, while professional experience and particular skills are important for effective service, Cardell Cooper has the personal strengths and attributes the Senate looks for in nominees to high posts. He is an energetic leader, with a strong work ethic and a deep commitment to public service and the mission of the Department. I can personally attest to his integrity and ability to work well within a larger organization. 
Mr. President, I hope the full Senate will act expeditiously to confirm Cardell Cooper as HUD's new Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to convey to the full Senate my overwhelming support for the confirmation of Harold Lucas to be the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) new Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. I especially want to thank Chairman D'Amato and Ranking Member Sarbanes, and all the members of the Senate Banking Committee, for moving Mr. Lucas' nomination so quickly through the Committee. 
Mr. Lucas has first-hand knowledge of the challenges facing our nation's public housing authorities. Prior to his nomination, Mr. Lucas served as Executive Director of the Housing Authority of the City of Newark, New Jersey. When Mr. Lucas took hold of the reins at the Housing Authority in 1992, HUD considered it to be a `troubled' agency, and had given it failing grades since its creation in the 1970s. Within two years of taking over, Mr. Lucas turned things around. Last year, the agency received a 94 percent rating--an A in anyone's book--and is now considered one of the top performing housing agencies in both New Jersey and the nation. 
During his tenure, Mr. Lucas tore down many dilapidated high-rise buildings and replaced them with more attractive townhouse-style housing that provides a better quality of life for tenants and improves the neighborhoods that surround it. 
Mr. Lucas' dedication to helping public housing residents achieve self-sufficiency, and his strong commitment to ensuring the safety and viability of our public housing stock, are testament to his qualifications for this position. I am confident that our nation's housing authorities will be well served by having someone as dynamic and experienced as Mr. Lucas at the helm. 
Mr. President, I therefore urge the full Senate to conform, without delay, Mr. Lucas to be HUD's new Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would first like to commend and thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for their work to ensure our Nation's continued strong commitment to our children and families tragically infected with HIV by providing support for Title IV of the Ryan White CARE Act. Title IV programs are designed to coordinate health care and assure that it is focused on families' needs and based in their communities. These programs are the providers of care to the majority of children, youth, and families with HIV/AIDS in our country, ensuring these families have access to the comprehensive array of services they need. A portion of Title IV funds may be used to provide peer-based training and technical assistance through national organizations that collaborate with projects to ensure development of innovative models of family centered and youth centered care; advanced provider training for pediatric, adolescent, and family HIV providers; coordination with research programs, and other technical assistance activities. 
The Senate report stated that the Committee intends for the Department to continue its Title IV support of the National Pediatric and Family HIV Resource Center located within the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. The Title IV funding needed to support the Center's work is $1.1 million per year. Is it correct that the managers intend for the Department to continue to support the National Pediatric and Family HIV Resource Center?

As the author of the original provision, Mr. President, I can assure my colleagues that it was my intention that state sponsors of terrorist acts against Americans pay the price for their deeds set by U.S. courts. I did not include a waiver because I don't believe countries which sponsor terrorism should be shielded from these judgements. On the interpretation of the waiver added in conference, I would have to rely on the Senator from North Carolina and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my pleasure that legislation providing permanent residency in the United States for 13-year-old Vova Malofienko and his family, residents of Short Hills, NJ, passed the Senate. Vova Malofienko has leukemia from his having lived 30 miles from the Chornobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine during and after the infamous disaster. His leukemia is in remission only because of the emergency medical treatment he's received in the United States. 
Were Vova forced to return to Ukraine, the United States would be placing an innocent child near the front of the line on death row. Vova was one of eight children of Chornobyl who came to the United States in 1990--and when the seven others later returned to Ukraine, they died one by one because of inadequate cancer treatment. Not a child survived. 
On behalf of the Malofienkos, I thank my colleagues for their invaluable support of this legislation. We are a compassionate nation that has opened its heart to Vova and his family, who came in dire medical need. 
 Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to tell my colleagues a bit more about Vova and his family. Vladimir `Vova' Malofienko was born on June 29, 1984 in Chernigov, Ukraine. His mother, Olga Matsko, was born on September 29, 1959 in Piratin, Ukraine, and his father, Alexander Malofienko, was born on December 25, 1957 in Chernigov, Ukraine. 
Vova was only 2 when the Chornobyl reactor exploded in 1986 and exposed him to radiation. He was diagnosed with leukemia in June 1990 at age 6. Vova and his mother came to the United States later in 1990 on a B-1 visitor's visa so that Vova could attend a cancer treatment camp for children, sponsored by the Children of Chornobyl Relief Fund. Vova was invited to stay in the United States to receive more extensive treatment and chemotherapy. In November of 1992, Vova's cancer went into remission. Vova's father, Alexander Malofienko joined the family in 1992, also on a B-1 visa. 
Vova and his family have wanted to remain in the United States because of the extraordinary health concerns facing Vova. Regrettably, as I mentioned earlier, Vova is the only survivor from a group of eight children of Chornobyl who came to the United States together in 1990. The seven other children returned to Ukraine and have since died. Now that Vova is in remission, it would indeed be tragic to return him to an environment which would once again endanger his life. The air, food, and water in Ukraine are contaminated with radiation that people residing there for several years have grown accustomed to, but which could be perilous to Vova's weakened immune system. 
Furthermore, treatment available in Ukraine is not as sophisticated and up to date as treatment available in the United States. Before Vova came to the United States, no aggressive treatment for his leukemia had been provided. Although Vova completed his chemotherapy in 1992, he continues to need medical follow-up on a consistent basis, including physical examinations, lab work and radiological examinations to assure early detection and prompt and appropriate therapy in the unfortunate event the leukemia recurs. 
According to Dr. Peri Kamalakar, Director of the Valerie Fund Children's Center at Newark Beth Israel hospital, where Vova has received care, Vova's cancer is considered high risk with a threat of relapse. He is also at risk to develop significant later complications secondary to the intensive chemotherapy he received, including heart problems and secondary cancers. Another significant risk is relapse in the bone marrow, testis, or central nervous system. Dr. Kamalakar has concluded that Vova's chance for a permanent cure is considerably better if he stays in the United States. 
I am pleased that this bill has passed today. It is now up to the House of Representatives to send this bill to the President and allow Vova and his family to remain in the United States. Finally, I would like to thank all of the Senators, from both sides of the aisle, who were involved in negotiations on these private relief bills.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I, too thank Senator Snowe, Senator McCain, Majority Leader Lott, and Senators Hollings and Breaux for their assistance on this important economic development initiative. The program will involve the development of an environmentally sound method for dismantling the Navy's many decommissioned vessels. Camden Iron and Metal, a critical partner in this initiative, intends to transport pieces of the Navy's ships on the barge from the shipyard to its facility in Camden for further processing. It is a very important project in the city of Camden and I am grateful for their help. I recognize that discussions are under way with the House regarding the Coast Guard authorization and want to ask the chairman for a commitment to giving this provision priority consideration in those discussions.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this is one of those moments that one feels a bit overwhelmed--to follow Dale Bumpers in a discourse that he gives here on the floor. This is a task that I never liked--to get on the floor after Dale Bumpers moved us with his oratory and described his feelings for this institution and our responsibility. But there is another reason that I am really feeling uneasy; that is, the prospect that this place will be without Dale's voice, without his wit, his humor, but more importantly, his commitment to the people of this country. 
I want you to know, Dale, what a sacrifice I make today. I decided to stay here rather than to go to a budget conference down the hall trying to wrestle with the issues of the day. So I sacrificed that time just so I could stand on this floor to hear your terminal speech. That is devotion and friendship, I assume. 
I have to say that one could see the position that Dale has earned over the years, because people were as generous and as warm and as friendly from the other side of the aisle. That doesn't mean that we always agree, and it doesn't mean that we always share a similar direction for our country. 
But Dale has succeeded in winning friends, in making sure that we never forgot about who it is we are here to serve. We could make lots of jokes, but one never wants to compete with Dale's humor. I think about the only close match was with Dale Bumpers and Alan Simpson. That was a good team. The jokes were always better when we were off the floor somehow. But beyond the wit, beyond the humor, beyond the jokes was always this incredible pursuit of what is right for our country and what is right for our people. 
I have submitted a written statement without the kind of eloquence I wish I could have borrowed from Dale. He was right, he was accurate when he said his impression of his IQ was overblown. All of us agree with that. 
We know Dale well. We love him. We love to tease him a little bit. There were very few times on this floor when Dale could not get attention from others, and it wasn't just the volume; it was the substance of his mission that we all paid attention to. They kid him about stretching the cord that holds our microphones, but everybody was anxious to hear what Dale had to say or read what was in the Record. 
So I just wanted to have a chance to say how pleased I am for the opportunity to be here at the last speech Senator Dale Bumpers was going to make in this Chamber. It has been an honor to serve with Dale as well as to serve with people such as John Glenn. John Glenn is one of the finest people who, it is fair to say, has ever left this Earth. But we are going to see John Glenn at the end of the month and witness his heroic and incredible mission into the sky. John Glenn was with me when I was sworn into the Senate. We happened to be in Colorado on a vacation just 16 years ago, and he stood while I found a magistrate to swear me in because there was an opportunity based on the resignation of the then-appointed Senator. 
At the same time we are saying goodbye to Wendell Ford. Wendell is someone who you could fight with, get your blood pressure up, more often than not you would lose the argument and lose the debate. But Wendell Ford got things done. And I want to tell you, if I had to be served by a Senator, I would want that Senator to have the same concern about my State and my well-being and my family and my future as did Wendell Ford. He never let an opportunity go by without defending his people and the State of Kentucky. Although we disagreed on lots of occasions, I always walked away with a high degree of affection and respect for Wendell Ford. 
So when I listen to Dale Bumpers summarize his life, I think about where we are, because too often the arguments here overtake the purpose of our functioning. But Dale Bumpers, Senator Dale Bumpers reminds us that the mission is almost a holy one and that we have to step back and take a deep breath and get down to the business of the American people. 
I wish to thank the Democratic leader for giving me these few minutes. I also wanted to take an opportunity to say so long to Senator Dan Coats. Dan Coats was a formidable opponent for me when New Jersey persisted in sending its trash out to Indiana where it was welcomed by the communities that had the certified landfills and all that. But Dan Coats didn't object when New Jersey sent its All-American football players to Notre Dame or to the University of Indiana. But serving with Dan also has been a privilege. 
Mr. President, I wrap up just by saying that Dale Bumpers, if you listened to his words, arrived here encouraged by a father who saw the value of Government service, and it is an interesting and touching explanation of what it is that provided his motivation. My father also motivated me to engage in whatever enterprise I could to serve the public. But he didn't know it then. He worked. He tried to survive with his family during the lean and tough years, ashamed that he had to resort to a job with the WPA. I will never forget how discouraged he was when he came home, but, he said, he needed the job; he had to feed his family. My father died at the age of 43, after a year of illness with cancer. I had already enlisted in the Army. He disintegrated in front of our eyes, leaving not only an empty house but an empty wallet. My mother had to work. I had to send home my allotment to help pay the bills that were accumulated during that period of time. 
But we both got here because we were encouraged by things that occurred in our families, messages that were sent by our parents, mine perhaps less articulate than the one I heard Dale Bumpers describe. But we are here because they were able to give us that opportunity and we are here because we want to serve, to do something, to give something back as a result of having that opportunity. 
To Senator Dale Bumpers and the others, we say farewell. This place will be a lesser place without your presence, but because of your presence this place will continue to gain strength and to do what we have to do for the future. Rest assured that America will be strong. It will be different forces and different faces, but the work will continue to be done here. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to an American hero, a great Senator and a wonderful friend--Senator John Glenn. Senator Glenn is retiring after serving the people of Ohio for four terms. 
But his service to our country did not begin in the Senate, nor will it end here. Senator Glenn served in the Marine Corps during World War II and fought in combat in the South Pacific. He also fought with valor in the Korean conflict and ended up flying 149 missions in both wars. He has received numerous honors including six Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with 18 clusters. 
He later became a test pilot and set a transcontinental speed record in 1957 for this first flight to average supersonic speed from Los Angeles to New York. In 1959, he was selected to be one of seven astronauts in the space program. Three years later, he made history as the first American to orbit the earth, completing a 5 hour, three orbit flight. 
His heroism inspired me and all of the American people. He received the Space Congressional Medal of Honor for his service. 
After 23 years in military service, he retired in 1965 and went into the private sector. Despite his outstanding service to his country, it was not enough for John Glenn. He ran for the Senate in 1974 and is now completing his 24th year. 
Despite his fame, Senator Glenn was a workhorse, not a showhorse in the Senate. He took on complicated issues like nuclear proliferation, troop readiness, government ethics, civil service reform and campaign finance reform. He did his work with great diligence and thoroughness, with his eye on accomplishment not partisanship. 
If you add his 23 years of military service to his 24 years of Service to the people of Ohio, that is 47 years of dedication to our nation. 
But even this is not enough for John Glenn. On October 29th of this year, he will return to space on a shuttle mission. He will be the oldest person ever to travel in space but even then his journey will not be over. 
He will continue to represent the best of the American spirit and be an informal ambassador for scientific exploration. 
I wish him, his wife Annie, his children and grandchildren the very best for the future.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an extraordinary person, a respected and honorable man, a true friend, and one whom I am truly saddened to see leave the Senate--Senator Dale Bumpers. 
Mr. President, Senator Bumpers is, more than most, a true advocate for the citizens of the United States. I know of no better person who embraces issues with the passion and intellect that he demonstrates. His oratory skills are well-known and rarely matched. Dale is a true champion of the public's interests, and particularly when that clashes with special interests. 
Throughout his decades of public service, as Governor of Arkansas and United States Senator, Senator Bumpers has carried with him a strong, unyielding belief in a few basic ideas, ideas that have driven him in his tireless efforts to make our country--and the world--a better place. 
Senator Bumpers believes in ensuring equal opportunities for all, including the poor and indigent. He believes in providing high quality, comprehensive education and health care. He believes in the sanctity of our Constitution. He believes in the value of the arts and humanities in developing human creativity and a national culture. He believes in the importance of environmental conservation and preserving our natural resources. He believes in eliminating needless corporate subsidies and reducing wasteful defense spending. And he believes in the need to slow the growing gap between the rich and the poor. 
Senator Bumpers has never shied away from taking on the powerful special interests, year after year, even when he knows the odds are stacked against him and he is often disappointed with the results. But he has kept on trying. 
We have all been witnesses to his eloquent and powerful discourses on a number of subjects. Every one of his presentations before us and before the country have been grounded in personal experience and intellectual strength. When Senator Bumpers speaks, we know that he speaks from his heart. 
Mr. President, in 1995, the Senate debated an amendment that would require zero tolerance for youth who had any amount of alcohol in their blood. Senator Bumpers revealed his personal story about his parents and their friend who were killed by a drunk driver while returning from their small farm, just across the Arkansas River. Senator Bumpers was in law school at the time, far away in Chicago. 
Dale, more than most, has the power to sway with his words. That amendment was swiftly adopted. 
Mr. President, also three years ago, the Senate was considering an amendment to add funds to the National Endowment for the Humanities. Now, the NEH is a small agency that can, and does, often come under the budget knife as an insignificant agency. Not to Senator Bumpers. Senator Bumpers took to the Senate floor, and told all of us about his high school English teacher, Miss Doll Means. He touched us with a personal story that was a turning point in his life. When he was a sophomore, Miss Doll Means told him, after he had read a page of `Beowulf" that he had a nice voice and he read beautifully. That one statement, from an English teacher in a town of 1,000 people, did more for his self-esteem than anybody, except, he said, his father. Not only does he indeed have a nice voice and he reads beautifully, he is among the best orators this Senate has ever seen. 
Mr. President, earlier this year during the Appropriations Committee passed an amendment naming a vaccine center at NIH after Dale and Betty Bumpers. For almost 30 years, the two of them have worked tirelessly on a crusade to vaccinate all children--and because of their efforts and others, we have made great progress toward that goal. 
Mr. President, when the Senior Senator from Arkansas leaves this body in a few weeks, there will be a noticeable void. We will lose a tireless champion for the underserved; a champion for the public's interest; a champion for responsible spending, not wasteful spending; and a champion for equal opportunity, for our environment, and for the arts and humanities. Senator Bumpers has our respect, and he has the people's respect. We will miss him. 
Mr. President, I wish my friend and his wife Betty, their children and grandchildren the very best for the future.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President I rise today to pay tribute to our esteemed colleague from Kentucky, the Minority Whip, Senator Wendell H. Ford. I wish him well. All of us know that we have not heard the last from this dedicated and effective public servant. 
His retirement from the Senate will end a formal career of public service to the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the United States which has lasted over three decades. After first serving in the Kentucky Senate, he was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1967 and then Governor of Kentucky in 1971. In 1974, he was elected to serve in the United States Senate. 
Mr. President, in the history of this body, few Senators have protected the interests of his or her state as doggedly as Wendell Ford. 
Whether the issue was aviation, tobacco, telecommunications or farm legislation, Senator Ford has always put the people of Kentucky first. And even though we have disagreed on a key issue or two, I know that he is guided by what he believes is best for the people of his state. 
As the senior Senator from Kentucky put it himself: `If it ain't good for Kentucky, it ain't good for Wendell Ford.' 
And the people of Kentucky have shown their deep appreciation to Senator Ford in return. In 1992, he received the largest number of votes ever recorded by a candidate for elected office in the Commonwealth. 
In March of this year, he became the longest serving United States Senator from Kentucky in history. 
Mr. President, although New Jersey and Kentucky are very different states, Senator Ford and I share many things in common. First of all, our vintage--we were born in the same year. We both fought for our country in World War II. We both ran businesses before we entered public life. 
These common experiences helped make Wendell Ford an instant friend and mentor to me when I arrived in the Senate. His extensive knowledge and public service experience has made him an invaluable asset to our caucus' leadership. 
And he has been quite a leader, now as Minority Whip, first as Chairman and then Ranking Member of the Rules Committee, and in prior years, the Chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. 
Mr. President, Senator Ford has left a formidable legacy to the nation as a whole, in addition to his legendary status in Kentucky. He was the chief sponsor of the National Voter Registration Act, also known as the `motor voter' law. 
This law helps ensure that more of our citizens are officially registered to participate in our democracy. He was also instrumental in the enactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act Amendments of 1986, and many other landmark aviation and energy laws. 
The Senior Senator from Kentucky will be greatly missed here in the United States Senate. We will miss his leadership, his experience and also his great wit. But our personal loss will be the Commonwealth of Kentucky's gain. 
I wish him, his wife Jean, their children and grandchildren Godspeed as he returns to Owensboro.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the distinguished Senator from Indiana, Dan Coats. While he has only been in the Senate ten years, he has made an important contribution. One example is the work he put into developing the historic, bipartisan Family and Medical Leave Act. 
Mr. President, believe it or not, even though I am a Democrat from the Northeast and Senator Coats is a Republican from the Midwest, we have worked together on legislation. Senator Coats has consistently fought to improve the lives of our nation's children. This commitment led him to join me in support of the Juvenile Mentoring Program--otherwise know as JUMP. This program supports mentoring programs across the country, including Big Brothers and Big Sisters. We have fought together for funding and reauthorizing the program because we share the belief that all children can succeed if we lend a helping hand. 
Senator Coats also became a leading expert in the Senate on military issues as a member of the Armed Services Committee. He also worked hard on education and poverty legislation as a member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. 
Mr. President, during Senator Coats' tenure in the Senate, we did have disagreements over policy issues. One environmental issue consistently put the State of Indiana at odds with the State of New Jersey. We always had a vigorous debate when this issue came to the floor. Despite our differences, he showed me great respect and courtesy during these deliberations. I left these debates with a great respect for his energy and determination to help his state. 
Mr. President, I wish Senator Coats, his wife Marcia, and their children and grandchildren the very best for the future. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased that key members of the Senate have agreed to pass all the pending private relief bills in one package and send it over to the House. 
I would like to thank the principals who have been involved in this effort, Senators Hatch, Abraham, Leahy and Kennedy. This package will include my bill to help Vova Malofienko. 
Let me tell you a little about Vova Malofienko and his family. Vova was born in Chernigov, Ukraine, just 30 miles from the Chornobyl nuclear reactor. 
In 1986, when he was just two, the reactor exploded and he was exposed to high levels of radiation. He was diagnosed with leukemia in June 1990, shortly before his sixth birthday. 
Through the efforts of the Children of Chornobyl Relief Fund, Vova and his mother came to the United States with seven other children to attend Paul Newman's `Hole in the Wall' camp in Connecticut. 
While in this country, Vova was able to receive extensive cancer treatment and chemotherapy. In November of 1992, his cancer went into remission. 
Regrettably, the other children from Chornobyl were not as fortunate. They returned to the Ukraine and they died one by one because of inadequate cancer treatment. Not a child survived. 
The air, food, and water in the Ukraine are still contaminated with radiation and are perilous to those like Vova who have a weakened immune system. 
Additionally, cancer treatment available in the Ukraine is not as sophisticated as treatment available in the United States. 
Although Vova completed his chemotherapy in 1992, he continues to need medical follow-up on a consistent basis, including physical examinations, lab work and radiological examinations to assure early detection and prompt and appropriate therapy in the unfortunate event the leukemia recurs. 
Because of his perilous medical condition, Vova and his family have done everything possible to remain in the United States. Since 1992, they have obtained a number of visa extensions, and I have helped them with their efforts. 
In March of 1997, the last time the Malofienkos visas were expiring, I appealed to the INS and the family was given what I was told would be final one-year extension. 
So we have a family battling for over six years now, to stay in this country. And why? So that they can save the life of their child, Vova. 
Because of the compelling circumstances of their case, I introduced S. 1460, which was approved unanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
After I introduced that bill, Senator Abraham, in his capacity as Chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, requested a report from the INS and that stayed any further INS proceedings. 
But at the end of this Congress they would be subject to deportation. That is why I have worked so hard to get this bill passed this session of Congress. 
This family has endured enough. They cannot have the threat of deportation hanging over their heads. They are dealing with enough trauma from Vova's cancer. 
I wish my colleagues could meet Vova--then they would understand why I feel so strongly about this case. He is truly a remarkable young man. 
Throughout his battle against cancer, he has been an inspiration. He has been an honors student at Millburn Middle School, and he is an eloquent spokesperson for children with cancer. He has rallied the community and helped bring out the best in everyone. His dedication, grace, and dignity provide an outstanding example, not just to young people, but to all Americans. 
Again, I want to thank Senators Hatch, Abraham, Leahy and Kennedy for their diligence. 
I hope that we will pass this package on Monday and send it to the House and then the President. Then, Vova can continue his fight in the safety of United States.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we live in a world where it is increasingly difficult to protect our children. The advent of sophisticated computer technology has made it too easy for depraved criminals to gather information about children and prey upon them. And nothing is more heinous and reprehensible than the brutalization of a child. We cannot be too vigilant in the battle against child predators. 
I am pleased that today, with the passage of the Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act, the Senate is marching forward in this fight. This legislation will provide tough punishment for those who would sexually abuse the youth of our Nation. 
This measure contains an important provision, the Joan's Law Act, that Senator Torricelli and I originally introduced as a separate bill. This measure is based on a New Jersey law, which was named after a 7-year-old-girl, Joan D'Alessandro. Tragically, Joan was raped and killed in 1973. Although her murderer was convicted of the crime and sentenced to 20 years in State prison, he has become eligible for parole and continues to seek his release. 
Joan's family has repeatedly had to fight against parole for this vicious killer. They have been forced to relive this tragedy again and again, as they try to ensure that others are protected from the terrible horror they have suffered. 
Joan's law will spare other families from these battles. It provides that, unless the death sentenced is imposed, any criminal convicted of a sexual offense that results in the death of a minor under the age of 14 will be sentenced to life imprisonment. With this effort, we will ensure that cold-blooded murderers who abuse our children will be kept behind bars for the rest of their lives. 
Mr. President, I wish that we could do more to alleviate the pain and trauma suffered by the D'Alessandro family. With profound courage and dignity, they have endured so much for so long. Their relentless battle for justice, and their tireless efforts to protect others is an inspiration to us all. I am deeply heartened that Congress has passed this legislative memorial to Joan.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join in support of the Water Resources Development Act of 1998, one of the most important public works measures before the Senate. This important measure was approved this summer by the Committee on Environment and Public Works, on which I serve. 
This legislation includes authorizations for numerous water resources projects important to my state. Three shoreline protection projects which will protect property, wildlife habitat, and contribute to New Jersey's coastal economy are authorized to proceed to construction. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that this Committee has addressed a serious policy disagreement with the Administration over funding for shore protection projects. For the past five years, the Administration has requested no funding for new shore protection studies and has underfunded the construction work of ongoing projects. This year, the Administration proposed modifying the cost-share for shore protection projects to require the states and localities to finance the majority--65 percent, of the costs of periodic renourishment. This activity is the most expensive portion of the project, since these projects generally receive 3-5 year renourishments over their 50-year period. 
I disagreed with this approach because I believed that it was unfair to those communities that had planned for these projects and expected a true partnership with the federal government. During the consideration of this bill in Committee, I offered an amendment to allow us to phase in a more reasonable cost-sharing formula for shore protection projects. Those projects which have a feasibility study completed by the end of 1998 or which are authorized to proceed to construction in this bill, will continue to be covered by the 65/35 cost-share formula through the life of the projects, just as all flood control projects are cost-shared. Those projects authorized subsequently will continue to receive the 65/35 cost-share formula for the initial construction. However, states will be required to provide 50 percent--just five percent more of the costs--for periodic renourishment. While I was disappointed that we could not maintain the current cost share for all projects, I believe that the committee's proposal is fairer to the communities and states that have planned for these projects. We have authorized many shore protection projects that have only moved forward because of the efforts of Congress. I sincerely hope that our action today moves the Administration forward to begin planning and budgeting for these projects. 
The bill also provides necessary authorization adjustments for projects critical to the movement of cargo through the Port of New York and New Jersey as proposed by Senator Moynihan and I. The port annually handles 1.4 million containers and 30 billion gallons of petroleum products and is the gateway to a thriving economy for New Jersey, New York, and the entire country. By the year 2010, experts predict that 90 percent of all liner freight will be shipped in containers. The bill's amendments are important to addressing the increasing cost of dredged material disposal in light of the moratorium on ocean disposal. 
In addition, the bill authorizes flood control studies important to numerous communities in my state. The bill provides for a study of flood control measures in the Repaupo Creek. This waterway contains a deteriorating 76-year old floodgate, which, if breached, threatens the communities of Greenwich, East Greenwich, Harrison, and Logan, Mantua, and Woolwich. Another important study of the Delaware River streams and watersheds in Camden and Gloucester Counties is authorized in the bill. The bill also includes a study of navigational needs along the Fortescue Inlet of the Delaware Bay. 
Mr. President, the State of New Jersey, local governments and regional authorities have been carefully planning and budgeting for the critical projects that this bill authorizes. Any further delays could have an adverse impact on the economies of regions that are affected by these projects. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
I want to thank the Chairman, Senator Chafee, the Ranking Member, Senator Baucus, and the Subcommittee Chairman, Senator Warner, and their staff members for their hard work on this bill. The members of the committee staff, including Dan Delich, Ann Loomis, and Jo-Ellen Darcy were extremely helpful and professional, putting in many long hours to produce a bill that benefits communities across the country.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to clarify a section in the statement of the managers accompanying the VA-HUD conference report. The language urges EPA not to spend any funds or require any parties to dredge contaminated sediments until completion of a National Academy of Sciences report on dredging technology. The report may take two years to complete. It is my understanding that the language is not intended to limit EPA's authority during the next two years with respect to dredging contaminated sediments that pose a substantial threat to public health or the environment where EPA has found that dredging is an appropriate response action.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my great concern about the Year 2000 computer problem, and to urge that funding be approved on an emergency basis to address this problem. 
Mr. President, in less than 500 days, an unknown number of computers around the world will fail because they can't tell the difference between the year 1900 and the year 2000. Although this may seem like a minor problem that could be easily fixed, it is not. It's time consuming, difficult, and expensive to address. And the implications of failure are enormous. 
We have known about the Year 2000 problem for some time, Mr. President, but many have failed to appreciate its severity. Throughout the private and public sectors, top officials assumed that someone else would find a solution. Or they simply did not appreciate the importance of making this problem a priority. 
Fortunately, Mr. President, many in the private sector are now taking this threat seriously. One Federal Reserve official speculated that private sector spending on the problem could exceed $50 billion. While many small businesses are just beginning to face the problem, most major large businesses are acting aggressively. Banks, utilities, hospitals, factories, insurance companies, and railroads are scrambling to ensure that they will be ready. Many understand that this truly is an emergency, and they're treating it that way. 
Still, I am afraid that most Americans still do not appreciate the severity of the Y2K problem. And I would urge all those listening to educate themselves about it. Admittedly, it is very difficult for most of us to evaluate the risks. But many credible experts have discussed scenarios that are truly alarming. 
Consider, for example, the impact of the Y2K problem on public utilities. Senators Bennett and Dodd, the co-chairs of the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, have held a hearing on this, and I commend both of them for their leadership. Their Committee surveyed major utilities and found that many are far from ready for the year 2000. The Committee's work raises very serious questions about the risks of major power outages throughout our country, and the impact of such outages on our financial and telecommunications systems. Indeed, the essential infrastructure of our nation could be at risk. 
Largely because of such threats, some economists have argued that the Year 2000 problem is likely to lead to a severe recession. Some see a parallel to the downturn of the 1970's when oil supplies were disrupted. In fact, quick and reliable computing may be even more important to our economy than oil was two decades ago. Without reliable computer information, as without oil, production and distribution systems could break down. And that could dramatically increase unemployment, interest rates and inflation, all at the same time. 
Now, Mr. President, I'm not saying that this is bound to happen. Experts disagree about the likelihood of major economic and social dislocations. However, even if the odds of a significant breakdown are modest, the potential enormity of the problem demands that we take it seriously. 
I do know from my own experience that software problems can be terribly serious and difficult to address. Before I came to public life, I was an executive in a computer services firm, a firm that has been quite successful. I can tell you that nothing is more vexing than a seemingly insignificant software glitch that grinds an entire program to a halt. Fixing such a glitch can require laborious, line-by-line examination of impenetrable computer code. Meanwhile, everything is often brought to a standstill. 
While analysts may disagree about the scope of the Y2K problem, Mr. President, it does seem clear that some things will go wrong on January 1, 2000. We just can't say exactly which, or how many. Compounding matters, even if one system has had its Y2K problems fixed, it still can be corrupted by interacting with other systems that are flawed. We have a systemic problem--and it will only be solved if all of us work together. 
What is the government's role in all this? Well, our first responsibility is to put our own house in order. 
As the General Accounting Office has reported, Y2K could have a devastating impact on the provision of public services. These include air traffic control, Social Security and Medicare payments, supervision of the financial system, monitoring of nuclear facilities, and a wide variety of other services. And let's not forget the Nation's defense. We are all proud of our modern military with its smart weapons and computerized battlefields. But a technology-dependent military is subject to the same computer hazards as everyone else. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, many agencies are way behind schedule in fixing the Y2K problem. According to GAO, `unless agency progress improves dramatically, a substantial number of mission-critical systems will not be compliant in time.' 
So, Mr. President, this is truly an emergency, and it's critical that we act as soon as possible. Unlike many problems we face in the Congress, this one can't be delayed or postponed. We can't set up a commission. We can't put it off until the next Congress. On January 1, 2000, the problem will hit, whether we like it or not. And we have to do everything we can to prepare. 
Mr. President, let me commend my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, and throughout the Senate, for approving emergency funding to address the Y2K problem. I wish we had done so earlier. Unfortunately, there are many Members in the House of Representatives who strongly oppose treating this funding as an emergency. And they have created serious obstacles to allocating the funding. I urge them to reconsider their opposition, and am hopeful they will. 
Beyond increasing funding, Mr. President, there are other steps that the Federal government must consider to address the Y2K problem. For example, we need to reform laws that discourage businesses from sharing relevant information with each other. We need to ensure that businesses accurately report on their compliance efforts to the SEC and investors. We need to support small businesses' efforts to fix their computers. I have actively supported these types of legislative initiatives. But I recognize that they are not sufficient. We also need to communicate better with our constituents about the problem, so that all Americans can prepare. 
Mr. President, given differing views on the actual risks, the only wise thing is to prepare for the worst. When a hurricane approaches, we never know exactly where it will hit, or how destructive it will be. But that doesn't stop us from evacuating and boarding up our homes in expectation of the worst case scenario. Sometimes, those preparations prove unnecessary. And, if the hurricane does hit, there will also be cleanup costs later. But the better one prepares, the more efficient, and less expensive, the cleanup will be. And the same is true for Y2K. 
So, Mr. President, I would strongly urge this Congress to focus serious attention on Y2K, and to strongly support all funding needed to solve the problem. This is an emergency, and the time to act is now. We shouldn't panic. But we must prepare. Even if nobody knows the exact dimensions of the problem, this is one threat that we ignore at our peril.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, last month I convened a forum to investigate the problem of gun-trafficking. At the forum, we heard from a number of compelling witnesses and I have been submitting their testimony into the Record so that my colleagues and the public can benefit from their insights. Taken together, this testimony makes a compelling case for the Anti-Gun Trafficking Act, S. 466, which I introduced earlier this Congress. 
Today, I would like to submit the final testimony from this forum, that of Captain Thomas Bowers, Director of the Office of Crime Gun Enforcement for the Maryland State Police. Two years ago, the Maryland Legislature passed the Gun Violence Act of 1996, which restricted the purchase of handguns to one in a thirty day period. The results have already been dramatic. In fact, Maryland saw a 78 percent decrease in the number of handguns sold as a result of multiple purchases in the first year after the enactment of this law. This means fewer lethal weapons supplied to criminals in cities nationwide. 
I hope that my colleagues will work with me to pass this important piece of legislation. Keeping handguns out of the hands of criminals, and reducing the gun violence across our nation should be of paramount importance to all.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 678, the `Thomas Edison Commemorative Coin Act', a bill that directs the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue coins commemorating Thomas Edison and the 125th anniversary of the invention of the lightbulb. I am the author of the Senate version of this bill. In 1928, Congress saw fit to award to Mr. Edison a Congressional gold medal `for the development and application of inventions that have revolutionized civilization in the last century.' Mr. President, by passing this legislation today, we have the opportunity to once again honor the memory of one of the world's greatest inventors by issuing commemorative coins bearing Mr. Edison's likeness. 
Thomas Edison produced more than 1,300 inventions during the course of his lifetime, 1,093 of which were patented. These included the incandescent lightbulb, the alkaline battery, the phonograph, the microphone, motion picture cameras, and stock tickers. He was one of America's greatest inventors, and truly a genius. Formerly known as `The Wizard of Menlo Park', he would spend countless hours in his labs in New Jersey coming up with ideas that ultimately made all our lives much easier. 
In 1887, Thomas Edison built his lab in West Orange, New Jersey. It was known as the world's first `invention factory', where he and his partners invented, built and shipped out numerous products stemming from Edison's work. He saw every failure as a success. One story is that Thomas Edison failed 10,000 times in his storage battery experiments. Instead of being dejected, he said `Why, I haven't failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that it won't work.' Conversely, in response to remarks about his success, he would say, `Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.' It is now proper to honor this man who left such a lasting legacy with these commemorative coins. 
Mr. President, not only would these coins honor the memory of Thomas Edison, they would also raise revenue to support organizations that preserve his legacy. The two New Jersey sites, the `invention factory' in West Orange, New Jersey and the Edison Memorial Tower in Edison, New Jersey, are in need of funding for maintenance and repair. Each year, nine thousand young students visit the West Orange site alone to learn about the great inventor. The proceeds from the sale of these coins will help to preserve irreplaceable records containing Edison's thoughts as well as priceless memorabilia. This bill, at no cost to the government, would provide the funds necessary to protect these and six other historical sites so that generations of school children can continue to visit them. 
Mr. President, I introduced similar legislation in the 104th Congress as well as at the beginning of this Congress. I now urge the passage of H.R. 678 so that we may honor the memory of Thomas Alva Edison and celebrate the 125th anniversary of the lightbulb while, at no cost to the government, providing needed funds to important historical sites. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I introduce the Saving Taxpayers from Obsolete Programs and Spending Act of 1998 also known as the STOP Spending Act of 1998. This legislation cuts or eliminates over 25 unnecessary federal programs and would save approximately $80 billion over the next five years. 
This legislation targets programs throughout the government--from the Pentagon, to the Departments of Agriculture, Interior and Energy, to NASA. If this legislation were to be enacted, we would have a leaner, better, smarter government. Many of these programs, like the peanut quota program, are outdated relics of a different era. Others, like the cancellation of an unnecessary tactical aircraft program, just represent new thinking that more properly reflects a changing international security environment. 
Mr. President, the federal government spends about $1.7 trillion each year. Much of this is for important programs that provide health care to American families, Social Security and Medicare to senior citizens, education for our kids, roads for our cars, security for our nation, housing for families with modest incomes, protection for the environment, and research to advance our civilization. However, there also is too much waste in government. And we must constantly reassess our spending priorities. 
Many of the programs targeted in this legislation represent bad policy and bad economics. The benefits go primarily to a narrow group of beneficiaries, while the costs are borne by consumers, taxpayers, and in some cases, the environment. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's sugar program is one example of a program which interferes with the proper functioning of the marketplace at the expense of consumers and the general public. This program guarantees U.S. sugar growers a price that is well above the world price of sugar and results in American consumers paying over $1 billion extra for sugar products each year. In addition, since the artificially high sugar prices that result from the sugar program encourages cultivation of marginal agricultural lands near the Florida Everglades, much environmental damage has been done as a result of increased pollution and runoff from these lands. Unfortunately, the benefits from this program primarily go to very few large and politically powerful corporations, not small farmers. 
This is but one example of the many wasteful and outdated programs cut or eliminated as part of this legislation. There are many more examples which I will not detail at this time. However, the bottom line is that we can make our government more effective and save money at the same time if we make the commitment to do so. 
Mr. President, I understand that with the limited time remaining in the 105th Congress, this legislation is not likely to be approved before the end of this session. And I realize that many of these proposals would face strong opposition. But I hope my colleagues will review this legislation and support my efforts to reduce government spending in the future by cutting these outdated and wasteful programs.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on September 2, I convened a forum on gun trafficking. Across America, it is simply too easy for criminals, particularly gangs, to purchase and distribute large numbers of guns. And more guns in the wrong hands means more murder and mayhem on our streets. 
Because we must move more aggressively to stop this deadly crime, I introduced S. 466, the Anti-Gun Trafficking Act. The testimony I heard at the forum has made me even more determined to pass this sensible legislation and help stop gun traffickers. 
In order to share the insights of the witnesses at the forum with my colleagues and the public, I am submitting the testimony presented for inclusion in the Congressional Record. Previously, I submitted the testimony of Mayor Edward Rendell, James and Sarah Brady from the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence and Handgun Control, and John Schuler, Kenisha Green and Quanita Favorite, three young people from the D.C. area. 
Today, I would like to submit a statement from Captain R. Lewis Vass, Commander of the Criminal Justice Information Services Division of the Virginia Department of State Police. His testimony bears witness to the success of Virginia's one-gun-in-thirty-day law which was enacted in 1993. Since 1993, the number of crime guns traced back to Virginia from the Northeast dropped by nearly 40 percent. Prior to one-gun-a-month, Virginia had been among the leading suppliers of weapons to the so-called `Iron Pipeline' that fed the arms race on the streets of Northeastern cities.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution expressing the sense of the Congress that the United States should not extend preferential duty-free treatment on products to countries who do not comply with their treaty obligations regarding the protection of intellectual property. 
The United States leads the world in the production of intellectual property. Intellectual property-based industries, including those that rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and trade names, contribute over $500 billion annually to the U.S. economy. However, the current global reach of information is making it much easier for pirates to gain access to intellectual property. It is vitally important that we take adequate steps to discourage, and ultimately prevent, other nations from allowing the rampant piracy of the work of Americans. 
Members of the World Trade Organization signed an agreement on Trade-Related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, or TRIPS, in 1995. That agreement establishes minimum standards of intellectual property protection and requires the signatory developing nations to be compliant with their TRIPS obligations by January 1, 2000. Regardless of this, piracy continues in GSP beneficiary nations and around the world, costing the U.S. intellectual property-dependent industries approximately $50 billion a year. 
The United States has recognized the importance of protecting American intellectual property and encouraging the growth of its related industries. The Administration has actively pressed other nations to engage in adequate protections, particularly through the use of the Special 301 `watch' list. However, this is not enough. We need to do more to remove the incentives for piracy. Linking GSP benefits to TRIPS obligations is an important first step, and a powerful way to send a clear message to these and other nations that there is a price to pay for continuing to permit rampant piracy of American-made products. 
Mr. President, this sense of the Congress does send an important message to these countries that the United States is watching, and that legislation to implement the denial of duty-free treatment is imminent unless they take the necessary steps to respect and protect the intellectual capital of Americans. 
At this point, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters in support of this resolution be inserted into the Record.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am submitting an amendment to the House-passed tax bill on the calendar. This amendment would improve the House bill by directing more of its tax relief to middle income taxpayers, and by protecting Social Security. 
The amendment would provide relief from the marriage penalty, help parents afford child care, promote the modernization of our schools, allow self-employed individuals to deduct the costs of health insurance, encourage savings and investment by establishing new exclusions for interest and dividends for all Americans, promote research by reinstating the research and experimentation tax credit, provide relief from the estate and gift tax, promote the revitalization of depressed areas, expand support for small businesses, and modify rules that discourage seniors from working. 
The amendment differs from the House bill in two primary respects. First, it would target tax relief to middle income families, largely by providing additional relief for families with children in child care, and by promoting the modernization of our nation's schools. Second, the bill protects Social Security, by deferring the effective date of the tax cuts until the Social Security Trust Fund is actuarially sound. 
Mr. President, let me briefly review the items that are included in my proposal. 
First, the amendment would provide relief from the marriage penalty. As proposed in the House-passed bill, the amendment would increase the standard deduction for married couples so that each spouse would have the same deduction as a single filer. 
Second, the amendment would help families handle the costs of child care. It would increase the child care and dependent tax credit to a maximum allowable expense for inflation. It would make the credit refundable, so that it benefits those with lower incomes. And it would provide a new tax credit worth $90 per month for stay-at-home parents of children under one year of age. 
Third, the amendment would promote education, by supporting the modernization of our schools, and allowing schools of higher education to establish prepaid tuition programs. 
Fourth, the amendment would allow self-employed individuals to fully deduct the costs of health insurance. 
Fifth, the amendment would promote savings and investment, by establishing a new exclusion for dividends and interest. Individuals could exclude up to $200, and couples could exclude up to $400 in dividends and interest. 
Sixth, the amendment would extend several provisions of the tax code that expired this year or would expire next year. These include the credits for research, work opportunity and welfare-to-work, would be extended through Feb. 29, 2000. The credit for contributions of stock to private foundations would be extended permanently. 
Seventh, the amendment would provide immediate relief from the estate and gift tax. Under the legislation, an additional $25,000 of estates would, in effect, be excludable from this tax in 1999. This would increase the total credit against this tax to $675,000. 
Eighth, the amendment would encourage the revitalization of depressed areas, by providing a variety of tax incentives to businesses and individuals in 20 so-called renewal communities. These low-income areas would be designated by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. 
Ninth, the amendment includes various provisions to assist small businesses. For example, the legislation would allow small-business owners to deduct up to $25,000 of the cost of business-related equipment. 
Finally, the amendment would allow seniors to work more without suffering a reduction in their Social Security benefits. Under the proposal, seniors would be able to earn up to $17,000 in 1999 without losing a portion of their Social Security benefits. That limit would increase to $39,750 in 2008. 
Mr. President, there also are other provisions in this amendment, and I will not detail each one. Suffice it to say that, to a very large extent, this proposal tracks the tax cuts included in legislation approved by the House. However, as I have noted, the amendment is more targeted to middle income taxpayers, largely because it includes support for child care and school modernization. Also, its estate tax provisions are somewhat modified from the House version, to help us afford these other provisions, and to ensure that the bulk of the relief provided in the bill goes to middle class and moderate-income Americans. 
The second key difference from the House Mr. President, it that this proposal includes significant tax relief while fully protecting Social Security. Under the proposal, all tax cuts would become effective when the Social Security Trust Fund is in long-range actuarial balance. This ensures that we will not squander our opportunity to reform Social Security next year, and that we will not force unnecessary cuts in Social Security benefits for today's younger Americans. It also reflects a commitment to abide by the Balanced Budget Agreement and to maintain fiscal discipline.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a very special young man, one who is close to my heart and certainly close to my daughter's. He is my son-in-law Joe Morgart. 
I rise to congratulate him not simply for being a terrific husband to my daughter Nan and a loving father to my grandsons, Alexander and Jonathan, but also to recognize some of his personal achievements. Today, I commend him for becoming a leader in the Jewish community in Boston. He was honored there recently with the 1998 Young Leadership Award given by the Combined Jewish Philanthropies (CJP) of Greater Boston. 
CJP now raises nearly $25 million annually to support educational, humanitarian and cultural causes, as well as providing funding for health care and social service programs in Israel and other Jewish communities around the world. The Young Leadership Division of CJP gives young Jewish people in the Boston area the opportunity to get involved in community service, as well as to participate in discussions about Jewish issues from religious, ethical, social, political and economic perspectives. 
For Joe to receive this award is especially noteworthy, coming from one of the oldest philanthropies in the country and one so dedicated to educating others about Jewish issues. That is so, Mr. President, because Joe has not always been a member of the Jewish faith. 
Maybe Joe was attracted to Judaism to impress Nan when they were dating. Maybe he was attracted to Judaism to impress me! Or, knowing Joe and his thirst for knowledge when learning about Judaism, he found that the Jewish religion fulfilled him spiritually and invited him into the community. Joe then decided to convert, and he has become a most valuable participant in the community. 
Joe Morgart has served on CJP's Board of Directors, has been an active fundraising campaigner and started a successful outreach and educational services program that drew in many new members for CJP. He has participated in CJP's leadership development program, and has been deeply involved in community service programs for the organization. Beyond his involvement in CJP, Joe is a leader of the Jewish Big Brother & Big Sister Association, part of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and is a member of the United Jewish Appeal's Young Leadership Cabinet. 
Mr. President, I am proud that a well-regarded organization like CJP recognized Joe Morgart's ability and contributions by honoring him with this award. I know that his entire family is proud as well of his accomplishments and the love and respect that he has earned from all of those who know him.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on September 2, I convened a forum on gun trafficking. Across America, it is simply too easy for criminals, particularly gangs, to purchase and distribute large numbers of guns. And more guns in the wrong hands means more murder and mayhem on our streets. 
Because we must move more aggressively to stop this deadly crime, I introduced S. 466, the Anti-Gun Trafficking Act. The testimony I heard at the forum has made me even more determined to pass this sensible legislation and help stop gun traffickers. 
In order to share the insights of the witnesses at the forum with my colleagues and the public, I am submitting the testimony presented for inclusion in the Congressional Record. Last week, I submitted the testimony of Mayor Edward Rendell. Today, I am submitting the testimony of James and Sarah Brady. Through their tireless efforts with The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence and Handgun Control, they have helped reduce gun violence across our country and it was an honor to have them at the forum. 
I am also submitting the testimony from several young people who were kind enough to testify at the forum. John Schuler, Kenisha Green and Quanita Favorite live in communities where gun violence is an everyday occurrence, and they have experienced the pain and misery that results. We must do more to help them and the other children who live in the crime-ridden neighborhoods of our nation.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, yesterday the Conferees on VA-HUD Appropriations decided to amend our nation's Superfund law. 
At present, Superfund contains a limit on the liability of sureties who issue performance bonds to Superfund cleanup contractors. I was the author of that provision, which I introduced in 1990 as a free-standing Superfund bill (S. 3187). My bill was broadly supported by labor, environmentalists, and the American Insurance Association. 
But, Mr. President, at the time the surety liability legislation was passed, certain Senators who doubted the limitation was necessary to increase the availability, and hence, competitiveness, of surety bonds, added a sunset provision. 
During the VA-HUD Conference yesterday, the Conferees agreed to eliminate that sunset provision. The deletion has had broad-based, bipartisan support, and has appeared in each comprehensive Superfund reform bill introduced in this Congress. 
I supported that amendment, Mr. President, but I want to underscore my distress at the manner in which the Conferees adopted the amendment. 
Several months ago, I asked Senator Chafee to include two Superfund amendments on the agenda for an Environment and Public Works Committee business meeting before the end of the year--one pertaining to brownfields and the other to municipal solid waste (`MSW'). Senator Chafee rejected this request, based on his opposition to `piecemeal' Superfund reform, that is, anything less than a comprehensive overhaul of the entire Superfund statute--something that has eluded this body now for three consecutive Congresses, or six years. 
I was therefore astonished that the surety amendment made its way into yesterday's VA-HUD Conference Report. I was especially surprised that Senator Chafee, as Chair of the authorizing Committee, signed off on this piece of Superfund reform on an appropriations bill, despite his repeated opposition to `piecemeal' reform, and the fact that this provision had not passed the House or the Senate as a stand-alone bill, and was not in either the House or the Senate VA-HUD bills. 
Some argued that the surety amendment was merely technical in nature--that it simply perpetuated the opportunity for sureties to enjoy limited liability under Superfund. 
Using that criterion, a brownfields liability exemption would also constitute nothing more than a technical fix--it would clarify that Congress did not intend Superfund liability to deter persons from purchasing and cleaning up brownfields properties. Nor would an MSW amendment--which would confirm that Congress did not intend persons who disposed of only household waste to be liable for cleanup of toxic waste. 
The surety amendment has also been touted as non-controversial--having consistently enjoyed broad-based bi-partisan support. 
Mr. President, as I have stated on many occasions, and my esteemed colleagues must agree, brownfields and MSW liability exemptions can boast the same historic consensus. They have appeared in each of the comprehensive Superfund reform bills introduced by Republicans or Democrats since the 103rd Congress. And they have gained the support of all stakeholders, the Administration, and the national environmental community. 
The brownfields and MSW fixes are minor, but they are crucial for successful brownfields development, or to relieve those subjected to unfair and unintended litigation. And they offer significant economic and environmental benefits. The nation's Mayors estimate they lose between $200 and $500 million a year in tax revenues from these properties sitting idle, and that returning these sites to productive use could create some 236,000 new jobs. 
I am therefore honestly trying to understand what, if any, objective criteria exist for determining which small Superfund fixes will be made in this session. 
When I consider yesterday's surety amendment, along with Senator Lott's recycling proposal (S. 2180), I can find nothing that distinguishes sureties or recyclers from brownfields or MSW. There is virtually nothing that makes the surety's or recycler's needs more urgent than those of our cities in need of brownfields revitalization, and their taxpayers and residents, who want cleanup and redevelopment; or those of the homeowners and small businesses mired in litigation at landfill sites. And it certainly cannot be argued that brownfields or MSW have enjoyed any less broad-based support than have fixes for recyclers or sureties. 
As a Senator from a state with literally thousands of brownfields sites, as well as altogether too many instances of homeowners and small businesses dragged into Superfund litigation by their corporate peers (and not by EPA), it is my responsibility to lobby for those communities and individuals who don't have lobbyists representing them here in the Congress. We, as their elected representatives, are their lobbyists. We are their voice. There is no reason in the world why this Senate, and this Congress, should not move forward to make the minor, non-controversial, and eminently sensible changes to Superfund law that impede brownfields development and rob small businesses of their hard earned profits. 
Now, Mr. President, some of my colleagues have claimed that passage of brownfields or MSW amendments are anathema to comprehensive Superfund reform. Or some of my colleagues have argued that precisely because the brownfields and MSW amendments are so popular, and enjoy such broad ranging support, and provide such significant benefits to the nation, that they should be held hostage to comprehensive Superfund reform--that we should see if they will succeed in driving parties back to the table to negotiate comprehensive Superfund reform for the fourth consecutive Congress. 
Mr. President, with all due respect, I think it is wrong to prevent enactment of legislation that enjoys broad support, and would reap acknowledged benefits, as a tactical matter to achieve unrelated goals. This disserves the public and adds to public cynicism. For a variety of reasons, efforts to radically change Superfund, the nation's toxic waste cleanup program, have failed for six years running. Toward the end of each of the past two Congresses, many Senators, including this Senator, have argued that we should move ahead with achievable reforms that are non-controversial and permit our people, our communities, and our economy to benefit from their enactment. Today, as we head into the final week of this Congress, I make the same plea. Just as holding recyclers or sureties hostage to comprehensive Superfund reform has not gotten us any closer to producing an acceptable product that the President could sign, so holding brownfields development and persons who disposed of household trash hostage to other legislative goals is a failed strategy. It will not mitigate the controversy intrinsic to the broader issues raised by comprehensive legislation. But it will rob communities across the country of the jobs and tax ratables that flow from revitalized brownfields and will impose severe penalties on the individuals and small businesses caught up in a litigation nightmare through no fault of their own. 
Mr. President, I call upon my esteemed colleagues to move brownfields and MSW amendments before this Congress ends. I believe otherwise we will all have a hard time explaining, when we return to our home states in October, why sureties and recyclers merited this body's attention, but our communities and our taxpayers and our small businesspeople were somehow less worthy.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to inform my colleagues of a forum I held on September 2 on the deadly problem of gun trafficking. I am pleased that Senator Robb and Senator Sarbanes were able to join me at the forum. 
As my colleagues know, I have introduced S. 466, the Anti-Gun Trafficking Act. The Judiciary Committee has not held hearings on this legislation, and I thought it was important to gather expert testimony on the issue. The testimony I heard at the forum has made me even more determined to pass this sensible legislation and make it more difficult for gun traffickers to obtain and sell their deadly merchandise on our streets. 
The witnesses at this forum included: Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell, who is also the chair of the Conference of Mayor's Task Force on Gun Violence; James and Sarah Brady; Captain R. Lewis Vass of the Virginia State Police, and Captain Thomas Bowers of the Maryland State Police. 
We also heard from a panel of youth from right here in our nation's capital who live with gun violence everyday in their communities. They were John Schuler, Kenisha Green and Quanita Favorite. 
In this statement I will summarize what happened during the forum. But I will also be including, during the next few days, testimony from the witnesses so that my colleagues and the public will have a record of their views. 
Mr. President, as a result of the Brady Act, we have helped prevent thousands of guns from getting into the hands of the wrong people. Since the Brady Act went into effect in 1994, more than 242,000 handgun purchases have been denied to convicted felons, fugitives, drug addicts and other dangerous persons. The Domestic Violence Gun Ban in the Brady Act, which I sponsored and which went into effect in 1996, has prevented more than 6,800 firearms sales to people convicted of abusing a spouse or child. 
However, the Brady Law has not completely stopped the flow of handguns to those who should not have them. Gun traffickers continue to supply an illegal gun market by buying large quantities of guns in states with lax gun laws and then reselling them on the streets--often in cities and states with strict gun laws. 
If these traffickers can not legally buy a gun themselves, or if they do not want to have their name turn up if the gun is later found at a crime scene, they find others to make the purchases for them. The trafficker pays a straw purchaser, in money or drugs, to buy 25, 50 or more handguns at a time and then resells the guns to those who otherwise could not buy them--such as convicted felons, drug addicts, or children. 
In fact, the Maryland State Police official testified that multiple guns purchased by straw purchasers were the source of the majority of firearms used in the commission of violent crime. 
My bill would make it far more difficult and less profitable for traffickers to conduct their deadly business, by prohibiting an individual from buying more than one handgun a month. We know this approach works because three states--Virginia, Maryland, South Carolina--have passed one-gun-a month laws and the results have been dramatic. Gun trafficking from these states has plunged. 
For instance, officers from the Virginia State Police testified that after Virginia passed its one-handgun-a-month limit in 1993, the number of crime guns traced back to Virginia from the Northeast dropped by nearly 40 percent. Prior to one-gun-a-month, Virginia had been among the leading supplier of weapons to the so-called `Iron Pipeline' that feed the arms race on the streets of Northeastern cities. 
In 1995, the Virginia Crime Commission conducted a comprehensive study of the one-handgun-a-month limit to determine if the law had achieved its purpose. That study found, and I quote, `Virginia's one-gun-a-month statute . . . has had its intended effect of reducing Virginia's status as a source state for gun trafficking.' 
Maryland and South Carolina showed similar results. In South Carolina, according to the same Crime Commission report: `Prior to the passage of the one-gun-a-month law, South Carolina was a leading source state for guns traced to New York City, accounting for 39% of guns recovered in criminal investigations. Following the implementation of the law, South Carolina virtually dropped off of the statistical list of source states for firearms trafficked to the northeast.' 
Maryland--the most recent state to pass a limit on handgun purchases-- passed its law in 1996 and has already seen the results. According to testimony from the Maryland State Police: 
`In 1991 Maryland was nationally ranked second in terms of suppliers of crime guns to the City of New York. By 1997, one year after the passage of Maryland's one gun a month law, Maryland moved out of the top ten suppliers of crime guns to New York City.' 
And most significant is the drop in crime that has followed enactment of limits on handgun sales. For example, in Virginia, the number of murders, robberies and aggravated assaults committed with a firearm significantly dropped after 1993 when the limit went into effect. Of course it should not come as a surprise to anyone that violent crime would drop when it becomes more difficult for criminals to get a handgun. Handguns are the gun of choice for criminals--they are cheap and concealable. Of all murders committed with firearm, about 80% are committed with a handgun. 
Limits on handgun purchases, while disrupting gun traffickers, have little or no effect on the sportsman or law abiding citizen because a very small percent of all handgun purchases involve multiple sales. For example, in 1991, Virginia State Police reported only 6% of handgun purchases were multiple sales. But of these, nearly 75% were semi-automatic weapons, the weapon of choice among gun traffickers. Mayor Rendell testified that less than 1% of handgun purchasers in Philadelphia bought more than 12 handguns in a twelve month period. 
Let me put some human faces on this issue. As I said earlier, kids from the District of Columbia testified at my forum. And what they had to say was terrifying. Guns were an every day part of their lives. For these kids, D.C. does not stand for District of Columbia. It stands for Dodge City. 
These young people told us that guns are easy to get in their neighborhoods and schools. They call it getting strapped. And if you do not get strapped you might not make it through the day, they said. 
One young woman put it eloquently: `It's not fair,' she said. `Other kids get to go to college. We get to go to funerals. These people who sell guns are the real predators. They feed off our pain.' 
We must shut these predators down. 
Most sane people would ask, who could possibly need more than one handgun a month? The testimony at my forum gave the clear and obvious answer. Someone who should not have any at all. The only people who would `need' more than one gun a month are gun traffickers. It is the only way to make their deadly business profitable. 
The need for a national limit on handgun sales is clear. I hope this Congress has the courage to act in the interests of law abiding Americans. But I have my doubts. This Congress has defeated sensible proposals to try to make guns safer through mandated safety locks. This Congress has defeated legislation that would require adults to keep their guns locked and out of reach of children. 
I look forward to the day when this Congress listens to the American people instead of the gun lobby and the National Rifle Association. Poll after poll shows that Americans, including gun-owning Americans, want tougher controls on guns. A University of Chicago study in 1996 found 85% support legislation mandating that all new handguns must be childproof, and 80% favors limiting handgun sales to one a month. 
We have heard a lot from Charlton Heston lately now that he is president of the National Rifle Association. But I sometimes think Mr. Heston forgets he is only an actor--not Moses--when he uses that superb voice of his in the service of the National Rifle Association. 
I would like to remind Mr. Heston of one of the last things Moses said to the children of Israel before he died. 
`I have put before you life and death, blessing and curse. Choose life if you and your offspring would live.' 
Well, Mr. Heston, we choose life--for ourselves and our children. And we are going to fight the curse that gun traffickers have wrought upon cities, our schools and our streets. 
I urge my colleagues to listen to the American people; stop turning a blind eye to the daily destruction caused by guns in America. I urge my colleagues to have the will to do something to help the youth of America live without the daily sound of gunshots in their lives. I ask my colleagues to support this common sense approach to keep handguns out of the hands of criminals.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today on behalf of myself and Senators Bumpers, Dodd, and Moseley-Braun, I introduce the Gun Show Sunshine Act of 1998. This bill addresses the serious problem of gun shows where criminals can buy and sell dangerous weapons without any record of the sale, and without any background checks. 
Let me outline the scope of the problem. 
Since the Brady Act went into effect in 1994, more than 242,000 handgun purchases have been denied to convicted felons, fugitives, drug addicts and other dangerous persons. The Domestic Violence Gun Ban in the Brady Act, which I sponsored, went into effect in 1996 and has prevented more than 6,800 firearms sales to people convicted of abusing a spouse or child. 
However, because of a loophole in our laws, those same people merely need to drive to a gun show and they can buy as many weapons as they want. Just walk in with cash and walk out with a weapon--no waiting, no background check, and no record of the transaction. 
Simply put, gun shows are firearm flea markets for felons. 
Because gun shows are largely unregulated, no one knows for sure how many gun shows are held each year, or how many guns are sold at them. Estimates range from 2,000 to 5,200 shows a year. These shows generate billions of dollars in gun sales and put thousands of guns into the hands of people who would be stopped from buying a gun if a background check were done. 
The system is perfectly geared to the anonymity criminals crave. Tommy Dillon, a serial killer in Ohio, used gun shows to both buy and sell his murder weapons without a trace--even though police suspected he was the killer. Dillon was so sure he found a perfect system that he taunted police with an anonymous letter promising he would never be caught. He was caught after killing five people, but only because of a freak coincidence. After Dillon was picked up on an unrelated weapons charge, someone he had sold one of his murder weapons to recognized Dillon from a newspaper photo, and called the police when he realized he had one of the murder weapons police sought. 
One California gun dealer used the unregulated flea-market atmosphere of gun shows to sell 1,700 guns in a four-year period. Some of these guns made their way to gang members and juveniles. Of the guns that could be traced, at least 30 were used in crimes, including three murders and a shoot out with police. 
The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that 341,000 guns a year were stolen from private citizens between 1987 and 1992. Because there is no requirement to keep records, gun shows provide a safe haven to dispose of these weapons. 
How did it come to be like this? 
Back in 1986, under intense pressure from the gun lobby, Congress passed and President Reagan signed into law the Firearm Owners' Protection Act. The law substantially weakened the Gun Control Act of 1968, which was passed after the assassinations of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King. 
Among the changes was a loosening of the law regarding who needs a license to sell firearms and what records must be kept. Under the new law, anyone selling from their `private collection' or who is engaged in `occasional sales' was made exempt from federal record-keeping. 
But the law does not define `occasional sales' or precisely what constitutes a `personal collection.' And, to make matters worse, the law prohibits agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms from even entering a gun show unless they are there on a specific case. 
This has to stop. This bill would bring these weapons sales into the light and strip criminals of their government-granted anonymity. Under this bill, gun show operators would be required to obtain a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and meet the same standards as federally licensed gun dealers--they must be more than 21 years of age and have no convictions for gun-law violations. 
Any person selling a firearm at a gun show would be required to notify the gun-show operator. The gun-show operator would then conduct a background check of the purchaser using the Instant Check system, just as a licensed gun dealer is required to do. The gun-show operator would also be required to keep the same records as a licensed gun dealer, including the name and address of the purchaser, the type of gun and its serial number. The operator would also be required to submit to the ATF a list of the serial numbers of all guns sold at the show so that if these guns are later recovered at a crime scene, the ATF will be able to trace the gun. 
This bill simply takes the laws that already apply to licensed gun dealers, and applies them to the thousands of transactions conducted by unlicensed sellers at gun shows. 
Mr. President, we must do more to stop the gun violence on our streets. Firearms are involved in 35,000 deaths a year. That's more American killed than in the entire Korean War. 
I urge my colleagues to help cut this weapons supply line that fuels an arms race on our streets. Let's work together to pass the Gun Show Sunshine Act and keep guns out of the hands of criminals.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished Senator from Alaska, the Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. 
The Conference Report accompanying H.R. 4013, the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Appropriations bill, includes a funding level of $28 million specifically for making upgrades to the radars which will support the Navy Theater Wide missile defense system, through a competitive process. The Senate has a long history of supporting this effort by providing funding above the amount requested by the Administration. I concur fully with these additions. 
The Navy Theater Wide program is an integral part of the overall architecture of missile defense which is being developed and built by our country today. However, in order to field a Navy Theater Wide system that will be available on the schedule that the Navy is pursuing, we must increase our efforts in the area of radar development. To date, the preponderance of the funds expended for the Navy Theater Wide program have gone toward development of the missile and the kill vehicle. While these are necessary elements of the Navy Theater Wide system, without the upgraded sensors to operate with them, the overall system will be less than fully capable. With the addition of the $28 million in this bill we are just beginning to make up for lost time. I wish we could have provided even more funds. However, I encourage the Navy and the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization to commence a vigorous effort to develop a radar system that will meet the stringent requirements of the Navy Theater Wide program. I believe the same radar system should also be compatible with meeting other fleet requirements, such as improving its ability to defeat cruise missiles. 
Do you agree with my assessment of the situation?

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the pending amendment, offered by my friend and colleague from New Jersey, Senator Torricelli. The amendment, called the Quiet Communities Act, will reestablish the Environmental Protection Agency's appropriate role in noise abatement. 
This amendment simply reactivates an office in the EPA--the Office of Noise Abatement and Control--that was unfunded in 1981 at the request of the Reagan administration. The Office of Noise Abatement and Control will coordinate Federal noise abatement activities, develop noise standards, provide technical assistance to local communities, and promote research and education on the impacts of noise pollution. 
This office will be a resource to the millions of Americans who are affected by noise pollution, and particularly aircraft noise. 
Those of us who are in the New York-New Jersey region know only too well what effect aircraft noise has on our communities. It is a serious problem for populations across our country who are constantly harassed by airplane noise, truck noise, construction noise, and other noise, when they can never find peace in their own homes. In our region, with the several airports we have operating--La Guardia and Kennedy and Newark, and others--it is a constant. We have to find ways to deal with it. 
Just like air and water pollution, noise pollution is an environmental health issue. People who are tormented by noise pollution experience a range of health problems, such as hearing loss, stress, high blood pressure, sleep deprivation, distraction, and lost productivity. Aircraft noise is especially detrimental to human health. 
Some studies indicate that persistent exposure to high levels of aircraft noise is linked to hypertension, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal problems, among other disorders. 
Noise pollution is particularly troublesome in parts of the State of New Jersey. 
New Jersey is the most densely populated State in the Nation, and millions of New Jerseyans live close to major transportation centers that generate significant levels of noise in their neighborhoods. For example, aircraft approaching and departing from Newark International Airport are guided along flight paths routed over residential neighborhoods, patterns which disrupt families and disturb the community's quality of life. Communities affected by aircraft noise have been living with the pain for over 10 years and they must find relief. 
Unfortunately, the Federal Aviation Administration, which is charged with the responsibility of monitoring aircraft noise, has not adequately addressed the noise problems in New Jersey, and when attempted, its approach toward these problems is often flawed. 
For example the FAA's current threshold of 65 decibels Day-Night Level--or DNL--that the FAA indicates is compatible with residential use is often criticized as problematic and, in the opinion of the National Resources Defense Council, significantly underestimates the level at which many people are affected by aircraft noise. 
The fact that this fundamental threshold is controversial and the science behind it is disputed points to the fact that more research is needed on these issues. 
Mr. President, citizens living near airports have few resources at their disposal to find out more about the effects of air noise on their health and their environment. 
The Office of Noise Abatement and Control used to be one resource, and it has been dormant for too long. 
Simply put, Mr. President, noise pollution, and particularly aircraft noise, is a serious environmental health issue that deserves attention from the primary Federal agency whose responsibility is environmental protection--the EPA. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, that was not the view in 1981. But now we have an opportunity to correct this mistake by adopting this amendment. 
Besides reactivating the Office of Noise Abatement and Control, the bill authorizes funding of $5 million a year for the first 2 years and $8 million a year for the subsequent years to fund Office's activities. 
According to the National Institutes of Health, more than 20 million Americans are exposed on a regular basis to hazardous noise levels that could result in hearing loss and other psychological and physiological damage. In my view, $5 million a year to address a problem affecting over 20 million Americans is a sound investment. 
The bill also requires the Office of Noise Abatement and Control to produce a study. The study must examine the FAA's selection of noise measurement methodologies, determine the threshold of noise at which health impacts are felt and determine the effectiveness of noise abatement programs at airports around the United States. 
The EPA would then issue recommendations--recommendations, Mr. President, not directives--to the FAA on measures that will mitigate the impact of air noise on affected communities. In my opinion, Mr. President, this study is long overdue, and particularly long overdue for the millions of Americans who live every day with the nuisance of aircraft noise in their lives. 
Mr. President, back in 1990, I sponsored a provision in the Airport Noise and Capacity Act, that required all commercial airlines to convert their fleets from Stage II to Stage III noise certification levels, a quieter plane, by the year 2000. I am pleased to say that many of the commercial airlines are ahead of their schedules and we have seen positive benefits. 
Research is continuing on even quieter aircraft, and we may soon see fleets that would satisfy Stage IV noise certification levels. However, as air travel increases, communities will experience more aircraft noise. This issue will not go away. Indeed, if nothing is done, it will only get worse. 
Mr. President, this amendment simply reactivates a program in EPA that has been dormant for too long, a program that addressed a serious environmental health issue, in the Federal agency that is responsible for mitigating environmental health problems. This amendment makes sense, and will provide some element of relief for the millions of Americans who face debilitating noise pollution, such as aircraft pollution, every day. 
Mr. President, we have a chance to do something about this at a fairly modest cost overall, and to say to those people, simply because they live in an area that is crowded, that is a transportation center and so forth, that you shouldn't have to suffer a different way of life, or a less pleasant way of life than other citizens across this country. 
We do all kinds of things to mitigate against noise. We build highway noise barriers and have all kinds of systems. We have police rules that say you can't blow your horn unnecessarily--all kinds of programs that would reduce the amount of noise pollution that we endure each and every day. 
I strongly support this amendment and urge my colleagues to think through what it means to their communities, to their States, and do the same thing. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support Amy Rosen's nomination to the Amtrak Reform Board of Directors. Ms. Rosen has the right blend of business and financial knowledge, talent and creativity needed to lead Amtrak into the next century. 
Mr. President, the next few years will be crucial for Amtrak. To increase ridership, modernize and cut costs while reducing its dependence on federal assistance, Amtrak needs Board members with demonstrated business and financial skills. I believe Amy Rosen is eminently qualified to serve on Amtrak's Board and can make that kind of contribution at this critical juncture in Amtrak's history. She has business acumen derived from extensive professional experience in the private sector, along with her work in the public sector. 
Currently, Ms. Rosen is Managing Partner of Public Private Initiatives, a financial services and consulting firm that employs innovative financing techniques to benefit public sector, non-profit and private sector clients. At PPI, she is directly involved in applying creative financial tools, such as tax-advantaged leasing and asset securitization to enhance government services. 
For example, under Ms. Rosen's tenure, New Jersey Transit has leverage-leased $1.8 billion worth of equipment and facilities, for a net benefit of $100 million to New Jersey Transit and its ridership. Prior to starting Public Private Initiatives, Ms. Rosen was Senior Vice President of Marketing and Managing Director of Lockheed-Martin IMS, where she was responsible for the oversight of all domestic and international marketing initiatives, and state and federal relations. She also was very involved in the Lockheed merger with Martin Marietta. Throughout her tenure, she worked to re-shape the corporation's marketing and acquisition needs in the midst of defense budget cuts. These positions required the kind of skills and expertise that can help Amtrak deal effectively with the challenges it faces today. 
Ms. Rosen also has relevant and extremely valuable experience in the public sector. She served as Deputy Commissioner for the New Jersey Department of Transportation under Governor Byrne and currently serves as Vice Chair of the New Jersey Transit Board of Directors. As a result of her service in these posts, she has hands-on experience in state government and will be able to build strong relationships between Amtrak and the states it serves. 
Mr. President, while professional experience and particular skills are important for effective service, Ms. Rosen also has the kinds of personal strengths and attributes that the Senate looks for in nominees to high posts. She is bright, energetic, extremely hard working and committed to the goals and mission the Congress has set out for Amtrak. I can also personally attest to her integrity and ability to work well within a group. 
Mr. President, I strongly support Ms. Rosen's appointment and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to commend the authors of this legislation, Senators Durbin and Grassley, for their efforts on this legislation and their acceptance of my amendment which will help prevent drunk drivers from escaping the debts they owe to their victims by filing for bankruptcy. 
As my colleagues know, Congress has always worked in a bipartisan way when working to protect the victims of drunk-drivers under the Bankruptcy Code. In 1984, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984 which contained provisions to prevent drunk drivers from avoiding their debts to victims by filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. Although that Act closed a loophole in Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, drunk drivers began to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 13. Consequently, in 1990, Congress passed another measure to protect drunk-driving victims under Chapter 13. 
As originally drafted, S. 1301 contained a number of provisions that would have diluted the ability of drunk-driving victims to receive damages. Consequently, I drafted an amendment designed to ensure that victims would be paid for their injuries when the drunk driver filed for bankruptcy. Additionally, the amendment extended protections to victims of drunk boaters. The Coast Guard reports that drunk boating continues to be a problem with more than 200 fatalities in some years, and I thought it was important that irresponsible boaters not be able to escape liability by filing for bankruptcy. 
I am pleased that Senators Durbin and Grassley have incorporated my amendment into the managers' amendment. I appreciate their efforts and cooperation. We must ensure that the victims of drunk drivers and drunk boaters are protected in bankruptcy and I urge the conferees to make this issue a priority when working out differences with the House bill.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. Mr. President, yesterday the Majority Leader made a long statement on behalf of Senate action on S. 2180, the `Superfund Recycling Equity Act,' which he introduced earlier this year. This legislation would clarify that persons who merely recycle certain specified materials, but did not dispose of those materials, are not subject to Superfund liability. 
Today, Mr. President, I join as a co-sponsor of this legislation. And, I note for the record, that I was the author of the recycling provision in 1993. I included it in comprehensive Superfund reform legislation, S.1834, which I introduced when I was Chairman of the Senate Superfund Subcommittee. As Senator Lott noted yesterday, this provision has reappeared in every major, comprehensive Superfund bill since then, whether authored by Democrat or Republican. And it has been introduced in every Congress, by Democrats and Republicans, as stand-alone legislation. There is broad-based, bipartisan support for this legislation which would remove impediments to recycling efforts. It now appears that some type of liability relief for recyclers will be considered by the Environment and Public Works Committee next week, although it is not clear exactly which of several proposals will be considered. 
For this reason, Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Senate's attention two other very similar provisions which I believe should be considered in conjunction with S. 1280. They are designed to expedite the revitalization of communities all across this country, and to provide relief to untold numbers of small business owners, small non-profits, and individuals who sent only ordinary household trash to landfills that are now Superfund sites. 
Mr. President, once it became clear that the Congress would not act on comprehensive Superfund legislation this year, and the Majority Leader expressed his interest in enacting a liability exemption for certain recyclers, I suggested that we also take the very modest step of enacting a similar exemption for brownfields development and for those who innocently disposed of municipal solid waste at landfills that later became Superfund sites. I wrote to the Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, asking that the Committee consider exemptions for brownfields and municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal, should it take up any liability exemptions--because brownfields and MSW exemptions also enjoy broad, bi-partisan support and have been regarded as non-controversial. The Chairman responded that he opposed so-called piecemeal reform of Superfund, and that the Committee would not be considering such legislation this year. In deference to this judgement, I deferred introducing separate legislation. Now that the Committee apparently will be considering liability exemptions for recyclers, I hope we will also have an opportunity to consider exemptions for brownfields and MSW. 
Mr. President, as is the case for recyclers, provisions to clarify the law on liability for brownfields development and MSW have been included, with bipartisan support, in every comprehensive Superfund bill since 1993. In virtually every regard, they meet the same criteria that have been offered to justify enacting exemptions for recyclers. They are simple clarifications of existing law to correct unintended consequences of the Superfund liability scheme. They have gained the support of all stakeholders, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Justice, and the national environmental community. The brownfields and MSW `fixes' are minor, but are critical for successful brownfields development, or to those subjected to unfair and unintended litigation. They do not involve cleanup standards or natural resource damages. They do not deal with orphan shares or municipal liability. And they offer significant economic and environmental benefits. 
Why, then, should the Senate reject consideration of these `fixes?' Only one reason is offered: that they should be held hostage to comprehensive Superfund reform! Mr. President, it is argued they are so popular, and enjoy such broad ranging support, and provide such significant benefits to the nation, that we should hold them hostage to see if they provide a stimulus for action on comprehensive legislation in the next Congress. It is argued that they should be held as `sweeteners' to try to sweeten the sour pot of proposed changes to the Superfund program that have been rejected by three successive Congresses. 
Mr. President, with all due respect to those making this argument, I think it is wrong to prevent enactment of legislation that enjoys broad support, and would reap acknowledged benefits, as a tactical matter to achieve unrelated goals. I think this disserves the public and adds to public cynicism. For a variety of reasons, efforts to radically change Superfund, the nation's toxic waste cleanup program, have failed for six years running. Toward the end of each of the past two congresses, many Senators, including this Senator, have argued that we should move ahead with achievable reforms that are non-controversial and permit our people, our communities, and our economy to benefit from their enactment. Today, as we head into the final weeks of this Congress, I make the same plea. Just as holding recyclers hostage to comprehensive Superfund reform has not worked, so holding brownfields development and persons who disposed of household trash hostage to other legislative goals is a failed strategy. It will not mitigate the controversy intrinsic to the broader issues raised by comprehensive legislation. Yet, it robs communities across the country of the jobs and tax ratables that flow from revitalized brownfields and imposes severe penalties on the individuals and small businesses caught up in a litigation nightmare through no fault of their own. 
Mr. President, in the last Congress, the Majority party insisted on an all or nothing Superfund strategy. But, when that failed, lender liability legislation was passed in response to a strong lobbying effort by lenders who, understandably, wanted relief from liabilities that were unfair and made no sense. I supported lender liability relief because I thought it had public benefits and corrected an injustice. 
In these last weeks of the 105th Congress, a similar game plan is unfolding. Thousands of recyclers around the country are asking for liability relief--relief they deserve, in legislation I support. They have skilled representatives making their case, and I do not fault them for that. In fact, I support their efforts. But, as a Senator from a state with literally thousands of brownfields sites, as well as altogether too many instances of homeowners and small businesses mired in litigation at landfill sites, it is my responsibility to lobby for those communities and individuals who don't have lobbyists representing them here in the Congress. We, as their elected representatives, are their lobbyists. We are their voice. There is no reason in the world why this Senate, and this Congress, should not move forward to make the minor, non-controversial, and eminently sensible changes to Superfund law that impede brownfields development and rob small businesses of their hard earned profits. 
Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will consider the plight of persons who disposed of household waste, or office trash, such as cafeteria waste or paper waste, at the local town dump. I am talking about homeowners, pizza parlor owners, and Girl Scouts who, as unbelievable as it may sound, have been dragged into Superfund litigation. They have not been sued by EPA. They have been sued, primarily, by large corporations who disposed of toxic waste, some by dark of night, at a dump alongside solid waste from homes and small businesses and restaurants. 
Through two Congresses now, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has heard testimony from Barbara Williams, the owner of Sunny Ray Restaurant, who was named as a fourth-party defendant in litigation concerning the Keystone Sanitation Company, Inc. Superfund Site, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Indeed, the whole country heard her saga, when she was interviewed on `60 Minutes.' 
How did Barbara Williams get ensnared in Superfund litigation? EPA sued 11 companies that dumped hazardous waste from industrial processes at the Keystone Landfill for a period of years, but did not want to clean it up. These 11 companies sued 180 third-party defendants, who in turn sued 590 fourth-party defendants, including Barbara Williams. But Mrs. Williams sent only mashed potatoes and other restaurant waste to the Keystone Site. Those suing her told her she could get out of the lawsuit if she would pay them $75,000. 
Mr. President, a $75,000 assessment is a lot of money for most small businesses, and Barbara Williams is no exception. Further, Barbara Williams is not a polluter. No one at the Department of Justice, the EPA or in the Congress believes she should be liable under Superfund for sending mashed potatoes to the local garbage dump. Nor does anyone believe she should have to pay staggering lawyers' fees to get herself out of this litigation nightmare. Congress could, and should, act now to free Mrs. Williams and get all those like her out of the litigation web. Mrs. Williams, her business, and her family should not be held hostage to some notion that if we wait to grant her justice another two years, or four years, we will enact highly controversial changes to the Superfund program. Comprehensive Superfund legislation will have to rise or fall on its own merits. Barbara Williams should not become a pawn in this legislative battle. 
Likewise, Mr. President, this body should ask the same questions about removing obstacles to brownfields development. Brownfields are often in cities, but also are located in many, many suburban and even rural areas. They are abandoned, or idle, former industrial properties. Some of these are contaminated, some are not. But it is the fear that these properties are contaminated that some say deters investors from buying them and redeveloping them. 
Mr. President, there are more than 500,000 brownfields staining this country's landscape. The nation's Mayors estimate they lose between $200 and $500 million a year in tax revenues from these properties sitting idle. Returning these sites to productive use could create some 236,000 new jobs. Our nation's Mayors, as well as developers and bankers, say immediate action is imperative, since new tax laws provide incentives for brownfields redevelopment, but expire in 2001. 
Congress should act before we adjourn to remove the unintended burden of Superfund liability that deters investors from buying and developing brownfields properties. Brownfields development results in significant economic benefits. It creates jobs and tax ratables for communities, which lowers local tax burdens on residents. The cleanup of brownfields also removes contaminants from our environment. These cleanup initiatives are win/win opportunities that make good environmental sense and good business sense. 
Mr. President, if this body takes steps to encourage recycling, which I support, I urge my colleagues to also take steps to encourage brownfields development and to free our nation's small business owners from the unfair and punitive penalties being assessed on them. It is in the interest of good government, and clearly in the interest of millions of Americans, that we do so. Let's act now to revitalize our communities. And let's act now, and let Mrs. Williams discharge her lawyer.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this resolution. I am pleased that we are passing this resolution on the second day of Hispanic Heritage Month because Puerto Ricans, like all Hispanic Americans, have made a great contribution to the culture and economic growth of America. 
There are nearly 4,000,000 American Citizens who live in the Islands of Puerto Rico. They are an integral part of our nation, they pay taxes and serve and die in our nation's military. Furthermore, there are millions of American Citizens with Puerto Rican heritage who live on the continent, hundreds of thousands of whom live in New Jersey. In many ways, New Jersey is a second home for Puerto Ricans. 
I strongly believe that the American citizens who live in Puerto Rico should have the right to a democratic vote to determine the future status of these islands. I am pleased that such a referendum will take place in December. After this vote, Congress should take the appropriate legislative action that reflects the will of the American citizens living in Puerto Rico. And I will work with my colleagues to make sure that this happens. 
I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express my outrage at the depraved criminals who are using the Internet to exploit children. 
Recently, the United States Customs Service, in cooperation with authorities in fourteen other nations, conducted successful raids on an extensive Internet child pornography ring. The ring, called the Wonderland Club, had been distributing more than 100,000 pornographic photographs of children. Some of the children were as young as 18 months. I am deeply disturbed, and disgusted, that people would victimize innocent children in this way. 
I want to commend the Customs Service and the other international law enforcement agencies involved on their successful effort. They made 46 arrests worldwide and there may be hundreds more after all the evidence is analyzed. The raids also covered 22 states, including one location in my home state of New Jersey. 
While this raid has put this one ring of Internet pedophiles out of business, I am concerned that there may be others. Many law enforcement officials are concerned that the advancements in Internet technology are making it that much easier for pedophiles to conduct their sickening schemes. Additionally, the anonymity of the Internet makes it easier for these criminals to evade detection. 
Clearly, we must fight back against these cyberspace criminals. One step that we can take is to ensure strong penalties for those who use the Internet for these horrible purposes. That is why I support the Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act of 1998. This measure would double the maximum penalty for sexual abuse of a child under twelve--from ten years to twenty years. It would also increase the prison terms and fines for anyone using the Internet, or the mail, to contact a minor for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity or transferring obscene material. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I hope it will pass the Senate before we adjourn this year. We must act quickly to help prevent another generation of children from suffering.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Latino community. As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to recognize the contributions made by millions of Latinos in our nation. New Jersey is a truly multi-cultural state and I am honored to help represent this vigorous community in the United States Senate. 
Mr. President, this month we celebrate a community with leadership which is notable in every facet of our society; which continually commits to family, education and business; and which is a vital force in our economy. Latinos have persevered, often under difficult situations, yet remain hopeful even as they strive for change. Hispanic elected officials and community leaders work to increase involvement in the electoral process, break the cycle of poverty and improve people's lives. Many Latino soldiers have made the ultimate sacrifice in giving their lives for the common good of our country. Today, I want to honor these brave Americans and their families. And I also want to honor Latina/o heroes and heroines like the late Julia de Burgos, Arturo Alphonso Schomburg, Cesar Chavez, Roberto Clemente, Puerto Bibliophile and Don Pedro Albizu Campos among others. These teachers, advocates, athletes, and activists have brought pride to their community, enriched our country, and provided role models for all of us to emulate. 
I commend the Latino community for its courage and persistence and want to warmly acknowledge the talent and vitality its expanding population brings to our nation. I thank the community for leading by example, and for promoting a national policy agenda which highlights very basic human necessities that should be the right of every American. 
Mr. President, a democratic and prosperous society, such as ours, should not step back from a national commitment to provide assistance to those who strive to achieve the American dream, despite the odds. In particular, I want to emphasize the importance of a quality education for the success of Latino children. Our Latino young people are a great source of strength and hope for the future and they should be able to participate fully in the American experience. We should not cut off benefits to children, the elderly, and disabled immigrants who entered our country legally and may have no other means of survival. Quality child care, early childhood development and work training initiatives are also critical investments that can make all the difference to Latino children. 
Mr. President, I am proud to honor New Jersey's Hispanic community today and to have the opportunity to ensure that Latino contributions, insights and sacrifices do not go unnoticed.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I wanted to announce that I am cosponsoring legislation authorizing the National Park Service to acquire and add lands to the Morristown National Historical Park. The Morristown National Historical Park is an important Revolutionary War site and this bill would authorize the Park Service to acquire lands from a willing seller to prevent the encroachment of modern residential and commercial development in an effort to preserve the visitor's experience of the park's historic landscape and enable the park to retain its rural character. 
The Morristown National Historical Park was established in 1933 and hosts approximately 550,000 visitors a year. The park preserves the sites that were occupied by General George Washington and the Continental Army during this critical period where he held together, during desperate times, the small, ragged army that represented the country's main hope for independence. General Washington chose the area for its logistical, geographical, and topographical military advantages, in addition to its proximity to New York City, which was occupied by the British in 1779. The site proposed for acquisition would be a 15 acre parcel near the Jockey Hollow Encampment Area of the park and prevent further degradation of the parks vistas. 
I invite my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation which will ensure that an important historical site for New Jersey and the nation is protected.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, late last week the Majority Leader indicated that the Senate would be unable to complete efforts this year to reform the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as it pertains to remediation waste. For many months, Senators Lott, Chafee, Smith, Baucus, Breaux and I have worked on `rifle-shot' legislation in this area. I regret that we were unable to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion. However, I believe that we made a lot of progress in narrowing differences and developing a bill that could have improved the RCRA hazardous waste cleanup program through a series of responsible reforms. Our work provides a solid foundation upon which to build in the next Congress. 
Mr. President, last fall, in October, the GAO issued a report recommending targeted reforms which, in conjunction with adequate resources for state and federal agencies, could have resulted in substantial savings in cleanup costs; encouraged treatment remedies; and sparked brownfields cleanup and redevelopment efforts. As Chairman of the Subcommittee in the Senate with jurisdiction over these issues for many years, and more recently as Ranking Democratic Member, one of my priorities has been to encourage such efforts, and to return these contaminated parcels to valuable uses. I believe such reforms can yield substantial national economic and environmental benefits while protecting human health and the environment. Such reforms would especially benefit my state of New Jersey, which is one of the five states with the largest volume of remediation waste. 
For these reasons, I was pleased that Senators Lott, Chafee and Smith invited Senator Baucus and me to join in developing a targeted consensus reform package. We spent many hours at this effort and we reached agreement in a number of areas. I regret that we did not come to final closure on this legislation. I want to thank my colleagues and the Administration for the considerable efforts they all made in thoughtfully resolving many of the complicated issues in this debate. I want to also thank Senator Breaux, who has been instrumental in championing reform in this area. Finally, I want to thank the many and varied stakeholders--representatives from industry, environmental organizations, as well as state and local agencies and community groups--that provided us with inestimable assistance in understanding this highly complex statute. 
Mr. President, I regret that we did not have the chance to resolve all of the issues this year. We made significant progress in resolving a host of thorny questions. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act has significantly reduced the generation of hazardous waste, and prevented new generations of Superfund toxic waste sites. I am optimistic that we can resume this process next year and achieve responsible reforms at that time. I pledge myself to these efforts.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today, Senator Kennedy and I join together, as we have in the past, in a ceaseless effort to provide some degree of justice for the families of the victims of the terrorist attack on Pan Am 103. This flight was brought down over Lockerbie, Scotland on December 21, 1988. 259 people on the plane and 11 others on the ground were killed. Most of the victims were Americans, making it the most fatal terrorist atrocity in American history. 
Two Libyan security agents have been charged with this heinous crime. They must be held accountable before a United States or United Kingdom court. The United Nations Security Council has imposed sanctions in an effort to make this happen, but for years this has brought no results. 
Recently, Secretary of State Albright proposed that the two suspects in the bombing of Pan Am 103 be tried in a Scottish court, under Scottish law, with a panel of Scottish judges, but physically located in the Netherlands. Libyan authorities have publicly accepted this proposal while calling for negotiations. 
I remain skeptical of Libya's willingness to cooperate with the international community in bringing terrorists to justice. But I also remain hopeful that the families of the victims will soon be able to end their painful wait for justice. I therefore believe we should give this potential solution an opportunity to work, while remaining determined to see the indicted terrorists brought to trial. 
The amendment we are introducing today therefore sets a reasonable time limit for action. It also calls for the imposition of additional multilateral sanctions measures, even including an embargo on oil exports, if Libya fails to turn over the bombing suspects for trial. 
The families of the victims of the Pan Am 103 bombing understand that nothing will bring back their loved ones. Nothing we do here can change that. But by adopting this resolution today we send the clear message that we are determined to see justice served and we will continue to increase international pressure on Libya until that happens.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce that resolution along with my colleague, Senator Torricelli, expressing our pride and our admiration for that very special group of youngsters from New Jersey. New Jersey has a national philosopher who dwells in its boundaries. His name is Yogi Berra. He is often quoted and I quote him now. I recall he said, `It's like deja vu all over again.' 
For another time, a New Jersey Little League team has won the prestigious Little League World Series championship, a group of exciting youngsters under the age of 12, vigorous sports figures now. I have seen them on television. I understand the 11-year-old pitcher got a request for marriage from an admirer. I don't think that is what he was striving for, but it happened. The honors accorded this group have been spectacular. 
This past Saturday, the Toms River East American Little League team clinched the honor, defeating Kashima, Japan, by a score of 12 to 9 to win the 52nd annual Little League World Series Championship. They are affectionately known as `The Beasts of the East,' these little guys. They are pretty good. They received a hero's welcome Sunday upon return home from the five-game series in Williamsport, PA, where they defeated teams from Jenison, MI, Cyress, CA, Tampa, FL, and Greenville, NC, before their final game with Japan. They are the fourth New Jersey team in history to win the Little League World Series and the first U.S. team in 5 years to win this title. 
Toms River East American has brought pride to its community and the entire State of New Jersey. They join the ranks of the New Jersey teams from Hammonton, the 1949 Little League champions; Wayne, NJ, the 1970 champions; and Lakewood, champs in 1975. 
All of the young men on the team deserve hearty congratulations for an incredible season. I give you their names: Mike Belostock, Eric Campesi, Chris Cardone, Chris Crawford, Scott Fisher, Brad Frank, Joe Franceschini, Todd Frazier, Tom Gannon, Casey Gaynor, Gabe Gardner and R.J. Johansen. 
These 12 young men are not only fine athletes, but they are also outstanding young people. They showed poise and dignity, and if one saw them in that game on national TV, unparalleled enthusiasm under pressure. 
Their manager, Mike Gaynor, and coaches, Ken Kondek and Joe Franceschini, Sr., all volunteers, shepherded these youngsters through a 28-game season. I commend them for their hard work and their dedication on behalf of Toms River's children. But I also must congratulate the parents, the families and the fans of the team's players who supported these young sluggers through thick and thin. They traveled long distances to root for their children, and they are truly the heroes behind the champions. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that the entire U.S. Senate will have a chance to join with me and Senator Torricelli in recognizing the accomplishments of not only the Toms River East American team, but also the greater Toms River community. New Jersey and the Nation owe a debt of gratitude to the `Beasts from the East,' their parents, families, friends and fans for allowing us to celebrate this important achievement. 
As Yogi Berra said, `I'd like to thank all of those who made this night necessary.' 
With that, I yield the floor. 
Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an individual who dedicated his life to public service, and who died leaving that legacy as a model for all of us. 
Alan Gibbs began his career in Baltimore, Maryland. After serving several years on the National Labor Relations Board he joined the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission right here in Washington, D.C. His work at the EEOC was recognized by his peers when he received the Commission's meritorious service award. Wherever Alan served there was always public acknowledgment of his contributions. New York City, Seattle and my home state of New Jersey were fortunate beneficiaries of Alan's energy, tenacity and commitment to bettering the lives of others. 
In 1977, Alan was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Army by President Carter. He was awarded the Distinguished Civilian Service Award--an honor not many are given but few deserve as much. 
In New Jersey, Alan served as the Commissioner of the Department of Human Services. During his tenure, Alan made sure that individuals were not lost in the shuffle or became faceless statistics. He was always compassionate and caring. The principle that guided his tenure, and is his most enduring legacy, was to give each individual the resources to live a life with dignity and hope. The job was not easy, but Alan got it done. 
Alan also gave of his time to teaching. He recognized the importance of education and helped equip students for their careers. 
Mr. President, I extend my deep condolences to Alan's wife Barbara, and their children Jordan, Philip and Cynthia. The outpouring of tributes to Alan are in reality a celebration of his life. I hope they bring comfort and a measure of joy in remembrance to his family.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Very quickly, I am pleased to hear the assurances. First, I commend the Senator from Iowa for bringing this to our attention because we were both of the same mind. Even as I read the letter sent to Senator Stevens and Senator Thurmond, to me, it looked like we were going to be put in a position where defense was going to be particularly well treated, and nondefense was going to be left out. But we have had an interesting colloquy here, a dialog, and I trust the chairman of the Budget Committee. I work with him all the time and have great respect for him. 
When he gives us an assurance that there will be no distinction, or no difference between the treatment given to defense and nondefense, I don't have to go a lot further. We have heard it. We have heard it directly from the chairman. We have heard it in this public forum. 
Mr. President, I yield the time I have in the interest of moving this along.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Ray Bramucci for the position of Assistant Secretary of Employment and Training in the Department of Labor. 
Mr. President, I have known Ray for many years. He is a man of enormous integrity, deep commitment to public service, and is ready and anxious to take up his responsibilities at the Department of Labor. Ray has a passion for making things better, and believes strongly in lifelong education and job training for our youth, especially our disadvantaged youth. He will give this job his full measure. I urge the Senate to move rapidly to confirm him. 
A leading figure in New Jersey politics and public affairs, Ray's expertise in labor-management relations, job training initiatives, employment services, and policy development provides a solid foundation for overseeing the administration of agency programs as Assistant Secretary. From 1990 to 1994, Mr. Bramucci served as Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Labor. In this position, he was a key cabinet member and principal advisor to the Governor on matters of both statewide and national impact, particularly in regard to economic development, education and training, and labor relations. 
Mr. Bramucci also served as Chief Executive Officer of the New Jersey Department of Labor, an agency charged with workforce training and preparation, protecting workers from exploitation, and providing income security through benefit programs for injured, ill, and unemployed workers. While in office, he successfully created and implemented a number of ground breaking initiatives, including the Workforce Development Partnership, a program which has helped to train and upgrade worker skills since July 1992 and is training over 15,000 workers today. He helped to establish the nation's first state-funded program to provide extended unemployment benefits to workers who had exhausted their regular claims, as well as the New Jersey State Employment and Training Commission and the Employment Security Council, two national leaders in reforming and revitalizing the worker security system. 
To the position of Assistant Secretary, he would also bring the skills he acquired in his 22 years of service as part of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. During this time, he rose from shop floor worker to eventually become the senior executive and key negotiator for the Union, in which he played a central role in negotiating hundreds of individual and industry-wide contracts. 
From 1979 to 1990, he was Director of New Jersey Operations for our former colleague, Bill Bradley. Ray was the eyes and ears for Senator Bradley in New Jersey, and a key adviser to him on political and policy matters. It was during this period that I got to know Ray well, and then when he served as Labor Commissioner. In recognition of his many accomplishments, he has been named to the Executive Board of CDS International, Inc., the Commission Board of the New Jersey Black Achievers Program of Business and Education, and President of the New Jersey Caucus Education Corporation. 
Mr. President, the Assistant Secretary for Employment and Training is charged with directing Department programs and ensuring that programs funded through the agency are free from unlawful discrimination, fraud, and abuse. Ray Bramucci has the experience and commitment to assume these responsibilities with sensitivity and skill. He will make an exceptional Assistant Secretary. I thank my colleagues for confirming Ray Bramucci so he can get on with the job.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I would like to express my support for the amendment offered by Senators Snowe and Reid. 
I applaud the efforts of these two Senators in bringing to our attention the inequities that exist for men and women in federal health care plans. 
Most federal employee health care plans (FEHBP) cover a wide range of prescription drugs without covering prescription contraceptive drugs. In fact, almost all federal insurance plans fail to cover all five of the most widely used forms of contraception. Ten percent have no coverage of contraception at all. 
A health care plan's refusal to cover contraception is effective discrimination against women. Access to contraception should be a basic health benefit for female federal employees. And women should be able to choose the best method of contraception for them, depending on their medical history and personal health care needs. 
If adopted, this amendment will certainly help lower the rate of unintended pregnancies and reduce the need for abortion. That result is something positive on which we can all agree. 
The Federal Government should be conscientious and fair about how it treats its employees. It should be a model for private insurance plans, guiding them to provide the best health care possible for those who enroll in government-sponsored plans. Not allowing access to a full range of contraceptive services to the women who work in our own Senate offices, to the civilian employees in the Pentagon, to FBI and DEA agents, and to the female officers on the Capitol Police Force, to name a few examples, is unfair and essentially creates a two-tiered health care system for public and private sector employees. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment, which eliminates the Tax Code without an alternative. 
Mr. President, I heard it said that we ought to `pull it out by its roots,' get rid of it now. Well, I would hate to go to a dentist with a toothache and have the dentist say, `You know what, we are going to look at this tooth. First, we will pull it out by its roots, and then we will look at it.' 
That is what is being proposed here, Mr. President. This amendment would get rid of the Tax Code, but without any indication of what would replace it. Instead, we could be left without any revenues to operate the government. We could be left with no revenue to support our military and protect our country. With no revenue to buy the weapons systems we need for the future to advance our country technologically. 
Mr. President, this amendment will create tremendous uncertainty in the business community. They're not going to know when they can make investments and when they cannot. For example, they will not know whether the R&D tax credit will be available. That is an important part of the code. But businesses will not know whether it will remain available if this amendment is enacted. 
Mr. President, I ran a big company that now employs 31,000 people. I started this company with two other guys, poor people from New Jersey. We built the company by planning ahead and making investments, often because we knew that there were tax benefits that we could count on. But if this amendment is approved, other entrepreneurs will not be able to make similar plans. 
What the distinguished Senator from Kansas is saying is, `Wait, before you do any investing, let's get rid of the Tax Code. Wander where you want through the jungle for a couple of years, and that will make the Congress respond.' 
I don't understand it, I must tell you. Sometimes I think I work in a different place from some of my colleagues, because the references are to `them.' 
`They will never get it done unless we pull it out by its roots.' 
`They will never get it done unless we make the pain excruciating.' 
`Fear of shutting down Government, fear of being unable to operate, that will make them move.' 
Who is the `them' and who is the `they'? Who is the `we' and who is the `us'? We are all in this together for the American people. 
Look at the economy. I hear about this oppressive Tax Code and the number of pages, and `Compare it to the Holy Bible.' 
`Holy cow,' that is what I say, `holy cow.' What are we going to do? Are we going to weigh these things? Do we want to buy a scale here and say if it weighs less than a certain number of grams, pounds, ounces, it is OK? But if it weighs over that, overboard? 
Go to the business community and ask them what they think about throwing it all away. They will tell you that we would only be punishing ourselves. 
Mr. President, I agree that the Tax Code is too complicated and too cumbersome. But the way to solve that is to offer something positive. It is to offer a real alternative. 
I also would point out, Mr. President, that eliminating the whole tax code could undermine much of the progress we have made in recent years. We have gone from a deficit of $290 billion six years ago, to a surplus that is now projected to be $60 billion. And for the next decade, we will have $1.5 trillion to pay down our debt. 
But this amendment would reverse this progress. It says that we want to play political games. That is what this is about. This is almost becoming a national sport here. It is not football, baseball or basketball, it is politics. 
We are going to take away the revenue code. Do you know what? You are not going to feel it, Mr. Citizen. Everything is going to be hunky-dory. And do not worry if the FDA can no longer approve new drugs. And do not worry if the National Cancer Institute can no longer do the research needed to help defeat breast cancer or prostate cancer or to help the newborn grow up healthy--no. No. We are going to fix the revenue code. But you are not going to have to pay any price. You know, Mr. and Mrs. America, you know there are free lunches all over this place. You don't have to pay for anything. 
Listen, no one here likes taxing people who work hard for their money. The President certainly doesn't. He says: Provide tax relief for families who send their children to child care so that they can go out and work. Provide relief to support education, so that we can have the best educated society on this Earth. That is where we want to give tax relief--to ensure that our children can get a good education. 
That is especially important in our age of technology in the new millennium. 
Mr. President, I come out of the technology business. I am, immodestly, called, `a member of the Hall of Fame of Information Processing.' My company was one of the earliest in the computer business, and we learned that technology is the way to the future. We helped start an industry called the computing industry. It is different than the computer industry. The computer industry is the hardware. The computing industry is all else. It is programs. It is engineering. It is all those things. It is an industry that is dramatically improving efficiency in so many ways. 
Mr. President, from my experience in the business community, I know the problems that would be created if we simply rushed out and eliminated the entire tax code without a replacement. It would be a serious mistake. 
Yes, the Tax Code ought to be simpler. Yes, people ought to pay less. But you don't get something for nothing in life. You don't get it in a country club, you don't get it in a schoolroom, and you don't get it in the United States of America. 
We have seen what happens with those countries where they have codes that say you don't have to pay--communism. You don't have to pay. They produced a society in Russia that is almost flat broke, dispirited, broken down, can't produce a product. We say let the free market operate, and let the Tax Code reflect what the objectives are; to build a society, to invest in this society, to give people a chance to get an education, to know that when they are 65 years old that Social Security is going to be there and its purchasing power is protected. 
What a remarkable thing we are witnessing today, and how in a few words here we like to disparage it. `It don't work. It ain't good. Get rid of it.' 
Here we produced surpluses when deficits were the rule. And we want, now, led by the President of the United States, to shore up Social Security so somewhere in the 2070s--it is pretty obvious I won't be running by then; I might, though--we want to make sure Social Security is there for our children, for our grandchildren. 
That is what we are doing now, and it is all part of a fiscal plan. You can't throw out the revenues without throwing out the expenses. I am sure the Senator from Kansas would say, `Of course.' 
Well, what expenses? The expenses for the military, the expenses for research, the expenses for development, the expenses for education, the expenses for clean air, the expenses for operating our national parks, the expenses for leaving a legacy for our children, that tell them there are still fish in the oceans, fish in the streams, so that they have something to look forward to. 
No; the mission is destroy first and then decide what you are going to do next. I spent 3 years in the Army, and I never had that. We always knew what the mission was before we started out on it. 
Mr. President, I am a member of the Budget Committee. I am the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee, and I expect that a point of order will be raised against this amendment because it violates the budget rules. I hope that our colleagues respond appropriately. 
I respect those who differ with me, but I will tell you this: If a company I was investing in decided that they couldn't figure out what the revenues were going to be and they wanted to operate and just go ahead and see what happens, make all kinds of investments, I would get out of there in a hurry. There is not a company in America who will make big investments if they do not know what the tax treatment is going to be. 
I am going to yield the floor, but I hope my colleagues are going to join me in standing up for what is right for America and do things in an orderly fashion. 
I have heard the plea made so many times: Why can't we operate like a business? Why can't we operate like families do? We want to do just that. We want to operate just like a business that plans its actions, lays it out on a piece of paper and says, `This is going to be our revenues, this is going to be our expenses, and this is where we want to be 5 and 10 years from now.' 
Instead, we now have a proposal that says, `What we can do, ladies and gentlemen, and the board of directors and the president of the company, is we are going to ask you to hold your breath, we are going to make the investment anyway and take the chance it is going to come out right.' 
Fire that guy. 
I yield the floor and hope that my colleagues will assess the threat that this reckless proposal poses to our Government, our Nation, and our economy.  
Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to recognize one of the few schools operating in America today dating from the pre-Revolutionary war days. The Newark Academy in Livingston, New Jersey, is celebrating its 225th anniversary this year, and deserves great recognition for its dedication to excellence in education since its formation in 1773. 
For students who prove to have strong academic ability, the school offers a traditional college preparatory program and over 50 interscholastic athletic teams. With a commitment to diversity, the Newark Academy represents 15 countries, 85 communities, and since 1964 has been fully co-educational. 
The Academy's motto, translated as `toward enlightenment,' is apparent throughout the workings of the school. With 548 students between the 6th and 12th grades, this day school launches many youngsters on a path towards enlightenment, adulthood and higher education. 
The Newark Academy's ability to grow and adapt to our changing educational needs, complexity of our society and the ever advancing world of technology has contributed to the strength of the Academy and established it as an example for other educational institutions to follow. I congratulate the administration, faculty and students of Newark Academy for the school's superior performance and wish them the best in the years to come.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Senate's Transportation Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999 which the Senate will approve today is of vital importance to the state of New Jersey. As the most densely populated state in the nation, efficient and effective transportation is critical to the economic well being of my state, as well as to the quality of life of its residents. 
The Senate's transportation appropriations bill provides over $900 million in transportation investments to my state. In addition, New Jersey will receive tremendous benefits from investments in Amtrak services, in the William J. Hughes FAA Technical Center in Pomona, in the U.S. Coast Guard training center in Cape May, the Coast Guard air station in Pomona, and in the airports in our state, particularly Newark International Airport. This investment provides good paying jobs in the short-term, and in the long-term, it will create and maintain the infrastructure that New Jersey needs to attract and keep a strong workforce. Ultimately, these investments will serve to reduce congestion, improve air quality, and enhance New Jerseyans' quality of life. 
Mr. President, I would like to highlight some of the important provisions in the Senate's bill which I was able to secure for the Garden State. 
Transit is an intricate part of Northern New Jersey's transportation plan. The single largest component of New Jersey's mass transit initiatives is the Urban Core. I was pleased to secure $70 million that will go toward additional design and construction of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail link. This rail line will reduce congestion and increase mobility, and will spur economic development in the communities along the Hudson County waterfront and into Bergen County. It will improve air quality, and provide needed construction, operation and maintenance jobs. 
In addition, the $12 million that is provided for the Newark-Elizabeth Rail Link is the first significant infusion of federal dollars that will seriously initiate this project. This mass transit project will first link Broad Street Station to Penn Station in Newark, extending past Newark International Airport, through the City of Elizabeth and into Union County. Also part of Urban Core, the Newark-Elizabeth Rail Link is an integral part of the `Circle of Mobility' that will serve to reduce congestion, improve air quality, and enhance New Jerseyans' quality of life. To date I have secured over $600 million for Urban Core projects. 
In addition to the Urban Core and transit formula assistance, the bill makes a number of bus and bus facility projects eligible for federal assistance. Among those are the Market Street bus maintenance facility in Paterson, New Jersey Transit jitney shuttle buses, Newark, Morris and Essex Station access and buses, the South Amboy regional intermodal transportation initiative and New Jersey Transit clean fuel buses. 
The bill also allocates $4 million to the National Transit Institute at Rutgers University, of which $1 million will go toward mass transit workplace safety training. 
Mr. President, I strongly believe that Amtrak is a critical component of our nation's transportation system, particularly in New Jersey and throughout the Northeast corridor. It provides safe and effective transportation to millions of customers every year, reducing congestion on our roads and in our skies. If Amtrak were not operating, there would be 18,000 cars a day on New Jersey's already dense highways. This is untenable for my state. Despite many difficulties, I am pleased that the Senate bill provides $555 million for Amtrak's national rail operations. This funding is in addition to the $2.2 billion in capital funding provided by the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997. This investment will allow Amtrak to continue its operations for another year and further enable it to reach its goal of self-sufficiency by 2002. 
Mr. President, the bill also includes a general provision concerning a High Occupancy Vehicle lane along I-287 in New Jersey. The provision would allow the state to remove the HOV restrictions without being required to reimburse the federal government for construction costs. A few years ago, I secured $140 million for the HOV lane in an appropriations bill at the request of the state. Now operational, the HOV lane is clearly not working, as only 72 cars an hour are using the lane, significantly less than the 600 cars expected. Currently, a state can appeal to the federal government to decommission an HOV lane without having to pay back the funds if it successfully makes the case that it is not `in the public interest.' Since the I-287 lane was directed by statute, the federal government does not have the authority to approve a state's appeal. The general provision allows New Jersey to appeal to the Federal Highway Administration that the lane is not in the public interest, and if the Secretary concurs, the state will not have to pay back the $140 million. No one is more committed to cleaner air, energy conservation, and innovations to cut traffic congestion than I. HOV lanes have worked in certain settings and I support them where they are successful. But, in New Jersey, it may be that our traffic patterns, work schedules and other issues make it difficult for the I-287 HOV lane to work. This provision removes a significant financial hurdle if the HOV lane is proven to be a failed lane. 
Mr. President, to make roads in New Jersey as productive as possible, the Senate bill includes $6 million for intelligent transportation system initiatives in New Jersey. These funds will go to advance projects already underway and managed by TRANSCOM, a consortium of 14 state and local agencies in the NY/NJ/CN metropolitan area. TRANSCOM is responsible for developing and coordinating the region's traffic management and incident detection system through the deployment of significant investments in intelligent transportation systems. Over half of the congestion on the region's roadways is due to traffic incidents and it is TRANSCOM's mission to improve inter-agency response to such incidents. 
Mr. President, transportation is the lifeblood of New Jersey and aviation is in the center of it. I am pleased to cite a number of provisions in this bill that improve upon the state's aviation system. First, the bill includes $11 million for the redesign of national air space, of which $3 million will be used to focus the FAA's efforts of redesigning the airspace in the New Jersey/New York metropolitan area. This funding will kick-off the redesign process, which will hopefully alleviate congestion and improve aircraft operations in the region's already dense and complex airspace, leading to fewer delays and reduced air noise levels. I was also pleased to secure $100,000 for a `technical assistance grant' for a community group to retain the services of an expert to ensure that citizens are represented and included during the FAA's redesign effort. 
I was also pleased to secure funding that will greatly improve operations at Newark International Airport. The bill provides $2 million to begin work on installing state-of-the-art radar upgrades and runway-monitoring improvements that will reduce delays and enhance safety at the airport. Moreover, the bill includes report language that recognizes the cooperative effort among the FAA, the Port Authority of New York/New Jersey, and airport users to make Newark Airport among the best in the country. The language directs the FAA to report quarterly on the progress of the cooperative working group and outlines the various equipment and initiatives that are priorities for the airport. 
The bill also includes report language expressing concern about staffing and equipment needs at New Jersey/New York area towers, the New York TRACON and the New York Air Traffic Control Center. This language will serve to direct the FAA to do all it can to improve the safety and efficiency of these facilities. And, the bill includes a provision directing the FAA to ensure that the air traffic controllers serving all the major FAA facilities in the region--air traffic control towers, the New York TRACON and the New York Center--are compensated equally. The FAA's proposed reclassification scheme would create a pay gap that does not recognize the equity of the work performed at the facilities and will force the experienced controllers serving the towers to go to the Center and the TRACON. The language prevents this from happening. 
Moreover, the bill fully funds the Hughes Technical Center in Pomona. The Technical Center is the world's premier aviation testing and development center, with state-of-the-art facilities and an impressive workforce. The bill provides funding to continue the good work at the Tech Center. 
Mr. President, I strongly supported funding for the Office of Pipeline Safety, and I am pleased that the bill provides $32.7 million for pipeline safety programs, with $1 million set aside for One-Call programs. These programs require anyone who is going to dig--contractors, utilities, for example--to find out the exact location of pipelines before they break ground. We in New Jersey know all too well the damage that a pipeline accident can have on victims of pipeline eruptions, and particularly to the community. Four years ago, around midnight, on March 24, 1994, a major natural gas pipeline ruptured in Edison, New Jersey, a densely populated, urban environment. This rupture caused a deafening boom, awakening residents of the Durham Woods apartment complex and changing their lives forever. The explosion was caused by third party damage, something a strong one-call program would address. Thus, the bill includes language emphasizing the importance of One-Call programs in preventing accidents. Two-thirds of all pipeline accidents are caused by people who dig without knowing of the locations of pipelines. 
Mr. President, the bill also provides $2 million for the Biomechanics Consortium, of which the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) is a member. These institutions study the effects of motor vehicle crash injuries on adults and children, resulting in the deployment of more effective life-saving safety devices. These life-saving funds are extremely important and I am pleased that the bill funds this program. 
Mr. President, the Coast Guard has an important presence in our state and I am pleased that it is well funded. In addition to the assistance provided to the air station in Pomona and the training center in Cape May, the bill fully funds the Coast Guard's Container Inspection Program (CIP) at $3.6 million. The CIP addresses environmental and safety problems posed by improper transport of containerized hazardous materials into U.S. ports. I established this program in 1994 to address the environmental and safety problems posed by improper transport of containerized hazardous materials into U.S. ports. This was highlighted by the 1992 Santa Clara casualty, in which several containers of highly toxic arsenic trioxide were lost overboard off the New Jersey coast, posing a substantial threat to the marine environment and its resources. Following this, the Coast Guard conducted intensive, targeted inspections and discovered wanton and widespread violations of container handling and packaging regulations. This program serves to prevent such casualties and protect the marine environment. 
Mr. President, having better, more efficient transit systems, roads, airports and all other transportation systems will improve the quality of life for thousands of residents and visitors to New Jersey on a daily basis. I am glad that as Ranking Minority Member of this Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee I was able to secure this funding, as well as the bill and report language for New Jersey. I appreciate the generosity shown by the Chairman of the Subcommittee, Senator Richard Shelby, who has been most cooperative and helpful throughout the process. His work will serve all New Jerseyans and the nation well.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Manager's Amendment includes $800,000 to hire additional assistant U.S. attorneys and investigators in Camden County, New Jersey. This amendment builds on an initiative that was originally proposed by Senator Specter. At his request, the bill provides $1.5 million to hire additional assistant U.S. attorneys and investigators in Philadelphia to enforce federal laws designed to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals. 
I appreciate Senator Specter's effort. I think that additional law enforcement funding will help stop the gun carnage on our streets. My amendment would expand this effort into Camden, which neighbors Philadelphia. I want to ensure that the crackdown in Philadelphia does not simply push gun criminals into Camden. Clearly, a cooperative effort will provide a more comprehensive solution for the entire region. 
I want to thank Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings for their help with this amendment.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to confirm my understanding of a provision that will be included in the manager's amendment to the Commerce, Justice and State appropriation bill. I had proposed an amendment that would provide $1 million to equip New Jersey State Police vehicles with video cameras. It is my understanding, and I want to confirm this with Mr. Gregg, the distinguished Floor Manager of this legislation, that these funds will be made available by reallocating $1 million to the COPS Program. That $1 million would then be directed to the New Jersey State Police for video cameras in its vehicles, in the same manner that COPS Technology Program funds are directed to various programs on page 61 of the Committee Report to this legislation, e.g., $935,000 for the Missoula County, MT, mobile data terminals.

I appreciate his cooperation and I commend him for all of his hard work on this legislation. I know that it is difficult to accommodate the various requests from colleagues, and I think he and his excellent staff do it with grace and understanding. I also want to thank Senator Hollings, the Ranking Member on the Subcommittee, it is always a pleasure to work with him and his fine staff. 
The video cameras that will be funded under this provision will help the police document evidence which will assist prosecutors and also protect the innocent. With these cameras in place, people who are pulled over will think twice before acting violently toward the police. Additionally, the cameras will ensure that the troopers are following proper procedures when they make traffic stops. 
In my home State of New Jersey, we must find ways to help resolve disputes and ease tensions between the police and the public they are sworn to protect. These cameras are an important step forward. 
Again, I thank Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings for their help in securing this critical funding.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I am obviously pleased that the Senate has now turned to the consideration of the transportation appropriations bill. It has been some time in coming. And action on the transportation bill has been delayed for several weeks while the committee sought to resolve some of the challenges that arise when there are vital interests needs to be met with too few resources to meet them. 
Mr. President, I first ask unanimous consent that Peter Rogoff, a member of my staff, be permitted privileges of the floor during the consideration of this bill.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, it is always interesting, to me anyway, that when we get to something like transportation and we start talking about the numbers and how much we are able to spend on highways and aviation, on buses, and rail, whatever we do, we still fall short on this country's needs for investment in infrastructure. 
There isn't a Senator here who doesn't come to Senator Shelby or me during the time of the negotiations looking for more opportunities to invest in infrastructure. They want to get rid of the potholes, get rid of the obsolete bridges, update our system. 
I know I speak for the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Shelby, with whom I have the pleasure and opportunity to work--Senator Shelby and I have known each other for some time. He is a man with specific opinions on things. I could be described as a `pussycat'--I don't think so. But we have our differences out on the table, and we work to resolve them. There is one thing in this relationship, and that is mutual respect. I want to say today that Senator Shelby has not only exhibited patience but also a genuine interest in resolving issues, getting rid of the problems, and getting on with the task. Between us, I think we have a pretty good piece of legislation. 
For me, one of the greatest challenges that we faced in developing this bill was finding the funds for Amtrak. Senator Shelby, as is his wont, spoke out about his views on Amtrak. But he has respect for others' views--for those people who see Amtrak as an integral part of the transportation system in this country, an essential part of the system. 
While he is concerned about the amount of subsidy that Amtrak is getting from the Federal Government, it is also bidding its way towards self-sufficiency. Until we have the proper kind of equipment that attracts riders, that can make the trip--and the trips are made in faster times, particularly in the Northeast section, where in just the few States that Amtrak goes through with probably 100 million people, it is a significant part of the population in the country. Yes, it requires subsidy, but so does aviation. 
We go beyond the ticket tax, which is significant. What we are saying to the people who ride in aviation is you pay a tax for this. We don't really say that in similar terms with Amtrak. You pay a heavy tax when you fly. The system is totally built by the taxpayer and local interests when it comes to aviation. If Amtrak didn't operate, I would like to point out that we would need 7,500 new flights a year on 757s to make up for the numbers of people who are carried on Amtrak. 
We were able to fashion a compromise which was in this bill reported unanimously by the Appropriations Committee on July 14. It includes $555 million for Amtrak for the coming year, and as the chairman noted, there is over $1 billion worth of funding; some of that in operating expenses; some of that in capital expense, but it is $66 million less than the level requested by the administration. 
Now, we are on the verge--1999 is the year--of getting high-speed rail equipment in the Northeast corridor. And for the benefit of those who are listening not familiar with it, the Northeast corridor is that corridor of traffic between Washington here in the South, and Boston on the northern run, with New York and Newark as the intermediate points along the way. 
Well, if we can get that ride down--and I think that we can--to less than 2 1/2 hours, I can tell you, Mr. President, I have been out at the airport many times to take a flight that was advertised to be 40 and 45 minutes, and it has taken 3 hours. It is not because the airplane is so slow. It is that it's so crowded we can't get off the ground. And sometimes I find when I land in the Newark area we have to wait 30, 40 minutes to get to a gate. We are straining at the seams. And if anybody rides the highways of America they know there is plenty of congestion. I don't care what State it is, you will find a place in those States where highway congestion is unbearable, the air is foul, and we are consuming far more fuel than we ought to because we are building a further dependence on the countries outside our shores that produce it. 
And so this investment in Amtrak is one that is going to be made to get us to be able to take delivery on the high-speed equipment which is due next year, 1999. 
I thank Senator Stevens, the chairman of the committee, and Senator Byrd, the ranking member of the full committee, as well as, again, Senator Shelby, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation, for helping us to find an acceptable funding level for Amtrak, and I also thank them for their patience throughout the process. 
The Transportation Subcommittee faced a real daunting challenge in constructing a bill that kept faith with the promises included in the recently enacted Transportation Equity Act. That is the transportation program for the next half dozen years for the 21st century. It is a beginning into the 21st century, and with our infrastructure investment, as modest as it is, I can't say that it is one of America's proudest achievements because we are woefully underfunded, but it is a good start in the 21st century and I am looking forward to building on that. 
The TEA 21, as it is referred to in acronym fashion, law authorized substantial increases in our surface transportation programs, and this appropriations bill includes a historic 15-percent increase for funding for the Federal Highway Administration, and an 11-percent increase in funding for the Federal Transit Administration. Separate from these well-deserved increases in the surface transportation area, the bill seeks to meet, to the best of our ability, the needs of the FAA. 
You heard me just reciting the fact that crowding in the air is not an insignificant factor. If you want to fly into the New York area, or you want to fly into the Chicago area, the significant metropolitan hubs across our country, you have to share that space, and if the weather turns foul you wait forever. We could upgrade the system. There are other countries that have systems where takeoffs and landings are done at zero visibility. It is done mechanically. The pilot has to be there, but that airplane can touch down safely when you can't see the ground. I know I have been in a couple of flights like that, and it is always a shock when you don't see something and you feel that hard ground beneath you. 
That is what we ought to be doing. We have to invest more in all of our transportation modes and aviation as well. The Coast Guard is one incredible agency. We ask so much of the Coast Guard. We not only have them out doing drug interdiction, which is a very popular part of their agenda, but if one looks at the marine system that we have in our country, the development of boating, fishing, the whole recreational aspect of marine life is there because the Coast Guard manages it. They put out the buoy markers. I know sometimes I get lost out there, so I can tell you that they are there. It is not that they have moved. It is that I haven't been able to find them properly. 
It is an incredible system. And on top of that, they do pollution patrol; they do a patrol to try to intercept illegal immigrants who want to get to this great country of ours and are willing to risk their lives to do it, sometimes in tire tubes out in the ocean. The Coast Guard is there to provide interdiction, but also humanitarian service as well. And when it comes to rescues at sea, boy, there is nobody better than the Coast Guard. They know how to do it, and they are called on by everybody on every occasion. 
We just saw a ship fire, the Carnival Cruise Line ship in Florida. The ones I saw right there on the spot were the Coast Guard. They are always there. They need constant investment. I know one of the complaints in some of the northern areas is they don't have enough icebreaking equipment, for instance. We get it sometimes from the Defense Department. 
So, when you put all these needs together, it is not an easy challenge. I say, once again, Chairman Shelby and his staff, Wally Burnett, Reid Cavnar and Joyce Rose, do a terrific job, as well as the people on my staff, Peter Rogoff and Liz O'Donoghue--I mentioned before Peter Neffenger--and Carole Geagley, for the job the staff has done. 
The staff has worked very hard. I don't think it is realized outside that by no means are these 9 to 5 jobs. Yes, they are. I am sorry. They are 9 at night to 5 the next morning. That is the kind of jobs they are. We give them time off to sleep, go home, meet their families, say hello to their newborns, get breakfast--the work requirement is beyond comprehension, in many cases. But it gets done, and I am proud of what we did this year. 
Mr. President, as Members are aware, and the chairman brought it up, the bill as reported by the Appropriations Committee contains an extremely controversial rider. It is something regarding Project Labor agreements. The provision effectively wanted to stop labor-management agreements that have served successfully for years to hold down construction costs and improve working conditions. Imagine--on those occasions, which are too few, where management and labor shake hands across the table, no longer could they say, `These are the conditions we are going to be working under. This is what you can expect from us, and this is what you can expect from us; we are going to bridge our differences now, before this job starts. We are going to decide on things like pay scales and work schedules and health care--all of those things. We are going to decide together on the schedule that we want to meet. We want to be proud of this job when it is finished.' 
The chairman of the Appropriations Committee used a reference. He said in the Alaskan pipeline they had an agreement that saved billions of dollars, because everybody understood exactly what their responsibilities were and there was no room for work stoppages or things of that nature. It is a system that works. Why some people felt it was time to stop it, I don't understand. But I respect the differences that we have here. 
The issue was discussed at length during full committee markup of the bill. As Senator Shelby noted, Chairman Stevens asked us to defer this until we get to the floor and get this bill out there so Senators can see it and understand what we are doing. We did just that, and the result is we have a compromise that Senator Stevens sought to develop that would allow the bill to move forward and gain the President's signature. 
Senator Shelby and others involved, Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts, and I, agreed this was a consensus with which we could live. I am delighted that took place so we did not have to wrangle over it. We want to get this bill in place so when the new year starts, October 1, we are ready to go with the new spending levels and new programs. 
Once we have concluded our opening remarks, we are going to adopt the managers' amendment that encompasses a compromise on this issue, so all parties are agreed they will live with it. I thank my colleagues for their efforts in reaching this compromise. 
In closing, I want to express my view that the most important funding in this bill is not for any individual project or any individual State. The most important funding in the annual transportation appropriations bill is the taxpayers' dollars that we commit to maintaining safety throughout our national transportation network. 
Safety in the skies--we know we are crowded, we know we are busy, and we know there is a terrific strain on the staff who maintain the aviation system, the controllers, those in the towers and those in the service routes along the way. They do a terrific job. One need only look at the accident record, the number of people. Senator Shelby mentioned there are 600 million travelers a year. Look at that and thank the Lord, look at the accident record. You will see one of the nearly perfect systems that one could imagine operating in our skies with all that volume. 
We want the same thing on our roads. We want to reduce drunk, careless driving. We would like to even reduce road rage. I don't know how we do it. Sometimes we get into rage here, but we should be able to do that. 
Safety on our waterways--again, the Coast Guard is there marking out routes. It is just a terrific facility that we have. 
So, safety is the No. 1 priority of my agenda. It is the No. 1 priority for the Secretary of Transportation, Secretary Slater, and for the President of the United States. He talks about it a lot. And Senator Shelby indicated he is interested in safety. 
I am hoping one day we will be able to shore up our .08 blood alcohol level bill. We passed a bill that goes part of the way, but we have to go further in order to make it complete. The worst thing that can happen to a family is to lose a youngster, a young person, to an automobile accident when we try so hard to bring them up, to raise them and encourage them, and then have somebody get in a car where someone has been drinking too much and end their life. 
We are focused on safety. We are going to do that. I cannot overemphasize the responsibility that every Senator has in ensuring our transportation laws protect the safety of our traveling public to the maximum extent possible. The fate of the traveling public is truly in our hands each and every day. During the up and coming debate we are going to discuss a number of amendments that are critically important to the safety of our constituents. 
With that, I yield the floor to my colleague. We are ready to consider amendments and start with the managers' amendment.

Otherwise, I think we are seriously ready to go. I am feeling a little light-headed because we haven't heard a lot of criticism. But the bill is here. If there are people who want to amend it in any way, let them come down now or forever hold their peace, or something.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio presents, I think, very effectively the case for continuing the efforts that we have had in the past--some quite successful--to intercept the drug trafficking, and to make sure that we do not let down our guard, and to maintain the facilities and personnel that we need to do it. 
The thing I am concerned about--and I commend the Senator from Ohio for bringing this to our attention; we will be looking at this over the next period of time--the offset for this amendment, if I am not mistaken, is proposed to come out of the administrative costs at DOT; am I correct in that?

<DOCNO>105-lautenberg-nj-14-19980723</DOCNO>

Mr. LAUTENBERG. That account has been severly tested. We will look closely to see if we can put together the package that the Senator from Ohio is recommending. 
I do send up a note of caution as we look at it. We have been warned that we could face a RIF, reduction in force, at DOT at the levels currently in the bill for administrative expenses. 
The chairman and I have been very careful to try to make sure that the dollars we expend are those that are most effective in providing transportation facilities, helping the Coast Guard, helping FAA, and we have been all along trying to reduce the administrative side, the travel side, all of those things. We are both staunch supporters of the Coast Guard with our coastal States and in deep appreciation for what the Coast Guard has done. 
The drug interdiction mission I talked about earlier today, and I am prepared on this side to accept the DeWine-Graham amendment, but I have to know that the chairman and I are going to take a fresh look at DOT's administrative costs in conference.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I note with interest that all Members on the floor now are members of the Budget Committee, which I think is particularly significant, because we are here talking about not only Social Security and our obligation to make the system solvent--to create a degree of confidence that, looking out into the future, we are going to be able to say to people, some who have already worked a dozen years: Worry not, we are here going to solve the problem of the question of solvency on the Social Security fund and it will be there for you --but we are also, at the same point, talking about the work done to get ourselves to a balanced budget point and, beyond that, to develop the surplus stream that we now see flowing very mightily. 
The fact is, I think the Senator from South Carolina has worked so hard for so many years on the independence and on the solvency of the Social Security trust fund that he is almost `Mr. Social Security.' No questions are raised about Social Security when the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, isn't there defending the system and defending the right of those who expect to have the benefits to have them there at the time they need them. 
We shouldn't start spending those projected surpluses that look like they are going to be in abundance until we confront our biggest long-term challenge, and that is to make sure that we have done the things necessary to solve the questions about the Social Security trust fund. 
We need to ensure that younger Americans can benefit from the system, just as their parents and their grandparents are benefiting today. Once we fix that Social Security system and we have really done the job, we can consider using any remaining surpluses to provide real tax relief to ordinary Americans, to put more money in the pockets of struggling middle-class families. 
Yes, they are enjoying this prosperity that we have, but I don't know many of them who feel like their heads are that well above water that they can provide the education their children will need to help ensure that they, too, will have a decent quality of life, one that is better than those who are working now. They need some help, and we want to do it. 
We have a commitment that, first, we are going to start putting that money into the Social Security system, so that in the later years they have the reliability of the pension fund, of the Social Security fund. When we have done that, then we can, again, help the middle-class families afford education, health care, and take care of our infrastructure. 
The point of this amendment is to say, before we start raiding projected surpluses, that we have some hard work to do. We ought to make the decisions that say to our young people, `Your retirement is going to be there,' to do exactly what it is that the President pledged when we saw the surplus coming, and that is, save Social Security first. 
Social Security isn't just another Government program, it is the most important social insurance program in our Nation. It has dramatically reduced poverty among older Americans, and it provides a critical safety net for those who suffer from disabilities or the death of a family member. 
Keep in mind that a majority of American workers have no pension coverage other than Social Security; that is it. Nearly a third of all seniors get 90 percent or more of their income from the program. Without Social Security, more than half of the elderly would live in poverty. 
It is absolutely critical that we maintain this safety net for future generations. Yet, Social Security's long-term viability is now threatened by the impending retirement of the baby boomers. Unless we act, the trust fund will become insolvent in the year 2032. Do we want to say to people who have already worked a dozen years of their life, on average, that you can start to envision life in your later years without the help that comes from Social Security? We can't let that happen. 
Given the importance of solving the Social Security problem, Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have supported the concept of `saving Social Security first.' In 
fact, I remind my colleagues that the Senate already has approved a budget resolution that proposes to save all future budget surpluses. 
I didn't support that resolution because, like some other Democrats, I felt it shortchanged important priorities like education and child care and created procedural obstacles to comprehensive tobacco legislation. But I did support the resolution's fundamental approach on the use of surpluses. The budget resolution said that all new spending and all new tax breaks will be fully offset, and it was the right thing to do. 
My friends on the Republican side of the aisle, especially the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee who sits here now, Senator Domenici, deserve credit for a job well done. He worked hard, as we all did, to get this budget into balance and to make sure that we start on the road to developing some surpluses and protecting Social Security. 
Unfortunately, some Members are now suggesting that, `OK, we have some money in the bank; it looks like it is going to be there; let's start spending the projected surpluses.' Frankly, I think it is a peculiar irony that we see some of those who are most concerned about fiscal discipline, sound fiscal policy, are now saying, `Hey, this is the time to start getting rid of these surpluses.' I don't understand that when we are so deep in the hole. No one would advise a family or a business owner to do the same thing. When you have debt on your hands--and we have plenty of it, and it was noted by the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire that most of that debt belongs to the Social Security trust fund--I don't understand what it is that suddenly has impelled these folks to want to now spend the money. 
The weakening of the budget discipline seems to be based in part on new budget projections released only last week by CBO. They are now estimating surpluses in future years will be larger than originally anticipated. It is great news. According to the CBO, the unified surplus this year will be $63 billion, and by 2008 that figure will grow for that year to $251 billion. 
These figures are cause for celebration and they are cause for pride. They show that the disciplined policies we have adopted since President Clinton took office, including last year's bipartisan budget agreement, are working. Members on both sides of the aisle deserve credit for that. But CBO's new projections should not be used as an excuse to throw fiscal discipline out the window. They don't change the fact that Social Security still faces real, long-term problems. The trust fund, I repeat, will become insolvent, based on current projections, in 2032. We have to do something about that before we squander any of the projected budget surpluses. 
I fully support providing tax relief to ordinary working Americans. I want to strengthen at the same time our Nation's commitment to education and health care. But there isn't any reason why we can't provide tax relief or invest more in education, and we can do it today if we pay for it. What we ought not to do is start treating future surpluses as a giant piggy bank for an excuse to abandon the fiscal discipline that got us to the good condition we are in today. 
I also note that if Congress goes on a wild spending spree, the costs will not be limited to the long term. We could also trifle with investor confidence, and that then could create an upset in the market, about which everyone is concerned. People will be watching and saying, `When is the downturn going to come?' It could threaten our economy. 
Importantly, raiding the surplus could undermine, once again, this great opportunity that we have to secure Social Security for those in the long-, long-term future. It would be unfair to those baby boomers and other young Americans. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment. Let's maintain our commitment to fiscal discipline. Let's continue the long-term thinking that got us to the good position we are in today.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you. Madam President, I will just take a few minutes out of the distinguished Senator's time to illustrate what is being discussed here in as direct and simple terms as possible. This chart really does it. 
For years now, the Senator from South Carolina has been sounding the alarm. He has been the Paul Revere of Social Security for years now. He is always calling our attention to the fact that, yes, we now have enough to fund the needs of the Social Security payout program, the beneficiaries. But look out for the future, watch out, there is a train wreck coming. And he works at it all the time to make it abundantly clear. I hope the message gets through. He endorses, as we do, and as our friends on the other side of the aisle said today--and I will use the word perhaps `admitted' today--the best idea is to save Social Security first. 
Well, frankly, I was a little astounded at what I heard here. In the same breath, they said we are taking in more than we need to spend for Government, so essentially let's get rid of that which is left over. I wonder if the same proponents of that type of a policy would say to their kids, `Listen, kids, if you have more money than you need today, spend it.' I doubt it. Would you, if you were running a business, decide that if you had more than you needed for today's expenses, you would go ahead and spend it? 
I ran a big corporation before I came here. One of the things that we always tried to do was to make sure that we were putting away the funds necessary for long-term investment, for new programs, for new marketing, for new production, to make sure that we would be ready for the future to stay competitive. That is what we are saying now. We are saying, yes, yes, to tax relief for hard-working Americans. But the first thing that we committed to do is to make sure that we save Social Security. I use the term `SOS,' which is the international call for help--save our security, save our Social Security--SOS. 
The Senator from South Carolina has been the one who stood here in the face of all kinds of opposition and worked hard to make sure that the message got through. Finally, it is getting through. And now, as it gets through, we want to spend it. 
Here is the picture in very simple terms. In the 5 years, including 1999 to 2003, we will have a surplus that includes Social Security--includes Social Security. I repeat, we take in on Social Security more than we spend; thus, we are able to portray a surplus--$520 billion in 5 years. Now, if we take out the Social Security surplus--that means the funds that the people pay in through their payroll taxes--we wind up with a $137 billion deficit. So we ought not to continue this sleight of hand, as I call it, which is what is helping us to create these surpluses. 
From 1999 to 2008, the surplus is Social Security; $1.540 trillion is created because we include the Social Security balance in there. And if we follow the policy that we have developed now, we will use those funds to project the life of Social Security off into the future--into the foreseeable future, beyond 2070. If we don't use the Social Security surplus, we wind up, in this same 
period of time, with $31 billion compared to $1.5 trillion. 
So when I hear that, yes, we want to save Social Security, oh, absolutely; we want to send the message out to those who will come of retirement age in the years ahead that it will be there for you. But it can't be there for you if we spend it now, if we go ahead and do as we have heard said and subscribe to the Republican policy of huge tax cuts, as it comes over from the House. Get rid of this surplus; get rid of it now; let everybody feel good; let everybody believe this is good business practice --while we go broke in the process and create debts that we will never be able to meet. 
So I hope that we will take the amendment by the Senator from South Carolina and get it passed. I like the amendment that we hear about from the Senator from New Hampshire because in it they say very clearly, save Social Security first. The language is precise: `and return all remaining surpluses to the American taxpayer.' So there is first and there is second. The second part of this is returning the surpluses to the American taxpayer. Everybody wants to see tax relief available to those who are working and trying to take care of their families' needs and provide education and job opportunities. But we can't do it with this kind of hocus-pocus that we are seeing here. 
Nobody here who understands financial balance sheets would permit this kind of thinking to overtake their judgment if they were running a business. I would not, and I know the Senator from South Carolina would not, and our colleagues on the other side would not do it, either. But when you sprinkle it with a little bit of politics in there, the tune changes, and the tune is: Spend it while you got it, baby. That is what is being said here on the floor of the Senate. I think, frankly, it is the kind of a message that the American people will see through. 
With that, I yield the floor.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Durbin in introducing the Brady Waiting Period Extension Act of 1998. 
This legislation will build on the incredible success of the original Brady Act, which I cosponsored. Since that law went into effect in February 1994, our hard-working law enforcement officers have prevented more than 240,000 felons, domestic abusers, and mentally ill people from buying guns. In 1997 alone, 69,000 prohibited purchases were stopped. Because of the Brady Act, and the Domestic Violence Gun Ban which I authored, over 6,000 criminals convicted of domestic violence offenses were prevented from buying a gun last year. 
These laws are working. They are saving countless lives, helping to protect women and children, and making our streets safer. Just imagine how much more gun violence there would have been, if these gun purchases had not been stopped. 
And the Brady Act does more than just stop handgun purchases--it helps the police put violent criminals behind bars. Consider just a few examples: 
The Brady Law stopped a handgun sale in Colorado to a man who was wanted for armed robbery in the State of Washington. As a result of the Brady check, he was arrested in Colorado and extradited back to Washington. 
In Utah, an individual trying to purchase a handgun from a pawn dealer was arrested by the Salt Lake City Police Department on a felony warrant held by the State of Colorado for aggravated sexual abuse of a child. 
Incredibly, criminals continue to try to buy guns at gun stores. But thanks to the Brady Law, they do not get the deadly tools of their trade, and lives are saved. 
The legislation I am introducing today will build upon this success. As my colleagues know, the five-day waiting period for handgun purchases will expire in November of this year, and be replaced with a computerized background check system. While we all hope that this computerized system will work well, there are some potential problems. The Department of Justice and the FBI have done a good job centralizing most crime record, but some information, like restraining orders and mental health records, will not be available through the system. 
Our bill will ensure that no criminals slip through the system, by requiring that the Brady forms be sent to the chief law enforcement officer where the buyer resides. This requirement will give local police the opportunity to look through local records and determine whether the buyer is a prohibited purchaser. 
This legislation will also provide a 72-hour waiting period for handgun purchases. By maintaining a brief `cooling off' period, we can help prevent crimes of passion and suicides. When you consider that 20 percent of funds used in murders are purchased in the week before the crime, this provision will help save lives. 
Mr. President, these are sensible provisions that will help reduce gun violence in our nation. And make no mistake about it, there is much work to be done. 
In the United States, firearm violence is currently the second leading cause of injury-related death, behind automobile-related fatalities. This violence is increasing at an alarming rate. By the year 2003, firearm fatalities are projected to become the United States leading cause of injury-related death. 
Violence is taking a terrible toll on our children. Homicide is the third leading cause of death for youths 5 to 14 years old and the vast majority of these homicides were committed by firearms. 
Mr. President, our nation can do better. We can and we must stop the gun violence on our street. The Brady Waiting Period Extension Act will help us toward that goal, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I thank my colleague from Iowa and commend him for raising this issue and for presenting a way--that has been thus far deterred from becoming law--of reducing teen smoking. That is the mission here. We have already seen the leadership kill the comprehensive tobacco bill. So in the wake of the tobacco bill's death, the only existing nationwide program to reduce the teen smoking of cigarettes is an FDA rule. The FDA program needs this additional funding. 
We went through extensive debate. I do not know whether the Senator from Oklahoma is still on the floor, but he voted for this when we considered it before. Those who oppose this funding once again stand to say no to protecting our kids, to trying to reduce teenage smoking. They are standing directly or inadvertently with the tobacco industry. 
Mr. President, the FDA rule prohibits--nationwide--the sale of tobacco products to anyone under the age of 18. Without sufficient enforcement money, the rule is unnecessary because it will lack the teeth to force retailers to comply. 
Friends of big tobacco have already blocked our attempt to pass a comprehensive effort to reduce teen smoking, and now what we will see is tobacco's influence once again prevailing here. They are going to be able to thwart our existing efforts to control teenage smoking. 
What is their mission? Their mission is to get 3,000 kids every day to buy a pack of butts that is going to ruin their health in not too many years. So the money that we approve today is a bargain compared to what we will be forced to spend in later years in treating smoking-related illnesses. 
Mr. President, this is a fairly simple issue. If we adhere to what we say is our code of conduct--and that is to reduce teen smoking--then the rest of this debate is superfluous, I must tell you. Yes, we ought to try to find a way to pay for it that is as directly connected to the FDA rule as possible. That is what we have attempted to do here. 
But whether or not you are supporting this amendment has little to do with the funding issue; it has to do with whether or not we really believe that stopping teen smoking is a good objective. I hope that we will see that in a vote that is soon to come, Mr. President. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it has been inquired all around the country, by many people, as to whether or not the tobacco industry won its fight here in the Capitol. Did they bowl us over? Did they get the Congress to knuckle under? Are they so powerful that, over the will of the American people, the tobacco industry prevailed? 
And we say no. There is an amendment that has been offered by the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, that would give us a chance in the Senate to choose between the tobacco industry, the tobacco lobby, their friends, and our Nation's children. 
This amendment would put a real dent in a public health catastrophe that has touched nearly every American family. There are few of us who have not heard about the ravages of tobacco on a friend or relative, or seen people we know weakened from respiratory conditions caused by the use of tobacco--smoking, and how it changed the structure of their lives, how they are unable to do the things that they used to do: participate in sports, play actively with their children or their grandchildren--or how they suffered premature death. 
Too often, on the Senate floor, we have heard opponents of the tobacco bill parrot the propaganda of the tobacco industry. I would like to take a moment to review the real issues in this debate. 
The tobacco industry still lives in a privileged regulatory environment set up by its backers throughout decades. We have now learned something about what they discussed in the privacy of their boardrooms, in the privacy of their records, in the 
privacy of their marketing schemes, knowing full well that if they manipulated their product, if they introduced more nicotine, if they changed the advertising, that they could capture the market replacements that they needed to maintain their profits and their revenues. They knew if they tweaked their ads in a certain way, they could get young people to pick up smoking. Joe Camel became better known, it was said, than Mickey Mouse. 
The reason the industry targets our children and engages in other corporate misbehavior is that, aside from the courts, the industry does not face any real oversight of their actions, despite their devious actions to fool the public. The tobacco amendment that we have before us would put oversight in place. That is the primary reason that the industry's friends killed the bill last month. They killed it because they didn't want to have their market opportunities reduced. They didn't want to let the children, the young people in our society, get by, live normal lives, without their life expectancies being impaired. They didn't want to protect the families and the well-being of our citizens, because it meant cash to these folks. It meant that their market might shrink a little bit, that their stock prices might go down, that their salaries might be decreased. They didn't care about the damage they wrought--not at all. We see it in testimony, some of which was given under oath, which has some questions surrounding it. 
This amendment would establish unfettered FDA jurisdiction over tobacco products, so people would know what is there, so people would know that smoking can really do a job on you. I know many people have talked about the importance of FDA jurisdiction, but I want to describe what it really means. It means that the Federal Drug Administration has the capacity to enforce their anti-teen-smoking efforts. It means that they will have clear statutory authority to enact the appropriate constitutional advertising restrictions to protect children. 
FDA authority also means that smokers will know what chemicals and additives are put into the cigarettes they smoke. We did some research in my office on this subject and found out there are some 500 ingredients that are in a pack of cigarettes and some of these things are really toxic. We restrict their use in normal functioning in our society because we know how dangerous they are. When our constituents enter their local grocery or drug stores, cigarettes and other tobacco products are the only products meant for human consumption that do not disclose their ingredients. We ask it of food products. We are getting stricter all the time about what you have to worry about with meat and how you have to cook it and treat it. So, too, with vegetables. We see advertisements: `Organically grown.' But when it comes to tobacco, they put up, to use the expression, a pretty heavy smokescreen. 
Last year I introduced a bill to inform consumers about the ingredients and chemicals in tobacco products. Although we know that most smokers are aware that cigarettes are `bad for you,' I don't think the vast majority of smokers, or citizens, realize that there is arsenic and benzene and lead in the smoke they consume. These are things we prohibit. We prohibit the use of lead in paint today. We prohibit the use of benzene in products where it used to be routine. And arsenic--everybody knows that arsenic is a poison. Not only will the FDA require, under this amendment, the tobacco companies to disclose the presence of these chemicals, but it will also make sure the tobacco industry takes appropriate steps to decrease these poisons in their products. 
For years, the tobacco companies hid health secrets and secretly manipulated the ads as to the nature of their products. Under strong FDA jurisdiction, the tobacco industry will have to play by the rules. And, like other industries that produce drugs, they are going to be subject to the appropriate oversight to protect the consumers, to protect our citizens. It is long overdue. 
One thing we have to remember in the argument with the tobacco companies, the arguments that we have with them, is that this is not just another business, this is a business whose products are going to kill you if you use them, and there is no denying that. This is a business that is designed to make an addict out of you--addicts, over 45 million in America today. If this business was conducted in a less auspicious place than a boardroom of a tobacco company, and if it was a group of individuals who said, `We have a way to weaken America and here is the plot: 
We can kill over 400,000 Americans every year, and no one is going to say anything to us. Further, we cannot only encourage people to use the product, but we can start with them when they are children.' 
Do you know what? They will be more addicted to this product than many of them are addicted to illegal drugs. If we do this, we can cost America $100 billion in lost productivity and in health care costs; we can attack the American Nation, killing 400,000 people in a year, more than eight times the number that we lost in Vietnam in all the years of that war, a period of time when almost all America went into mourning about the loss of these young lives, these brave people; 58,000 died there--and here we lose 400,000 people a year, more than all of the wars that this country fought in this century. In one year, we kill more Americans with tobacco than those lost in combat in the 20th century. 
Mr. President, this amendment is going to require the tobacco products and advertisements to have large, clear warning labels that will send a strong message to kids about the real consequences of smoking. We are not just going to say `could be dangerous to your health.' And we are not going to permit it to be in colorful ads to make the young people feel like this is the macho image, this is the cool image that they want to portray. These warning labels will not be hidden in small type on the side of a pack of cigarettes. These labels will be prominently displayed in large type on each side of the pack of cigarettes. 
They will contain simple, truthful messages about the dangers of the product: Cigarettes are addictive; cigarettes cause cancer; and smoking can kill you. All true. All to the point. These new warning labels will add a strong dose of truth to the industry's deceitful billboards and other ads. They are not going to continue to see the guy on horseback roping the cattle or the champion swimmer or the champion athlete. No, those are bogus claims. We don't believe those anymore. But the problem is there has been an impression created in the minds of America that goes back decades, and smoking appeared to be cool. Every movie actor and every movie actress not too many years ago would have a cigarette hanging out of their mouth. 
When I was a soldier in the Army and I was in the war zone, they made sure we had in our rations little packs of cigarettes, little sleeves with three or four cigarettes, as I remember, in each of them, free, to make sure you felt good about what you were doing. At the same time, they were creating addictions that we now wrestle with in our veterans population. 
What we want to see is the Surgeon General's warning clear and concise, clear and perceptible, instead of the industry lies like `Alive with Pleasure.' We have seen that on billboards. It ought to read: `Dying with pain,' `Dying too early,' `Unable to compete,' `Unable to function,' `Unable to take care of your family,' `Unable to stay with your children as they grow,' because tobacco is dragging you down all the way. 
This amendment will require a truthful health warning to be printed on 20 percent of the billboard service. See it: `Cigarettes kill'; `Dying with pain.' That is the message that has to be out there, not this deceitful message that says, `You are going to feel good.' 
There was a time, I remember, when they used to say doctors smoke one brand more than any other, because it had the real taste, it was good, it made you feel good. 
The tobacco industry and their friends don't want us to deliver this message to the public. 
This amendment, Mr. President, contains strong look-back provisions that were improved by an amendment approved overwhelmingly by this body 66 votes to 29. I want to explain this look-back provision. 
It says that if you haven't gained the objective--and that is to reduce the number of teenagers who are picking up smoking--you and your company are going to have to pay and pay substantially. It is going to put teeth in our effort to dramatically reduce teen smoking. 
The real experts on marketing cigarettes to children are the tobacco companies themselves. So let them work to reduce that number. They have done a masterful job, and now they have to undo it. 
Mr. President, we know that the most efficient and effective way to dramatically reduce teen smoking is to raise the price, and this amendment will do that. A variety of factors contribute to a teenager's decision to try that first cigarette or to chew that first bit of spit tobacco. I know, because I smoked for 25 years. I took up smoking when I was a teenager, and I sure reinforced the image when I served 3 years in the U.S. Army. 
But we know that once you begin--tobacco companies know--most citizens don't realize that the first cigarette or the 15th or the 20th cigarette that you smoke is the reaction that says you are going to do this for the rest of your life whether you like it or not. How many people have we ever met in our lives--I know I have met, I will say, thousands who said to me, `Boy, I quit once for 3 months, but then something 
happened, and I started again.' Or `I tried 100 times to stop smoking, and every time I have it licked, I come back to it.' 
We know that addiction is the tobacco industry's game. That is what they want to do: Get you addicted, and then the marketing is easy. 
Mr. President, another issue I have long been involved with is secondhand smoke. As many of my colleagues know, I, with the help of then-Congressman Durbin, now Senator Durbin, authored the legislation that prohibited smoking on airplanes. It is now 11 years ago. 
It was the first real dent in the tobacco industry lobbying armor, and it was the first step toward the eventual goal of an overall national standard on secondhand smoke. We know, and I see it all the time when I talk to people, if I tell them that I was the author of the smoking ban in airplanes, boy, they love it --`That is the greatest thing you have done.' When I am searching for applause, speaking to an audience, I always tell them that and they all applause. These are people who remember how unpleasant it was to be in an airplane filled with tobacco smoke. The result is that secondhand smoke is very dangerous to the health and well-being of people.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I introduce the Industrial Emergency Notification Act of 1998. The bill will require the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to require that employers notify local emergency officials, like police and fire departments, in the event of workplace emergencies. Passage of this bill will help prevent accidents such as the explosion that took the lives of five men three years ago at Napp Technologies in Lodi, New Jersey. 
One mark of our progress as a society is the extent to which we can guarantee every working man and woman a safe, healthy workplace. No one should have to risk their health and safety to make a decent living. Sadly, the Napp explosion showed us how far we have to go. 
Among other things, the Napp explosion showed the loopholes that exist in current OSHA regulations. On the day of the explosion, after the chemical mixture started smoking, Napp management clearly knew they had a chemical emergency on their hands, yet they ordered the evacuation by word of mouth rather than by alarm, resulting in a lack of notification to the fire department. Then, still without notifying local emergency officials, which even common sense would have dictated, they sent the workers back in to their deaths. After all this, one would think OSHA would have had the basis for a strong enforcement action against Napp. Yet after the explosion, OSHA officials were unable to cite Napp for not contacting local emergency officials because there was no clear enforceable requirement to do so. 
Current OSHA standards on workplace emergencies and emergency response require employers to coordinate with local response authorities, leaving the final decision for notification to employers' discretion--rather than specifying clear minimum criteria for notification. The compliance directive recently released by OSHA on this standard elaborates on this requirement, but fails to close this gap. 
The Industrial Emergency Notification Act of 1998 will require OSHA to require that employers notify local emergency officials in the event of workplace emergencies. OSHA shall specify, as appropriate, the circumstances under which emergency notification is required, such as workplace evacuation. Also, the legislation will codify OSHA's recent compliance directive, which requires employers to develop emergency response procedures in cooperation with local emergency officials. 
It is both possible and important to list the circumstances under which local emergency officials should be notified, rather than leaving such notification to the discretion of a potentially harried business manager. Also it is vital that OSHA's authority include the ability to take appropriate enforcement action against negligence, after inadequate notification and the resulting workplace injuries or deaths. Finally, in addition to the importance of this legislation in improving workplace safety, to the extent that local emergency officials can help control the chemical releases associated with workplace emergencies, this legislation will provide important environmental protection benefits as well. 
The bill is endorsed by the American Federation of Labor, Congress of Industrial Organizations, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union, the International Chemical Workers Union Council of the United Food and Commercial Workers, the International Union of Operating Engineers, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to a good friend and exceptional leader in the business community, Gerald H. Lipkin, as he is honored with B'nai B'rith International's Corporate Achievement Award. 
B'nai B'rith, one of the oldest Jewish organizations in our nation, has long recognized model citizens for their contributions in the areas of business, politics, philanthropy and the arts. By conferring this prestigious award for Corporate Achievement on Gerry Lipkin, B'nai B'rith is recognizing his contributions to his community, his business savvy and generosity. 
Gerry, like me, came from humble beginnings, he from Passaic and I from Paterson. But we both made our way in the world of business. From a young age, Gerry knew what his passion was as he worked his way through school, earning an undergraduate degree in economics at Rutgers University as well as a master's in business administration at New York University. 
His business acumen is exemplified by his success at Valley National Bank, a leading financial institution with 97 branches in Northern New Jersey. Gerry began his career there in 1975 as Senior Vice President, and steadily rose to hold the joint positions of Chairman, President and CEO. Valley National has been nominated by U.S. Banker's magazine as the second most efficient bank and eighth overall best performing banking company out of America's 100 largest. 
Beyond his business accomplishments, Gerry's philanthropic contributions to New Jersey and to causes across the globe are widely acknowledged, as is his keen sense of humor! 
Gerry has been a staunch supporter of an organization close to my heart. For 15 years he has been involved with the Lautenberg Center in Jerusalem, Israel, serving as a board member and supporting its work on cancer and immunology research. I founded the Lautenberg Center at Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center in 1968. And twenty years later, Gerry was honored with the `Torch of Learning Award' in 1988 for all that he has contributed. 
Gerry's volunteerism does not end there. He is also a trustee of the Beth Israel Hospital in Passaic, where he has served for 21 years, and sits on the board of trustees of Daughters of Israel Geriatric Center. Gerry is on the nominating committee of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Foundation Board of William Paterson College, which honored him with its Legacy Award in 1994. 
Mr. President, Gerry and I also both share a love of trains. Gerry's are miniatures, while I have an affinity for larger ones. At this point, I think Gerry has more trains than Amtrak, so maybe I should take transportation pointers from him in the future. 
I couldn't be happier to extend my congratulations to Gerry, and his wife Linda, for receiving this great honor. And I want to thank B'nai B'rith for recognizing Gerry's professional success and his exemplary service to New Jersey.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the May 26, 1997 thirty-second anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Guyana. To the people indigenous to the region, the word `Guyana' means land of many waters. But Guyana is also a land of many peoples--Guyanese count East Indians, Africans, Chinese, Amer-Indians, and Europeans counted among their ancestors. Now there is also a growing community of Guyanese-Americans, many of whom make their home in New Jersey. 
My colleagues may be aware that Guyana achieved independence and observed its first free and fair election in 1992, after more than three centuries of British, French, and Dutch colonialism. Guyana's first Constitution bore the influence of British legal traditions, and former President Jimmy Carter supervised the team of international observers to guarantee the fairness of the 1992 elections. 
Guyana's three decades of unpopular and repressive rule slowed progress in the nation, but Guyanese are working to overcome these hurdles. I hope that they will succeed. Guyanese-Americans have much to be proud of. Their history is rich, and I hope the future of Guyana will be bright.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would first like to thank the managers of Conference Report. Both Senators Chafee and Baucus have worked day and night trying to produce a fair and balanced Conference Report. They have done their best to try to accommodate my views. We did not always agree on every issue, but they both tried to work with me and engage in a constructive dialogue when we differed. 
I would also like to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee, Senator Warner. He put in a substantial effort to try to create a consensus that would satisfy the need for this critical legislation. 
And I would like to thank Senators D'Amato and Sarbanes for their diligence and hard work on the mass transit title. Because of their commitment, this bill represents a balanced transportation bill. 
Mr. President, I offer some comments to indicate my specific views on how this good bill will help my State of New Jersey. As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I have been working on the ISTEA reauthorization bill this entire Congress. I have been fighting for increased investment in our nation's infrastructure, a balanced transportation system and critical safety programs. 
Overall, on balance, this is a good bill--good for the country and good for New Jersey. It includes $173 billion for highways and $41 billion for mass transit nationally over six years. As the Ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, I worked hard to increase mass transit funding by almost a third compared to the 1991 ISTEA bill. Overall, this translates to over $4 billion to New Jersey for highways and over $2 billion for mass transit over the six year life of this bill. As a result, New Jersey will receive an increase of over $1 billion in transportation funding as compared to the 1991 ISTEA bill. 
Mr. President, the ISTEA bill, like any bill that provides funding to the States, became a battle between regions. Western Senators argued that their needs were greatest because of the sheer miles of highways in their states. Southern Senators suggested that they had population growth and they needed increases. The so-called donor states were pushing a `minimum allocation' that would revise the formula that prevailed over the past six years. 
Mr. President, obviously, I pushed hard for increased investment in my region and my state. The Northeast states face tremendous infrastructure needs over the next six years. Since we are the oldest region in the country with the highest density and greatest volume of traffic, our infrastructure needs are great. This problem is compounded by harsh weather conditions, intense congestion and air quality. 
Mr. President, I didn't get everything I wanted for New Jersey. However, this bill does provide substantial increases in funding for New Jersey for highways and mass transit. It also includes funding for over 40 highway and mass transit projects for my state. I fought to keep all of the my colleagues in the House of Representatives' projects in the final bill. The Senate bill originally did not include any special projects, but I am pleased that a few of them were included in the Conference Report at my request. The first project is an emergency heliport on Cooper Hospital in Camden, New Jersey, which will speed up rapid emergency service for hospital patients in the region. I am also pleased with funding to construct a roadway network using the former Bergen Arches rail corridor going from east to west in Hudson County, New Jersey. The Bergen Arches project will provide congestion relief and will allow the demand for development of the Hudson County waterfront--the so-called `Gold Coast'--to move at its rapid pace. 
Mr. President, anyone who is familiar with my work in the Senate knows that I don't relent when it comes to standing up for my constituents and my state. I feel my responsibilities to the people who sent me here as a sacred obligation and I would never agree to anything that is detrimental to our needs. 
Mr. President, this legislation is all about compromise. And this Conference Report is not perfect for my state, but, in the end, the substantial increases in highway and mass transit funding will reduce congestion, increase productivity, clean the air, and improve the quality of life so I will support this legislation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished Chairman and the Ranking Member of the Banking Committee. Mr. President, the ISTEA conference report includes language that reauthorizes a very important mass transit project in my state. The New Jersey Urban Core project provides critical links in a rail system that is the backbone of the transportation system of the Northeast and the nation. The Urban Core project links all of New Jersey's rail lines and builds new ones where necessary, to establish one comprehensive and coordinated rail transportation system within the state. 
Mr. President, the Conference Report makes a number of changes to the authorization of this important project. The report adds new projects as elements of the Urban Core and makes a number of critical changes. The conference report is silent on the future of full funding agreements. Do the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Banking Committee, who authored the Mass Transit title to the next surface transportation authorization bill, agree that it is important that the Secretary and the State of New Jersey enter into full funding grant agreements sometime in the next six years, for those elements of the Urban Core that can be demonstrated to be under construction by September 30, 2003? Is it your intention to urge the Secretary to work with the State of New Jersey over the next two years to sign full funding grant agreements?

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support the Iran Missile Sanctions Act. I am a cosponsor of this legislation, and I hope the Senate will approve it without delay. 
This legislation will impose sanctions against entities--individuals, companies, and research facilities--that have provided Iran with the technology and materials required to develop ballistic missiles. Those identified as assisting Iran --or as attempting to do so at least once--will be subject to sanctions for two years. These entities will be ineligible for export licenses for arms or controlled goods and technology. Additionally, they will not be eligible to receive U.S. assistance. The President would be authorized to waive sanctions if he determines that it would be in the U.S. national security interest to do so or if additional information which demonstrates that the alleged acts were not committed by the sanctioned person is available. 
The need for this legislation is clear. There is growing evidence that Russian companies and research facilities continue to provide Iran with the technological assistance and the materials necessary to develop ballistic missiles capable of reaching U.S. forces in the Middle East and our stalwart ally Israel. According to public reports, with the help of Russian entities, U.S. officials estimate that Iran could deploy the medium range Shahab 3 missile within 12 to 18 months. That missile is capable of targeting Israel, other Arab countries in the Middle East, and U.S. troops in the region. According to public sources, Iran could also deploy the Shahab 4 missile within three years. That missile reportedly would be able to reach targets in Europe. 
The Russians are not building these missiles for the Iranians. Rather, Mr. President, they are providing the material and training necessary for the Iranians to develop an indigenous capability. Make no mistake about it. The development of these Iranian missiles will be very destabilizing in the Middle East. 
Mr. President, to its credit, the Administration has made the transfer of missile technology a very high priority in dealings with Russian officials, including the recent talks between Vice President Gore and former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Special Envoy Wisner has worked on this issue aggressively, and the State Department's Robert Galluci has been doing the same. I commend them for the attention they have focused on this very sensitive matter and the effort they have made to persuade Russia to clamp down on exporters. 
Clearly, some progress has been made. On January 22, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin issued an Executive Order stating the Russian government's intention to set policies that will more effectively control the exports of technology to Iran. Nonetheless, public reports indicate that the cooperation is ongoing and that the transfers continue. 
Because the stakes are so high, we don't have the luxury of time. And while I hope the Administration's efforts will succeed in persuading the Russians to clamp down on these technology transfers, this Senator believes time is running out. The missiles being developed by the Iranians are capable of delivering chemical weapons throughout the Middle East. They are lethal. They threaten U.S. troops. They threaten our ally Israel. And in the long run, they will threaten our European allies. America needs to use every appropriate tool in its arsenal to prevent the Iranians from developing these missiles which will threaten our interests in the region. And we need to use those tools now. 
Mr. President, the sanctions in this legislation provide another tool. They are appropriately targeted against the entities--the companies, individuals, and institutes--that are cooperating with the Iranians. They are not targeted at the Russian government. If used effectively, these sanctions--or the threat of these sanctions--can help the Administration in its efforts to clamp down on those entities that are cooperating with the Iranian government. 
For the stake of promoting stability in the Middle East, I urge my colleagues to approve this legislation.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona for allowing time for me to make a few concluding remarks here, because I want to discuss an amendment that is one of those offered and pending. It is the Gregg-Leahy amendment. I want to express my opinion on this because I think this is a cornerstone issue in terms of this piece of legislation, the tobacco bill altogether. I simply do not believe that we should provide special legal protection to the tobacco industry. 
This isn't a vote about holding together a coalition, as is often described, or some other purpose other than determination as to how this country conducts itself vis-a-vis its tobacco policy. This is going to be a straight vote, up or down, about providing this industry with unprecedented legal protections. 
Now, I described it before as kind of a cornerstone issue, because if these special protections that are being talked about in this bill, eliminating immunity for this industry that certainly doesn't deserve immunities in my eyes, tobacco companies, if the bill stands unmodified, unamended, tobacco companies will get special legal protection for having such things as arsenic in its products. But another industry that might use arsenic in its products would not enjoy such protection. They would have to list their product, be very specific, get permission to use it, et cetera. Why in the world would we want to do that--because arsenic is a very dangerous material among the many materials, 500 items, that are included typically in a cigarette. 
Why, of all the industries that we have in the United States, would we want to provide special legal protection to the tobacco industry? We are talking about an industry that has continuously lied to Congress, lied to the American people, deceived them about what might happen if they picked up, started smoking cigarettes. The average person wouldn't have the foggiest idea--warnings could be dangerous to health. It doesn't say it is almost guaranteed to make you an addict. It doesn't say if you took these ingredients apart, there are many that are quite toxic. If the labels on the package said you might die if you do this, you might die early, you might die at a prime time in your life when you would like to be with your family and your friends, when you would like to be able to enjoy life, be able to do the things that you do athletically or functionally or vocationally, it doesn't say on there, hey, listen, if you start this, first of all, you will be spending thousands of dollars a year to support this habit. 
Having been a smoker, I am somewhat of an expert on the subject. I am not a zealot. I don't say that just because I took the cure, so to speak, that other people have to take it. But I know what it is that got me around to ceasing my smoking habit, and it was the love of a child. It was when my youngest daughter of three children, who was about 7 or 8 years old, came up to me one night when I lit a cigarette after a meal and said `Daddy, why do you smoke?' And I said, `Well, I enjoy it. It is restful, makes me feel good.' And she said--this is a child in first or second grade--and she said, `Today we learned if you smoke you get a black box in your throat.' She said, `Daddy, I love you. I don't want you to have a black box in your throat.' This is after I had been smoking some 20 years. 
I smoked before I went in the Army and I made sure I smoked when I was in the Army. When I was overseas during the war, I was used to trading butts with my friends. I would take a puff, they would take a puff. Smoking was part of your life--not only part of your life, it was part of your resources. It was a currency. You could trade it for some fresh fruit. You could trade it for a bottle of water--we didn't drink much bottled water in those days, but whatever you chose to have. It was currency. It was more valuable than the French franc or the Dutch guilder--places I was stationed--or the Belgium franc, or the mark, for sure. 
So here I smoked and this child brought me to my senses, my daughter. I tried to stop, I would say at least a dozen times. She convinced me in that little message--`I love you. I don't want you to have a black box in your throat.' All I could think about were those beautiful big eyes looking at me the next couple of days and that was the end of my smoking. Thank goodness that child did me an enormous favor. 
But the industry didn't let me know that. The industry didn't let me know at the time that I might develop an illness, emphysema, some other respiratory problem, maybe a fatal heart attack that couldn't be predicted because of smoking. They never told me anything about those things. They said life is more beautiful, life is glamorous. You could be a cowboy on a horse or a great skier. I happen to be, it has nothing to do with my smoking, but the fact of the matter is that all of those things give you images that are deceitful, dishonest, and shouldn't be allowed to be out there with impunity, because if someone falls for that story, someone falls for that image, they wind up in deep, deep trouble, killing 400,000 people a year in this country. That is not a very credible industry, I must tell you. They don't tell you that. 
So this industry knew that its products caused cancer. They wouldn't acknowledge it. I sat at hearings galore. I was part of one hearing where we had the scientist in front of us from one of the tobacco companies, a man with incredible credentials if you looked at his curriculum vitae. He had gone to great schools and he had done wonderful things. I asked him what happened when they tested the products on humans, and he said, `We didn't do human research.' I almost fell off the chair. I said, `You didn't?' All of these studies, by then 60,000 reports on the dangers of smoking had come out. 
But this company, one of the biggest, said scientists representing him said, `Oh, no, we didn't.' I said, `What did you do in your research?' He said, `We did some research on animals.' I didn't pursue that because I am sure those animals didn't fare very well. 
This is an industry that deliberately targeted our children, not for a good purpose, not for better health, for worse health, to try to addict them. If it was an illegal drug, we would be after these guys and they would be thrown in jail for long, long sentences. But they targeted our kids. They went to your children and my children and said: `Smoke and you are going to be a hero among your peers. Smoke and you will be beautiful. Smoke and you will be desirable.' All deceit, all lies, all determined, at no matter what cost, to grab that child, get him or her smoking. They knew they could put money in the bank. They could probably take it to the bank as collateral for loans very easily, because that person, with rare exception, was hooked. 
That is why we have over 45 million people today who can't quit. I say they can't quit because I never met a smoker yet of any duration--not once--and I meet people all the time, but not once have I met a smoker who didn't say they would like to quit smoking. They tried. They have gone to clinics, wore patches, and they have done this and that. But every time they stop for a while, something else comes up, some situation comes up, and they start all over again. 
That is what they want our kids to do. They want our children to be their marker. In all kinds of testimony given--some of it willingly and some unwillingly--by edict of the courts, especially in Minnesota, information has come out that they new bloody well they were targeting kids, and they new doggone well that they alter the nicotine content and make that addiction even firmer. They knew very well that people got cancer and they knew very well that people got sick. They didn't give a darn. They had one thing in their eyes: Cash. And they went after it, and they were willing to seduce children to do it. 
In many other cases, if anybody touches a hair on a child's head, they go off to jail. If they dare say something improper to a child, they get punished. These guys wanted to seduce 3,000 kids a day, a million a year, to start smoking because they knew that they made that cash register ring. This industry, that purposely pushed its product on to all American children, focused often on African Americans, or minority children, who seemed to be a little susceptible. Now they find out it is not just the minority children, it is all children that are susceptible. 
This industry is being investigated by the Justice Department. What kind of precedent does that set? Because what we are talking about in this bill is immunity from lawsuits for damage created by the smoking habit which they were fooled into beginning. So with all of that, and being investigated by the Justice Department, we say we want to protect them in the event of a lawsuit? We don't want to protect anybody else, like car manufacturers, food manufacturers, or house builders. Food manufacturers have to list everything. They are all subject to redress of their rights through the courts. That is the way it ought to be. 
But here we want to do something different. So if this is a condition, why shouldn't we give all white-collar criminals 
special protection? We could extend it to drug dealers as well. 
The Gregg-Leahy amendment will keep the legal system right side up. It will prevent Congress from rewarding the corporate outlaws who are the tobacco industry. Unless we pass this amendment, we are going to undermine the rights of Americans who have been harmed by the tobacco industry's deliberate conduct. These people are dying of lung cancer, heart disease, and they are often debilitated in wheelchairs or in hospitals. They become sick because they were nicotine addicts, which has the same pharmacological qualities as cocaine and heroin. Mr. President, these people should not have their rights abridged, and the tobacco industry should not get unprecedented legal protection. 
I ask my colleagues to support the Gregg-Leahy amendment. Don't let the tobacco industry get away with this, because, again, I think this talks about the value of having this legislation. If they are free of their appropriate responsibility under the law, if they are free by virtue of a limitation on immunity, they are going to have a bonanza here, and we ought not to permit it. This amendment is not a deal-breaker, but it breaks a sweetheart deal for the tobacco industry. I hope that when the votes are counted here, the American people will be watching to see what the favorite industry of this body is. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator makes a statement that if this fee was not paid, it would enable the family to spend--I think the figure used was $1,600 on food and clothing. The Senator said that earlier. And if the addict is using the money to buy cigarettes, that certainly doesn't free up any additional spending power unless the Senator sees another way to do it. I am not quite sure I understand where the Senator goes with that.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator before said that $1,600 a year that the person would pay in additional taxes would prevent them from having the ability to spend it on food and clothing, et cetera. 
But, eventually, over a period of time that would be a cost which does not exist altogether for a million teenagers, and they would, therefore, be able to exchange the money not used to buy cigarettes, if they were able to close out on the smoking addiction, to be used for other things; is that not true?

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts for allowing me part of the time in the remaining minutes for the debate on this amendment. 
Mr. President, I want to say, first, just a quick note to my colleague now in the Senate, formerly in the House, Senator Richard Durbin from Illinois, that at the time we worked on the smoking ban in airplanes, it looked like a hopeless quest. Everyone said, `You will never get it by.' We worked, we pleaded, we cajoled, and we tried everything that we knew. 
But the odds on the other side were formidable against us. And finally we were able, through consensus, to develop a bill that took a 2-hour ban on smoking in airplanes with the promise that after a study of about 18 months we would reconsider and look at what the consequences were. 
Well, it was overwhelmingly popular across the country. People began to demand that we stop smoking in airplanes altogether. Some said, `How can you suggest that a 2-hour ban is all right but a 4-hour plane ride is full of smoke?' 
And so it was by popular demand that we were able to get that kind of a ban in place. And I remind my friend and colleague, Senator Durbin, in April, the month just closed, we had the 10th anniversary of the implementation of the smoking ban in airplanes. I can tell you, if there is one thing that gets you an applause line when you are doing a town meeting or meet in front of a group, when you say you were part of the authorship of the smoke ban in airplanes, people say thank you, thank you, thank you, and tell you tales about not being able to fly before, having respiratory problems, asthma, you name it, could not get in an airplane, and today they feel as if they have been freed. 
Well, it is the same thing here. This debate, frankly, I must tell you, Mr. President, borders at times on the silly. We have to make a decision here about what we are going to do about protecting the health of our people from the ills caused by tobacco and nicotine. And we have come to a conclusion, a sad conclusion, that we cannot change the course of action. I say this, and I say it with terrible regret. We cannot change the habits of some 40 million-plus Americans who are addicted to tobacco and nicotine. 
How they got started is a debate of and by itself, whether it was like it was with me in the Army when they used to give us in our emergency rations, in case we got separated from our units or had to depend on that for our sustenance--you always had a four-cigarette pack that you could call on in the event of an emergency when you needed a smoke. People were always waiting for the smoking lamp to go on so that they could smoke. It was encouraged. It was part of our psyche. 
I can tell you also, as one who smoked for 20-some years, that stopping was no easy chore. It is not easy for the 40-plus million Americans who are hooked, stuck, can't get out of the tobacco habit. I haven't yet met anyone who smokes who hasn't said to me: You know, I stopped a dozen times. I once stopped for 3 weeks. I once stopped for 4 weeks. And then my brother had the car accident. Or, my team lost on the baseball diamond and we all started smoking and sitting around and moaning--here we are, can't get away. 
But we can get away from it if we help our children not to start smoking in the first place, if we can stop them before they take the first puff, the second puff, or the 20th puff on a cigarette, because we know that the hook takes like that, like a fish after bait. And that is what the tobacco companies are doing. They are trolling. They are fishing with bait for more smokers. 
They now have a campaign on, a campaign to deceive the American people, a campaign to say that they are just another business and that all these jobs of the people who work in the tobacco industry will be lost and the taxes will be lost. And meanwhile, what they do we wouldn't accept from anybody offshore who wanted to attack our America, kill 400,000 people a year, 
maim lots of others, render them at times unable to conduct their normal activities, lost productivity from their jobs, et cetera, and get a tax deduction besides--besides all other things, to be able to deduct the cost of addicting people, seducing children. It is an outrage. 
Part of the campaign now is very interesting. I get mail, as we all do, from constituents. I have a letter here from a fellow named Jack McDonnell, Rutherford, NJ, which, by the way, is also the home of Tom Pickering, Deputy Secretary of State, a great diplomat. 
Mr. McDonnell writes: 
My family received a letter today from the RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company. The letter was addressed to my mother, and requested that she write to you protesting the proposed tobacco legislation . . . Unfortunately, she could not respond herself. She died this February after a long and horrible struggle against emphysema. My father, another ex-smoker, has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. My family understands the real costs involved here, and the cost of smoking far exceeds the costs of this legislation. 
Now, what happened is the tobacco companies--and the companies I will read off here include Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company, Lorillard, Philip Morris, Inc., RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company, United States Tobacco Company. They send a letter out to people and they write: 
Dear Mr: 
In this case, Robert Martin-- 
Since you registered your support for the proposed resolution reached last year between the tobacco industry and Government officials, private plaintiffs' lawyers, and members of the public health community, Washington has decided to press an agenda based on politics. 
Politics, not reason. 
Washington has been overtaken by politicians' insatiable desire to tax and spend. 
Not by the insatiable desire of a mother and father to save the well-being of their child, not in terms of families who want to keep the family together and do not want to see grandpa with emphysema when he gets to be an age when he could still be functioning normally. No; they describe the insatiable appetite of the politician. 
Well, Mr. Martin writes to me. They gave him a postcard to which he could affix a signature and send it to my office. And it says: 
Dear Senator Lautenberg: I strongly urge you to oppose any tobacco legislation that raises taxes, produces a black market in cigarettes, threatens nearly 2 million American jobs and expands the Federal bureaucracy. 
Reject these things. And it is signed with his name. He wrote underneath that postcard. He sent me a sample of the postcard.  
Dear Senator Lautenberg: I received this item in the mail. As you can see, I was polled over the telephone by a machine. The material given over the phone was very misleading the way that it was presented. I am against smoking and like to see it abolished. I am a lung cancer survivor. Keep up the good work. 
And it carries the signature of Bob Martin. He says: 
If there is anything that I can do to be of help, please call. 
And he lists his phone number. 
So that is the kind of campaign that is going on with these 
tobacco companies, designed to deceive the public that this is a major kind of public interest campaign that the citizens are rising up against. Let them tell the real story. Let them talk about the 400,000 deaths. Let them talk about the lung disease.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. We have to get on with the task of passing the $1.50-per-pack fee. I point out to you, Mr. President, and those who can see it, that the price of cigarettes in major industrial nations is quite a bit different than we have here in the United States: Norway, $6.82 a pack; Denmark, $5.10 a pack; United Kingdom, $4.40. Down we get to the U.S.A., with a current price of about $1.94. 
We know one thing, Mr. President. We have heard it in testimony and statements given by colleagues in the Chamber that the way to stop teen smoking most abruptly, to give them a jolt so that they will bolt, is to raise that price and raise it quickly and sufficiently. And $1.50 a pack will do it. With the $1.50 a pack, we can see substantial reductions in the number of those who start smoking. And I hope that when the votes are counted here, people will look and see how their Senators voted to see whether or not they are going to stay with the tobacco companies or whether they are going to stay with the families and protect the children who will be dependent upon tobacco in the future.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this obviously is going to be a fairly long debate. We are going to hear about everything from tax policy to love of country to how we deal with our budgets. We are going to hear all kinds of things. 
Mr. President, I join with my distinguished friend and colleague from Massachusetts in proposing the $1.50 amendment, if I can call it that, that both he and I have had a longtime interest in. I want to make some comments on the entire bill before I go into the specifics of the $1.50. 
Senator Kennedy has been the leader in all matters of health and concern for young people, always out in the front, helping to defend what is right in our country. I have great respect for him and I am pleased to share this particular interest in reducing teen smoking. 
Today we begin consideration of legislation that is long overdue. It tackles one of the most important health issues of our time, because today we begin the questions to finally reform the way tobacco products are sold in this country and the way the tobacco industry operates. 
Getting to this point has not been an easy journey. Despite the fact that the tobacco industry has for decades engaged in shameless corporate conduct, the Congress has never acted in a comprehensive way to get this industry under control. However, we have now reached a point where the American people no longer tolerate inaction on this issue. 
I have been fighting to protect Americans from the dangers of smoking for over a decade in the U.S. Senate, along with the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin. We authored the first ban on smoking in airplanes in 1987. Just a few weeks ago, we celebrated the tenth anniversary of the implementation of that legislation. 
Frankly, I believe that ban, that opportunity for people to fly and to travel in that close space free of tobacco smoke, was a catalyst for further antitobacco activity. They saw how pleasant it was. When people rode on airplanes, they saw how nice it was to have smoke-free travel, freedom from other people's tobacco smoke. Many who suffered from allergies, or had respiratory problems, or just couldn't endure being trapped in a smoking airplane cabin finally felt free to travel by airplane in what they considered a personally safer environment. 
But, despite the wishes of the American people, we had a tough time getting that legislation in place. It was a long, tough battle. We argued. We negotiated. We finally settled for a 2-hour ban, with the promise that we would wait 18 months for studies to come in. But the interest of the public was so overwhelming that we didn't have to wait 18 months. It began to become a cry across the country: Please, if you are going to ban smoking in airplane flights for 2 hours, for goodness sake, if it is a 6-hour flight, give us a break. And we immediately changed what had been a 2-hour ban to a 6-hour ban and now all flights across this country and many across the ocean. 
But despite the wishes of the American people, the tobacco industry has been able to use its power and its influence to stop real reform of tobacco industry behavior until this week. 
Now, we are poised to finally act in a comprehensive way to tackle the major problems this industry has caused our Nation. First and foremost is the issue of teen tobacco use. 
Mr. President, newly released industry documents show how the tobacco industry specifically and deliberately targeted our kids for addiction. They knew what they were doing. They put up fancy drawings and beautiful pictures of healthy people riding horseback and playing sports. They knew what was happening. They knew very well they were creating addiction for the children. They were seducing them into picking up the smoking habit. 
In addition, the industry's very own documents talk about ways to further entrap young smokers into a lifetime of addiction by manipulating the quality of nicotine in these cigarettes. The documents recently revealed also contain strategies on how to spread fake science to confuse their customers about the health effects of tobacco products. 
Mr. President, not only did the industry commit these acts but it came before the Congress and lied about it. Now these very same companies have decided that they are going to fight 
back against the popular will. They are going to fight back against the Congress' final awakening to the evils of smoking and to do something about it. They have decided that they are going to take a chance and spend $50 million or more for deceit with a misleading advertising campaign to stop the Senate action this week. You have seen it on TV. You hear it on the radio. You see it in print: After all, we were willing to pay $500 million. After all, we want to be proper citizens. But the Senate and the House want to take away our right. They want to invade people's lives. 
It is for that very reason that we have to act now and pass strong comprehensive tobacco legislation. The Senate must prove to the American people this week that we have broken from the past; we will no longer trade the future of our children for cold, hard tobacco industry campaign cash. This is effectively our Bastille Day. The reign of the tobacco industry on Capitol Hill must end today, now. We have an opportunity to prove to the American people that big tobacco's free ride is over. 
Mr. President, there are going to be lots of votes for us this week to prove our good faith. 
The chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, and the committee itself have given us a foundation to build on. I congratulate them and thank them for this and commend them for all of their hard work. 
But we have more heavy lifting to do, because what we see in front of us has to be amended and has to be expanded in order to do the job that we want to see done. Our Nation's leading health experts tell us that we have a way to go this week before this bill should be approved by the U.S. Senate. Names that Americans trust, like Dr. C. Everett Koop, Dr. David Kessler, tell us that this bill needs improvement. 
That is why it is imperative that the Senate adopt amendments that will be offered to put some more teeth into this bill. We will have votes this week on the Kennedy-Lautenberg amendment that would call for a $1.50 price increase on a pack of cigarettes to really discourage youth smoking. 
We will also vote on whether Congress should provide this industry with special protections on legal liability. Additionally, we will likely vote on look-back surcharges to see whether or not the companies will use all of their skills and knowledge to reduce teen smoking. And we will likely vote on preemption of local laws and on advertising restrictions. These will all be key votes, and the American people will be watching. 
I will not make my final decision on this legislation until I see the outcome of these votes and see what difference the amendments make in the quality and the extent of this bill. I hope, Mr. President, we can head into the Memorial Day weekend proud of what we did this week. 
As we remember our brave men and women who sacrificed their lives fighting for our country, I ask my colleagues to join the fight to protect our people from premature death and sickness as we would have if a foreign invader was to declare war on us and in 1 year killed more than 400,000 Americans--400,000 Americans. It is more deaths in 1 year than all of the combat deaths in all of the wars fought by Americans in the 20th century. We are looking at World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and other wars fought in this century. Once again, more Americans die each and every year from tobacco-caused disease than died in combat in all of the wars that I have just mentioned. 
So we want to fight back against the attackers, as we should. What if we were invaded by a foreign enemy? Now is the time to respond to a call to arms. 
Mr. President, this $1.50 amendment will test whether or not we are serious about cutting teen smoking or whether we are going to once again appease the industry. If we are serious about cutting teen smoking, then we must raise the price of cigarettes by at least $1.50 a pack. We have to get to that level quickly, within 3 years. 
I want to point out on this chart what we understand. The source of this is the Department of the Treasury. It says the number of children who will be deterred from smoking based on these prices: A $1.10 increase will stop 3 million kids from picking up the smoking habit; a $1.50 increase will stop 3.75 million children from picking up the smoking habit. We know that once they start--we have seen it on the chart displayed by the Senator from Massachusetts about when people start smoking at a very young age. I know I did. It took me some 25 years to recognize what a foolish thing I was doing. I didn't recognize it until my youngest daughter said one day, `Daddy, we learned in school today that if you smoke, you will get a black box in your throat, and I love you, and I do not want you to have a black box in your throat. Daddy, please stop smoking.' Within 3 days I stopped smoking, after numerous attempts. 
The number of children whose lives will be saved by the cigarette price increases is 1 million at $1.10; $1.50, 1.25 million people--1.25 million children whose lives will be saved by responding to that pressure from the price increase. 
We have heard everything here today about tax increases and how we are taxing those unfortunate people of modest income. 
The Senator from Arizona said everybody loves their children just as much regardless of their income class. The fact is we would like, all of us, to see the cessation of smoking or the reduction of smoking among children. 
One of the things that happens as we discuss this $1.50-a-pack possibility is that we would then be extracting from those whose use costs us more because of their habit to pay for some of the costs that they incur. If someone wants to use their car more often, they buy more gasoline. They pay a higher price. If they want a bigger house, they pay a higher price. If they want to use more fuel to warm or cool their house, they pay a bigger price. If they use more of the health care system, they should pay a bigger price. It is an unfortunate reality, but smoking costs this country $50 billion a year in increased health costs--$50 billion a year. And we are talking about something that is considerably less of a tax, less of a cost on those companies and the individuals who pick up the smoking habit. 
We want to stop people from smoking. Just think about it. We heard talk about the fact that this is a tax increase on hard-working families. Well, hard-working families ought to be interested in the money that they save. Imagine if we stopped people from smoking. Here we say a million and a quarter people. It will cost them over $2,000 a year, or they will save $2,000 a year as a result of dropping the smoking habit. Two packs of cigarettes a day, estimated at the lowest, perhaps $4 a pack, if the $1.50 increase goes into effect. But let's say it is $3 a pack. Three dollars a pack, twice a day; $6 times 7, $42 a week, times 52 weeks a year; over $2,000 a year that poor, hard-working families could very well use to buy other things they need far more than cigarettes. 
Smoking among children and teens has reached epidemic proportions. Three thousand children begin smoking each and every day, and a third of them, 1,000, will die prematurely as a result of the smoking habit. Every year we lose over 400,000 Americans to tobacco-related illness and over 90 percent of them started as kids. 
The managers' amendment claims to raise the price of a pack of cigarettes $1.10 in 5 years, but the public health community tells us that $1.10 just won't do the job. The goal we have set in Congress is to cut teen smoking in half, and if you examine the $1.10 proposal, it is clear that it doesn't cut it. Independent economists tell us that a $1.10 increase will only result in a 33-percent reduction in teen smoking over 5 years. 
Hallelujah, I would love to see that happen--even that. But on the other hand, these same economists say a $1.50 price increase will result in the 50-percent reduction target in 5 years. What an accomplishment that would be. Imagine that in a few years when those kids who would have started smoking are not smoking. More than 200,000 Americans who would have otherwise died would be alive. Families would not be grief stricken at the loss of someone they care about because of the smoking habit, or watch someone who was a good athlete unable to function, unable to run, unable to breathe without lots of labor because we were in this early stage able to stop teen smoking. 
The reason we are not focused on adults so much in this as teen smoking is because it doesn't have the same impact on adult smokers. We have over 40 million people who are addicted to tobacco. I never met anybody who is a smoker who will not tell me about the number of times they stopped and how long. They 
remember those as key moments in their life: I once stopped for 2 weeks, for 2 solid weeks I didn't have a cigarette. What do you think? And then I was watching the ball game or my friend Charlie at the office had a problem and got sick and I started smoking again. And I will be darned; I just haven't been able to stop. But one of these days I am going to do it, I promise you that. I wish I could. 
Talk to people who stand outside buildings all over America who are prohibited by the rules from smoking in the building and you see them puffing away. I was one. I don't make fun of them, I promise you that. See them standing out there in the cold weather freezing to finally get that puff on the cigarette. 
The other day I took the train from Philadelphia to Newark, and I watched a fellow get off the train, light up quickly on the platform, take two or three drags on the cigarette and chuck it and get back in the train. He is not happy with his habit. He may have been happy to have a puff on that cigarette, but I assure you, when that man thinks about what he is doing, he is not happy that he is an addict. No addict, whether illegal drugs or tobacco, is happy with the condition, but they are committed to it. 
And so our mission is to stop them before they start, because it is unrealistic to say stop after they have been doing it for a long time. You can never get to it. So what we will do is make an investment now that will start to pay off 5 years from now, 10 years from now, 20 years from now, when we will see our costs for health care and our costs for lost productivity will diminish considerably, and maybe even end, and we will be looking at a Nation that is considerably healthier. 
Why should the Senate stand for half measures? Public health organizations and Drs. Koop and Kessler agree that the price of tobacco products must be increased by at least $1.50 in 3 years, and be continuously indexed, by the way, for inflation. Otherwise, we will fall short of meeting our goals of cutting teen smoking in half. 
A variety of factors contribute to a teenager's decision to try that first cigarette or chew that first bit of spit tobacco, as we call it. But the price of tobacco is a critical factor. The higher the price, the less likely the child will be to continue to use tobacco. 
Again, the U.S. Department of the Treasury says it--the number of children who will be deterred from smoking if we adjust the prices, according to this chart. 
I would also like to ask my colleagues not to be fooled by the industry's deceptions that this price increase will bankrupt them. I remind my colleagues that these are the same folks who testified before Congress under oath that nicotine is not addictive. The tobacco industry made $7.2 billion in profit in 1997. And according to an MIT analysis, a $1.50 price increase would not bankrupt the industry by any stretch of the truth or imagination. In fact, the MIT analysis shows an industry profit of $5.2 billion with a $1.50 price increase. 
And further, the industry claims that this price increase will create a black market. Well, this black market looks like a red herring to me, I must tell you. We can pass tough antismuggling laws that will prevent a black market. It doesn't, unfortunately, hurt the tobacco companies if their product is sold in a black market. I want everybody to keep that in mind. If company X sells its products and it gets by without the $1.50 user fee imposed on it, they still get the same profit back in Winston Salem, NC, or wherever they are based. So that black market, so to speak, is not something that, frankly, I see making the tobacco companies very unhappy. In fact, the managers' amendment includes antismuggling language that I coauthored. This language is tough. It will go a long way towards cracking down on smuggling--the same way we have cracked down on alcohol smuggling in recent years. 
This $1.50 proposal has bipartisan support. I offered it as a sense of the Senate in the Budget Committee, and it passed overwhelmingly. It passed in the Budget Committee. A similar proposal passed with a bipartisan vote last week in the Finance Committee. There is a bipartisan Hansen-Meehan bill in the House that also increased the price by $1.50 over 3 years. 
Mr. President, this amendment has bipartisan support because the American people strongly support it. A recent poll by the American Cancer Society showed that 59 percent of the American people support a $1.50 price increase--people who are going to be affected by it. 
I think it is time for the full Senate to pass a $1.50 price increase and protect our children once and for all. We are going to see it in the voting. That voting is a public document that everyone can see, a public action that everyone can see. 
I am going to close in just a couple of minutes here. I listened to the debate. I listened to the cries that this is just another scheme, a scheme to tax the public so those of us who are responsible for legislation and operation of Government can spend the money. That is the biggest hoax in the world. 
Nobody, this Senator or any other Senator, on the right, on the left, in the Republican Party or the Democrats, enjoys spending the public's money. That is pure baloney, as we say in polite circles. We don't like taxing anybody. But people who smoke cause this society to spend $100 billion a year as a result of their smoking. We have the unfortunate experience of seeing a loved one die, or with a tracheotomy, as we saw last week at a hearing here. We heard a woman who was induced to represent a tobacco company as a model when she was 17 years old, and she said her employer said unless you smoke also, actually smoke, you don't quite have the real action that shows the satisfaction a smoker gets. And now she smokes through a tracheotomy in her throat. She was barely able to utter the sounds. It was pathetic, Mr. President, to see that happen. 
I also had the benefit of a hearing where we had a famous male model for one of the tobacco companies who said he is dying. He said he was so ashamed of himself, when he went into the doctors office, went in for surgery, and the doctor said to him, `For goodness sake, don't smoke for a couple of weeks before you get to the hospital, whatever you do,' and his doctor caught him smoking in the waiting room, waiting to be admitted to the hospital so he could have a lung taken out. That is how addicting tobacco is. 
We ought not feel sorry for the people who run the tobacco companies. They ought to be ashamed. They ought to pay the price. It is time for them to come clean with the American public and say, `OK, we have done it wrong. We have made a mistake. We want to cooperate.' Instead, they are mounting all kinds of spurious campaigns to try to deceive the public that the Senate, that the Congress, is trying to hurt them or hurt their families. It is not true. We ought not let them get away with it. So when I hear the stories, oh, we are going to just tax the American public, and a recitation of when these tax increases go through--I would like to recite just a few numbers in response. 
There has never been a time in the history of this country when the economy is better than it is these very days, and it is better because we took some specific actions. It is better because we had a balanced budget on our agenda, and we approved one last year. I am a member of the Budget Committee and we saw it happen. We decided we were going to control our expenses. And the economy is booming. Look at the stock market. Look at interest rates--low; stock market, high. Interest rates, low; mortgage rates, low; home ownership high--we have not ever seen that kind of affluence in this society. 
Everybody is not participating. I am not saying that at all. But to suggest that we have done things wrong in this country, in the management of this economy, and that what we have done is just picked people's pockets and taken the money and thrown it away is nonsense and the public will see through it. They are not going to believe that stuff. They have heard it before. They have seen it before. They know their children have a chance at a good job, they have a chance to get an education, that health care for their grandparents is going to be more assured, Social Security has moved up in its solvency-- 
2032 is the prospect. It is incredible. People can feel a lot better about their lives. 
And longevity? Mr. President, I hate to admit how old I am, but I can tell you if you want to run or jog or go skiing or do all the other things, I am there, because there is an opportunity in this country to have a full life as one ages. I was a soldier in World War II. I served 3 years in the Army. I count my blessings every day for the good health I have seen and the five--and sixth grandchild, maybe today or maybe tomorrow that child will arrive. I can't wait for my daughter to say, `Hey, Dad, we have a new one in the family.' I can assure you that child will never smoke if the parents or the grandparents have anything to say about it. 
We want our children to be healthy. That is the purpose of this. It is to bring health to the younger part of our society so that, as they age they, too, can enjoy their grandchildren, enjoy their life, be in good health, do whatever they want to do--run, dance, whatever, and feel good about the life they have led. That is the kind of America we have today. That is the kind of America that developed because it had leadership and a willingness to pay the price with some tough votes, some which I didn't make that I wish I had. 
So I want to see us pass this to tell the American people we are finished fooling around. We mean it when we say we want to stop teen smoking. We mean it when we say we are going to eliminate this scourge from our society. And we mean it when we stand up here and we vote and we say: OK, let the public see how we are doing it. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a dear friend and treasured community leader in Southern New Jersey, George Norcross II. 
George and I shared many experiences and values and each of us ended up in public service. 
We both grew up in a poor, urban environment, he in Camden, and I in Paterson. We both lost our fathers at a very young age, but continued to attend high school while beginning to work. We both served in the military during World War II, he in the Navy and I in the Army. 
After George returned from the war, he built a career in union organizing efforts and community service. His was a voice of strength and determination for working families in Camden County--and what a loud voice it was! He fought tooth and nail for union workers, never without a cigar in hand. But his rough exterior was complemented by his caring heart, and the effectiveness of his work with organized labor was reinforced through his numerous philanthropic activities. 
The Union Organization of Social Services, of which George became president in 1955, reflected his marriage of organized labor and charity work. The mission of UOSS is to deal with drug and alcohol abuse, job training, food banks, disaster relief, clothing drives and blood banks within its community. 
George was also active in the United Way his entire life, serving as its general chairman in 1992 and as chairman emeritus after his retirement. His involvement with this organization led to the United Way's Labor Support Committee, which raised millions of dollars for charity. 
As a touch negotiator, a coalition builder, and someone who always got the job done, George's unrivaled union leadership will never be forgotten. He served as president of the AFL-CIO Central Labor Union for 16 years, was a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1448, and became the international representative of the International Union of Electrical Workers. 
George and I shared the conviction that educational opportunity is critical to a robust and stable democracy. George's dedication to providing educational opportunities to others led to his creation of the Peter J. McGuire Scholarship Program in conjunction with the American Federation of Teachers. These scholarships, presented every year at New Jersey's Labor Day celebration, benefit children of Southern New Jersey union members. And if my schedule didn't permit me to attend this annual event one year, I would get an earful from George! 
George's union leadership and sense of civic responsibility have benefitted countless New Jerseyans, including students able to go school on scholarship, people in need who receive help, and workers with grievances whose rights are defended. 
George Norcross will be dearly missed. I want to extend my heartfelt condolences to Carol, George's wife of 43 years, and his four sons, George III, John, Don and Phil. I know I will continue to cross paths and work with them on behalf of New Jersey.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine. 
Senator DeWine has experience as a prosecutor. He has seen what happens when alcohol and driving try to mix. The result is terrible tragedy so often. His work here, together with mine, has enabled us to assemble a bipartisan group to support our effort to reduce the blood alcohol content to .08 at which point someone can be declared driving while impaired. 
Today marks the 10th anniversary of the Nation's most deadly drunk driving crash. On the night of May 14, 1988, a bus packed with sleeping children was driving south on Interstate 71 to the First Assembly of God Church in Radcliff, KY. Thirty-five girls, twenty-eight boys, and four adults were returning from a day at the King's Island amusement park near Cincinnati. 
According to newspaper accounts, the group said a short prayer before they began their return trip. 
I quote him. He said, `Please grant us a safe trip. May God have his hand on this bus.' That is what he prayed. 
But prayers were not enough that day. At 10:55 p.m., as the bus neared the northern Kentucky town of Carrollton, the driver of the bus spotted a pickup truck barreling north in his southbound lane. Moments later a collision and the bus burst into flames. 
Twenty-four children and 3 adults were killed in that devastating schoolbus crash, and 30 more were injured. The lives of so many families and friends were destroyed. 
The current president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Karolyn Nunnallee, lost her daughter Patty in that terrible crash. She was on television this morning trying to explain the impact of losing that child. This day across the Nation thousands of mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters will join in a moment of silence to honor those thousands of victims who die on our highways each year at the hands of drunk drivers. 
We will honor Patty and the others who died that night and those who were injured during this moment of silence. 
Sadly, the death toll visited upon us by drunk driving mounts up each year with an appalling clock-like efficiency. Every 30 minutes a family loses a loved one to a drunk driver. That means in the decade since the Carrollton crash 175,000 people have died. That is almost twice the population of the capital of my home State of New Jersey, Trenton, NJ. These deaths need not have happened. 
If we also take into consideration that each of these victims had family and friends, we are talking about more than--more than--a million people grief stricken, which is more people than who live in Washington, DC. And this grieving should never have occurred. 
Drunk driving also takes an enormous economic toll, as well, on our Nation. Alcohol-related crashes cost society over $45 billion each year. One alcohol-related fatality is estimated to cost society about $950,000; and an injury averages about $20,000 in emergency and acute health care costs, long-term care and rehabilitation, police and court services, insurance, lost productivity, and social services. 
Just look at this toll of needless death, needless grief, and needless spending. These facts should move us to rage. And our rage should move us to action. 
Mr. President, we can act. Right now, the House-Senate conference committee is meeting to resolve the competing ISTEA reauthorization bills. I sit on that conference committee. As part of this process, the Congress is going to make one decision--will we get tougher on drunk driving and enact laws that will save lives or will we fall prey to the liquor and restaurant lobbyists? 
Mr. President, this body has spoken about this issue. Two months ago, the Senate passed an amendment to prohibit open containers of alcohol in motor vehicles. It adopted a tough program to combat repeat offenders of drinking and driving. And by a 2 to 1 margin, the Senate voted to set a strict national drunk driving standard at .08 blood alcohol content. The Senate voted 62 to 32 for this life-saving measure. The House was not even able to vote on this issue. They were prevented from it. 
We can ask the question, Why? But we must carry the will of the Senate--of the people--through to completion. We want `.08 in '98.' We are now at the crossroads, and it is time to decide. The question comes up, Why? Why aren't the House 
Members permitted to vote on this issue? Well, it stops at a committee over there. The process is different than it is over here, and they do not even have to let a piece of legislation come up on the floor. 
And why? Why would they say no to a vote on this issue when parents lose children and children lose parents across this country in numbers that compare to our worst year in Vietnam? In full combat we lost about 17,000 of our soldiers. In our country every year we lose more than 17,000 people to drunk driving, and it does not have the same impact on our society. So we have to say, Why is it that it does not? 
If after coming so close we fail to enact .08 this year, the American people should charge this Congress with something I will call `VUI,' voting under the influence of the liquor lobby. That is where it stops. They say, `You're going to kill our business,' that `You're going to arrest social drinkers.' No, no, no. We are not saying anybody can't drink. They can drink as much as they want. They can fall off the bar stools, as long as they don't fall on me or my kids. 
The issue is whether, after having had a blood alcohol content level of .08, they ought to get behind a wheel. And we say no. I think the Senator from Ohio made it very clear. He said if he watched someone at a party or someone at a dinner, or something like that, have four drinks in an hour--a man my size would have five--on an empty stomach, to have your child get in the back seat of a car with that driver, I would say never, never. That is what we want to say across this country. Because every family is entitled to that kind of safety and security. 
In 1984, President Reagan signed a bill that I wrote over here to make the national drinking age 21 and eliminate blood borders. Those are the borders between States with different drinking ages. Since then, more than 10,000 lives have been saved, enough to fill a small town. That is 10,000 families that did not have to mourn or grieve the loss of a child or a parent or a brother or a sister--10,000 people. That is a lot of people. 
Now we have a different kind of blood border--the blood alcohol border. Right now a driver legally drunk in one of 16 .08 States merely has to drive over the border and--poof--he is legally sober again. We know that is wrong. And we know once you are over .08 you are too drunk to drive in any State. 
Consider this: Someone, again, of my height having had four glasses of wine in an hour--five glasses of wine; again, I am a little heavier than the average; five glasses of wine in an hour --on an empty stomach. That is too much. We are not saying, again, that people cannot drink. We are saying they cannot drink and drive. 
Think about the 6,000 families who will be spared the devastating loss of a loved one to a drunk driver over the course of a decade if we pass .08. Think of what it means. Thousands of parents now destined to lose a child will be able to read their little ones to sleep instead of looking at an empty bed; children now destined to lose a parent will wake up in a full and loving home. 
One year ago, Randy Frazier called the Congress to action. Randy's daughter, Ashley--people from Maryland--was killed by a .08 drunk driver. Randy said, `It is time for the leadership and action here in Congress to draw a safer, saner, and more sensible line against impaired driving at .08. If we 
truly believe in family values, then .08 ought to become the law of the land. Four beers in an hour'--four glasses of wine in an hour, on an empty stomach--`and getting behind the wheel of a car, in our estimation, is one definition of family violence.' 
Mr. President, it is decision time. The question is whether we are going to vote with our conscience. Are we going to vote under `VUI,' voting under the influence of the alcohol lobby? They poured people into this town. The Restaurant Association had 130 as reported by a newspaper, 130 lobbyists come in. They swarmed all over the House, and they got people to change their minds. Then they got people, as I said earlier, to be able to hold that bill from getting consideration. That is not the way law ought to be decided when it comes to American families. And we hope we are going to stand up to our responsibility as we pause to honor the victims of drunk driving. 
Let us be moved to action. We must enact tough drunk driving laws this year. It has to be `.08 in '98.' 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today we celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the establishment of the State of Israel. As we do so, we also remember the tragedy of the Holocaust and the events that culminated in the creation of a Jewish homeland. 
I rise today to submit a measure to honor an individual who stands in the highest esteem of the citizens of Israel, and throughout the world. I am pleased to be joined by the senior senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, in submitting this measure calling on the Postal Service to issue a stamp commemorating the life of Oskar Schindler. 
Millions of people around the world know the story of Oskar Schindler, whose heroism was brought to light by the author Thomas Keneally and the film maker Steven Spielberg. During the Nazi occupation of Poland, Oskar Schindler demonstrated that one person truly could make a difference. He saved the lives of over 1,200 Jewish men, women, and children, while risking his own life and that of his wife. Mr. Schindler also rescued approximately 100 Jewish men and women from the Golezow concentration camp, who were trapped in a sealed and freezing railroad car. 
Two of the individuals whose lives were saved by Oskar Schindler are residents of New Jersey. Before the war, Abraham Zuckerman lived in Krakow, Poland. In 1942, he was sent to the Plaszow concentration camp where he faced unspeakable horrors and certain death. While he waited out his days toiling in a coal yard, one day, to his great fortune, Mr. Zuckerman was told that he was one of the fortunate individuals whose name appeared on `Schindler's List.' Mr. Zuckerman was relatively safe for a little more than a year, but when Schindler's factory in Krakow was liquidated, he was sent to a concentration camp at Mauthausen and later Gusen II, where he was finally liberated. Meanwhile, Mr. Zuckerman's close friend Murray Pantirer was sent to another concentration camp, Gross-Rosen, after Plaszow was shut down. On his third day there, he was chosen as one of 900 workers for Schindler's new factory in Brinnlitz, Czechoslovakia. Both men later emigrated to the United States. They have lived in New Jersey since shortly after the war where they started a home building business. To honor Mr. Schindler, these men are responsible for over 20 Schindler Courts, Terraces and Plazas all over the Garden State. 
Mr. President, we recognize that Mr. Schindler was a human being, not infallible like many heroes. But his bravery has truly made him stand out and worthy of honor. There is nothing I can say that could describe him any better than in the words of Mr. Zuckerman. 
`I am one of the Survivors and I owe my life to the courage and strength of this great man. He was not a diplomat or a politician, he was a very good manipulator. He had the courage and the knowledge to save over 1200 Jews from death. He managed somehow to fool the Germans into thinking he was on their side when all along he was going behind their backs to save the Jews. His life was always in danger but still he persisted to do what he knew to be the right thing, he saved the Jews anyway he could. He bartered, he lied, he used his own money, he did everything humanly possible to save us. He was very unselfish as his life could have ended at any time but still he did all he could to save the Jews.' 
Mr. President, Senator Specter and I are submitting this resolution today to call on the Postal Service to issue a stamp commemorating the life of Oskar Schindler. Such a stamp would bring the story to millions of people. It would help us all understand that one individual can make a difference in the lives of others. 
We understand that we face somewhat of an uphill battle as Mr. Schindler is not a citizen of the United States. The Postal Service tells me that its policy is to issue stamps that depict American subjects. But we say in response that Mr. Schindler's life was largely devoted to the pursuit of freedom, to opposing tyranny, and to humanitarianism. These qualities certainly represent the American ideal and we believe that Mr. Schindler deserves the honor that the Postal Service has bestowed on other individuals who stood for these ideals. I am pleased to sponsor this important measure.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to extend my congratulations to Deborah Miller on her 14 years of outstanding service to the Solomon Schecter Day School of Raritan Valley in East Brunswick, NJ, where she currently serves as Director. Deborah has decided to leave the school to pursue her own education, and I want to wish her continued success in her future endeavors. 
While I'm sure that everyone at Solomon Schecter is saddened by Deborah's departure, her eagerness to earn a Ph.D. in Jewish Education at the Jewish Theological Seminary is a fitting next step in Deborah's already distinguished academic career. After finishing her undergraduate work at Barnard College, Deborah went on to earn a Masters in Jewish Education and a Day School Principals Certificate from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. 
Deborah has been a devoted educator and administrator during her many years teaching. Since her arrival at Solomon Schecter Day School 14 years ago, Deborah has done everything to develop the school and make it a complete success. 
While Deborah has served as Director, the school has been nationally recognized for its excellence in education. It is particularly well known for its integration of Jewish and General Studies curricula and its `immersion' Jewish Studies courses in Hebrew. The school has also grown in size during Deborah's tenure. It originally taught students in pre-kindergarten through 6th grade. Now the school teaches 7th and 8th graders as well. When Deborah started, there were 180 students enrolled. Now there are 315. 
As if Deborah didn't have enough to keep her busy, her extracurricular activities are equally impressive. Outside of Solomon Schecter, Deborah teaches Jewish Studies to adults in neighboring educational facilities and synagogues. She also happens to be a well-known author of children's fiction. She currently has written five books for children about Judaism. Her style is clever and fun-loving, and her books are enjoyed by all ages as a result. 
Deborah's departure from Solomon Schecter Day School may be bittersweet, but she has a great deal to look forward to as she continues to learn about Jewish literature, history and the Torah. The lucky ones are not only those who have known her at Solomon Schecter, but those students who will have the privilege of being in Deborah's classroom when she returns to teaching full time.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr President, I rise today to congratulate the students of East Brunswick High School, national champions of the We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution. This program, administered by the Center for Civic Education and funded by the Department of Education, is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Competing against 50 classes, the East Brunswick High School students demonstrated their superior knowledge of the Constitution in three days of simulated Congressional hearings in which students were required to apply constitutional principles and historical facts to contemporary situations. 
These young scholars worked diligently to reach and win the national finals by winning local competitions in my home state of New Jersey. I am proud to recognize the distinguished members of the class representing New Jersey: 
Mian Amy, Michael Carr, Daniel Cohen, Michael Cohen, Stacie Dubin, Andrea Feit, Naomi Finkelstein, Christian Forsythe, Hillary Gallanter, Gina Gancheva, Heather Gershen, Brett Gursky, Denise Heitzenroder, Rachel Katz, Terry Lin, Jonathan Meer, George Mossad, Amanda Rosen, Joel Pruce, Niyati Shah, Naseer Siddique, Michael Sturm, Robert Thompson, Howard Wachtel, Ari Waldman, Jamie Yonks, Joanna Young. 
I would also like to recognize their teacher, John Calimano, who deserves much of the credit for the success of the class. The district coordinator, Robert Strangia, and the state coordinator, Evelyn Taraszkiewicz also contributed a significant amount of time and effort to help the class win the national finals. 
I commend these constitutional experts for their great achievement.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first just a brief commentary, if I might, to say that Senator Roth and Senator Kerrey did the country a wonderful service by the reform measure that was put through to try to assure the public that Congress listens, the Government listens, that people should be treated fairly at all times; that there is no excuse for rudeness and inappropriate pressure on those people who pay their taxes. They are the constituents and we are here to serve them. I commend both Senators, the managers on both sides, Senators Roth and Kerrey, for a job well done.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a matter that is triggered by something I read in the newspaper this morning. I saw it in the Washington Post and I saw it in the New York Times, a statement that House Speaker Gingrich made when he held a press conference in which he criticized the Clinton administration's handling of the peace process. 
Now, he, like any one of us in the Congress, has a right to disagree with the administration on policy, but I think it is dangerous, destructive, certainly demagogic, to say that `America's strong-arm tactics would send a clear signal to the supporters of terrorism that their murderous actions are an effective tool in forcing concessions from Israel.' 
That is an outrageous statement to make because it accuses President Clinton. Further in his statement, and I quote him here: 
Now it's become the Clinton administration and Arafat against Israel, Gingrich said at a Capitol news conference. He also released a letter he sent to President Clinton saying that `Israel must be able to decide her own security needs and set her own conditions for negotiations without facing coercion from the United States.' As Israel celebrates its 50th anniversary, Speaker Gingrich said the Clinton administration says, `Happy birthday. Let us blackmail you on behalf of Arafat.' 
In his letter he gave the quote that I just read about America's strong-arm tactics, sending `a clear message that terrorism was an acceptable tool in forcing concessions from Israel.' 
Mr. President, I know Israel very well. I had the good fortune over a 3-year period to serve as chairman of the United Jewish Appeal. That is the fundraising arm that helps local 
institutions within the Jewish community, as well as Israel. This was over 20 years ago when Israel was getting on its feet. I know lots of people there. I know many people who have lost a son, lost a daughter. I know many people who visit in the hospitals regularly where their children or their friends or their loved ones are in a condition that keeps them hospitalized because of wounds they received during the wars. 
I was able to visit Israel within a couple of days after the 1973 war was concluded while they were still searching for bodies on both sides, Egypt and Israel, in the Sinai desert, and I talked to people who regret so much that they are forced at times to inflict pain on their neighbors to protect themselves. 
The Israelis have lost some 20,000 soldiers in wars since that country was founded--50 years. That is a short period of time. In the whole of the 20th century, the United States will have lost less than 400,000 soldiers in combat. I was in Europe during the war. I served in the Army in World War II. Mr. President, 20,000 Israelis is the equivalent of 1 million soldiers, 1 million fighters lost in the United States on a comparative basis--1 million. Could you imagine the heartbreak in this country that would exist if we lost a million soldiers in a period of 50 years? It would tear us apart. 
Mr. President, I make this point. I served here under President Reagan, I served here under President Bush, and I knew President Carter very well because I had tried to help them at times when I was running a company in the computer business. They have been good friends to Israel because Israel and the United States have many common interests--the strength of a democracy, the ability to withstand adversity and come up providing freedom at all times for their citizens. But there has never been a better friend in the White House among the four Presidents I just mentioned than President Clinton. President Clinton has approached Israel from the mind as well as the heart. He understands what the relationship of Israel to the civilized world, to the democratic world, means. And he insists that they be permitted to negotiate on their own. 
But as the President and the administration and the State Department tried to permit the Israelis and the Palestinians to negotiate their own terms, we were called back; we were called in to act as a go-between. I don't even want to use the term `as a negotiator' because it is up to the parties to negotiate. But we have been called on to try to facilitate the negotiations. And that has been the mission. 
And so, Mr. President, I think it is outrageous that President Clinton, that this administration be declared as someone alongside terrorists, encouraging Arafat, encouraging those who would destroy Israelis. It is an outrage, it is demagoguery at its worst, and I don't think that kind of debate ought to be used, whether it is to gain votes or whatever else one can gain from those kinds of statements. It doesn't further the cause of peace, and it doesn't help our friendship with any of the countries in the area. It is the wrong way to go. 
Mr. President, I believe--and I know that people in Israel believe--they have to have peace because it is unlike some other parts of the world where the absence of peace doesn't necessarily mean violence or war. There are tense relations in many parts of the world with one country alongside the other where there is no killing between them. It doesn't mean that there is affection. It doesn't mean that there is necessarily diplomatic or economic pursuits between these places. But in that area, I think most people are convinced that if it is not peace, it is violence, it is war. That is a condition that every one of us wants to see avoided. And so I hope we can take some comfort in the fact that we, the United States, are trying to be helpful to all parties there. We have worked very hard to make sure that Israel has the ability to call upon us when she needs a friend in world forums. 
We are friendly and supportive of Egypt and Jordan and even attempt to try to get the Palestinian Authority to renounce parts of their covenant that says they want to destroy Israel. Yes, we don't like that. But to suggest, on the other hand, that President Clinton is someone who wants to send Israel a threatening message that comes from the terrorist side of the equation is unfair and, again I say, outrageous. 
So I hope the Israelis and the Palestinians will be able to pursue a peaceful discourse. No one--no one--knows what Israel needs by way of its security better than the people of Israel. They have to make that decision. It is not going to be made in Washington, it is going to be made in Jerusalem. It is going to be made between the parties, and we have to let them do that, but recognize that they want us to play a role. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, while Senator Byrd is here, I would like to take this opportunity to make just a few remarks, daring to venture into the lion's den because of the eloquence that Senator Byrd brings to his thought and to his speech. 
I have been a long-time admirer of Senator Byrd. I have been here 16 years. As I looked around the room, I noted that there were only six others who had been here as long as I have, which gives me a relative senior status, although the Chamber wasn't filled, and I regret that it wasn't because I know that everybody responds the same way as I do when Senator Byrd speaks. You always learn something of quite an incredible nature, and we are always in awe of his intellect and his memory. 
I will never forget my earliest days here when I went in to visit Senator Byrd because I was anxious to serve on the Appropriations Committee. And Senator Byrd gave me a treatise on English kings, reaching back, I think, somewhere before William the Conqueror. I am not going to try to duplicate anything that Senator Byrd said by way of recall, but I remember that that was in the 1000s, I guess. And I listened while Senator Byrd talked about Ethelberht and all of those, and how each one succeeded the other and how each one died and how long each one served. I walked out shaking my head, and I said, `What is there about this man that enables him to remember so much for such a long period of time?' 
Senator Byrd cast his 15,000th vote this day, and he is our Babe Ruth, there is no doubt about that, having accomplished things that none other before him ever accomplished. But it is not just the votes. As the Senator said, it is the quality; it is the kind of votes that we are casting. 
I asked Senator Byrd before he stood up to make his remarks did he have any regrets. And he repeated publicly what he said to me privately--there were a few. But I think he probably remembers darned near every vote that he has cast. He certainly remembers those that were of major magnitude. 
There are a few of us in this room, Senator Byrd, who are not going to cast 15,000 votes. I would like to do it, but I may have to do it from some place on high. Not only do we treasure Senator Byrd's presence here, but for me one of the great honors of having served in this body, and I consider it a tremendous honor; I come from immigrant parents. They came early in the century as little children, but their aspirations were limited, never suspecting, though always believing that it could happen to their son, that I would have the distinction of serving in this body. 
Senator Byrd reminds us that only 1,840-some have ever served here since the founding of this country. And when I opened my desk top, I saw that one of the names in there was Truman, Missouri, and wherever I moved, Senator Byrd, I have always taken that desk with me. So there is so much honor and so much grace that falls our way, but one of the great honors for me has been to serve with you, Senator Byrd, master 
of all about the Senate. I don't think anyone ever loved the body with the same depth of interest, not just affection, as Senator Byrd has shown us in his years here. It is always an uplifting experience to listen to Senator Byrd talk about the Senate and to bring us to our dignity by asking us once in a while to sit down and cast our vote from our seats. It is for me, relatively seasoned, a refresher about the dignity of this body and the removal from the squabble and the hostility that sometimes has occasion to rise here. It doesn't make it any less of a distinction or a privilege to serve here, but every now and then, Senator Byrd, I thank you for bringing us back to our senses about where we are in this great Nation of ours and how fortunate we are to have known one another. 
But you, Senator Byrd, have, I think--I come out of the computer business--probably been a model for those who wanted to construct a computer that would have vast memory, quick response, and developed intelligence, not artificial at all but real, and I salute you on this 15,000th vote to say that I know, for as long as I serve in this body, you will continue to inspire and encourage all of us, and I thank you for the contribution you have made to the country and to me as well. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment to S. 1186, the `Workforce Investment Partnership Act.' My amendment will provide a mechanism for 59 U.S. cities currently administering locally-tailored workforce development services under the Job Training Partnership Act to retain their designation as Service Delivery Areas (SDAs). This amendment allows those 59 cities that are existing SDAs, with successful job training programs, to appeal to the Secretary of Labor if the Governor of their State denies their request to retain SDA status. 
Without my amendment, 59 cities, with 200,000 people or more, that had previously been SDAs but whose populations are under the new 500,000 threshold, would have to specially request SDA designation from their State. Among others, these cities include Denver, Colorado; Fort Worth, Texas; Long Beach, California; Akron, Ohio; Omaha, Nebraska; and two cities in my state of New Jersey, Jersey City and Newark. If Governors have sole discretion to terminate SDA designations, successful and long standing community job training programs would be terminated. This could be disruptive to cities that are taking leadership roles in implementing welfare-to-work job training programs to meet welfare reform goals. 
I support the goal of S.1186 to consolidate job training and employment programs into a more efficient workforce development system. I believe that creating an appeal mechanism for existing SDA designated cities with productive programs, like Newark and Jersey City, will enhance this legislation's objective to meet that goal. 
I want to thank the bill's managers, Senators DeWine and Wellstone, as well as the Ranking Democratic Member on the Labor Committee, Senator Kennedy, for working with me on this issue. They should be congratulated on creating a strong, bipartisan bill. I am grateful that Senator Wellstone, Senator Kennedy and Secretary Herman have committed their support to this provision when S.1186 goes to conference.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of expanding NATO to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. 
As the Congress has considered this issue, I have evaluated the arguments for and against NATO expansion. There are compelling arguments on both sides. However, on balance, I have concluded that this round of NATO expansion should be supported. 
The first question I asked myself in making this vitally important decision is whether expanding NATO serves America's national security interests. I concluded that it does. 
America has fought two brutal world wars in Europe, and we have thousands of troops stationed in Bosnia. Our vital interests in promoting European stability and democracy are clear. 
I believe that NATO expansion will promote stability in Europe. The mere possibility that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic might be invited to join NATO created a strong incentive for them to resolve peacefully longstanding ethnic and border disputes and to improve ties with their neighbors. Hungary, for example, concluded Basic Treaties on Understanding, Cooperation, and Good-Neighborliness with Slovakia and Romania in 1996, and its relations with Romania are greatly improved. Clearly, Europe is more stable as a result, and that is good for America. 
While I hope tensions will not arise in the future among any of these new members, they may. If these countries are not NATO members, our ability to prevent tensions from boiling over into full-blown conflicts will be more limited. Experience has shown that NATO can play a constructive role in resolving conflicts between members, helping reconcile former adversaries like France and Germany and moderating tensions between Turkey and Greece. It could play the same role in mediating conflicts between new member countries. 
NATO strength has come from the fact that it is not only a security alliance but also a political organization. Just as it has been a force for stability in Europe, so it has been a force for democratic development. Now that the Cold War is over, that political role will be increasingly important. By including Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in NATO, the U.S. and NATO will have a greater ability to influence the continued democratic development of these countries. 
Furthermore, expanding NATO will advance America's long sought goal of defense burden sharing. We've spent a considerable amount of time in the Senate debating the costs of NATO. But few have talked about the benefits of including three countries that are willing and prepared to share the defense burden in the Alliance. Already prospective members are working with NATO through the Partnership for Peace program and serving with American troops in Bosnia. All three would have supported American air strikes in Iraq. They're willing to pay their fair share and contribute to the collective defense. The West ought to welcome them. 
The second question I asked in making this decision, Mr. President, was whether each of the prospective NATO countries meets the five criteria articulated in 1996 by then Secretary of Defense Perry: commitment to democratic reform; commitment to a free market economy; good neighborly relations; civilian control of the military; and military capability to operate effectively with our other NATO allies. I am satisfied that each of the countries the Senate is being asked to approve for NATO membership meets these criteria. 
In Poland, where communism once reigned, democracy is flourishing. Seven free and fair elections have been held since 1989, and two democratic changes in the government have taken place. A new Polish constitution has been approved in a popular referendum. The judiciary is independent, and the press is free. 
As a result of Poland's economic reform program, the country currently has one of the fastest growing economies in Europe. The private sector is thriving and currently accounts for about two-thirds of GDP and about 60% of the country's work force. 
Poland has good relations with all seven of the states it borders. Its new constitution codifies civilian control as well as parliamentary oversight of the military. And American officials have determined that Poland has the most capable armed forces in Eastern Europe. 
Hungary receives high marks on each of these criteria as well. 
A stable, parliamentary democracy, Hungary has had two democratic changes of government since 1989 in free and fair elections. Its governmental institutions are stable, and its judiciary is independent. 
Since 1989, the country has implemented price and trade liberalization, extensive privatization and instituted important legal changes. That almost one-third of all foreign direct investment in Central and Eastern Europe has been attracted to Hungary speaks to the strength and attractiveness of its economy. 
After many years of tension, Hungary has made tremendous strides in improving its relations with neighboring countries, such as Romania, where large concentrations of ethnic Hungarians reside. New Treaties with Slovakia and Romania include important provisions on ethnic minority rights and reconfirms Hungary's commitment to respect existing borders. 
Importantly, Hungary's military is under civilian control, and its armed forces are reorganizing to meet NATO standards. 
Finally, Mr. President, there is the Czech Republic, a parliamentary democracy which has held three free and fair elections since 1989. Vaclav Havel, a former political prisoner and human rights advocate, serves as President and conscience of the country. 
The economy of the Czech Republic has been so transformed that nearly 80% is currently in private hands, an astonishing amount for a formerly centrally planned economy, and 65 percent of the GDP is generated by the private sector. Since 1991, the Czech Republic has operated on a balanced budget. Relations between the Czech Republic and its neighbors, including Germany and Slovakia, are sound. And the Czech military is under civilian control. 
As a Member of the Helsinki Commission, I am aware of the issues that continue to form a part of the U.S.-Czech bilateral dialogue, including property restitution problems and discrimination against the Romani minority. At the same time, I believe that Czech leaders are committed to resolving these problems and I am committed to working with the Czech Government until they are. 
I am keenly aware, Mr. President, that there are some risks involved in expanding NATO and that many are deeply concerned about the impact that expanding NATO will have on our relations with Russia. I have thought long and hard about this risk. I have discussed it at length with Undersecretary Pickering, and I have concluded that while NATO expansion may create some complications in our relations with Russia, those difficulties can be managed. 
Despite the fact that most of the Russian political elite say they oppose enlargement, Russia continues to pursue a cooperative relationship with the U.S. Public opinion polls in Russia reveal that the vast majority of the Russian public would rather cooperate with than confront the enlarging Western alliance. 
Even on arms control issues, progress is being made with the Russians despite the debate over NATO expansion. For example, Russia has continued to implement START I reductions in strategic forces. In fact, I am told that Russia is dismantling its strategic nuclear forces more rapidly than the Treaty requires. 
Despite the fact that NATO was well on its way to expansion, at the March 1997 summit in Helsinki, President Yeltsin agreed to the outlines of a START III accord, and he agreed to urge the Duma to ratify START II. Importantly, there are signs that the Duma will move forward and ratify the START II agreement this summer because, according to Duma speaker Seleznev, it `meets Russia's interests.' 
There are other positive signs regarding arms control. While NATO expansion was being debated, Russia ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention. It also continued to work with the U.S. on adaptation to the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty. 
While I do not have a crystal ball, and I cannot predict the future of arms control, I am encouraged by these signs. They indicate to me that this round of NATO expansion will not derail arms control. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the inclusion of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into NATO. Expanding NATO will erase Stalin's artificial dividing line. Poland, Hungary, and the former Czechoslovakia ended up, against their will, on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain after the Second World War. Now that democracy is flourishing in each of these countries, it is to America's advantage to erase that dividing line and bring them into the NATO alliance. We expanded NATO in 1952 when we allowed Greece and Turkey to join. We expanded it in 1955 when we allowed Germany to join. And we expanded it in 1982 when we invited Spain to join. 
We should expand it now by allowing Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to join as well.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate an esteemed New Jerseyan, Rabbi Jack M. Rosoff, on the occasion of his retirement after 34 years of service at Congregations B'nai Israel in Rumson, New Jersey. 
I really got to know Rabbi Rosoff when he organized a community-wide response to acts of vandalism committed against B'nai Israel and the neighboring Catholic church in Rumson. I spoke at the rally that Rabbi Rosoff put together condemning the desecration, and was very moved by his dedication to fighting bigotry. 
Rabbi Rosoff's accomplishments during his tenure at B'nai Israel, for which he has just been elevated to Rabbi Emeritus status, are almost too numerous to mention. He has multiplied the membership of his congregation by hundreds and provided Sunday school opportunities for over 300 students. He developed the Israel Scholarship Program there, enabling all students in their junior year to spend six weeks in Israel. 
Beyond those achievements, Jack has been a counselor and friend to the members of his synagogue. He has rejoiced with them in times of happiness and has been a comfort in times of grief. 
Rabbi Rosoff has served on the boards of various organizations in Monmouth County, including Riverview Hospital, the Mental Health Association, the Day Care Center, the Clergy Advisory Council of the local Planned Parenthood, as well as being the founding member of the Greater Red Bank Interfaith Council. 
Rabbi Rosoff should be honored by all of us not only for his 34 years of service to B'nai Israel, but for his community-wide leadership and civic involvement. I am pleased to congratulate him again on his retirement, and wish him well in this next chapter of his life.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to add a provision to the Brady Handgun Background Check Form to enforce the prohibition that persons under a restraining order for harassing, stalking or threatening an intimate partner or child cannot purchase a gun. 
The Background Check Form, used by law enforcement and gun dealers to enforce the Brady Handgun Violence Protection Act, currently requires a purchaser to answer questions on whether he or she falls into one of the categories prohibited from purchasing a gun. The form asks whether the purchaser has been convicted of a felony, has been declared mentally defective or been committed to a mental institution, is an illegal alien, fugitive from justice or an illegal user of drugs--all of which would disqualify the person from lawfully purchasing a gun. However, there is one very important disqualification not listed on this form. The 1994 Crime Act prohibits a person under a restraining order for harassing, stalking or threatening an intimate partner or the child of that partner from purchasing a gun. But this disqualification is not on the Brady Background Check Form--in fact it is the only disqualification not on the Form. 
Dealers, law enforcement agencies, and purchasers rely on the form to provide notice as to who is prohibited from purchasing a handgun, and law enforcement agencies use the form as a guide in making background checks. This omission on the Brady Form means persons under restraining orders for harassing, stalking and threatening their partners and their partner's children can more easily obtain a gun even though it is illegal for them to do so. My legislation is necessary because all changes to the form are required to be done by legislation rather than by regulation or order. 
This simple change to the Brady Check List can mean the difference between life and death for women and children across America. Domestic violence in the United States remains the number one threat of injury to women ages 15 to 44, and hundreds of thousands of women are forced to obtain restraining orders to protect themselves and their children from abusive partners every year. More than twice as many women are shot and killed each year by their husbands or intimate partners than by strangers. 
Mr. President, Congress has already recognized that persons who are under restraining orders for harassing, stalking, and threatening their spouses, partners, and children should not be able to buy a gun. This simple bill will help to enforce this important prohibition to keep guns out of the hands of those who pose a real and serious threat to their partners and children. Every year we see tragic incidents of victims of domestic violence who have obtained restraining orders only to be murdered by their partner. 
I hope you will join me and support this worthy bill to protect victims of domestic violence from the dangers that follow when their abusive partner gains access to a gun.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Coverdell bill. This bill will undermine our public schools and provide the bulk of the tax breaks to wealthy individuals. 
Mr. President, before I talk about the Coverdell bill, I want to make two points. First, I am not opposed to tax cuts for families which help them make ends meet and invest in their children. For example, last year I supported the $500 family tax credit and the HOPE Scholarship $1,500 tax credit for college tuition both contained in the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act. I also believe that we can enact further targeted tax cuts for hard working middle class families this year without tapping the surplus. 
Second, I am not opposed to private schools. In fact, I commend the teachers and administrators in private schools for their work. And I strongly support the mission of the private schools in my State. Catholic, Jewish, and other parochial and private schools provide an excellent education to thousands of New Jersey children. 
But I am also a strong supporter of our public school system, because 93 percent of all children go to public schools. They come from all different, racial, ethnic, religious, disability, academic and financial backgrounds. They are generally poorer than children who go to private schools. They tend to live in unsafe neighborhoods--surrounded by crime and drugs. They mostly attend schools that are in need of great repair. Many have no textbooks and ancient computer equipment that does not provide them access to the internet. 
Mr. President, these children should be our highest priority. And I will never give up on them. 
I strongly believe in educational equity--the ability for all kids to have access to an excellent education with modern facilities and talented teachers. But the Coverdell bill will only make our educational system less equitable. If we pass it, we are turning our backs on our public schools. 
Mr. President, as ranking member of the Budget Committee, I must tell my colleagues that Federal budgeting is a zero sum game. And since this bill effectively spends money to help private schools, we cannot spend more for public schools. It is that simple. 
Unfortunately, our public schools have enormous financial needs. For example, our schools need a tremendous amount of modernization. In fact, our existing school buildings are in such poor shape, the General Accounting Office estimated that we need to spend $112 billion on repairs and renovations. Fourteen million children--mostly from poor or inner-city school districts--attend schools that need extensive repair or replacement. 
But the needs of our public schools do not stop here. They need modern computers. They need to be hooked up to the internet. They need more teachers to reduce class size. That is why the President proposed hiring 100,000 new teachers. We also need greater funding for educating disabled children. And the list goes on and on. That is why the 93 percent of all American children who attend them should be our number one priority. 
Mr. President, this bill is also unfair as a matter of tax policy. While we are awaiting final figures from the Treasury Department, I would like to point out the tax distribution of last year's Coverdell bill. Under last year's Coverdell bill, the average tax benefit for the richest 20 percent of all Americans would be $96. But do you know what the average tax benefit would be for the lowest 20 percent of all Americans? One dollar! One buck! 
Mr. President, this means that the richest Americans would get ninety-six times the tax break that the poorest Americans would get under the old Coverdell bill. Now, I understand that this new Coverdell bill is slightly modified, but I understand that the same dramatic inequity still exists. 
We simply should not pass a tax bill that is so skewed toward the rich. Any tax relief should be focused towards middle class Americans--people who work hard to raise their families. 
Mr. President, the Democratic alternative to this bill meets part of our educational needs in an equitable manner. It will provide tax incentives for employer paid education and pre-paid college tuition plans that exist in many states. It also provides $22 billion for school modernization. This will mean that thousands of schools across our country will have better science labs, safer classrooms and smaller class size. 
If we pass the Democratic education plan, along with the President's proposals to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class size, increase the number of tutors available and create new education opportunity zones, we will see real improvements in our educational system both public and private. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that the President has indicated that he will veto the Coverdell bill. It will hurt our public schools and provide a tax break for the rich on top of it. When it comes to our public school children, this bill says `let them eat cake.' 
I ask my colleagues to oppose this legislation for the sake of the millions of children who walk through the public school door house every day and seek a solid physical and educational foundation.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Rutgers University women's basketball coach, C. Vivian Stringer, and her team for their excellent success this past season when the Scarlet Knights made it to the NCAA Tournament. 
Even though Rutgers didn't make it to the NCAA Final Four, losing to the Tennessee Lady Volunteers 92-60, Vivian and the talented young women whom she has recruited and cultivated are champions to all New Jerseyans. 
Vivian began her career building the fledgling women's basketball program at Cheyney State in Pennsylvania, bringing the team to the NCAA Championship game in 1982. She moved on to Iowa State, where for nine consecutive seasons she brought her team to the NCAA Tournament. And then she landed at Rutgers. 
As one most respected head coaches in women's basketball history, Vivian has been named National Coach of the Year three times by her peers, as well as getting Coach of the Year awards from Sports Illustrated, USA Today, Naismith and the Black Coaches Association. 
So Vivian's success at Rutgers, however remarkable, is not unexpected. Before this year, the Scarlet Knights had not been to the NCAA Tournament since 1994. A recent news article in Newark, New Jersey's Star-Ledger describes the reasons behind Vivian's thriving tenure best, I think. It said that Vivian, now in her third season: `pumped Rutgers with fresh talent and a distaste for mediocrity, a combination that has triggered the Scarlet Knights' rise and surge through the NCAA Tournament.' 
Vivian has worked hard to recruit gifted women, instill discipline in practice and competition, and most importantly, inspire self-confidence among the players. The women attracted to the Rutger's basketball program all excelled in their high school years and have a strong desire to contribute to the game at a college level. The number of awards that the players on the team have received individually is part of an impressive collection, with honors such as Parade all-American, Rookies of the Year, Gatorade Player of the Year, and Sports Illustrated `Faces in the Crowd.' 
Again, I congratulate Vivian on her hard work and the ambitious young women who play for her. I wish them continued success.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I would like to stand with the Majority Leader not only in affirming the importance of pipelines to our national transportation infrastructure, but also as a personal witness to the damage that a pipeline accident can have on victims of pipeline eruptions, and particularly to the community. 
Four years ago, around midnight, on March 24, 1994, a major natural gas pipeline ruptured in Edison, New Jersey, a densely populated, urban environment. This rupture caused a deafening boom, awakening residents of the Durham Woods apartment complex. Seconds later, a plume of fire and gas shot hundreds of feet above the ground. Thankfully, the more than one thousand residents fled their homes, all leaving before the explosion leveled the Durham Woods apartment complex. I visited the site after the blast. I saw how the explosion incinerated cars, playground equipment and trees. Over one hundred people suffered injuries from the fire. One woman died from a heart attack. It was a miracle that nobody else died from that disaster. Four years later, the victims still suffer emotionally and physically. Some are still awaiting settlements. They escaped with their lives but their lives are not the same. A state grand jury determined that the disaster probably was tied to damage caused earlier by unauthorized excavation which weakened the pipe, causing it to explode.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, the Safety Board is right. Following the disaster, the State of New Jersey adopted a comprehensive one-call program that mandates participation throughout the state. It has been a resounding success. Every year since its adoption, accidental hits have decreased. In 1995 --the first year of the program, there were 4,624 hits of underground lines in 1.7 million excavations. In 1996, there were 3,974 hits in 2.1 million excavations. And last year, there were 3,796 hits in 2.5 million excavations--a success rate of 98.8 percent. 
One call programs work. We in New Jersey have seen the devastation caused by pipeline eruptions. We in New Jersey have seen what a one-call program can do.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I cannot agree more. States need the full participation of every stakeholder in order for a one-call program to be successful. A comprehensive national one-call initiative is far from comprehensive, far from national, if a major industry that has a significant role in the location of pipelines along their rights of way chooses to take a walk on an initiative that is important in protecting our communities and the environment against the damage incurred by pipeline accidents. 
As the Majority Leader noted, the Senate adopted the Lott-Daschle one-call bill as part of ISTEA reauthorization. This is not without precedent. The Administration included a one-call provision in its NEXTEA bill. A one-call bill, sponsored by my colleague from New Jersey, Congressman Frank Pallone, and Congressman Richard Baker of Louisiana, is moving through the House of Representatives. The support lies in the Senate, in the Administration, and in key areas in the House. All we need is to break that logjam and sign a comprehensive one-call bill into law. All that is standing in its way is that the railroads' adamant opposition to the bill--opposition that is preventing the bill from moving ahead. It would be a shame if we missed out on this opportunity to pass this safety initiative only because of the railroad industry.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I too support our nation's railroads. Railroads play a critical role in my state in particular. Ships arrive in the intermodal hub that is the Port of New York and New Jersey, unload containers directly onto railroad cars, and send them into the heartland of the United States. Railroad lines exist throughout the state. That is exactly why I care about this issue and urge the railroads to join us in this effort to enact a comprensive bill into law. 
Madam President, I want to commend the Majority Leader for his involvement and diligence on this issue. Safety must be paramount. And that is what this issue is all about.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Grams amendment. As he clearly says, the budget surplus should be used to, perhaps, establish personal savings accounts. At the same time I heard the Senator say we all want to save Social Security. 
If we want to save it, then we ought to pay down the debt, shore up Social Security, and not turn over to the private sector the opportunity now to engage in individual savings accounts. This is not the place to do it. Perhaps it ought to be considered 1 day, but this would completely upset the principle of saving Social Security first. If we are going to talk about it, then we ought to really mean it and put all surpluses into saving Social Security and reducing the debt. I think that is the proper way to go, and I hope all my colleagues vote against this amendment.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Then I owe the Senator an apology. I will start all over. I don't call attention to the fact that he has sent a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to the desk. 
This amendment, however, Mr. President, would prohibit any Member of the Senate from offering a sense of the Senate or sense of the Congress amendment to a budget resolution. The budget resolution already places serious restrictions on minority participation. This is how we get there. When you are on this side next year, you will know how it feels to be in the minority and you will have an opportunity to amend things that you don't see. 
I, frankly, don't see a lot of harm in it. It takes time, yes, but it gives a chance for an exchange of ideas that I think is important.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Allard amendment. It is going to impose excessively rigid strictures on the way we function. What it says, very simply, is that any time that income does not exceed expense, that revenues do not exceed outlays, there is a 60-vote point of order to make any change to accommodate it. 
Just think what the consequences might be. We use our opportunities here to sometimes adjust to an economy that is in stress. We could be endangering our national security, because though a declaration of war may not have been made, the fact of the matter is that military preparation may be necessary in advance of that. 
What happens if our outlays exceed our revenues? We cannot go ahead and take care of our necessary business. What happens in times of depression when, in fact, revenues may be down and we may have a need to increase our expenses to help us carry our citizens through that period of time? 
What it does is it excessively restricts our ability to function. Proper fiscal policy is an important part of operating our Government. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the request to waive the Budget Act.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment establishes a reserve fund to allow revenues, taxes paid by large corporate taxpayers, to be used in a manner that is directly connected to environmental cleanup. 
Right now, the bill that we are considering permits only the use of $200 million out of a total revenue base of $1.7 billion to be used for environmental cleanup. Frankly, I think that is wrong. 
What we need to do is make sure that these funds are available for the purpose that it is collected. We don't want to see it going to tax breaks or other programs. Only $200 million of this will be used to pay for the `orphan shares,' those shares for which no polluter can be found. It is insufficient to take care of the job. That is the way Superfund was originally designed. 
I hope we can waive the budget point of order that has been raised.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment by the Senator from Kansas. This amendment calls for a change in the Budget Act that would allow discretionary programs to be completely eliminated in order to provide new tax breaks for purposes other than the initial direction for this funding. I'm not sure that I understand who would determine that. Would it be the Budget Committee that would determine that? Would it be the specific committees? Would we go to Environmental and say, eliminate this environmental cleanup program? Or would we go to the Department of Transportation and say, eliminate safety programs, eliminate parts of the programs that are not financed through the trust fund? 
This would be an incredible departure from the rules that are established in the balanced budget agreement. It could threaten just about anything--education, anticrime efforts, environmental programs--defense, as well, by the way. 
We know that we have a debate here between those who would typically like to spend more for defense or those who say, look, we have spent enough on defense to keep our security intact. How about the Coast Guard? You could come from a landlocked State and say, what do we need the Coast Guard for? How about other departments? Some might disagree with us on a program to protect our water or any number of programs that are often represented regionally. 
Frankly, I see this as a terrible prospect to contemplate. The Budget Act is designed to ensure that if we incur permanent obligations such as permanent tax cuts or new mandatory spending, we pay for these obligations with permanent savings. 
That is what the pay-as-you-go plan rules are all about. It has worked out well for many years. This amendment would change these rules. It says we should make cuts in temporary spending--that is, annually appropriated discretionary programs--and use those temporary cuts to fund permanent tax breaks. Well, it doesn't take a CPA to figure out that this can create serious problems in the long run. Cutting funding for a program in one year doesn't mean those savings are going to remain available in future years. Once you have a tax break on the books, its costs regularly occur, year after year. 
I am not opposed to tax cuts for ordinary Americans. In fact, I supported targeted relief like the expanded child care credit that the President proposed. But I think we ought to pay for tax cuts with permanent savings. I am also concerned that Senator Brownback's proposal could encourage further cuts from programs that educate us and help us continue the pursuit of a cleaner environment, put the cops on the streets, and make sure that our service people are well housed and equipped to do their duty. 
The budget agreement is already calling for substantial real cuts in discretionary programs. Under the agreement, nondefense discretionary spending in 2002 will reach its lowest level in almost 40 years as a share of GDP. These cuts are getting close to the bone, and we need to be careful about cutting further, especially if further budget cuts are to be used for large tax breaks that could very well blow a hole in the budget for the future. 
So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will agree that this is no time, nor is it the correct process, for radical surgery on the Budget Act. If we want to do that, we can discuss it within the Budget Committee. This is a new subject. Let us not create fiscal problems in the future by allowing short-term cuts to pay for long-term costs, because I suspect that in there, there is a mission, and that is to kind of take care of the people who are largely at the top of the ladder, who benefit from most of the tax cut proposals we have seen. 
Let's not encourage further cuts in programs that deal with education and crime. Do you want to tell veterans--I am a World War II veteran. I served 3 years in the Army overseas during the war. Do you want to tell my colleagues--and many are not as fortunate as I am, to have this kind of a position--do you want to tell them that someone may want to cut their programs on behalf of the tax cuts for the well off? I don't see it, and I sure don't want to tinker with defense. I am not what you call a traditional hawk, Mr. President. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have respect for the Senator from Kansas. We have gotten to know each other a little bit. When we disagree, it is with a purpose of accomplishing something. When he talks about getting a big applause line in Kansas if there were to be the elimination of the subsidy for tobacco, well, I happen to agree with the Senator on the elimination of the subsidy for tobacco, but I wonder whether it would get an applause line in North Carolina or Kentucky or South Carolina. What if I were to say, well, let's reduce the cost for the Corps of Engineers, we don't have to do all that flooding work, or maybe eliminate the program for agricultural subsidies because in New Jersey our farmers are pretty close to market and they don't need a lot of subsidy, they don't draw down subsidy? 
The point I make--without being too challenging, or too pedantic--is that what the Senator described is exactly the problem, a Nation with 50 States, one Nation wanting each of us here--and there isn't anybody here who hasn't stood up to protect a program in their State without feeling that they are doing the right thing. 
I don't know of anybody here. 
We have to respect those differences. I am not saying promote tobacco. I am not saying encourage agriculture. I am not saying that we ought to have our ports dredged and no one else ought to have an opportunity to move their economies along. When we lose our beaches in a storm, it is no different than a flood in Kansas, or a drought, or a tornado. It is our economy that is kept going. But, apart from that, the notion that we could suddenly change the rules and say, OK, who is it that is going to decide we are going to eliminate this program? I guarantee you that there will be quite a debate in this body about what programs get eliminated. There is only one way you can do this. That is through a deliberate, slow, and tedious discussion among us. It is called debate. It is called discussion, dialog. 
I hope that the Senator from Kansas would not prevail with this. I think it would be a disastrous conclusion. 
Imagine risking some of the services that we talked about. How would we feel about reducing the program in FEMA, the Emergency Services Program, where everybody calls up, picks up the phone, dials the big 911, saying, `Help. Get out here. Hurry.' We wouldn't have the funds to do it because we were giving tax breaks to well-off people. That would really create a stir in this country. I will tell you, it would be louder than an applause line. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will support it because I think it is a terrific amendment. I commend the distinguished Senator from California for her leadership. Too many kids spend more of their waking hours without supervision, without constructive activity, and it is only in school that they are able to have some 
supervision that makes sense. As many as 5 million kids are home alone after school each week. The prospect of a child alone without proper supervision is sometimes too grim to even think about when we think about those who would molest them, those who would invade the privacy of the home, those kids who might get their hands on a weapon. We have seen what happens there. 
I want to see that this amendment carries. It puts things in proper focus. We talk here constantly about children and about how important they are in our lives and what it means to every one of us. Anybody who has been a parent, a grandparent, niece or nephew, aunt or uncle, knows about the relationships that children need and require in terms of their growth and development. 
So I support the amendment of the Senator from California. We want to make sure there are quality after-school programs. The kids who do have good programs can do better in their schoolwork, get along better with their peers. I think it is a great amendment, and I want to see it pass even modestly if it passes. It doesn't have to be overwhelming.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Kennedy amendment, which expresses the sense of the Senate that we should pass legislation establishing a patients' bill of rights. 
Mr. President, legislation to reform the way health plans often treat patients is long overdue. The integrity of the doctor-patient relationship is being whittled away, and that must be stopped. For example, many health plans have gagged their doctors, preventing them from presenting their patients with all possible treatment options. That's wrong. 
Mr. President, Democrats have introduced a bill that would remedy many of the problems that consumers are facing in their managed care health plans. Our bill would put an end to drive-through mastectomies. It would ensure that individuals with disabilities and others with special needs have direct access to specialists. And it would ensure that children have access to pediatric centers of excellence. 
Mr. President, the American people are demanding that we enact a managed care reform bill this year. And that's exactly what Senator Kennedy's amendment promises we will do. I commend the Senator for offering his amendment, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote for it.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I encourage all to listen carefully to what is proposed in this UC. The mission is to respond to the entreaties by Senators on both sides, `When are we going to complete our work? We have plans to make, we have our appointments to keep.' 
You cannot have it six ways. What we have done here is we have tried to be as considerate as possible. The Senator from New Mexico has clearly stated the case. I have a further request that would apply to both sides, and that is, where the subjects are in common in two or more amendments, if those parties would consent to try to consolidate, we can further eliminate any time for discussion. Even though it is only 1 minute on each side, we are looking at a considerable amount of time. I plead with our colleagues--10 minutes on their clock has to be the same as 10 minutes on our clock; they can't be a different 10 minutes. 
So if we are going to keep the voting limited, I urge the chairman of the Budget Committee to exercise all of the `meanness' that he can, be a bad guy and criticize and punish and all that. This is serious, and if people don't want to be looking at this clock at midnight, then they are going to have to adhere to the rules as we have them. I think I heard the Chair declare that the unanimous consent is in place. I would like to get on with the business at hand and do what we can to expedite the program and the time.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment presents a modified version of the budget that President Clinton submitted to the Congress last month. The amendment delineates all of the important priorities in the President's budget. 
First, it maintains strict fiscal discipline and adopts the President's commitment to save Social Security first. The amendment reserves all surpluses--I want to emphasize all surpluses--until we solve Social Security's long-term problems. This will help ensure that when the baby boomers retire, Social Security will be there for them, just like it has been there for their parents and grandparents. Second, this amendment, like the President's budget, makes education a top national priority. 
It calls for an initiative to reduce class sizes by hiring 100,000 new teachers; it promotes higher standards and greater accountability; it provides more after-school opportunities for young people; and it would help modernize and rehabilitate many of our schools. 
These initiatives are not included in the budget before us. That is one of its greatest shortcomings. 
Third, this amendment, like the President's budget, includes a historic commitment to helping families afford quality child care. It would double the number of children receiving child care subsidies by the year 2003. It would provide tax relief to working families who struggle to afford child care, whose biggest concern is that their kids are in good, safe, secure hands and it doesn't matter what your income is or what your assets are. Everybody wants that. It includes many other measures to improve the quality of child care. Again, the Republican budget in front of us fails to include a meaningful child care initiative and would do little for working parents and their kids. 
Fourth, this amendment, like the President's budget, would expand Medicare to provide health care to many older Americans who now lack private insurance. It would assist those people to help them pay for their fair share so that there are no additional burdens on the taxpayers at large. The Republican budget rejects this proposal. 
Fifth, this amendment, like the President's budget, includes a major investment in research, especially medical research at the National Institutes of Health, with all of the lifesaving possibilities it promises. The Republican budget claims to provide funding for NIH, but it provides no new money to do so. It merely assumes that the Appropriations Committee will cut other programs--cut education, cut environmental protection--to find the money to provide NIH with more resources. That is not likely to happen. 
Sixth, this amendment includes a significant investment in our transportation infrastructure in accordance with the agreement reached on ISTEA funding. That includes not only funding for highways but transit and safety matters as well. 
Seventh, this amendment, like the President's budget, reflects a commitment to environmental protection. It calls for reinstatement of the Superfund taxes on polluters and to use those funds for a variety of environmental objectives. The Republican budget, by contrast, uses most revenues from the Superfund tax for purposes that have nothing to do with environmental protection. 
Mr. President, this amendment accommodates a wide range of Democratic priorities that have been shortchanged in the Republican budget--education, child care, health care, environment. We accommodate all of these priorities using real numbers scored by the Congressional Budget Office. This alternative budget fully complies with the discretionary spending caps in the balanced budget amendment, and it doesn't spend a penny of any surplus to meet the goals that we have had to modestly scale back some of the spending included in the President's original proposal. 
We have adjusted the levels of both nondefense and defense discretionary spending to be consistent with the spending caps, and we have held about $15 billion in the President's funds for America's initiative in reserve. Those reserves will become available upon the enactment of tobacco legislation, if that legislation produces more revenues than proposed by the President. 
I note that all of these priorities could be funded if we enact the proposal that Senator Conrad and I have been advocating; that is, to promptly increase the cigarette taxes to $1.50 a pack. Mr. President, to avoid any confusion on this point, let me explain. We are assuming that many of the President's discretionary initiatives will be funded in authorizing legislation, which largely means tobacco legislation. We think that is the most likely way that many of these priorities will be funded. If so, they would all be scored by the Congressional Budget Office under the pay-as-you-go system separate from the 
discretionary spending caps. Of course, as the administration has proposed, this could also be accomplished with the rules change included in appropriations legislation. 
The point is that, in any case, the President's priorities can be accommodated here within the current rules or with the rules change for tobacco legislation. 
I want to be up front about this. I don't expect a Democratic substitute to be approved by this Senate. I am not asking for an extended debate about this proposal. We aren't looking for a partisan fight. We simply wanted to put this forward to reassert our support for the President's budget and to counter those who might try to argue that the President's priorities cannot be accommodated using the Congressional Budget Office scoring. We have shown that they can be. If the Senate wants to reject the President's proposals to expand Medicare, child care, reduce class size, that is their right. We can disagree. We can disagree on these in good faith. But we shouldn't just blame it on the Congressional Budget Office. It will be our choice and an expression of our priorities. 
Speaking for most Democrats, we think that this budget represents the values and priorities that we care about and that this country ought to care about. It reflects our commitment to fiscal discipline. It saves Social Security first. It would improve the lives of millions of American families. 
Mr. President, I yield the time so that the Democratic leader can use as much of that time as remains. How much time remains?

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I don't want to take any more time than that, because we have an understanding about the use of time, but I do want to say to my friend and colleague, the chairman of the Budget Committee, who is so articulate and who is so knowledgeable about the budget, the only thing is he happens to be wrong. Other than that, we are in very good agreement. 
What do I think the chairman is wrong about? Priorities. I think that when he lays out those things that are taken care of, we say, `No, they are not taken care of,' and we will do all we propose, all the President has offered by staying within the budget caps, and we are going to use the pay-as-you-go mantra; that is, nothing happens until it is paid for. That is the way we see it. 
When I see the narrowness, the demand that the only way that we spend any of our surplus is on Medicare--and I submit, and I proposed this the other day--ask any grandparent, because by the time you get to Social Security, you are pretty much a grandparent, if they would rather worry today about shoring up Medicare or keeping their child or their grandchild from starting smoking. 
I can tell you what the answer is going to be. They would say, `Listen, we have lived a pretty good life, and we are worried about Medicare; we want you to help solve the problem, but if you are saying take a choice between keeping my youngster from getting hooked on tobacco, which will begin his or her final innings at sometime in life when it is very inopportune, take care of those kids.' 
That is what we are asking for. If the revenues come from tobacco, we want those funds to be used for smoking cessation programs. 
I think it is a fairly simple choice, and that is, do we want to say to the American public that we are going to try to deal with all of the problems that we have, but we are only going to do it if we have the money to spend and, if not, then we are going to have to forego that as well? 
We committed to a balanced budget. I worked not only amicably but I think efficiently with my friend from New Mexico in getting a balanced budget into place. We were commended by people across this country, including leaders of both our parties. 
I want it to continue that way, Mr. President, and I hope we will be able to have the votes that say, `OK, let's give the priorities that are for the people a chance to be put into effect.'  
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I rise to oppose the amendment of the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison. It would reject President Clinton's call to save Social Security first. 
Now, the Hutchison amendment calls for diverting part of any surplus for tax breaks. It therefore directly contravenes the President's plan to preserve Social Security benefits for baby boomers and other young Americans. For the first time in 30 years, Mr. President, we are probably going to have a budget surplus at the end of 1998--1998; that is, the current fiscal year. It ends September 30. 
The forecast for the coming decade is for continued surpluses--$1 trillion over the next decade. We have tightened our belts, we have restored fiscal responsibility, and these surpluses are largely the product of our joint hard work. 
What do we do with the surplus? On this question, the President has spoken clearly and unequivocally. I agree, before we spend a penny of any surplus, we should save Social Security first. A decade from now, the baby boom generation will begin to retire. Additionally, Americans probably, Lord willing, are going to be living longer and having fewer children. That means fewer workers will be contributing to Social Security for each beneficiary. These forces will put severe strains on the Social Security system. It could have a real impact on our economy. 
If we do not maintain fiscal discipline, plan ahead, we could reduce the quality of life for our children and thus jeopardize the most important safety net for protecting senior citizens against poverty. That is why the President has been so insistent that we save Social Security first. That is why the amendment by the Senator from Texas is, in my view, misguided. 
I heard the Senator talk about restraining ourselves, about returning money to the citizens as quickly as we can. The President shares that objective. What he says when he says save Social Security first, he talks about doing it through paying down the debt. If we look at where we are now, I have to say, the President's leadership in managing this economy is pretty good. This doesn't mean that our friends on the Republican side haven't worked together with us and the administration to do things. This isn't pointing a finger. It is recognizing where we are: The lowest inflation rate, perhaps, in 30 years, in terms of the consistency and the level of the rate; the lowest unemployment rate in decades; the best growth rate in the economy that we have seen in decades; perhaps the best economic condition that this country has ever seen--maybe any country has ever seen. 
We are on the right track, and we are paying down debt. We have gone from almost $300 billion when President Clinton took over, down to a prospective surplus in 1998, a period of 6 years. That is quite an accomplishment. 
Why is it, at a time like this, that we suddenly recognize, `My gosh, we have a huge deficit out there and we better get it paid down'? The President agrees, except he provides the leadership to do it. 
I urge my colleagues to resist the short-term temptations. Confirm the fact that we want to save Social Security. Confirm the fact that we want to pay down the debt. Let's continue to work together, not point fingers at who is at fault. If we are going to point fingers at who is at fault, we had better point fingers at those who helped us in the excellent job we have done together, and it was not all done by Alan Greenspan, as much respect as I have for him. I want to make sure Social Security will be there to protect younger Americans as it is here today for parents and grandparents. 
Mr. President, we have had all kinds of attacks on the present condition. Frankly, I scratch my head and say, What are my friends looking at? I see a stock market that is thriving--and I am not here to prognosticate the future of the stock market, but I heard a very distinguished economist, a personal friend of mine, on the air this morning. His name is David Jones. He is with a New York firm. He says that he thinks the economy is in pretty good shape in terms of the market. He doesn't see any reason to get overly concerned about sudden market dips. He doesn't predict that the market is going to continue straight up, but he predicts it is on a good, solid base. 
So the worry tree is sprouting buds here. I don't know whether it has to do with the political condition we will be facing when we get out there and talk to voters or exactly what it is. I want to be as frugal, as thrifty, as the next one, but I also want to make sure we maintain the service of our responsibilities to the people in our society, that those who don't have as much money as some at the top are still able to afford a college education for their child so that child can learn, to make sure there is sufficient housing for people, to make sure there are jobs for people who are moving from welfare to work. We had better have work for them. 
There are lots of worries and concerns, as I guess there always are with mankind, no matter what the conditions are. Recognize what we have, recognize where we have come, and at least admit we are doing the right kind of a job. 
So I don't want to do anything that will restrict the way we function with this economy of ours. That is why I don't want to succumb to the short-term temptation and take money out of programs to pay down the debt. We have a program laid out on just how we will do these things. 
I hope my colleagues will say no to the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Texas. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I rise in opposition to an amendment presented by Senator Kyl that would call for a constitutional amendment and require a supermajority to vote to increase Federal revenues. This amendment effectively would grant special protection for tax loopholes. In this body, we only require a supermajority vote for things that deserve special protection--Social Security, for example. It would be wrong to give breaks for corporations and the well-off and permit them to have the same protection as the Social Security trust funds, and it would be outrageous to give those loopholes constitutional protection. 
The Founding Fathers had it right the first time. A simple majority vote is all that should be required for this body to act. That is a democracy. 
I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote against it. It calls for a sense of the Senate looking for a constitutional amendment to be offered here. 
I am not going to take any more time. I hope that the Members will see that we are giving special protection to tax loopholes when certainly the status doesn't warrant it, but worse than that, we are talking about a constitutional amendment. Thank goodness it is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. It has about as much force as so many of the other sense-of-the Senate amendments that we have already had here. I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment represents a modified version of the budget that President Clinton submitted to the Congress last month. The amendment incorporates all of the important priorities in the President's budget, maintains strict fiscal discipline, and adopts the President's commitment to save Social Security first. The amendment reserves all surpluses until we solve Social Security's long-term problem. That will help ensure when the baby boomers retire, Social Security will be there for them. 
Secondly, like the President's budget, this makes education a top national priority, calling for an initiative to reduce class sizes by hiring 1,000 new teachers, promotes higher standards and greater accountability, and provides more after-school opportunities for young people. 
In short, what this does is remind us all what the commitment is that the President made and what we would like to see in place. I will just say that this presents the President's budget in a modified form. I hope our colleagues will support it.

Yet, I hear conversations constantly about how everybody is saluting the sanctity of Social Security--preserve it, make sure we shore it up, make sure that we take care of it for future generations. But here we open the gate to use this money that would otherwise be reserved for Social Security for tax cuts. I think that the American people, if asked the question, would say no, we want to pay down the debt, shore up Social Security, and let's not use this for tax cuts, the benefit of which goes principally to those people in the higher income level. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment in the interest of saving Social Security first.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment expresses the Sense of the Senate that Congress should fulfill the intent of the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 and appropriate sufficient funds in each of the next five years to enable Amtrak to implement its Strategic Business Plan. 
In the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997, Congress declared that `intercity rail passenger service is an essential component of a national intermodal passenger transportation system.' With the passage of this Act, Congress and the President effectively agreed to provide adequate appropriations over the next five years for Amtrak to implement its Strategic Business Plan so that it may achieve the goal of operating self-sufficiency. 
I would like to take a moment to thank Senator Lott for his cooperation on this amendment and for his commitment to providing the funding necessary for Amtrak to implement its Strategic Business Plan. 
I would also like to thank Senator McCain for his cooperation and assistance in working out the language of this amendment. 
Finally, I would like to thank Senators Roth, Biden and all of the cosponsors of this amendment for their continuing support of Amtrak. 
I believe that for the first time in memory, we have a general commitment among members of Congress to provide Amtrak with the funding necessary for it to turn its financial situation around. We will accomplish this by providing Amtrak with the capital funds necessary to modernize its equipment and facilities. For too long, Congress underfunded Amtrak, leaving it with an aging and inefficient capital stock. By providing sufficient capital funding, we will allow Amtrak to increase the efficiency of its operations and attract new passengers by providing better, more reliable service. 
Last year's $2.2 billion capital fund and the passage of the Amtrak Reform legislation brought the dawn of a new day for our national passenger railroad. 
We need Amtrak to reduce congestion on our highways and in our skies. Congress and the President have demonstrated clear support for Amtrak as a national system and for continued federal appropriations. Too often in the past, we under-funded this important system. Today, Amtrak is operating under substantial challenges to meet strict business goals. 
I believe Amtrak is up to the task and I hope and expect that we will provide them the funds we have promised and give Amtrak a fighting chance to succeed.

Mr. President, if I might add a word also, to say that working with our colleagues on the Republican side, particularly the chairman of the Budget Committee with whom I work closely and I consider a friend, we try to handle disagreements in a positive fashion. Sometimes it gets a little edgy, but rarely. 
I also want to say I thought, and I was discussing it with a couple of Senators here, that there was a degree of comity in this deliberation that is an improvement, I think, over what we have seen in past years. It is a much better way to work. I thank our leader for his support and also to say to the majority leader that his steady hand helped move things along. It has been an excellent experience. I wish we had won more than we did, but we go away knowing that we had a fair chance at the deliberation. That is what counts. 
I particularly want to say to Phil Gramm and to Senator Nickles, I thank them for their gesture--with the encouragement of the majority leader--in kind of righting what we took to be a wrong. I want to acknowledge it publicly. 
With that, I thank my friend from New Mexico and hope we will have lots of occasions to do these budget resolutions--with me in the majority seat. I hope we will be able to do this many times.

The traditional 15- or 20-minutes will be as it is and thereafter 10 minutes. But I ask all of our colleagues--because as I did a mental count here, we probably have 60 or 65 amendments sitting there--that we ought to not have anybody saying just give me a minute more. We made those decisions as of this moment and we are going to try to move the agenda along as expeditiously as we can. 
Last, everyone should understand that this is done at the request of Senators on both sides, lots of Senators who say let's get our business done, let's complete our agenda and let's be prepared to conclude the week, hopefully, by tomorrow evening. I do not mean to put words in the mouth of the Senator from New Mexico, but as I remember our discussion, that's where we want to be.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise in support of this amendment, which would establish a new point of order to protect the Social Security surplus. It's designed to enforce the principle that President Clinton emphasized in his State of the Union address: `save Social Security first.' 
The Social Security program is the most important social insurance program in the United States. It's dramatically reduced poverty among older Americans. And it provides a critical safety net for those who suffer from disabilities, or the death of a family member. 
Unfortunately, Social Security's long-term viability is now threatened by the impending retirement of the baby boom generation, and the significant new pressures that will place on the system. Congress needs to act promptly to address this problem. 
Congress already has made a clear commitment to Social Security, and we've created various procedural protections to enforce that commitment. For example, Section 301(i) of the Budget Act prohibits the Senate from considering a budget resolution that would reduce a Social Security surplus. And Section 311(a)(3) prohibits us from considering any measure that would decrease a Social Security surplus below the level set in the budget resolution. 
The point of order proposed today is consistent with these precedents. But rather than directly protecting Social Security, this point of order would protect the rules that protect Social Security. 
These budget rules, in effect, require 60 votes to reduce a Social Security surplus. The problem, though, is that there's a loophole. And the loophole is that these rules themselves can be amended under certain circumstances with only 50 votes. 
In general, legislation to amend budget laws is subject to a supermajority point of order, under Section 306 of the Budget Act. But this point of order doesn't apply to legislation that's been reported from the Budget Committee, or to any amendments to such legislation. 
So, for example, if the Budget Committee reports a minor bill to make technical corrections to the Budget Act, an amendment to gut the Social Security rules could be adopted by a simple majority vote. 
In my view, that's a loophole that we need to close. 
Let's not just proclaim our commitment to saving Social Security first. Let's put it in writing. And let's make it enforceable. 
I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support the amendment.

We are building--we may have a record year this year, I say to the chairman.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. So we just let it flow, go with the flow, as they say. None of us want to do anything to impose a penalty on marriage. The statistics are not as good as we would like to see in the first place, so we do not want to make it any more difficult. But when the schedule says `shall begin to phase out the marriage penalty this year,' I think that is somewhat precipitous. But hearing the Senator from Alabama confirm I think what we all know, all we can do is kind of make this abstract recommendation and hope that it gets picked up along the way. So with that, with that caution, I am ready to go to a vote. I hope, I say to the chairman, in the interest of time, that we might be able to move it along. 
Is Senator Faircloth still on his way?

<TEXT>
Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator Craig's amendment. This amendment would prohibit using revenues to offset new mandatory spending and, instead, require all new mandatory spending to be offset with other mandatory cuts. The amendment would prohibit using revenues to offset new mandatory spending. Alternatively, instead, it would require all new mandatory spending to be offset with mandatory cuts. 
The amendment would represent a significant departure from current pay-as-you-go rules. It would give special protection to special interest tax loopholes at the expense of programs like Social Security and Medicare. It would further undermine the prospects for comprehensive tobacco legislation. 
There is nothing new about using revenues to offset mandatory spending. The pay-as-you-go rule has been in place for many years and it has worked well. That rule says that new mandatory spending must be fully offset either by revenue increases or mandatory savings. In other words, new mandatory spending must be deficit neutral. 
Under Senator Craig's proposal, however, deficit neutrality is not enough. Under this amendment, legislation to provide a new mandatory benefit, like Medicare coverage for a new medical procedure, would have to be offset with other mandatory spending cuts. No new revenue could be used. 
If you think about that for a minute, it really doesn't make sense. If we are looking to pay for a new benefit, why would we say that cutting Social Security is fine, but closing a wasteful tax loophole is not? Why would we say that cutting Medicare is OK, but eliminating a corporate tax subsidy is not? Well, Mr. President, maybe some people think that the Tax Code is just fine the way it is and that it doesn't contain any loopholes or special breaks for the special interests. I happen not to be one of them. 
I don't think many Senators on either side of the aisle would make that claim. After all, we are now hearing calls to scrap the entire Tax Code even without a replacement. Can these same Senators now also be claiming that there is not one special tax break or loophole that deserves closing, even if the savings could be used to provide for new health benefits for people stricken with newly discovered deadly diseases? I hope that not many of my colleagues really believe that. In my view, we ought to be intensifying our efforts to eliminate wasteful tax loopholes. The last thing we should do is give any special protections to them at the expense of Social Security or Medicare. So it is a little out of balance. 
This amendment would compound the obstacles already created in this budget resolution for comprehensive tobacco legislation. Under this amendment, tobacco legislation could not use tobacco revenues to pay to finance antitobacco activities. It doesn't make sense, and it would undercut what could be the most important piece of legislation in this session of the 105th Congress. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. It would change a fundamental rule that has worked well for many years. It would give special protection to wasteful tax loopholes at the expense of programs like Social Security and Medicare and could seriously impair the ability to get us to a comprehensive tobacco program. 
The pending amendment is not germane. I, therefore, raise a point of order that the amendment violates section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. 
I don't see anyone else in opposition. I yield the time.

<TEXT>
Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Illinois. I do want to say something about this important piece of legislation. 
Mr. President, I stand to support the amendment presented by the distinguished Senator from Illinois. Senator Moseley-Braun's amendment is a critical issue in terms of how we deal with the educational requirements of our young people. 
The Senator from Illinois has had a long record--certainly since she has been here, and I understand before she arrived to the U.S. Senate--of interest and involvement in children, particularly focused on education in the early years. I am delighted to join with her and others here who are supporting an investment in bringing our school facilities up to date, making sure that the place in which children are expected to learn invites the process of learning and doesn't distract them, because it is either too cold, too hot, or too dangerous, or because of water leaking through the roof, or perhaps asbestos in the building, or insufficient facilities to attend to the children's needs. The condition is so outrageous that the GAO says that there are more than 14 million children attending schools that are in need of extensive repair or replacement. Several million attend schools with safety code violations, and, as I mentioned, leaky roofs are in schools that house 12 million students. 
The GAO found the problem of crumbling schools transcends demographic and geographic boundaries. Roughly one-third of urban rural and suburban schools report that at least one building is in need of extensive repair, or to be completely replaced. Furthermore, the GAO reports that most schools are not prepared to incorporate modern technology in the classroom. Forty-six percent of schools lack adequate electrical wiring to support the full-scale use of technology. More than a third of the schools lack the requisite electrical power. And 56 percent of schools have insufficient phone lines for modems. 
When we talk about percentages of 56 percent here and 12 percent there, it kind of escapes into an amorphous condition that prevents us from really analyzing what the effects of these inadequate facilities represent. It takes a real toll on students, on children. 
I came out of the computer business. I arrived here some years ago from the city of Paterson, NJ, where my company was founded and where I was born. We had a population, I would say, of somewhere around 150,000 people with a commensurate number of students. I have been back there many times. I have a fondness of that place of my birth. I know a lot of the people who live in the town. One of my schoolmates was a fellow named Larry Doby, who was just admitted to the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
I visit the city regularly. Until recently, I used to go to the same barbershop every couple of weeks since I was a college student. I return there and very often bring people around my old neighborhood to kind of give them a sense of what kind of beginning and opportunity I had. They were amazed at the dilapidated condition of the facility. I met children there and told them I lived in the building. They asked me what floor. I said, `The second floor.' The number of the building was 310 Hamilton Avenue. They asked me, `What floor?' I lived on the second floor. `Yes. What apartment?' I said, `In the back apartment.' They said, `You lived there?' `Yes. I lived there.' 
So it established a particular attachment. 
I was called on by the board of education at Paterson a year or two ago to see if I could get them some help so they could get the schools wired in preparation for connection into the Internet. They couldn't raise the money within the city. People wanted it; they couldn't afford to pay the taxes necessary. The city was in arrearages all over the place. I arranged for some people I knew in my old company to pay for the 
facility to be wired. We went down there, and we stood with the people from the telephone company and pulled wire. What a pitiful condition. Can you imagine that you have to depend on someone's goodness, or some company's willingness to step forward so a school can be affixed to the Internet so the kids can learn that there is something besides pens and pencils and pads that are going to be required in the lives that they expect and hope to lead one day? It is pretty discouraging if kids don't know what it is that the outside world holds for them. 
I once visited a school in Newark earlier in my days in the Senate. It caused me to write a piece of legislation called `computers in schools' to try to make sure that there was a computer available in classrooms with a reasonable population-to-computer ratio so that the children there would have a chance to learn the applications. 
One of the things that we saw in a visit to a school in a very poor neighborhood with high crime in a broken-down neighborhood was that one child I was introduced to was sitting at a computer terminal. They told me that he was in about the third or fourth grade. They told me that this child had such a bad deportment record that they were looking for a way perhaps to expel him from the school. Then they brought in a couple of computers. This child couldn't keep up academically. His behavior, as I say, was bad. They sat him in front of a computer. They taught him a couple of basic exercises that children learn. He was so proficient in such a short time that he began to outdistance the other children. 
I tell you this story only because to me it established the fact that children have to be given a chance to learn and develop based on their own ability, based on their own capacity to learn, and not be restricted to staying with a class where perhaps there is some maladjustment to it. 
So I fully support this amendment. 
Broken-down schools have a negative effect on the ability of students to learn. They see this grim surrounding, and they begin to believe that is the way the world around them exists and will exist for them. Academic research has proven that there is a direct correlation between the condition of school facilities and student achievement. 
Georgetown researchers found that test scores of students assigned to schools in poor condition can be expected to fall 11 percentage points below the test scores of students in buildings in adequate condition. Unfortunately, many local educational agencies have difficulty securing financing for school facility improvements. The proposal called for in this amendment would really help. The zero interest school modernization bond and the Federal income tax credits to purchase those bonds in lieu of interest payments would be an important step toward rebuilding and modernizing our Nation's schools. 
Mr. President, I say to those who criticize test scores, who intimate that our children are inadequate to the task that they are assigned to, I ask those people to look to where the problem is. It is not simply looking at students' surroundings. We should provide facilities through our Government. Why is it that we encourage this feeling of being forlorn, or outside of the mainstream? It is because the condition of the facility says that these children are not worth the effort that it takes to have them in a better learning condition. 
Mr. President, if we want our kids to learn, if we want our children to be competitive in the years ahead, if we expect them to be leaders in the true sense of the word, where we are not just making speeches but we want to do something about it, then this is an excellent opportunity to register our support. 
Again, my commendation goes to the distinguished Senator from Illinois for her leadership on this issue.

My father kept 100 percent of his wages. They were so meager he couldn't pay taxes on them. But he had an opportunity to work whenever he could, and he held his head high and he loved America every day that he lived here, and that is what we are talking about. We can beat ourselves to death about how terrible conditions are here when people are living longer, living better, and enjoying life better than ever before in the history of mankind--including in America. I am proud of this country and, as I said earlier: America, America the beautiful. 
I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Conrad.

I think it is fiscally dangerous and irresponsible, and I hope we will marshal a vote against this amendment.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, a few moments ago I had an opportunity to discuss with the chairman of the Budget Committee how we might proceed, because one of the things we are running into is that, although we had agreed to have a half-hour limit on amendments equally divided, as a result of courtesy, we have extended time on the resolution. It, thusly, then challenges whether or not we are ever going to get done here, because we have almost 30 amendments. If we take 30 amendments, you have 2 hours each, 7 or 8 hours of votes to accompany that, that is another, who knows, 7, 8, 10 hours. 
So what we are going to do, unless there is a difference in the conversation as I remember it from what the distinguished Senator from New Mexico agreed, we are going to permit approximate time on this side equal to the two speakers that we just had. Then we are going to eliminate further time off the bill itself for amendments. 
With that, I yield some time to the Senator from North Dakota, as he sees fit.

<TEXT>
Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thirty. So I will yield myself some time off of the amendment, which I understand is the time that remains to respond to the proposal by the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, the Senator from Delaware, whose proposals we always take seriously. This is a man who is intelligent, who is committed to the proper procedure of getting things done. We have great respect and regard for the Senator from Delaware. But we can nevertheless disagree. 
On this particular proposal, I do disagree because I see things in perhaps a different light. When I think of the prospect--and I thank the Senator from New York because, as usual, he has a grasp of issues that goes way beyond the capacity of the average human being. And, boy, do we learn, and we learn in a hurry here. But nevertheless, I listened carefully to what the Senator from New York said. He talked about the possibilities of some investment on the private side, and I respect that, when combined with other changes that have to be made. I think otherwise we are rushing almost willy-nilly into a change, if this proves to be law at some time, that would rock the timbers of our society. 
When we think of Social Security, we think of the foundation that it holds for senior citizens. I kind of ask myself, well, would we recommend to the elderly across this country that they go ahead with some investment adviser, or make a decision on their own, whether it is to buy fund X, A, B, or C? We saw what happened to this investment club that was doing so well, according to the papers, and finally they admitted they made a few accounting mistakes. Would anyone want to have to face that widow who perhaps gets $700, $800 a month and say, `Sorry, there's an error; you don't have $800 a month, you have $400 a month or $500 a month'? Or would you rather say, `Listen, what you have is guaranteed. It may not have provided the kinds of things that your husband and you had when you were living together, but you will not be chased out of your room or your house. You will have a chance to continue to live at some scale, modest as it may be.' 
But when I look at companies like the Prudential Insurance Company, one of the great companies of the world, one of, if not the largest company in the world--it was among the top five--it had some inappropriate management problems there. And they are good friends of mine, so I do not knock the company. But they, nevertheless, had to reduce the interest they were paying on policies, on cash reserves on their policies. This giant company, the Rock, the Rock of Gibraltar was their trademark, and they had to reduce their interest rates. 
In October, a few years ago, 1987, the market lost a substantial portion of the holdings. I was at a meeting in Boston and people up there were shaken to their foundation to see their investments, their growth in investments, suddenly whittled away by some 15-plus percent. While I am excited about the market and where it is going, just like everybody else, I know one thing: That going down is always faster than going up when there is any velocity attached to it. 
I think that without full deliberation about what the 
consequences might be, pro and con, with this kind of investment, it is excessively hasty. I would not want to be talking to people who suddenly decided they wished they had had Social Security IOUs, as they were described here. I do not know about you, but I know that I still feel pretty good about an IOU owed by the U.S. Government, by the people of America. Those are, as they say in the movies, as good as it gets, not high-paying but everybody pretty much feels that, listen, the worst that happens, we are going to get paid. We may even have it monetized a little bit with inflation, but the fact is we know it is there. 
So when I look at the proposition that is offered, I say that I hope my colleagues will vote against it. When you cast your vote, you must look or try to look in the eyes of an elderly parent or grandparent, or perhaps, at some of our ages, a brother or sister, who are totally dependent on Social Security for their survival--for their survival. 
I tell you, I would not recommend on a personal basis--and I have had a lot of experience. I ran a big company. And I managed, as part of my responsibilities, the company's investments. I managed acquisition. I had a lot to do with the financial side of things. I could hardly imagine myself recommending to someone whose principal asset, exclusive asset in some cases, was Social Security, that they invest in the market a little bit, buy a hedge fund maybe or, gee, your adviser--I remember when one of the great unions, I say to Senator Moynihan, sued a bank in New York, who I will not identify here, for the poor performance that this bank had with hundreds of millions of dollars that belonged to this union's pension funds because it underperformed. 
Who, with an investment of a couple thousand dollars a year or a thousand dollars a year or less, is going to be able to pick just the right adviser? There is some genius sitting there waiting to take your $1,000 a year and monitor it and watch it? Come on, what do we think this is? The guys who get that kind of attention are the guys who hit the new scales on the heights--$500 million in net worth, $1 billion in net worth, the people who are outside. 
I know of one university fund, common among investments, being made today by university endowments, who wants to get into investments that they can be out of in 5 years. They do not want to be stuck in investments that carry them indefinitely. And you will find that true in place after place. 
I say also that everyone is aware today that capital is not a problem in this country. Capital is chasing investment all over. I know people in the real estate business. I know people in the investment business and merchant banks. And people are coming to them--institutions, universities, companies, individuals--with money saying, `Please help me invest it properly. Please help me place it securely. Please help me make sure that it's safe.' 
So how is a person who has a modest Social Security income going to have the security to know that they have the right person advising them or whether they know how to read a financial statement? It is an interesting idea, but an idea, in my view, whose time has not come. I hope that we will stand securely against it, give it a chance, led by the leadership that the chairman of the Finance Committee can so aptly provide, and have a full review of what it means. 
We have discussed it. We have discussed it in the Budget 
Committee, and we have discussed it with other committees, with Alan Greenspan and with other distinguished economists: What does it mean? What about privatization? Some say yes, some say no. I tell you this, I would far rather be one who said no, just leave it where it is, than take the risk that we have to face someone who is depending on Social Security and not finding the reserve there when they need it. 
So I hope this amendment does not pass. I urge my colleagues to vote against it. No disrespect to the chairman of the Finance Committee or those who are supporting it, but it just needs more time than we have. 
Mr. President, as I stated, I must oppose the proposal to allocate the surplus for personal savings accounts. In my view, this proposal has serious ramifications for the future of Social Security. And we shouldn't endorse it without first carefully examining all of its implications. 
Mr. President, let me just discuss a few of the concerns raised by this amendment. 
First, this proposal represents a major step toward privatizing Social Security. And privatization, in my view, is directly inconsistent with the fundamental purpose of the program. 
Social Security is supposed to guarantee that all American seniors can avoid poverty and live their lives with a basic level of dignity. It is a social insurance program. It is not supposed to be the only source of retirement income for most seniors. 
Moving to a system of private accounts represents a dramatic shift in risks. Away from government. And onto the backs of individual senior citizens. 
Under a privatized system, seniors would lose: protection against declines in stock prices; protection against inflation through cost of living adjustments; and protection against outliving their assets. 
Mr. President, protections against these kinds of risks--which are completely beyond the control of any individual--are why we need social insurance in the first place. 
Let me be clear. I'm all for private retirement savings. I support IRAs and 401(k)s, and believe Americans need to save more. But private savings should supplement, not replace, social insurance. Otherwise, most Americans will spend their old age walking a financial high wire, without a safety net. And as someone who lived through the Great Depression, that is not what I want for my children and grandchildren. 
If we use a surplus to roll back payroll taxes and force people to put this money into private accounts, money would be drained from the Social Security trust funds. That would accelerate the date when the program will go bankrupt. And that is the opposite of what we should be doing. 
There are many other points I could make about this proposal, but I will not get into great detail here. Let me just say again that this is not the kind of change that we should endorse without a great deal of careful and thoughtful debate. That discussion is only now just getting underway. And it would be premature to rush to judgment on such a fundamental change in our system. 
So I hope my colleagues will oppose this proposal. Let us fix Social Security. But let us do it carefully. And let us do it right. 
I ask unanimous consent to have printed some editorials in the Record. The Senator from New York has asked us to do that, and I put them forward.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes. Mr. President, I sat and listened here with wonderment. We are about ready to say, `Let's get rid of this other thing because that will make us behave like responsible citizens. That's the only way we can do it.' We heard the same speeches, with all due respect, about whether or not we needed a balanced budget amendment because we cannot discipline ourselves, and, thank the Lord, that failed. And we did not alter the Constitution, and we did not get into the ridiculous kind of arguments that we would have. We just went out and did it. 
To my friends on the other side I would say, have faith, have faith in your own ability that you can make a difference. You have a majority. Let us change it. But if you want to burn down the house so we can be forced to move and find another location, I think that is a pretty poor way of conducting business. I see what the distinguished Senator from New Mexico has proposed as an alternative, something that promotes economic growth, something that is a low tax rate. 
This amendment would delete the provision in the resolution calling for scrapping the tax code without an alternative. Instead, the amendment calls for the continued tax deductibility of home mortgage interest and charitable contributions. 
I share the frustration of most Americans about the Internal Revenue Service, and believe strongly that we must pass IRS reform legislation as soon as possible. The House approved similar legislation last year. It's long past time for the Senate to act. 
At the same time, I have serious concerns about the proposal to scrap the tax code without an alternative. I think, with all due respect, that it is a reckless political gimmick that would backfire on this Congress. 
The main problem with this proposal is that it would create enormous uncertainty about the continued availability of many important tax code provisions. And that could create economic chaos and other problems for millions of Americans. 
The Finance Committee needs to consider these problems before we scrap the whole tax code. For example, what will this do to the value of homes? How will uncertainty affect contributions to charities, or savings plans for retirement and education purposes? How will employers react to health and retirement plans; will they refuse to set up new plans? Will they reduce contributions to existing plans? 
What will be the overall effect of uncertainty on economic growth and job creation? These are important questions that need to be publicly examined. 
The Finance Committee ought to consider these types of questions before we approve sunsetting legislation. But I do think it is important that, in the meantime, we reaffirm our support for the mortgage interest deduction and the deduction for charitable contributions.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I watched with interest the development of this amendment and the others that we heard over the last couple days. It seems like there is a testimonial here to Alan Greenspan. He is a very smart guy, and I will tell you how I know how smart he is. He used to be on the board of my company, and when I left to come to the Senate, he was still on the board of my company. He didn't leave there until he was chosen to be chairman of the Fed. At that point, he could not stay and continue enjoying the private side of things. It was very nice. 
He is a very bright guy. At our board meetings, everybody used to listen so attentively to what Alan said. Fortunately, in this country of ours, there are lots of smart people. It doesn't mean that he is wrong, but it means that others can have a differing view. I think that this amendment--and I am not putting myself in his league, I must tell you; but we talked to economists, too, and we see a problem with this. 
This amendment would establish a point of order against any budget resolution in which revenues do not exceed outlays for any given year. We are considering a budget resolution today. There would be a point of order against any budget resolution in which revenues do not exceed outlays for any given year. Well, this amendment would lock us into a rigid formula for fiscal policy, threaten to make future recessions more severe, jeopardize our national security--I don't use these words casually--and deprive the Nation of needed investments in our future well-being. 
We all know that reducing the Federal debt is an important goal of fiscal policy. I don't think it is unknown that our President, President Clinton, is a very strong advocate of doing that. He proposed using any surpluses to pay down debt and, yes, to shore up Social Security, which it does at the same time--pay down that. That is what the President said, `I am not going to let you tinker with that. If I have anything to do about it, I don't want you to use that money for anything but paying down the debt.' So we have a common goal here, but it should not be pursued to the exclusion of all other worthy goals. 
If this amendment were to pass, it would make future recessions deeper by eliminating the budget's ability to stabilize the economy automatically. We use it that way--perhaps to the surprise of some--and when an economic downturn hits, tax revenues go down automatically and spending for unemployment benefits increases automatically. That is the way, frankly, I think it should be. The budget's automatic response helps to offset some of the economic pain and to shorten the recession's duration. 
Handcuffing our fiscal policy in times of economic crisis, as this amendment would do, risks turning recessions into depressions. As one who lived through the Great Depression myself, I know very well what that would mean to our Nation. I know what it did to help my family, the only time--other than the GI bill--that we had to reach out. My father was humiliated when his job was finally lost in the Depression and he had to go to work for the WPA, a Government program. It was embarrassing to him, but that was the only way he could see to 
try to support his family. That is the way it happens in times of stress like that. 
So when I look at what is being proposed here, I say thank goodness we have the capacity in times of need to make changes. For instance, the Allard amendment doesn't just pose a threat to our economic security; it also jeopardizes our national security. The cold war may be over, but that doesn't mean we won't face serious new military threats in the future. What would happen if America confronted an enemy that was building up its military in preparation for conflict? We would not be able to arm ourselves to meet the challenge because of this fiscal straitjacket. 
I know that the Senator from Colorado wants to do the right thing and, again, we share a goal, but the approach is radically different. The Allard amendment does include an exception in matters of Defense, when a declaration of war is in effect. There is very significant meaning to those few words. We faced a variety of major military challenges since war was last officially declared, and the year was 1941. This amendment, in those several times, would have tied our hands behind our backs. I also say to Senators who care about public investment that this amendment could prevent us from providing prudently for our future. 
Here is an example: If Congress were to decide that it's important to make significant new investments in our telecommunications infrastructure or our transportation infrastructure and we wanted to amortize the cost over several years, even though we don't have amortization formally in our financial statement, the Allard amendment would create a new roadblock. I want to say especially to our friends on the other side of the aisle who believe that tax cuts underwrite our future prosperity, this amendment would also make it more difficult to enact tax cuts. 
My point is not at all to advocate huge, new tax breaks. But I want to highlight the fact that this amendment will tie everybody's hands behind our backs and limit flexibility for Senators on all sides of the ideological spectrum. We have eliminated the deficit, restored fiscal discipline, and helped create the strongest economy in decades--maybe retroactively we are going to say it has been the strongest decade ever. We have done it all without procedural gimmicks that limited our flexibility. We did it the old-fashioned way, with hard work and hard choices. That is the way I think we ought to do it now and in the future. There is just no need for this kind of rigid rule. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I think it would be a huge mistake. It could wreak havoc on our economy, could weaken our national security to a dangerous point. It could impede our ability to make needed investments either directly or through the Tax Code. 
Mr. President, at the appropriate time, I intend to raise a point of order against this amendment. It is not germane. If the proponents of the amendment move to waive my point of order, I hope my colleagues will vote no on the motion to waive. 
With that, I yield the floor.  
Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2195. 
Mr. President, I want to point out that we have the following cosponsors on our amendment. They include Senators Daschle, Kerry, Baucus, Bingaman, Boxer, Graham, Moynihan, Leahy, Reid, Wyden, Lieberman, and Murray. 
Mr. President, this amendment would establish a reserve fund that would allocate funding from a reinstated Superfund tax on polluters for several important environmental initiatives. 
Mr. President, President Clinton has made environmental protection a top priority. And the American people agree with that. Americans feel strongly about the need to keep our water and air clean, and our national parks well maintained. And, in my view, they're right. 
The President has urged that several related environmental initiatives be funded by reinstating the Superfund tax on polluters. But the resolution before us largely rejects this approach. It does allow for spending up to $200 million next year from this tax, if it is reinstated, and if the reinstatement is part of broader Superfund reauthorization legislation. 
However, the Superfund tax raises $1.7 billion per year. And the Resolution would allow the extra $1.5 billion per year to be used for purposes that have nothing to do with environmental protection. 
By contrast, my amendment would use these environmental taxes for environmental objectives. 
My proposal largely incorporates the President's Environmental Resources Fund for America, as proposed in his budget. 
Under the proposal, revenue from a reinstated Superfund tax could be used for a variety of environmental priorities. These include, but are not limited to the following: cleanup of hazardous waste sites; clean water initiatives to assist states in protecting waterways from polluted runoff; construction and maintenance for our deteriorating national parks, forests, refuges, public lands and tribal schools; and purchases of valuable natural resources through the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
The funding for hazardous waste cleanup would increase the Superfund budget by 40%. This would double the pace of cleanups, bringing the total number of cleanups to 900 by the end of 2001. 
Let me be clear, also, that this amendment does not raid the Superfund program to pay for other initiatives. Under the amendment, we would still appropriate more money for hazardous waste cleanup than is collected from the Superfund tax, as has been our practice in the past. 
Mr. President, let me take a moment to highlight the Clean Water and Watershed Restoration Initiative. Today, the major source of pollution of our rivers, lakes and other sources of drinking water is not industry, and it's not municipal sewage treatment plants. It's polluted runoff from our cities and farms. 
This program would provide funds--not to increase the federal bureaucracy--but to aid states and localities in their efforts to address this problem. 
Mr. President, I want to emphasize that this amendment would not increase the deficit or reduce a surplus by one penny. It's entirely deficit neutral. 
I would also note that the amendment is broad enough to allow the appropriate committees to make the specific decisions about where this additional $1.5 billion per year would be spent. The amendment does not limit the committees to the particular proposals in the President's budget. Rather, it allows them flexibility to shape programs based on their needs and priorities when the Superfund tax is passed. 
I would note that the amendment is supported by the League of Conservation Voters, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the American Planning Association. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, the American people want us to protect the environment and to protect our investments in our national parks, refuges and forests. This amendment could go a long way toward meeting these goals in a deficit-neutral manner. I hope my colleagues will support it. 
We have a letter from the Council on Environmental Quality responding to our request for administration views on the proposed amendment.  
Please be assured that the Administration strongly supports your efforts to secure adequate funding for pressing environmental challenges facing this country. 
I submit that and the letter from the League of Conservation Voters, as well as a letter signed by 44 environmental groups.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, there is no additional spending that is provided for by virtue of the Superfund tax. These are not entitlements. We are talking now about direct appropriations. If the funds aren't there obviously out of this fund, out of this reserve fund, if money doesn't come in, it can't be spent. There were programs developed by the Environment and Public Works Committee. I assume the Senator is aware that we have finished a Superfund reauthorization bill out of the committee. I didn't support it. But it is due to come 
to the floor sometime after our recess. The committee has mandatory spending authority for minimum allocation for ISTEA, the orphans' share funding for Superfund, and funding for landowner incentives under the proposed Endangered Species Act. Under current law the committee has mandatory spending authority for the Wallop-Breaux Sports Fishery Act and other legislation. 
So this isn't a casual proposal. It is going to be paid for by taxes that accrue to the Superfund reserve fund. It will be used for environmental purposes. That is what we are talking about. It is fairly simple. We offer the amendment, and we are ready to have it processed and hope that our colleagues will vote for it.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have heard about the amendment that the Senator from Georgia proposes with Senator McCain, and I want to describe why I am opposing this amendment. While it sounds good on the surface, I think there are a few things we have to talk about and highlight what kind of problems might ensue. 
This amendment would cut domestic programs like education, child care, law enforcement, veterans' programs, and environmental protection. It would violate current budget rules. Frankly, I view it as fiscally irresponsible. 
This amendment calls for $101 billion in cuts from discretionary programs for use in providing various tax breaks. I note that it is not allowed under the Budget Act. And there is good reason that the Budget Act protects against that. The Budget Act is designed to ensure that if we incur permanent obligations, like permanent tax cuts or new mandatory spending, that we pay for these obligations with permanent savings. That is what the pay-as-you-go system is all about, and it has worked well for many years. People understand very clearly that if you spend it, you have to find a way to get the money. 
This amendment flies in the face of these rules, and it threatens to undermine long-term fiscal discipline. The amendment says that we should make cuts in temporary spending--that is, annually appropriated discretionary programs--and use temporary cuts to fund permanent tax breaks. That is a mix and match that does not work. 
Mr. President, it does not take a CPA to figure out that this can create serious problems in the long term. I am not opposed to tax cuts for ordinary working Americans, but I do think we should pay for them with permanent savings. I do not think we ought to introduce gimmickry that says we are going to have permanent cuts and temporary savings. 
In addition, I am concerned about what it would mean to cut $101 billion from programs which support education, fight crime, support our veterans, and protect our environment. Many of these programs are critical to the well-being of our country and to millions of ordinary Americans. 
The question is raised, Is there waste in Government? Yes, of course, but this amendment does not target waste, it adopts the meat-ax approach to Government, and that is not what the American people want. In the most successful corporations, in the largest corporations, there is waste, but how you get rid of it is to focus on what caused it in the first place and work deliberately toward ending it. 
You do not simply say, `OK, we're going to cut our expenses across the board.' That goes through good departments; that goes through bad departments; that goes through good management, as well as bad management. That is not the way problems are solved. 
I think most Senators from both parties will agree that the era of big Government is over. Government has been shrinking, and it will continue to shrink. As a matter of fact, the executive branch employment is the lowest as a proportion of total civilian employment since the 1930s. 
Federal outlays as a percent of GDP stand at their lowest level since the Nixon administration. Nondefense discretionary spending is at its lowest percentage of GDP since the early 1960s. 
I think it is important to note where America stands. Total Government spending as a share of GDP is the lowest for the United States than for all G-7 countries, the most advanced countries in the world--France, Italy, Germany, Canada, the U.K., and Japan. That tells us that not only is Government spending proportionately less but that Government is in fact smaller when it comes to employment and programs realistically. 
Under the budget agreement reached last year, nondefense discretionary spending in 2002 will reach its lowest level in almost 40 years as a share of GDP. But the McCain-Coverdell amendment would violate the budget agreement. It would lower the discretionary spending caps even further, making draconian cuts in the investments that Americans care about most. 
Under this amendment, funding for the National Institutes of Health would be cut by 7.9 percent; education would take a 7.6 percent cut; child care would be hit to the tune of 7.8 percent; the environment, 8.3 percent; transportation, a 7.1 percent cut; and veterans programs, a 7.6 percent cut. And it goes on--crime fighting programs would be reduced 7.6 percent. All to support $101 billion worth of tax breaks. 
The kind of cuts that would be required under this amendment could have a devastating effect on our children. It would dramatically reduce funding for education, child care. It would weaken enforcement of environmental laws and undercut our efforts to reduce crime and support our veterans. 
I listened to the debate carefully, and I heard descriptions of an America that I really do not recognize--an America where your freedoms are limited, where your opportunities are reduced, an America where it is harder to get by. 
I have to ask one question: Why is it that people will die to take the chance and the risk of death to get to our shores, to sneak in our borders, to float on tubes in the Caribbean, hide in the holds of airplanes, take a chance on drowning in the hold of a boat to get here, to get to this place described as a confiscatory structure that does not permit people opportunity? 
Mr. President, that bell does not ring true. It may be good politics, it may sound good on the radio when people hear it, but it is not the truth about our society. This is the greatest country on the face of this Earth, and it has been since its creation. And we have been smart. We have been working hard, but we have also been darn lucky, let me tell you. We have an abundance of whatever it is. We have an abundance of oil; we have an abundance of minerals; we have an abundance of space; we have an abundance of agricultural land. Boy, are we lucky--America the beautiful. That was not a coincidence; that is the truth. And people all around this world know it. 
That is why our stock market is constantly headed upward. Why? Because people say, if you have money, whether you are in countries A, B, C, D, all the way around the globe, `Boy, I want to put my money in America, because I know it is safe here.' We have seen country after country, the richest oil countries, they are packing their money and getting out of their own resource structure, because they know they may have oil in the ground but they do not have freedom on the streets; they do not have a secure societal structure. 
And we hear whispers about what Thomas Jefferson might have done. Look at this country. Look at our citizens. Life expectancy has never been better. I remember when I was a child, the man next door to us died. He was 53 years old. And I thought to myself, I said to my friend, `Oh, he was old.' 
Old? I see lots of guys over 50. I see guys in my decade running in marathons, jogging, healthy, supporting their families, enjoying life. Why are there conversations about, maybe Social Security ought to be raised? I am not endorsing it; I am simply mentioning it. Why? Because we know that people who are 65 are today almost prime-of-lifers. 
And, boy, I come from New Jersey, and I want to tell you, when I look at New Jersey's economic structure, we are called `the medicine chest of the country,' because we have these pharmaceuticals. I used to read the sports pages actively. Now I read about the new inventions or the new patents actively--what is going to save your hair, what is going to save your heart, what is going to save your lungs. That is the kind of society we are. 
What is this gloom, this despair, that hangs over us? `Well, they're taking away our rights. They're confiscating our property.' Life has never been better on the whole for the people in the world than in this country, America, these days. 
People get in an airplane today that is jammed. It is jammed with ordinary working people. No more of the formality. You do not have to wear a suit and a tie to get in an airplane, as was the custom years ago because it was restricted to an elite few. It is available for everybody. Air traffic today is almost mass transit, because we have made it available. 
People go on vacations to places that nobody even heard of when I was a child. It is available. Children are healthy. Look at them. Look at the young people who surround the President's table there, bright, 15 years old. They know what is going on in the world. They have learned. They love the opportunity to be here and to associate with these great Senators, I think. 
This is a country where we devote our energy to young people. We want our kids to have appropriate nutrition. We want them to have proper education. Do we succeed in every program? Heck, no. We do not. But we try. We try. And it is a subject of debate here. Right or wrong, it does not matter. It is a free society, as free as any place in the world. I know lots of places where if you talk about things we talk about here--criticism of the President, criticism of this institution, criticism of that institution--you go off with your hands in handcuffs. 
This is a great society. It does not need any apologies from anybody about whether or not taxes--yes, maybe taxes are a little onerous at times, but the question is, compared to what? We can talk about what tax rates used to be, the amount of income kept in years and decades gone by, `dreamsville,' but today you may pay a little bit more, but you have a lot more left because you are earning more. That is what this society is about. 
Entrepreneurships, opportunities, Mr. President. I have been really lucky in my lifetime. Best of all, my luck is four children and five grandchildren, with number six on the way. That is the best luck I have ever had. But in addition to that, I was able, with a couple of other guys who, like me, came from 
working-class parents--my father worked in the silk mills of Paterson. Paterson is an industrial city that has fallen by the wayside, one of America's poorest cities trying to fight back. A lot of dilapidation; a lot of problems; but a lot of spirit. 
Three of us started a business that started an industry that created more jobs than the computer hardware business. More people are employed in the software service side of the computer industry by far than those in the hardware business, than the IBMs or the RCAs or the Honeywells or the companies that used to be in the computer business. Today, there are more people employed in the service companies like ADP--the company I helped found--by far than companies that made hardware. 
I am considered a pioneer. I am in something called the Hall of Fame for Information Processing, a little place in Texas, that has some plaques in there because we were innovators. The company I started--without a dime literally; the three of us came from poverty, not middle-class; poverty--our company today employs 30,000 people across the world and has one of the best records of growth in its stock of any company in America. If you invested $300 in ADP in 1961, it is worth $1.4 million today. 
What does it mean? It means that entrepreneurship is alive and well in this country of ours. Look at Intel, look at Microsoft, look at America Online. Look at these companies. You will see success after success after success. There is no shortage of opportunity in America, none at all. The shortage may be in the mentality that fails to see the goodness that we have in this country of ours. 
Talk of the gloom and the confiscation of property and taxes and how debilitating it is to pay your way--my gosh, if people want to join a club, they look at the dues and they say, `Well, is it worth it or not? What's it worth to belong to the country club called America?' It is worth everything. People are willing again to fight and to die for the opportunity to be here. Look at how many illegals we have in this country now. Under all kinds of threats--you get shot at the border, you get stopped, you get jailed--they still pour over because they want to be in America. That is where the opportunity is. That is where the freedom is at its fullest. 
When I hear talk about how we are losing opportunity, we are losing the chance to succeed, it is summarized in one word that means a lot in America. It is called `baloney'--and I'm not talking about meat. There is plenty of opportunity here. And we have problems. One of the problems is our violence rate--10,000 people, roughly, murdered by handguns, people afraid to walk down the street. One of the people on my staff, 2 days ago, was walking home, living just about on Capitol Hill, a gun was put in her face, took her handbag. Thank the Lord that is all that happened. 
Those are the problems that we have. Those are problems we ought to work on. I don't understand why we want to take money away from safety and fighting crime and put it into tax breaks for people who don't need it, especially those at the top. Look at the top incomes in this country. It boggles the mind. I never knew that people could amass the kind of fortunes that we have seen. 
We have our weaknesses, but, boy, have we got our strengths. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. Don't play with the system this way--shoot-from-the-hip tax breaks that are permanent, cuts in other programs where the revenue flow is just temporary. This adopts a meat-ax approach to domestic needs while making sure that these tax breaks are there. It violates the Budget Act. We note that. I hope our colleagues will reject this amendment and in that rejection say no, we are not going to play those kinds of games. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am pleased to support the amendment that the distinguished Senator from Alabama offers, because I think we all share the view that if a parent can stay at home--mother can stay at home, typically--then that is the best way to go and there ought not to be any discrimination against that kind of a policy or program. But people are forced, because of the pressure on incomes, to often look for the second or even the third job in the household. 
As we examine the programs that will promote the parents at home, I think we have to consider this amendment as an indication of where we all stand. The amendment, as I see it, simply affirms the view that families should not be punished for their child care choice. There is no better babysitter, no better caregiver, than the mother of the child. I don't think anyone will disagree with that. 
Democrats are proud of our long record of helping families with a stay-at-home parent to make ends meet. When you got to a particular vintage, kind of like mine--advanced middle-age, I think we call it--it was typical, regardless of the difficulty that existed financially in the household; somehow or other it all came together. 
My mother was widowed when she was 36. I had already enlisted in the Army. I had a little sister at home. Mom managed to take care of my sister, get a modest allotment from my military pay, and at the same time have a job. She made all those arrangements, and my sister was never neglected and grew up a happy, fulfilled person, as did my mother and I. But things are different now. We live in a pressure-cooker world where people just can't seem to get by unless there are multiple jobs in the household. For the middle-income family, it is not atypical. 
So Democrats, maybe we kind of harken back to a different day and say those were the proper kinds of functions to be going on in the household. Things were modest, but people accepted their fate and tried to work their way out of it. In 1993, what we tried to do was to establish the opportunity for a family to take care of their kids. We secured an expansion of the earned-income tax credit, giving a refund to those people who just didn't make enough to care for their families. In 1996, we secured an increase in the minimum wage. Last year, we won the 
$500-per-child tax credit. 
Now, all of these initiatives put more money in the pockets of American workers, and I, as a Democrat, and those of us who are Democrats were happy to see that. This is not to suggest that many of our Republican friends were not happy, but it put a Democratic stamp on these programs. I am sure, again, many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle support it. These things have made a real difference. Also, the Family and Medical Leave Act, signed into law by President Clinton, has given parents the flexibility to take time off to care for a newborn or a sick child. When it comes to helping working moms, I think we are all on the same page. 
Once again, I commend Senator Sessions for offering this amendment. I am pleased to support it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I rise in support of the Murray amendment because it very simply focuses on a problem that is of critical importance. It establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund to help reduce class sizes. I have to commend the Senator from Washington because her focus on children extends to the whole range, from nutrition, health, education, and child care. She is right, in my view, to bring this amendment up before the Senate, and now before the American people. 
What she is saying is young people need more attention from their teachers and thus the class size reduction is a perfect avenue toward getting them more attention. The capacity for the child to learn increases when class sizes are smaller. 
Once again, I commend our friend and colleague from Washington. She is one among several of our colleagues who call education focus of their agenda. The reserve fund would allow the Congress to help the States and local educational agencies recruit, train, and hire the 100,000 additional teachers by the year 2005. These teachers would reduce class sizes in grades 1 to 3 to an average of 18 students per classroom. Mr. President, this is a very important initiative and deserves our support. 
I will now speak for a moment about a personal experience. I grew up in what is now one of America's poorest cities, an industrial city, in New Jersey. The city is called Paterson, NJ. I was born there. I and a couple of my business associates decided to try to help out because of our good fortune and our interest in what was taking place within that old favorite city of ours. We provided a program for extending free tuition--we paid for it--for students who, from the sixth grade, our targeted grade, went on to pass their high school requirements and we would pay for their education in college. I thought it was a pretty significant inducement. We had academic counselors that worked with these students. Then-Vice President Quayle was very kind, spending 45 minutes with these youngsters. It was a real treat for them. We took them on various trips and tried to help them along. 
I am ashamed to say, pained to say, really, that the program did not do a lot of good. We are reexamining why. The principal thing that jumped out at us was that the sixth grade was too late to start, too late to make a difference with these youngsters. 
When examined it further, we look to the earliest grades, grades 1, 2, and 3. We found that those early learning experiences matter most. So I think that this amendment helps us to concentrate on putting our resources where they will do the most good. It is critical to get the kids off on a good start at that tender age. That is why President Clinton proposed this major national effort to limit class sizes in the early grades. That is why the proposal enjoys such strong support among the American people. 
Unfortunately, the budget now before the Senate rejects this proposal. Frankly, I believe it is one of the major shortcomings of the resolution. Senator Murray offered this amendment in the Budget Committee's markup, but it was defeated on a straight party line. I hope today's vote will be different. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and, once again, commend the distinguished Senator from Washington for her leadership on this issue. Since coming to the Senate, she has been an outspoken advocate for education, for our children in all aspects. I know she speaks not just for America's parents, grandparents, but families all across our country in urging this Nation to make education our top priority. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. KENNEDY Mr. President, the Republican budget is anti-education It sets up too many roadblocks to a brighter future for the nation's children We should be doing more, not less, to improve the nation's public schools. 
The budget should reflect our true national priorities The American people give top priority to education, and Congress should too But, the Republican education budget goes against what the American people want by cutting education funding. 
Republicans say that they are pro-education But, there is a massive disparity between their rhetoric and the reality of their budget Our Republican colleagues say that they support education and children But their current tax proposal and their current budget proposal make it very clear that they are no friends of public education 
If Republicans were friends of public schools, they would not divert $1.6 billion of scarce resources to private schools. 
They would not cut education by $400 million next year, and prohibit funding for any new programs. 
They would not ignore the pressing need to repair our crumbling schools--to train more teachers, to reduce class sizes, to provide more after-school programs to keep children off the streets, away from drugs and guns, and out of trouble. 
They would not propose tax breaks that benefit wealthy families who send their children to private schools. 
There are many good ideas to improve education that deserve support We need to increase our investment in public schools We need to raise academic standards We need to modernize school buildings We need to reduce class size We need to support more teachers and better training for current teachers We need to expand after-school programs. 
Students deserve modern schools with world-class teachers But too many students in too many schools in too many communities across the country fail to achieve that standard The latest international survey of math and science achievement confirms the urgent need to raise standards of performance for schools, teachers, and students alike It is shameful that America's twelfth graders ranked among the lowest of the 22 nations participating in this international survey of math and science. 
Schools across the nation face serious problems of overcrowding Antiquated facilities are suffering from physical decay, and are not equipped to handle the needs of modern education. 
Across the country, 14 million children in a third of the nation's schools are learning in substandard buildings Half the schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition It will take over $100 billion to repair existing facilities nationwide. 
America's children are learning in overcrowded classrooms This year, K-12 enrollment reached an all-time high, and it will continue to grow over the next 7 years Communities will need to build 6,000 new public schools to maintain current class size Due to overcrowding, schools are using trailers for classrooms and teaching students in hallways, closets, and bathrooms Overcrowded classrooms undermine discipline and decrease student morale. 
In Springfield, Massachusetts, student enrollment has increased by over 1,500 students, or 6 percent, in the last two years, forcing teachers to hold classes in storage rooms, large closets and basements. 
In addition, too many schools are already understaffed During the next decade, rising student enrollments and massive teacher retirements mean that the nation will need to hire 2 million new teachers Between 1995 and 1997, student enrollment in Massachusetts rose by 28,000 students, causing a shortage of 1,600 teachers--without including teacher retirements. 
The teacher shortage has forced many school districts to hire uncertified teachers, and ask certified teachers to teach outside their area of expertise Each year, more than 50,000 under-prepared teachers enter the classroom One in four new teachers does not fully meet state certification requirements Twelve percent of new teachers have had no teacher training at all Students in inner-city schools have only a 50% chance of being taught by a qualified science or math teacher In Massachusetts, 30% of teachers in high-poverty schools do not even have a minor degree in their field. 
Incredibly, the Republican budget ignores these pressing needs The Republican plan cuts funding for education It refuses to provide key new investments to improve public education If their anti-education plan is passed, schools and students will get even less help next year than they are getting this year, just when they need help the most. 
The Republican budget cuts discretionary funding by $1.6 billion below the President's budget It cuts funding for education and Head Start by $1 billion below the level needed to maintain current services In fact, it cuts education and Head Start funding by $400 million below last year And to make matters worse, the Republican budget prohibits funding for new education programs. 
It denies 3.7 million students the opportunity to benefit from smaller class sizes. 
It denies 900,000 disadvantaged students the extra help they need to improve their reading and math skills. 
It denies 400,000 students the opportunity to attend after-school programs. 
It denies 6,500 middle schools serving 5 million students extra help to ensure that they are safe and drug free. 
It denies 1 million students in failing schools the opportunity to benefit from innovative reforms. 
It denies 3.9 million needy college students an increase in their Pell grants. 
The Republican anti-education budget does nothing to help recruit and train qualified teachers. 
It does nothing to improve failing schools by creating Education Opportunity Zones. 
It does nothing to help disadvantaged students attend college and graduate from college. 
It does nothing to increase funding for Title I to improve students' math and reading skills. 
It does nothing to increase funding for Pell grants. 
The challenge in education is clear. We must do all we can to improve teaching and learning for all students across the nation. 
That's why I strongly support the amendment by Senator Murray to reduce class size in grades K-3 across the country. A necessary foundation for success in school is a qualified teacher in every classroom, to make sure that young children receive the individual attention they need. That's why it is so important that we help bring 100,000 new qualified teachers into the public schools and reduce class size in the elementary grades. 
Research has shown that students attending small classes in the early grades make more rapid progress than students in larger classes. The benefits are greatest for low-achieving, minority, and low-income children. Smaller classes also enable teachers to identify and work effectively with students who have learning disabilities, and reduce the need for special education in later grades. 
A national study of 10,000 fourth graders in 203 school districts across the country and 10,000 eighth graders in 182 school districts across the country found that students in small classes performed better than students in large classes for both grade levels. 
Gains were larger for fourth graders than eighth graders. Gains were largest of all for inner-city students in small classes--they were likely to advance 75 percent more quickly than students in large classes. 
Another significant analysis called Project STAR studied 7,000 students in grades K to 3 in 80 schools in Tennessee. Again, students in small classes performed better than students in large classes in each grade from kindergarten through third grade. And the gains were larger for minority students. 
We also know that overcrowded classrooms undermine discipline and decrease student morale. 
Many states and communities are considering proposals to reduce class size. But you can't reduce class size without the ability to hire additional qualified teachers to fill the additional classrooms. The federal government should lend a helping hand. 
This year, California Governor Wilson proposed to spend $1.5 billion to reduce fourth-grade classes to 20 students or less, after having reduced class sizes for students in grades K-3 last year. 
In Pennsylvania, a recent report by the bipartisan legislative commission on urban school restructuring recommended capping class sizes in kindergarten through grade 3 in urban districts at 20 students per teacher. 
In Wisconsin, the Student Achievement Guarantee in Education program is helping to reduce class size in grades K-3 in low-income communities. 
In Flint, Michigan, efforts over the last three years to reduce class size in grades K-3 have led to a 44% increase in reading scores and an 18% increase in math scores. 
Congress can do more to encourage all of these state and local efforts across the country. We can help lead the way in reducing class size. I urge my colleagues to support Senator Murray's amendment and to increase our investment in education. The nation's children deserve our support.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for the Dodd amendment. This amendment would provide a reserve fund to improve the affordability, availability, and quality of child care. It also would support families' choices in caring for their children. 
As you know, Mr. President, child care remains a pressing national problem. More families need it. Not enough families can afford it. And there aren't enough qualified professionals to provide it. 
Families with children under 5 and with incomes under $14,400 a year today spend one-quarter of their incomes on child care. Yet only 1 of every 10 children eligible for child care assistance receives it. Most modest-income families are getting crushed by the costs of child care. 
Compounding matters, the quality of much child care remains seriously deficient. And a major reason is the high rate of turnover among child care providers. More than one-third of them leave their jobs each year, largely because of low wages. 
Mr. President, this amendment would help address these problems by providing a mechanism for additional federal support for child care. And it is critically important. 
Some have argued that working families don't need this help, because the states already are getting more federal child care funding than they can spend. But that is just wrong. According to the latest HHS data, states' child care outlays are 90 percent of total budget authority for 1997, and states have obligated 99.8 percent of those funds. 
Morover, so far in 1998, states are drawing down child care funds at a higher rate than last year--and at a higher rate than either CBO or OMB had projected. 
I also have heard the argument that we don't need to support spending on child care when we can expand the dependent care tax credit instead. But that's just not sufficient. 
As long as the dependent care tax credit remains non-refundable, expanding it will not help modest-income working families. In fact, a two-parent family with two children that pays $400 per month for child care would not begin to benefit from a non-refundable expansion until its annual income reaches almost $31,000. 
Let me emphasize that. If you have two kids, a $30,000 income, and you pay $400 a month for child care, you're not going to benefit at all from current proposals to expand the dependent care tax credit. Your income is just too low. 
Finally, I know that the Republican budget resolution is assuming some additional discretionary funds for child care. But I question whether these funds will materialize given the strict overall caps on discretionary spending. And, in any case, discretionary spending is a 1-year, short-term approach to a long-term problem. Americans' child care needs are increasing, and families should have our commitment that we will lend a helping hand. 
Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will agree that it's time to address child care needs in a serious way. And I hope we can get bipartisan support for Senator Dodd's important amendment.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is very kind. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his generous giving up of some time here. 
In 1 minute, very succinctly, Mr. President, it is this: I heard our friend from New Mexico talk about the proliferation of reserve funds. I want to remind the Senator that he and I were part and parcel of an agreement to establish a major reserve fund last year in the budget agreement. It was designed for transportation. 
We encouraged that process to make sure that there would be money to take care of the transportation needs. We had a commitment by the chairman of the Finance Committee that that was an appropriate use of process, to set up a reserve fund. Well, we have a reserve fund now to make sure our kids, when they grow up, are healthy and learned and ready to take on their responsibilities. I do not mind a little reserve fund. I hope that the Senator's vote carries.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, which expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress should not grant immunity to the tobacco companies as part of comprehensive tobacco legislation. 
Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from New Hampshire for offering this sense of the Senate. It's a clear statement on a critical issue. 
Mr. President, there is no valid reason to give the tobacco industry special protections from liability. The tobacco industry, for decades, has lied to the American people. It's intentionally boosted the addictive power of its products to hook consumers. And, worst of all, it's conspired to illegally market its products to children. 
The end result of all this fraud and deception is that millions of Americans have died prematurely. Families have lost mothers. Fathers. Grandparents. Brothers. Sisters. And all too often, these families watched helplessly as their loved ones smoked themselves to death, unable to break this deadly addiction. 
Now. Mr. President, the tobacco industry is asking for a special favor. They want to be shielded from liability for the harms they've caused. A shield that hasn't been granted to any other industry. 
Mr. President, why would Congress give special immunity to the tobacco industry, of all industries? 
Well, the main argument you hear is that Congress must let the industry off the hook because otherwise they'll keep marketing tobacco to our kids. It's as if the industry has a gun to our heads. Or, more precisely, the heads of our children. 
Well, Mr. President, that's an outrageous threat. And I don't think we should give in to it. After all, the U.S. Government doesn't negotiate with terrorists. And the same should be true for those who threaten to market deadly drugs to our children. 
I also would point out, Mr. President, that if we did give the industry the broad liability restrictions that it wants, we still wouldn't get much in return. And it's important to understand why not. 
The tobacco industry has said that it would be willing to give up advertising to kids if we give it immunity. But the tobacco manufacturers can't make an agreement on behalf of all those who might want to advertise. So, instead of RJR buying ads, its distributors could. Or retailers. Or anyone else. These others would not be bound by any agreements entered into by manufacturers. 
It's also important to remember that many constitutional experts believe that these agreements could be ruled unenforceable. So we could discover later that we have compromised the legal rights of tobacco victims, and gained absolutely nothing in the process. 
Mr. President, instead of giving special breaks to the tobacco industry, Congress should be developing legislation that keeps our kids away from tobacco. That helps adults kick the habit. And that saves lives. 
We need legislation that will increase the price of cigarettes to at least $1.50 per pack--as the Budget Committee agreed, in a bipartisan vote. 
We need legislation to give FDA the authority to regulate tobacco as a drug. Legislation to fund anti-teen smoking programs, smoking cessation programs, counter advertising, and other anti-tobacco initiatives. 
Mr. President, there's no reason to give the tobacco industry veto rights over that kind of legislation. None. 
Mr. President, this is the Senate of the United States of America. And our job is to do what is right for the American people. It is to do what we can to save lives. And if the tobacco industry doesn't like it--frankly, that's too bad. 
So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire. Let's not give the tobacco industry a special handout. This is an industry that has lied to the American people. It's an industry that's directly responsible for the deaths of millions of Americans. And they should be held accountable. There just is no excuse for letting them off the hook.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the sense-of-the-Senate amendment offered by Senator Kyl, which calls for the expansion of private contracting between physicians and Medicare beneficiaries. This proposal could leave beneficiaries vulnerable to higher out-of-pocket costs for Medicare services. And it could leave the Medicare Program more vulnerable to fraud and abuse. 
Mr. President, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 allows physicians to enter into `private contracts' with Medicare enrollees and set their own fees for services covered by Medicare. The intent of this provision was to allow the 9 percent of physicians who don't participate in the Medicare Program, to continue to treat their Medicare-eligible patients through private contracts. 
To protect Medicare from fraud and to ensure that private contracting arrangements are limited to physicians who otherwise would not be available to Medicare beneficiaries, the law is limited to those physicians who agree, in an affidavit, to forgo all reimbursement from Medicare for at least 2 years. The law also requires a physician to disclose to the patient that no Medicare payment will be made for privately contracted services, no balance billing limits will apply, no Medigap coverage will be available, and the services to be performed would be paid for by Medicare if provided by another physician. 
The proposal advocated by Senator Kyl could jeopardize these important protections by allowing all physicians to charge Medicare beneficiaries more than the levels set by the Congress on a service-by-service or patient-by-patient basis. And that could lead many seniors vulnerable to pressure from providers to pay higher rates. For example, a physician could tell someone with a serious illness that they would have to pay extra to get the services they need. And for a desperately ill person, that may leave them feeling that they have no real choice. 
So, Mr. President, we need to evaluate the impact of the law we just passed before we make changes that could raise costs for beneficiaries or add to the already critical problems of fraud and abuse. The American College of Physicians has recommended that we not legislate further on the issue of private contracting at this time. They have advised that any further expansion of private contracting could have many unknown effects that should be studied in the broader context of Medicare reform by the bipartisan commission on Medicare. I believe that's good advice, Mr. President, and I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I appreciate the message that the chairman of the Budget Committee is sending out here, and that is the time is going to be consumed. We always know what happens when it gets to the bewitching hour, which is the end of the week, and people want to go home or take care of other business. 
I say to my colleagues on my side, as well as the other side, do not be surprised, if you want to delay doing it now, that you are not going to be able to get enough time, in many cases, to really explore the amendment that you want to present. We could wind up in a vote-a-thon. That is going to be allowed. It means 1 minute debate and a vote. I don't think that is a good way to do legislation. 
I say we are going to be here. Senator Domenici and I have agreed we will stay as long as we can, to use the expression, to do some business, to have people come down and offer their amendments. We invite them, whether it is 10 o'clock or 12 o'clock. We don't want an hour to elapse in between them, frankly, but we are here and we will stay as long as our colleagues want to bring amendments. We hope they will. If I still have the floor, I have a couple of amendments to send to the desk.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their kind comments and would say, while this looks like a mutual admiration society, we kind of get that way because we work on an issue we care an awful lot about, something with which several of us have had a history for a long time. I particularly say what a delight it is to work with our distinguished Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad. He is always very thorough in his review of budget matters or whatever the subject is. He is on the Finance Committee. He has done a lot of good work there and has earned the respect of all the people he works with because he is so thoughtful and so deliberate and so direct in the things he sees and that he wants to work on. 
Senator Conrad was designated as chairman of the tobacco task force by our leader. It was a singular honor, because what the minority leader wanted to do was to pick someone whose objectivity could be counted on because we do have different views on how we ought to treat the tobacco negotiations, deal with the tobacco companies, and deal with our constituents and the public at large. The Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, chose Senator Conrad because he knew he could be counted on to do a thorough analysis, bring the parties together, and certainly that has been the case. Senator Conrad had people there who were friends of the industry, unabashedly. They made sure the industry point of view was being represented. On the other hand, we had those from the science community, Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler, and people who had seen the effects of tobacco directly in their homes and often on their own person. 
So he has done a thorough job all the way through the discussions here. We have a chance now to finally come to the beginning of the analysis of what might take place here in the Senate as it regards a kind of comprehensive settlement. It is discouraging, I must say, at this point, to find out, despite the good intentions of our friends on the other side, that we wind up with a budget resolution facing us that totally restricts our ability to work with the problem. The problem, very simply, is how do we protect young people--kids, if I may use the affectionate expression--kids, from starting to smoke when they are 8, 9, 10, 11 years old? We had a boy, a young man, in front of our committee. I think he was 12, a young man from Iowa, 12 years old. He was pleading for help to stop his addiction--12 years old--because he didn't want his little brother to start smoking and be addicted to tobacco--12 years old. He said he was already hooked and he tried to stop several times. 
I looked at him and I said, `My gosh, how can that happen that someone that age, still in the full bloom of development and growth, how could he be hooked on tobacco?' He told it as it was. He wasn't a city slicker. He was a boy from--kind of country. He came in with a member of the police department, as I remember, who was his friend and kind of counselor. 
We have lost the mission, I think, by directing the language so that we are hamstrung. We are unable to say to the country at large that what we want to do is we want to see that the tobacco industry finally makes up for some of the terrible damage it has brought on our community, brought on our people. We lose sight of that sometimes, the damage, as we go through the debate, because we talk about 
 immunity from the suit, protection from litigation, talking about how we can cut a deal with the tobacco industry. I, frankly, think it comes under the umbrella of nonsense. 
I don't like to be casual with language. We are dealing with an industry that has taken a terrible toll on America. To put it in some frame that makes it quite clear, in all of the wars of the 20th century--World War II, World War I, Korea, Vietnam--the casualties, those killed in combat in all the wars of the 20th century, don't equal the number that die each year as a result of smoking. It is incredible when you think about it. 
We know there are over 400,000 deaths a year, most of them premature, often fatal after surgery--after surgery--lungs, throat, you name it, respiratory conditions galore, gastrointestinal conditions. We found out not too long ago, via the Harvard School of Public Health, that in addition to those who we knew died from tobacco-developed illnesses, that those who have exposure to secondhand smoke, numbering over 50,000 persons a year, 50,000 persons a year have fatal heart attacks, fatal heart attacks from exposure to secondhand smoke. 
We look at this and we say, `Well, what do we do about our arrangement with the companies?' 
The first thing we have begun to find out--and we are about to find out a lot more--is what they have hidden in their planning over the years, their papers over the years, their attempt to hide information from the public by pretending that there is a client-attorney relationship. 
The reason I mention these things is, we have to understand who it is that we are working with, that we are talking to. This is an industry which has been a foul-play industry for decades, knowing very well that addiction was being created by the manipulation of the nicotine, trying to grow plants that have a higher nicotine content that will addict quicker and firmer. 
After a lot of discussion, after the attorneys general of most of the States in the country have met and have fashioned out what they think is a settlement--which we didn't all fully agree with, but they made a start, and I give them credit--they began to lay out what the parameters might be, an arrangement which would have the companies stepping up to help us develop a proper public health policy, because that is the primary mission. 
Money, in this case, while not unimportant, is certainly a secondary part of the discussion, because with that money what we want to do is stop kids from smoking. We want to teach people how to stop even after they have begun smoking. We want to do some research. We want to find out what that nicotine does to the body, to the lungs, to the digestive system--the whole thing. We want to be able to stand up face to face with the powerful tobacco industry and say, `Hey, listen; whatever you do, understand that we are going to limit your ability to get your message out to children and to other unsuspecting people, and we want you to pay for it, but we want you to work with us to help us develop these programs.' 
We thought we were doing pretty well, because that proposed settlement served as a springboard for other discussions. It served as a springboard for what else we might do, as the President so carefully and positively laid out. We saw that there would be programs as a result of an agreement with the tobacco companies and to ask the public to join in and help pay for some of the costs that tobacco renders on our society. There are guesstimates that it goes from $30 billion, $40 billion a year, up to $100 billion a year when you talk about lost productivity and problems which arise for individuals and families which go beyond just the treatment of the health problem. We worked hard. 
Mr. President, we have just been joined by the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, who has become a friend over the years as we worked together and with whom we had an unusually successful program last year to get to a balanced budget, to help continue the process begun by President Clinton and his policy and watch that deficit go down. We look forward to surpluses in the future, possibly over $1 trillion in the next decade. Think about what good we could do with that money. 
The President laid it out very carefully. It had to do with teen smoking programs, how we stop that from happening, and all the things I just talked about to improve health, prevent people from becoming addicts, which they are, over 41 million of them--addicts. It doesn't sound pleasant, but that is the truth. As a matter of fact, it is said in some quarters that 
addiction to smoking is almost deeper and longer lasting than it is with some of the illegal drugs that we hear so much about in our society. 
We were enthusiastic. I know I speak for the Senator from North Dakota and I speak for myself, Senator Reed, Senator Durbin, and Senator Bingaman, when I say we thought, `OK, we're on a good track; we talked to our friends on the Republican side of the Budget Committee, and we worked to find a plan so that we could use whatever revenues developed effectively,' even as we developed a good health policy, because that was outside the Budget Committee directly. But it did include the programs which would be considered as part of the budget resolution, budget planning, for fiscal year 1999. 
I don't have to tell you how disappointing it was to find out we were not at all going to be able to implement the policies we thought were positive--that we thought would prevent the kids from starting to smoke, that we thought would help us counter advertising, that we thought would help us with research, the NIH--to find out that by design, certainly more than by coincidence, what we were doing was restricting the use of any funds which might derive from a fee--we might even call it a user fee--from those who smoke, but a fee, an excise tax--that it was going to be restricted to something we like, by the way. 
All of us want to see a more solvent Medicare, a stronger Medicare. The President has confirmed his view of what ought to be done, because he has appointed a commission. They are going to have a chance for deliberation. In the next year, there are going to be specific recommendations on how to protect Medicare, how to create the kind of solvency which will give us all some confidence that Medicare is going to be there as a program to use for all who reach 65. 
We find out, however, despite the fact that we want to see Medicare protected, what has happened is the use of funds has become so narrowed that we can't do the other programs; that we are going to be unable to take the money which was earned off the addiction, off the habit that ruined so many people's health. Out of the 41 million people who are out there, we don't know how many are going to die prematurely, but we know a lot of them are, and we know a lot of them will be wrestling with diseases which will render them unable to conduct their lives in a normal fashion, and we are not going to be able to use those funds for that. 
Again, there is not a suggestion of anything underhanded-- not at all, Mr. President. I want to make sure that is completely understood. It is a focus on what the programs are that we are going to be able to put into place as a result of having those funds available. Our friends on the Republican side have decided you are not going to use it for any of those things; you are not going to use it for developing an appropriate health policy program; you are not going to be able to use it to stop teen smoking. I know there are programs within the basic budget resolution to encourage that, but, Mr. President, those programs are financed to the tune of $125 million a year. That is the recommendation. My gosh, even the tobacco companies, who hate to admit they have done anything wrong, were willing to put $2 billion into the anti-teen-smoking program. 
We find ourselves in the position where we agree with the interests and the effort on behalf of the majority of the Budget 
Committee in developing a program, but we also find ourselves saying, `Hey, wait a second, is this going to help the tobacco companies in some way? Is this going to hurt our ability to attack the programs that we so desperately need to do? Or is it just a little bit of a disguise to say, `Well, OK, what we are going to do is, we are going to support health programs very narrowly'?' 
It is with regret that we talk about that today. Mr. President, you have seen the list that the Senator from North Dakota has alongside him there: Reality versus rhetoric. We have some work to do. We have to try to amend what it is that came out of the Budget Committee. I am the ranking member. I like working with Senator Domenici. I hope he will like working with me when I am the chairman. But that is the way these things go, Mr. President. Sometimes what goes around comes around.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Long enough to accomplish that objective. Anyway, we are going to want to amend this, and I hope we can get that done. That would be a positive start. Think about it: 3,000 young people a day start smoking; over 1 million a year. One-third of them will die prematurely, just as sure as we are standing here, if we don't make significant changes in the way tobacco is understood in our society--1 million kids a year. Wow, that is larger than some of our biggest cities. It is certainly larger than a lot of the countries that are on this globe. 
It is time we reach out a helping hand and say, `OK, we are going to help you stop before you get started on this addiction.' I hope our friends on the Republican side will join us. 
It was interesting for me to see what happened on two different occasions in these last couple of weeks. One was this very day, when a senior Member of the Senate on the Republican side, the Senator from New Hampshire, offered an amendment to say that there would be no protection for the tobacco companies, that they would have to face up to what the process is--whether it is the courts or negotiated settlements, or what have you--and take their chances. It drew a lot of votes. I think there were 75 votes in favor of the Gregg amendment. 
The other was an earlier time, when we were marking up the budget resolution, when we had six members of the Republican Party stand up with Democrats and confirm the fact that we think the $1.50 price per pack of cigarettes put in place over 3 years at the rate of 50 cents a year ought to move ahead. 
And that was the only amendment that had any bipartisan support--the only amendment. It meant that some of our friends on the Republican side, just as we have heard in these Capitol Grounds, just could not say no. They had to say yes. They had to say yes, we want to see a $1.50 per pack fee imposed on cigarette use. 
We are looking at a lot of money. We are looking at hundreds of millions of dollars over the next 25 years. I make a plea for those who are going to be voting on this amendment tomorrow sometime: Take a look at what it is you are doing. We understand the interests in Medicare, but we want you to share our concern that the place to start in preventing disease from the use of tobacco starts with kids, starts with the youngest of them, starts with the most helpless of us, and join us in amending this budget resolution so that we can get a different kind of message out there. 
Mr. President, to reiterate I strongly support this amendment, which would expand the tobacco reserve fund to allow tobacco revenues to be used for anti-tobacco efforts. 
This amendment, in effect, is a test of whether the Senate is serious about comprehensive tobacco legislation. If we vote down this amendment, then we're saying `no' to tackling the issue of tobacco this year. 
Senators on both sides of the aisle have various visions of how tobacco revenue should be spent. But there had been a bipartisan consensus that, at the very least, we should dedicate tobacco revenue to fighting teen smoking and developing smoking cessation programs. 
The majority leader, Senator Lott, has taken that position. Senator McCain is developing legislation that would use tobacco revenues for anti-smoking efforts. And other bills by Senators Hatch, Conrad, Jeffords, Kennedy, and myself all would devote tobacco revenue to anti-teen smoking programs, tobacco-related research, smoking cessation, and other tobacco related programs. 
Even the tobacco industry's proposed settlement called for tobacco revenue to be used for a variety of programs, including teen education, smoking cessation and tobacco research. 
Unfortunately, this budget would block all of these activities. That's wrong. And it just makes no sense. 
The distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee has argued that there is enough funding available in the resolution for these activities. I strongly disagree. 
The budget resolution assumes $125 million in budget authority for anti-youth smoking and cessation in fiscal year 1999. But that is far below any of the major tobacco bills. In fact, it's not even in the same ballpark. 
The tobacco industry's original proposed settlement included over $2 billion per year for these programs. Senator Conrad's bill included a similar figure. That's $2 billion versus $125 million. 
That is not even close. 
Also, the $125 million assumed for teen smoking reduction programs and smoking cessation in the budget resolution must be accommodated within the discretionary spending caps. And there's reason to be skeptical that this will happen. After all, those caps are very tight. And increasing funding for these activities would require cuts in other programs. Maybe that will happen. But I certainly wouldn't count on it. 
The bottom line, though, is that the restrictive reserve fund language in this resolution makes it much less likely that we will pass tobacco legislation this year. That's a grave concern to me, and to most of my colleagues on this side of the aisle. 
After all, 3,000 kids a day start smoking every day; 1,000 of them will die prematurely as a result. We simply must act. And this resolution would create a major roadblock. 
I ask my colleagues to support the Conrad amendment, and pave the way for comprehensive tobacco legislation this year. 
With that, I yield the floor.

I will take my 5 minutes first, and I ask the Chair to remind me when my 5 minutes is up so that I can give the remaining 7 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota. 
First of all, I am not personally insulted, I promise you that, not at all. I heard the chairman of the Budget Committee talk about what a great guy and a good friend and a nice Democrat and everything else the Senator from North Dakota was. Then he talked about the Senator from Louisiana. It doesn't bother me. It is just one of those things, Mr. President, two Democrats being described as great guys and all that. But we will go on from there.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. We are together, believe me. As a matter of fact, I want to tell you something, Mr. President. You have no idea--few have--how hard I worked to get this man to stop smoking. It showed my true affection for him because I wanted him to be around here. Even when I disagree with him, I like him here because he stimulates reactions and gets us going at times, if you know what I mean. 
Mr. President, I ask people to consider this question with me. What grandparent, I ask you, would not say: Take care of my grandchild first, help my grandchild so that when he or she grows up, they are healthy, help my grandchild to not become an addict to tobacco or other drug substances? What grandparent would not stand up and proudly say `take care of them first' because eventually they will be the ones who will shoot the Government programs and health insurance programs up through the roof? 
Yes, there is $22 billion worth of spending in Medicare on tobacco-related illness. We are not sure, but there is a significant amount, perhaps a like amount, in Medicaid tobacco-related illness. But if we don't inhibit smoking among the youngsters today, this price will continue. Sometimes you have to make an investment in the long term before you can obtain the result that you want. You can't always do it overnight. 
So I submit, Mr. President, that we are determined not to break the caps. We are determined to abide by CBO accounting. We are determined not to spend money that we don't have. And to correct something the Senator from New Mexico said a moment ago, he said the surpluses should be used for Medicare. I think he didn't quite mean it that way because, technically, the words are, `surplus is going to Social Security,' and hopefully the proceeds from the tobacco legislation would go toward creating a more solvent Medicare. 
So, Mr. President, I kind of rest the case here. My colleague from North Dakota is going to want to wrap up, as they say, but I say as an experienced grandparent--and if anybody wants to see the pictures of my five grandchildren, I have them here in my pocket. But I tell you that there is nothing--nothing--in my life that I would not give to prevent sickness or illness to any one of my grandchildren. There is no price that is too high to pay. I will take care of myself, but I want to make sure I give my grandchildren a chance to grow, develop, and be healthy. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor for my friend from North Dakota.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I listened with interest and do not want to enlarge the debate at this time. Obviously, the hour is late, but I listened with a degree of interest and care to the comments of the Senator from Idaho. And we have this debate sometimes that centers around whether the glass is half empty or half full. And we are looking at the same matrix, but I see it differently. I do not see a nation out of control. I do not see an economy that is in great jeopardy. I do not despair over what is taking place in our economic structure. Yes, we are paying more taxes in total, but that is because people's incomes have gone up and thus they are paying a larger share of the tax burden than they used to pay. 
But when we look at a time when the unemployment rate compares to all-time lows, when we see inflation so well controlled, when we see the investment climate in our country so appetizing, no one knows when this is going to change, but the fact of the matter is, lots of people, lots of hard-working, what we will call modest-income people, have made good returns on their investments. And, Lord willing, they will be protected. 
But why is all that taking place? Why has the stock market galloped up like it has? It is not simply because there is some kind of a speculation fever out there. A lot of it has to do with the fact that the United States is the most attractive investment country in the world. People feel secure. They know if they invest in America that they have a better chance of keeping their money safe and getting a return than any other place because of the structure of our financial being. We cannot ignore these things. 
I share the Senator's view. I would like to see us paying off the debt. I am one of those who said, yes, I want to shore up Social Security. And how are we going to do it? We are going to do it by paying down the debt. The President has forecast over $1 trillion worth of surpluses over the next 10 years. That is a pretty encouraging prediction. 
So, I hope we will continue this debate on the morrow, because I think there are other people here who would also want to comment. 
Mr. President, I do not think we ought to ever lock ourselves into straitjackets to say that you cannot do this unless you do that. We are sent here to exercise judgment. And when I hear the speeches of some of my colleagues, I say, well, we sound like a bunch of recalcitrant children who have to be locked in a corner or put in our seats, or we are so bad--why can't we control ourselves? I do not see it that way. 
I must tell you, I have great respect for those that I disagree deeply with here. They are sent here to represent a constituency who thinks that these people, the Senators in this Chamber, are going to carry a point of view that they share. And if not, there is a test that comes every 6 years. And you can see what happens. You have either passed the test or you have flunked it; it is very decisive. 
But with all of that, I just do not see this, if I might call it, self-flagellation, this beating of ourselves. Look at the facts. The economy is really good. I know that I feel better about my children's future now than I did a few years ago. I think we have proven one thing. And some would say, well, we have not, Alan Greenspan has. He is part of our crowd, whether we think we are in his league or not. 
The fact of the matter is, we have inflation under 
control--something that was hard to believe could be done, and has not caused deflation, has not caused a crisis. Things are going along very well. 
So I hope, Mr. President, we will have a chance to chat about this a little bit tomorrow, and I hope we will be able to encourage our colleagues to vote against the Craig amendment, to say that we do not have to put on the handcuffs and apologize for our behavior. I do not think I do everything right, but I know one thing: I work at what I do. And so does everybody else here. 
I do not think there is anybody here who shirks their responsibility, who does not take it seriously. And I do not think I have to be put in a corner like a child and told, well, you are not going to be allowed to do this unless you do that; you are not going to be allowed to spend money. How do we know when the crisis is coming? 
We have done the things we said we ought to do. We have a balanced budget. I think we are all proud of that. We can argue whether it is CBO balanced. We say, yes it is. We all kind of believe that on a unified budget basis we are going to be seeing a slight surplus in the very short period. So I hope our colleagues will stand up and say no to limiting our ability to use our heads, to use our judgment, to take the risk of our votes and to see if we can do things without limiting our ability to act. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I want to say a couple of words about the dialog that Senator DeWine and I have had, working together, about the reduction of the blood alcohol content to .08. I listened very carefully to the information he just gave regarding repetitive assaults on excessive alcohol in this one case even, at the fairly reduced level of .085. It kind of forecast a tale that would have an unfortunate outcome. 
I think it is important, as we consider legislation on ISTEA that carries this prohibition of driving over .08 blood alcohol content, we ought to review the case and see what it is we are discussing because I, too, in the State of New Jersey and around the country, have been subjected to criticism from the restaurant associations, the Alcoholic Beverage Association, and others who say, `What do you want to do, take away social drinking and friendliness?' 
We have only one mission, and I share this with the distinguished Senator from Ohio on this particular issue. That is to protect the lives of between 500 to 700 people a year, it is predicted, and also to send out notice that drinking and driving is an unacceptable condition in America. Mr. President, .08 certainly is a level which, I think it is fair to say, has conclusively been established as the beginning of significant impairment behind the wheel, including slowness in adjusting to different speeds, braking, turning. 
It happens enough. We lose 17,000 people a year, Mr. President, to traffic accidents that involve alcohol. Over 40,000 to 41,000 people are killed each and every year. I use a reference fairly frequently that, in the worst year of Vietnam--when this country was, if not in virtual mourning, certainly in virtual internal turmoil about what was happening there--in its worst year, we lost about 17,000-plus people in Vietnam, and every year we lose 17,000-plus people on our highways and it doesn't get the same kind of public reaction as it did when we were engaged in combat in a cause that our people served but one that had us challenging the policy decision that got us there in the first place. There can't be any challenge here. It is such an easy thing. 
I was the author of the uniform drinking age bill that raised the age to 21 across the country. We had had modest alcohol requirements in legislation offering incentives for States to get this thing done--reduce, make sure you had your road checks, and make sure you were cautioning people about driving while under the influence of alcohol, driving while intoxicated. It never quite did the trick. 
But we found out when we raised the drinking age to 21, and we said those States that don't do it will be subjected to penalties by virtue of a loss of the highway or infrastructure funding that they may get, we had a devil of a time. It took a long time to persuade some places, like Washington, DC, which was making the callous calculation about whether or not revenues derived from tavern receipts, restaurant receipts, would be more than that which they would lose if they failed to raise the drinking age to 21. They finally agreed, and we had the unanimous support of all 50 States and the District of Columbia. 
I am pleased to report that it is estimated that over 15,000 lives are saved as a result of a minimum drinking age of 21. Imagine, 15,000 families that don't have to mourn, 15,000 families that don't even want to contemplate what it might be like to have an empty place at the table. 
We both have heard from the Frazier family in Maryland that lost a 9-year-old daughter. Her name was Ashley Frazier. When you see her parents and her sister talk about the emptiness that surrounds that household, about the place at the table where the mother sits occasionally because they want to be reminded that Ashley was a significant part of their everyday lives--they set the table for four, and only three of them are there for dinner. I have watched Mrs. Frazier compelled to tell her story through tears because she doesn't want another family to have to go through that experience. Her daughter was killed at 8 o'clock in the morning by a woman who was just over .08, who drove up on the sidewalk as Ashley and her mother were waiting for the schoolbus to pick her up. She describes in the most horrifying language how she felt when she heard the impact and realized what happened to her daughter. 
So, Mr. President, this is a pursuit that we are going to continue to engage in, the Senator from Ohio and I and many others who supported us when we had the vote on the issue here, because it is the right thing to do. 
The one thing that I can't believe is that the Licensed Beverage Association wants to stand up and challenge whether or not .08 is really an impairment. Mind you, it takes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Education, over four beers, four drinks, four highballs--over four--4 1/2 , to be precise--for a 170-pound person on an empty stomach to reach the .08 level. Now, that sounds like fairly heavy drinking. A woman of roughly 135 pounds would have to take 3 1/2 drinks for her to get to .08 in 1 hour on an empty stomach.  
That is pretty significant drinking. And so we say to the Restaurant Association, Why? `Well, it could ruin our business and throw all of these people out of work.' Well, Mr. President, I can tell you this--we heard the same appeal or the same challenge in 1984 when the drinking age was raised to 21, and the Restaurant and the Licensed Beverage Association said, `You are going to ruin business in this country.' 
I don't know whether anybody has noticed an absence of restaurants or hospitality spots in our society since 1984, but I can tell you that I haven't. I don't think anyone else has. Just read the list of the better restaurants and of the new beverages that come out, the new concoctions, mixed drinks. They are not going to lose any business with this either. And if they do, so what? If they save somebody's child from dying because someone was too drunk to drive, then that is a price that ought to be paid. I, frankly, think that if they are serious about this and they remind their bartenders and servers and people are reminded through campaigns that when you get to .08, you can't go behind that wheel--not without risking serious punishment, perhaps loss of a license and something even worse if it is repeated. 
And so, Mr. President, so many times we go through the legislative process here and we forget, at times, the impact that it has on a family or on an individual. It becomes too much a calculation of other things than the right thing. We ought to do this. I am hoping that as ISTEA moves along, we will not only have .08 in there but we will have it with the measures that we have introduced and said, at the end of 3 years, if you haven't reduced your blood alcohol level acceptance to .08, you lose 5 percent, and if it goes for another year, you lose 10 percent. But at the end of 6 years, you still state A, B, or C, and you still have the opportunity to reclaim those funds that you would have lost, because we are giving it that much latitude. The program begins 3 years out and goes until 6 years without permanent loss of funding. 
So I commend the Senator from Ohio for his interest and his attention to the details. As a prosecutor, we heard him say, he saw too much of the mayhem that is produced from someone getting behind the wheel who is unfit to drive. I look forward to working with him on this issue and other issues in which we share a common interest. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise to join in offering this amendment to address a serious problem in my state. 
This amendment is very timely. This week, I have been working with my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee on Superfund reauthorization. 
I strongly believe that the Superfund reauthorization bill before the Committee will severely undermine the concept that the polluter should pay for the waste it created, which is what this amendment before us now is all about. 
The Federal government is long overdue in reaching an adequate resolution of claims against W.R. Grace & Co., for the cleanup of the Wayne Superfund Site in New Jersey. There seems to be no end to the headaches experienced by the residents of Wayne Township over this site and over the lack of any settlement. 
Between 1955 and 1971, the W.R. Grace & Company owned and operated a thorium extraction operation in Wayne Township. 
In 1984, because of the threat to the public's health from potential groundwater contamination, the site was placed on the Superfund National Priorities List and is now being managed by the Corps of Engineers under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). 
That same year, 1984, W.R. Grace provided a payment of $800,000 and signed an agreement with the Federal government. This agreement stated that the government can still pursue legal action against the company under applicable laws, which would include Superfund. In the meantime, cleanup costs for this site continued to escalate, costing the taxpayers millions of dollars.

Today, I rise to reiterate my strong opposition to a final settlement that would permit W. R. Grace to escape appropriate responsibility for its share of the pollution. This amendment reminds the Attorney General that we not only want to see progress, but that we demand a settlement that adequately reimburses the taxpayers.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to thank the managers of this bill, Chairman Stevens and Ranking Member Byrd, as well as Senators Bond and Mikulski, for agreeing to a provision of critical importance to southern New Jersey's AIDS afflicted community. This provision allows for the administration of Housing for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) funding for four southern New Jersey counties by the State of New Jersey. 
New Jersey's AIDS community has raised concerns about the current administration of HOPWA funding to four southern New Jersey counties: Camden, Gloucester, Salem, and Burlington. In order to better serve the needs of southern New Jersey's AIDS community, this provision gives the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) the statutory authority to delegate the administration of southern New Jersey's HOPWA funding to the State of New Jersey. 
This provision will help improve the implementation of housing services for southern New Jersey's AIDS afflicted, and I am pleased that the managers of the fiscal year 1998 supplemental appropriations bill have agreed to include this change. Again, I thank them for their work on this matter.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to suspend temporarily the rate of duty on four products produced by a constituent, AlliedSignal Inc. I am introducing a separate bill for each of the four products. The first is organic luminescent pigments, dyes, and fibers that are used in products requiring security and anti-counterfeiting technology. Unlike other pigments and dyes, these luminescent compounds are designed on a proprietary basis for one specific anti-counterfeiting application. The current duty is 5.9%. The second product, 4-Hexylresorcinol, has a variety of applications, including in throat lozenges, topical antiseptics, and other pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. The current duty is 5.8%. Potassium hexafluorozirconate and hexafluorozirconium acid are used in the treatment of aluminum alloys in a variety of applications, including aerospace. The current duties are 3.1% and 4.2%. Finally, polymethine sensitizing dyes are used to improve the spectral response of photo-sensitive emulsions on photographic films. These dyes are complex organic molecules, and each one is typically designed on a proprietary basis to the customer's specifications. The current duty is 6.8%. 
I have received assurances from AlliedSignal that there is no commercial US manufacturer for any of these products. Furthermore, each of the products was included in the United States Trade Representative's `zero list' of chemicals whose U.S. tariffs it tried to eliminate, in exchange for concessions from trading partners, during the November 1997 APEC Ministerial meeting. In a chemical industry-wide review of the zero list, no U.S. company objected to the proposed elimination of these products' duties.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to temporarily reduce the rate of duty imposed on a fragrance additive with the chemical name of Benzenepropanal, 4-(1,1-Dimethylethyl)-Methyl-. The chemical has a lily-like floral aroma and used in fragrances. 
My constituent who requested this duty reduction, Bush Boake Allen Inc. of Montvale, New Jersey, knows of no opposition to this legislation. The last United States manufacturer of this chemical, Givaudan-Roure, will cease all production of this additive by June 1998. I have drafted this legislation to ensure that it will not go into effect before July 15. Givaudan-Roure, which is also a constituent, knows of this legislation and the effective date, and does not oppose it. 
I ask my colleagues to support this legislation. Reducing the duties paid by American companies for products which have no American manufacturer keep our companies from being placed at a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace. In addition, these lower duties will benefit American consumers and business customers of Bush Boake Allen Inc.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to recognize an old friend and successful businessman on the occasion of his retirement as Chair and CEO of Atlantic Energy, Inc. 
Jerry and I both have strong roots in Paterson, New Jersey. We grew up there, and our fathers worked together in the silk mills. Being from Paterson, of course, we were both destined for success! 
Jerry began working at Atlantic Electric in 1961, first in various managerial positions and then working his way up to Chairman and CEO. Eventually, Jerry rose to the position of Chairman and CEO at Atlantic Energy, the holding company formed in 1987 which incorporated Atlantic Electric. 
Besides Jerry's achievements at work, he has several professional and civic affiliations. He holds everything from memberships to chairmanships in organizations such as the New Jersey Utilities Association, the New Jersey Chapter of the Nature Conservancy, the New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce and the Noyes Museum Board of Directors. 
Again, I congratulate Jerry for his devotion to Atlantic Energy for over 35 years, and I extend my warm wishes to his wife Carol and his three children, Michael Jacob, Melissa Kuperminc and Marlene Sandstrom.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, last week, the Senate overwhelmingly passed S. 1173, the ISTEA II bill. I supported that bill because, while it does not provide for all of New Jersey's highway and transit needs, it is indeed a better, more balanced bill than the one that was originally presented by the Environment and Public Works Committee early last September. Since September, I have managed to secure an additional $120 million in highway funds each year for New Jersey, which brings us near to where we need to be. In addition, the Senate gave strong support to the mass transit title of the bill, which continues the federal government's solid commitment to our nation's subways, buses and commuter rail projects. Mass transit was helped by an additional $5 billion that was provided over the life of the bill. I was pleased to join with Senators D'Amato, Sarbanes, Moynihan and Domenici in announcing this agreement, balancing out the funds allocated to both highways and mass transit. 
During these past few months, I have worked to ensure that federal transportation funding allocated to New Jersey would be enough to meet our state's tremendous infrastructure needs. The original highway title provided adequate funds to most of the United States, but not to all. It simply was not balanced. In short, the bill did not recognize the special needs of high density, high traffic states. Even with an extra $20 million in bridge discretionary funds that the Committee agreed to provide to my state of New Jersey, my state's funding levels would have actually been lower in 1998 than in 1997 despite a 20 percent growth in the overall program. This was unacceptable and I was determined to change that bill. 
New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the nation, and our roads carry more traffic per lane mile than any state in the country. We are a true corridor state. Ten percent of the nation's total freight passes through New Jersey. These conditions create burdens that have an adverse impact on the state's transportation infrastructure, environment, and economic productivity. 
That's why, Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate adopted the High Density Transportation Program which provides funds to states which share these same problems and had not done well in the apportionment formulas used in the underlying bill. 
Mr. President, as we enter the 21st century, with an increasingly global marketplace, one of our most important functions will be to ensure the existence of a seamless transportation system which can carry large volumes of people and goods. But, for now, severe system failures exist in densely populated, urban areas where high volumes of traffic clog the roads and high repair costs impede routine maintenance, not to mention traffic flow enhancement. Roads in these high density States provide invaluable support to the Nation's economy by carrying high value goods and service-providers along essential trade corridors which connect nationally significant ports and economic sectors to the rest of the country. However, the intensity of traffic causes highways in these States to deteriorate rapidly. As a result, crucial portions of the interstate highway system linking all of us are in desperate need of repair. Moreover, costs are extraordinarily high for highway repair and maintenance in these high density States, especially in urban areas. The High Density Transportation Program will address these problems by providing $360 million a year for grants to States that meet specific population density, heavy 
traffic, and high urbanization criteria. Under this program, eligible States, like New Jersey, are guaranteed $36 million a year, but they can qualify for even more. These funds may be used for highway and transit projects. 
Mr. President, the High Density program rounds out New Jersey's funding. Under ISTEA II, New Jersey will receive a hefty increase each year in highway and transit funds over the funding levels in ISTEA I. More specifically, this means ISTEA II will provide $1.05 billion each year for New Jersey's roads, bridges, and mass transit systems. This figure includes an average of $660 million in highway formula funds and an estimated $390 million in mass transit formula funds for New Jersey. By comparison, the bill as introduced last September would have only provided New Jersey with an average of $532 million for highways and $345 million for transit. I have fought hard to improve New Jersey's funding levels, and apparently my efforts paid off. 
The Senate also took a strong stand against drunk driving in this bill. Alcohol is a dominant cause in 41 percent of highway deaths. However, because the Senate adopted my amendment to establish a national drunk driving limit of .08 percent blood alcohol content, I am confident that this grim statistic and the highway death rate in general will improve. Senator DeWine and I fought hard to get this amendment passed, and it did, by a 62-32 vote. This amendment is estimated to save 500 to 600 lives each year. I also worked with Senator DeWine and Senator Warner to develop a provision that the Senate adopted that toughens drunk driving penalties for repeat offenders. And, I was a lead co-sponsor on another important anti-drunk driving measure to outlaw open containers of alcohol in moving vehicles nationwide. Alcohol has no place on our roads and this bill takes a strong stand against drunk driving. 
Mr. President, I was also pleased to see the Senate adopt another amendment I developed to make `ports of entry' eligible for the planning and infrastructure funding authorized for this new trade corridor program. To qualify for funding, a port would have to show that there had been a significant increase in the transportation of cargo by rail and motor carrier through that facility since the enactment of NAFTA. 
The bill also continues our commitment to technology that will increase efficiency and improve safety within our transportation system, by including a comprehensive Intelligent Transportation Systems program, authorized at $1.8 billion over six years, that I helped author with the managers of the bill. Intelligent Transportation Systems hold the promise of increasing capacity and promoting safety through innovative technologies. A recently released report estimated that ITS projects and programs generate a benefit/cost ratio of more than 8:1 for the Nation's 75 largest metropolitan areas. Intelligent Transportation Systems provide cost-effective ways to achieve the Nation's transportation goals of mobility, efficiency, national and international productivity, safety and environmental protection. The bill incorporates ITS into mainstream transportation planning and construction process for all modes at the local, state and federal levels. It also integrates ITS technologies in the Nation's infrastructure, resulting in coordinated ITS systems that benefit the safe and efficient movement of both passengers and freight in localities, states, regions and corridors. I am pleased that the Senate adopted a strong, comprehensive program. 
Mr. President, the first ISTEA emphasized the importance of intermodalism in reducing congestion and improving mobility. One way intermodalism will be enhanced in this bill is through an amendment adopted by the Senate which I strongly supported. This amendment will boost the existing $18 million annual Ferry Program to $50 million for ferry operations around the country. 
Another goal of ISTEA I was the reduction of air pollution and traffic congestion. Protecting the environment remains an important element of federal surface transportation programs under ISTEA II as well. Thus this bill increases the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program funding levels and maintains the enhancements program. This bill also includes an amendment that I authored to establish a `Transportation and Environment Cooperative Research Program,' funded at $5 million a year, that will study the relationship between highway density and ecosystem integrity, including an analysis of the habitat-level impacts of highway density on the overall health of ecosystems. 
I am also pleased that the Senate stated its support for the continuation of a provision that I authored in the original ISTEA that froze longer combination vehicle operations on routes as of 1991. Longer combination vehicles (LCVs) can be longer than a 737 jetliner and can weigh up to 164 tons. Multi-trailer trucks are involved in more serious crashes than single-unit trucks or small tractor-trailer combinations. Although big rig trucks make up only 3 percent of all regulated vehicles, they are involved in 21 percent of all fatal multi-vehicle crashes. The least we can do is maintain the current system and not let LCVs branch out onto roads they aren't already on now. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to support this bill. I will continue to work to ensure that New Jersey is treated fairly in the final bill that will be signed by the President.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I'm pleased that the Senate confirmed the nomination of Judith M. Barzilay to a seat on the Court of International Trade. 
Over the past 16 years, Ms. Barzilay has had a unique mix of experiences that I believe will make her an excellent Judge on this most specialized court. I strongly supported her nomination. 
Ms. Barzilay has worked as an attorney in the field of international law for both the government and the private sector. In the private sector, she also worked as a manager and business advisor. 
Ms. Barzilay began her career in international trade law in 1983 as an attorney with the International Trade Field Office of the U.S. Justice Department in New York City. In that position it was her job to represent the U.S. Customs Service before the Court of International Trade on matters such as import classification and the valuation of imported goods. It was also her job to defend the legality of Customs' seizures and import prohibitions before the court. 
She also represented United States manufacturing interests in fair trade cases. 
In 1995, Ms. Barzilay was appointed by Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin to his advisory committee on Customs Service Operations and was recently reappointed for a second term. 
Currently, Ms. Barzilay is the Vice President of Government Affairs with Sony Electronics, where she handles such cutting edge trade issues as world standards for High Definition Television and the Information Technology Agreement. 
She also sits on the executive board of the American Association of Exporters and Importers and chairs its committee on trade policy. 
Ms. Barzilay's expertise in international law is well known and she has lectured before groups such as The National Association of Manufacturers, The Council on Logistics Management and the World Trade Association of Southern California. 
Although she has a busy professional life, Ms. Barzilay has always found time to do volunteer work in her community. She often speaks at local high schools, educating students on the importance of international trade. She also works as an advisor to the Bergen County, New Jersey, court system in an innovative program that tries to reduce repeat crime by putting juvenile offenders through mock trials. 
When you put it all together, Judith Barzilay will be a welcome addition to the Court of International Trade and I again applaud her confirmation.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have risen on a few occasions before to pay tribute to a good friend and a man I much admire, Larry Doby. And I have excellent cause to do so again. Just last Tuesday, Larry Doby was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, not only for being a great baseball player, but also for being a person of outstanding character and drive. 
On July 5, 1947, Larry Doby became the first African-American to play in the American League with the Cleveland Indians, only 11 weeks after the famed Jackie Robinson stepped onto the major league diamond with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Because Robinson was the first African American to play professional baseball, Larry has often been overlooked as a deserving player of Hall of Fame status. But he is worthy of that distinction beyond the shadow of a doubt. 
I knew Larry when we were both students at Eastside High School in Paterson, N.J. He had already astounded all his observers by his exceptional skill in four sports--baseball, basketball, football and track. We would watch with envy and amazement as he won prize after prize in any of the sports in which he competed. All who knew him believed he would be successful. I was not surprised when he went to the Indians, only disappointed that it didn't happen sooner. He had to wait his turn, but then played with elegance and class. He waited his turn to enter the Hall of Fame, which he also did with same elegance and class. 
Mr. President, Larry Doby did more than play a good game of baseball in the major leagues. Larry swung at racism with every crack of his bat, opening the doors of opportunity to future generations of Americans. 
Larry weathered the racist insults and vicious invectives hurled at him both on and off the playing field as Jackie Robinson did. While traveling, he stayed alone in dingy hotels only for blacks, while the rest of his team stayed together across town. The color barrier had been broken when Larry started playing, but the blockades of prejudice in people's minds against blacks still stand.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the New Jersey Arya Samaj Mandir as it celebrates the Hindu New Year. The New Jersey Arya Samaj Mandir was incorporated to serve the religious, educational, and cultural needs of the Arya and Hindu immigrant population in New Jersey, demonstrating my state's rich and diverse heritage. 
My colleagues may know that the Hindu New Year, called Holi, occurs at the advent of spring and is a time when Hindus focus on the joys of the new season and the passing of the cold, harsh winter. The day also marks a time to emphasize reconciliation, forgiveness, unity, and tolerance. I am glad to be able to contribute to this celebration as New Jersey's Arya and Hindu population gathers with family and friends to mark the coming of spring and another New Year. 
Hindus in our country have contributed a great deal to America's heritage. The strength of our country is built upon the melding of its many languages, customs, and traditions, including those of the Hindu community. Our diversity is a strength. It is important that we celebrate the contribution that Hindu Americans have made to American society.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I join with the cosponsors of this amendment, Senators Warner, Moynihan and Chafee in offering this amendment. This amendment will make so-called `ports of entry' eligible for the planning and infrastructure funding authorized for this new trade corridor program. To qualify for funding, a port would have to show that there had been a significant increase in the transportation of cargo by rail and motor carrier through that facility since the enactment of NAFTA. 
The trade corridor and border crossing program is intended to address the strain on the U.S. transportation system caused by the increase in international trade following enactment of NAFTA. However, in addition to the increase in commercial traffic at border crossings and along highways, other areas, such as ports of entry, are significant trade corridors for the movement of cargo, either by ship, rail or air, since NAFTA. These ports of entry, including the Port of New York and New Jersey, and the Port of Philadelphia/Camden, bears significant infrastructure costs from the increase of this cargo. This amendment would enable ports of entry to compete for funds in the Trade Corridor program. 
In a State-by-State comparison of the total value of international truck shipments through each State, New Jersey ranks third, trailing only New York and Pennsylvania, for total value of international shipments moving through the State. Thus, New Jersey's ports are supporting a significant portion of the Nation's international trade activities and are contributing a great deal to the sound economic status we are now enjoying. However, this increase in trade and traffic is taking its toll on the infrastructure of ports in States like New Jersey. With this amendment, these ports, that are working so hard to support international trade and the U.S. economy as a whole, will be able to apply for assistance. This amendment is a significant step toward addressing the burden of increased international trade on States with very active ports, like New Jersey. 
With this amendment, the trade corridor program will be balanced so that those areas and facilities that have indeed seen increases in cargo shipments will be eligible to compete for these scarce funds.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, as co-sponsor of this amendment and author of the original freeze on longer combination vehicles in the first ISTEA in 1991, I strongly support maintaining this freeze. By adopting this amendment, the Senate will declare loudly and clearly, that the freeze should not be weakened with more exemptions. 
Six years ago, Congress recognized the need to stop the growing presence of big rig trucks on our roads. We included in ISTEA a provision I authored that froze the lawful operation of LCVs to only those routes where they had been operating up until that time. It was the right thing to do then and it's the right thing to do now. 
We, as Members of Congress, have a duty to actively ensure the safety of all our Nation's roads, not just the roads in our individual States. By allowing monster trucks to terrorize our highways are we not failing to fulfill that duty? 
LCVs can be as long as 123 feet (that's longer than a 737 jetliner) and can weigh up to 164 tons. 
If it's raining when one of these trucks passes you, the spray from its 32 sets of wheels can blind you for over a minute. That's a long time when you're driving at 55 miles an hour. It means you can't see anything for over a mile. 
LCVs pose extraordinary safety risks to other motorists. 
Quick lane changes can cause them to exhibit a `crack-the-whip' effect--throwing the last trailer into other traffic lanes, causing the vehicle to roll over, or causing the last trailer to rupture its connections with the truck. In addition, LCVs are big and slow, especially when they have to accelerate. Thus they create dangerous traffic hazards when they have to merge or change lanes. 
They also have difficulty maintaining speed on upgrades, and reducing speed and braking on downgrades. Speed differentials between trucks and other traffic of only 15 miles per hour are known to dramatically increase the risk of crashes, and speed differentials could be aggravated by the recent speed limit increases in many States. 
As a result of all these dangerous features, multi-trailer trucks are involved in much more serious crashes than single-unit trucks or small tractor-trailer combinations. In 1994, over 5,000 people in the U.S. lost their lives in big truck crashes, and more than 100,000 were injured. Although big rig trucks make up only 3 percent of all regulated vehicles, they are involved in 21 percent of all fatal multi-vehicle crashes. 
Clearly these big rig trucks are a deadly menace. 
It's no wonder that of the over 42,000 people polled last summer, 87 percent said they are opposed to permitting the use of even bigger trucks, and 91 percent said large trucks should not be allowed on roads other than major highways. 
Trucking companies are constantly pushing drivers to drive longer and longer hours and heavier and longer trucks to meet ever tighter deadlines. This is a trend that has to stop now. 
And if the safety risks these vehicles impose on everyone else wasn't enough, these big rigs also cause significant damage to our roads and bridges. 
On top of that, they don't even pay their fair share of costs. A recent study found that in virtually all truck classes, the heaviest vehicles pay considerably less in taxes than the costs they impose on our Nation's highway system. For example, LCVs registered at over 100,000 pounds pay only about half their cost responsibility. 
Highway agencies are losing money every mile traveled by one of these vehicles. That will mean poorer roads, higher taxes, or both. To maintain road conditions States must turn to funds from other sources--i.e., gas taxes paid by other motorists. This shifts the cost savings experienced by truck companies, who can hire fewer drivers if they use LCVs, onto other highway users. 
This is outrageous. Not only do other motorists get less return on their highway investment because they have to share the road with these life-threatening juggernauts, they also have to pay more for it. 
The least we can do is maintain the status quo and not let LCVs branch out onto roads they aren't already on now. 
I hope you'll join Senator Bond, Senator Reid and me in maintaining the freeze on LCVs. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise to express my support for Senator Mike DeWine's amendment that would establish minimum standards of punishment and treatment for repeat offenders of drunk driving. These standards will send a strong message that repeated convictions for drinking and driving will not be tolerated. 
We have heard, over the past few days, the extent of the national scourge that is drunk driving in our country. Let me remind you, in 1996, 41,907 people were killed in highway crashes. Another three million were injured. These crashes cost society $150 billion every year. Forty-one percent of all traffic fatalities are alcohol related. 
In 1996, 17,126 people were killed in alcohol-related crashes. That year, more people were killed in alcohol related crashes than were killed in the worst year of the Vietnam War, a war that tore this country apart. 
Driving While Intoxicated, or DWI, is one of the most prevalent crimes in this country. In 1994, more people were arrested for DWI--1.5 million--than for any other reported criminal activity including larceny or theft. We need to start treating this epidemic. 
A shocking number of DWI convictions are repeat offenders. When the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration studied this issue, it found that about one-third of all drivers arrested or convicted of DWI each year are repeat DWI offenders. One out of eight drunk drivers in a fatal crash has had a DWI conviction in the past three years. The danger of these repeat offenders is illustrated by the fact that drivers with prior DWI convictions are over represented in fatal crashes. These drivers have a 4.1 times greater risk of being in a fatal crash, as do intoxicated drivers without a prior DWI, and the risk of a particular driver being involved in a fatal crash increases with each DWI arrest. 
According to the National Commission Against Drunk Driving, about 2,300 innocent victims are killed each year due to so-called persistent drinking drivers, or those who repeatedly drive after drinking. Annually, persistent drinking drivers represent an estimated 65 percent of fatally injured drinking drivers and 15 to 20 percent of all injured drivers. This translates into 7,000 dead drivers and 250,000 injured drivers each year. And, Mr. President, persistent drinking drivers cost the economy $1.5 billion each year in enforcement and court costs and $45 billion each year in crashes. 
One study in California demonstrated the extent of this problem over the long-term. It found that 44 percent of all drivers convicted of DWI in California in 1980 were convicted again of DWI within the next ten years. 
Madam President, when we talk about drunk driving, too often we talk about it in statistical terms. But there are real people attached to those statistics. In the spring of 1995, a young man, from Tuckerton, New Jersey, full of goodness and potential, was struck down by a drunk driver while he and his friend were in-line skating. Matthew Hammell was exceptional. All those who knew him talk about being touched by his kindness and caring. At one point Matt dreamed of being a baseball player, but as he matured he knew he wanted to be a missionary. His dream became living a life of helping others. But this dream never materialized. Robert Hyer, drunk and driving, struck Matthew with his car while passing another vehicle. Hyer should not have been on the road. Not only was he drunk, but he had a history of driving drunk. Before this fateful incident, Hyer had been charged with DWI six times, though he was convicted only twice. Hyer lost his license in New Jersey in 1984, but somehow he obtained a North Carolina License just two years later. He was a habitual offender who kept bucking the system. A system which kept letting him go. A system which, in the end, was too late in responding. 
Madam President, it may be too late for Matthew Hammell, and all of the other Matthew Hammells who are taken from us too early, but it is now that we must become serious about drinking and driving. I introduced a bill one year ago that I named in his honor the `Deadly Driver Reduction and Matthew P. Hammell Memorial Act.' That bill required states to adopt a `three strikes and you're out' law that took away the driver's license. 
While I introduced that bill, I am pleased to say that the amendment proposed by Senator DeWine is a positive step toward combating this terrible epidemic. The amendment before us provides a comprehensive approach toward reducing repeated drinking and driving. 
First, the amendment recognizes that the large percentage of DWI arrestees, from 40 to 80 percent of all offenders, are alcohol dependent, by requiring alcohol assessment and treatment, as necessary, after the second and each subsequent offense. Experts suggest that combining treatment and legal sanctions will produce the largest benefit to traffic safety. It makes sense. 
Second, the proposal requires states to revoke a driver's license for one year after the second and each subsequent offense. Most states already require license suspensions after the first and subsequent offense, and states have found that the threat of taking away one's license has been very effective deterrent for the general population. However, studies have also found that for the chronic drinking driver, license suspensions have very little effect--upwards of 80 percent of drinking drivers continue to drink and drive after license suspension. 
That's why this amendment seeks to employ other methods that will make it difficult for the repeat offender to drive when he or she is drunk, or to drive at all. The amendment requires that, after the second and subsequent offense, the person is subject to vehicle impoundment or immobilization, or the installation of an ignition interlock device on the car. These tools have found to be extremely effective in reducing recidivism of drunk driving. After the City of Portland, Oregon adopted an ordinance to take cars away from repeat offenders, the City saw a 42 percent decrease in drunk driving fatalities, and a recidivism rate of only four percent for offenders whose cars had been seized. 
Ignition interlock devices are those that are locked into a repeat offender's car. Before the person can drive, he or she must blow into the device, and if the device registers more than .02 BAC--or zero tolerance--the car will not turn on. The repeat offender usually is responsible for paying the costs of the device, which is about two dollars a day. Over 35 states have passed some form of legislation that uses ignition interlock devices to combat repeat offenders. According to the NCADD, ignition interlock programs used in several states have reduced recidivism to about one percent while the program is in effect. 
Finally, the amendment requires states to adopt laws if they have not already, mandating jail time or community service for the second (five days in jail or 30 days community service) and subsequent (ten days in jail or 60 days community service) offense. Repeat offenders must know the severity of their crime. 
States are given three years to adopt laws that have, at a minimum, these provisions. States that fail to do so must transfer one and one-half percent of their highway construction funds in the fourth year, and three percent in the fifth year, to their Section 402 impaired driving program, or to the state police, to assist in enforcing drunk driving laws. 
The NCADD has proposed strategies to deal with the persistent drinking driver. I am pleased to say that this amendment incorporates almost all of those strategies. License revocation. Vehicle immobilization or impoundment. Imposition of an ignition interlock device. Alcohol assessment and treatment. Another strategy the NCADD proposes to deal with the persistent drinking driver is to reduce the legal BAC limit to .08 BAC for adults, because studies have shown that .08 BAC laws have reduced drunk driving at even higher BACs. As we all know, the Senate approved that amendment last week. 
Madam President, I want to commend Senator DeWine and Senator Warner on their effective leadership on behalf of this issue. The programs that we have passed--the .08 BAC amendment, Senator Dorgan's open-container amendment, and this repeat offender amendment--create a comprehensive program that when in place, will show measurable effects. We will see a reduction of alcohol-related crashes. Fewer families will face the crippling grief of a loved one lost to drunk driving. 
This amendment matters. I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this comprehensive amendment that will save lives.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Montana. 
Mr. President, I stand here in opposition to the amendment that is being offered. I hope that the Senate will reject this amendment because, despite the best intentions of so many, we still do not have a level playing field when it comes to Government contracting. There is still discrimination. Sometimes it's overt, sometimes it's subtle; but it definitely still exists, and the facts bear this out. 
Consider the following: for transportation construction contracts, minority-owned firms get only 61 cents for every dollar of work that a white male-owned business receives. Unfortunately, it's even worse for women-owned businesses--they only receive 48 cents. This amendment will only exacerbate these numbers. 
I have to take 1 minute, Mr. President, to describe a personal situation. My mother was widowed early in the war. I had already joined the Army, and she went to work for an insurance company, a large insurance company, and she did a good job for 3 years. At the end of that time, they said to her, `Molly, thank you very much, but Joe is back from the Army.' She said, `Well, give me another territory.' They worked in territories at the time. They said, `Well, you know we don't hire women for these jobs.' It was shocking. My mother was shocked, my sister was shocked, and I was shocked, because she did her job and did it perfectly. They said, `We don't hire women for these jobs.' We are past that stage, thank goodness. But the fact is that women, whether it is in salaries or in business, are always operating at a different level than white men. 
Mr. President, there are a few more figures I would like to give. Few are aware that white-owned construction companies receive 50 times as many loan dollars--and I know this having served for a short time on the Small Business Committee--as minority-owned construction firms with the same equity. And women-owned businesses have a lower rate of loan delinquency, yet still have far greater difficulty in obtaining loans. The majority of women business owners have to resort to personal resources, such as maxing out their credit cards, to finance their business. 
Mr. President, we all know what the problems are with the traditional affirmative action programs. But we ought to work to correct them because people who don't have the same advantage, whether it's education or family exposure or a job opportunity, deserve to be able to come into the mainstream of America's economic and cultural life. And if they don't, we know what the problems are. 
Mr. President, Jim Crow laws were wiped off the books over 30 years ago. However, their pernicious effects on the construction industry remain. Transportation construction has historically relied on the old boy network, which until the last decade, was almost exclusively a white, old boy network. 
I do not imply that the individuals running these white-owned companies were racist, rather, I blame the discriminatory laws and practices that shut minorities out of this industry for so many years. 
This is an industry that relies heavily on business friendships and relationships established decades, sometimes generations, ago--years before minority-owned firms were even permitted to compete. In 1982, President Reagan signed into law legislation attempting to put an end to the old boy network. 
That legislation, creating the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, or DBE program, has been a success. 
Mr. President, let me explain briefly what the DBE program does. The Secretary of Transportation sets a nationwide goal for participation by socially and economically disadvantaged businesses in transportation construction contracts. The program does not contain a quota or create a set-aside, but merely sets a goal for states to follow as they wish. 
To their credit, the overwhelming majority of states have chosen to follow or exceed the recommended goal of ten percent. Those states that have opted out of this goal have neither been the recipient of any retaliation nor have otherwise suffered from any adverse consequence. 
Furthermore, states and municipalities are given the flexibility to adjust their goals to reflect the availability of minority and women-owned businesses in their area. 
Who are the participants in the DBE program? They are hungry small businesses that are just trying to get a chance at a Federal contract. These are competitive firms. 
As one of my constituents who participates in the DBE program told me, if a pie is sliced ten times and nine pieces are eaten by a `big guy' and one piece is thrown to ten hungry little guys, you can be certain that those ten hungry little guys are going scramble, shove, kick, and scuffle to get that one piece. 
Congress and President Reagan were right back in 1982 and the Chairmen of both the transportation subcommittee and the full committee were right to continue this program in ISTEA. 
Why do we still need an affirmative action program for federal construction contracts? 
Because we know that the private sector looks to the public sector for leadership on this issue. And we also know that once affirmative action programs stop, the inclusion of qualified minorities, be it in education or in business, drops. We have seen this with law school admissions in California and Texas. We have seen it in state contracting in Michigan and Louisiana. 
I fear this would occur at the federal level and that it would spill over into lower levels of government and into the private sector. 
Mr. President, it would be a shame to allow this to occur. I urge my colleagues to oppose the junior Senator from Kentucky's amendment and I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my friend from North Dakota. 
I stand with Senator Dorgan as a cosponsor of his amendment to require States to adopt this so-called `open container' law. The law will have the practical effect of prohibiting a very dangerous scenario. Just think, it is currently legal in some States to be driving a car with an open bottle of whiskey alongside, or maybe stuck in the cup holder, just an arm's length away from the driver's lips. A car should not be a bar on wheels. 
Mr. President, with the passage of my amendment yesterday, .08, this body cast a vote in favor of drunk driving victims and their families. We can all be proud of that vote. Sixty-two Senators voted to inject a sense of sanity in our drunk driving laws, by defining a person as a drunk driver at .08 BAC. We don't want them to reach that level while they are driving a car. 
This amendment, the National Drunk Driving Prevention Act, is another critical amendment. It makes as much sense as the Zero Tolerance Act, passed in 1995, and .08 BAC. We have to do all we can to prevent drunk driving in this country. Isn't it, perhaps, obvious, that the least we should do, nevertheless, is to prevent the act of driving and drinking to be performed at the same time? 
We have heard, over the past few days, Mr. President, the extent of the national scourge that drunk driving is in our country. I remind those who can hear us, in 1996, almost 42,000 people were killed in highway crashes. Another 3 million were injured. These crashes cost society $150 billion each and every year. Forty-one percent of all traffic fatalities are alcohol related. That means that in 1996, 17,000 people were killed in alcohol-related crashes. Think of what it means. That year, more people were killed in alcohol-related crashes by a significant measure than those killed by firearms, murdered. That year, more people were killed in alcohol-related crashes than were killed in the worst year of the Vietnam war, a war that tore this country apart. The public was in mourning. 
A death at the hands of a drunk driver is just as final as the death at the hand of a gun. Drunk driving deaths are preventable. Acting to stop drunk drivers from driving is sensible and responsible. We have to do more. We cannot rest on past laurels. A vote for the .08 BAC is not the only vote that will reduce drunk driving. Voting for this amendment, authored by the Senator from North Dakota, is just as important. 
Remember: When you are in your car, at the wheel, it is a driver's seat; it is not a bar stool. 
I commend the Senator from North Dakota for his leadership on this and his commitment to the issue. We have learned over these past few days that drunk driving has touched his family personally. I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment, the National Drunk Driving Prevention Act. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the changes that have been made to the ISTEA II bill. This legislation is now much more balanced and fair to all states than the original bill last fall. I want to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Committee, Senator Chafee, and other Senators involved for their assistance in improving this bill. 
I was never happy with the original bill, because it falls way short of addressing New Jersey's growing needs. While the underlying bill recognized the special situation of some states, particularly large, western, low-density states, and those in the Southeast, it did not recognize the unique needs of densely populated, urbanized states with significant passenger, commerce and freight traffic. 
Mr. President, last year, the ISTEA II bill that came to the floor was not regionally balanced and did not recognize the special needs of high density, urban states like New Jersey. 
This amendment includes a program that I authored which is designed to address the needs of high density, urban states. Called the High Density Transportation Program, this new program addresses the special needs of states where high population density and heavy traffic volume create perpetual bottlenecks in the flow of goods and people through our national transportation system, resulting in tremendous wear and tear on the roads and reduced economic productivity. We can all argue over how much money should go to one region or another, but to deliberately leave out factors that allow for consideration for high density, urban states in a major transportation bill is unacceptable. That's what happened in the original bill. 
That's why I am very pleased that the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Chairman of the relevant Subcommittee, agreed to include this new High Density program in the new bill. And that's why this is now a more balanced bill. 
The High Density Transportation Program is a $360 million annual program, distributed over five years. New Jersey will be guaranteed $36 million each year, and will be eligible for more, for projects that reduce congestion, increase mobility, and maintain the infrastructure. Those projects may include construction and maintenance of roads, mass transit, bridges, even bike paths. As long as those projects reduce congestion and improve mobility. 
This program, coupled with the increase in apportionments and the funds the Committee included in the Bridge Discretionary account last fall, show a total highway funding increase for New Jersey of approximately $780 million over the life of the bill. This comes out to an average of about $130 million a year over six years. This increase is on top of the yearly average of $532 million a year the original ISTEA II bill included for New Jersey. 
Mr. President, this proposal is simple. It gives all states an increase, but also accounts for the needs of states that were not fairly accommodated in the original bill. With this new proposal, New Jerseyans can breathe a sigh of relief, since our needs will begin to be met. 
Mr. President, those needs are great. Transportation funding is especially critical in my state. The Garden State is one of the most important links in our nation's transportation system. The most densely populated state in the nation, it also has the highest vehicle density on its roads. Located between two heavily populated metropolitan areas, New Jersey is known as the corridor state, linking commerce and travel to the northeast and the rest of the country. Over 60 billion vehicle miles are traveled on New Jersey's roads annually. The ability of trucks and cars to move freely on New Jersey's roads directly affects New Jersey's economy, as well as the entire region. 
Millions of people have traveled along New Jersey's highways. They travel from the South and West to New York City, Boston and New England. And people in New York and New England travel through New Jersey on their way to places like the Jersey shore, Florida or Washington, D.C. 
But our roads are used for more than just vacations. Every day, 324,000 tons of goods made in New Jersey are transported on New Jersey's roads by 134,000 trucks. 
Many of these trucks are coming from the Ports of Newark and Elizabeth. They are transporting cars and other goods that arrive from countries like South Korea, Great Britain, Germany, Taiwan and Indonesia. The Port of New York and New Jersey is the busiest on the East Coast. 
Despite the critical importance of New Jersey's infrastructure to the nation, it is in dismally poor shape, and it is getting worse by the hour. Nearly 20 percent of New Jersey's interstate mileage is in poor or mediocre condition. And more than 45 percent of our bridges are in deficient condition. 
Mr. President, New Jersey's roads and bridges take an unbelievable pounding. Our hot summers and harsh winters take a huge toll on its infrastructure. Road salt in the winter and ocean salt year round add to the damage. 
In addition, New Jerseyans and those who travel through my state often face untenable congestion. Travelers in both cars and trucks struggle for hours every day with New Jersey's highway stops and starts. And our heavily used roads and bridges are badly in need of additional maintenance. 
Mr. President, the status of New Jersey's transportation infrastructure has a direct effect on the state and region's economic vitality and on every resident's quality of life. But, more importantly, it affects the entire nation's economic vitality. And, the future challenges to that infrastructure are ominous. In the next six years, there probably will be more travel on our roads, more cargo coming into our ports and more rapid deterioration of our transportation infrastructure. 
Mr. President, I seek to educate my colleagues about my State, because I believe that New Jersey should get its fair share. No more, no less. 
Regrettably, last fall's ISTEA bill provided New Jersey with less money in 1998 than it received in 1997. Our transportation needs increase every year, but our funding level went down under the previous ISTEA bill. This was not acceptable. 
The last time I took to the floor to discuss S. 1173, I spoke for nearly four hours about the devastating effects this bill will have for New Jersey's transportation infrastructure. Since then there have been important changes which have greatly improved this bill. New funding has enabled the Environment Committee to ease the pain to some states which were hit the hardest by the original Environment Committee apportionment formulas. 
New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the nation, and our roads carry more traffic per lane mile than any state in the country. New Jersey is the true corridor state. Ten percent of the nation's total freight either originates, terminates, or passes through New Jersey. These conditions create burdens that have a direct negative impact of the state's transportation infrastructure, the environment, and economic productivity. In addition, our high level of urbanization increases the costs associated with road repair and construction. The High Density Transportation Program is established to address those conditions. 
Mr. President, I would like to thank Chairman Chafee for his work on this bill and commend him for his continuing efforts to produce a good and balanced ISTEA reauthorization bill. The Committee's decision to include the High Density program truly improves this bill over last year's. As I said at the Committee mark-up, we may have to nominate Senator Chafee for a peace prize by the time this process is over. 
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Senator Warner and Senator Baucus for all of their hard work and their leadership on this bill. 
I look forward to continuing to work with the Chairman and other Committee members in the coming months as we debate this bill on the Senate floor and in Conference.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are getting to the point where we are going to wrap up this debate. I thank my friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator Mike DeWine, for his support, his commitment, and his work on this issue. He has fought tenaciously to reduce drunk driving. I hope he and I at the end of this debate will be able to shake hands on behalf of the American people and say we have done something good this morning. 
I remind our colleagues, as I listen to the debate, about the issues that I hear being discussed. Frankly, it bewilders me, because I stand next to the picture of a child who was 9 when a drunk driver took her life. I hear discussions of process, that the process is the issue. The process is not the issue. The issue is whether or not we want to say to every American parent, `We have done something more to save, perhaps, your child or your grandchild or your sister or your brother.' That is the issue, and that is, I hope, what the American people are going to say when they look at the vote count and say, `My Senator stood up for life.' 
`My Senator,' on the other hand, they can brag, `proudly, stood up for process.' 
Can you imagine in the homes across America, all the people who are going to be applauding because someone stood up for process? It is outrageous. It cannot be that way. 
In the balcony sit people I have come to know, people I have come to know very well: Brenda, Randy and Stephanie Frazier--mother, father and sister of Ashley. 
I wish I could ask them to speak about their view of process, whether or not they think that process is the thing that we ought to be talking about. Or should we be talking about the loss that they had, that they do not want anyone else to experience. 
Before Senators vote on this amendment, I ask them to think about their children and think about the pain that could come from the loss of a child they know and love. Today we can spare parents across this country, in all 50 States, the grief experienced by the Frazier family. 
Mr. President, I hope that the happy hour is over for drunk drivers. Every year in this country more people are killed in alcohol-related crashes than were killed in our worst year of fighting in Vietnam. And the country stood in national mourning at that time. By lowering to .08 the blood alcohol level at which a person is considered legally drunk, we can save more than 500 lives each year. 
Mr. President, drunk driving is a crime, a crime like assault, like shooting at someone, like murder; and it should be treated with the same severity as other crimes that bring harm or death to another person. We can prevent many injuries and deaths that result from drunk driving by making .08 the national alcohol limit, just like 21 is the drinking age limit across the country. And if we do that, we could save lots of lives, like other westernized countries--like Canada, like Ireland, like Great Britain, Germany and Switzerland. Poland has a .03 BAC, and Sweden .02. 
We can make .08 work in America, if we pass this amendment and declare our opposition to violence on our highways. Because it is at .08 that a person's capacity to function is impaired. Their vision, balance, reaction time, judgment, self-control--this is the level at which they are medically drunk. And if they are deemed medically drunk, we ought to deem them legally drunk, in every State, no matter where they live. 
Mr. President, the alcohol lobby is trying to bottle up this bill. We are not targeting social drinkers. We are targeting drunk drivers. And when you get drunk, it is your business. But when you get drunk and drive, it is our business. We are not asking people to stop drinking. We are not running a temperance society here. We are asking them not to drive if they are drunk.

By enacting this law, we can stand with our Nation's families and prevent the loss of life that tears a family apart. We can stand with the public interest against the narrow opposition of special interests. 
Mr. President, we should do the right thing and pass this amendment. The Washington Post said it this morning in its editorial: The vote is a vote to create `a single, clear certified and effective standard across the country as to what constitutes drunk driving.' 
Let us vote to protect our children, our families--not drunk drivers. And I ask everybody to take one final look at this beautiful child's face before they cast a vote. 
I will yield the floor, but before doing that, Mr. President, I say thank you to my friend and colleague from Rhode Island for his support for this amendment, and also to the Senator from Montana who has been forthright and supportive of this amendment as well.

I submit to Members that there is no penalty too high to permit a child like this to live a full life. No penalty too severe. I think when Senators vote here, that is what they ought to be thinking about--thinking about the people back home and how they will react to a vote they are making here.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I offer this amendment with my colleague from Ohio, Senator Mike DeWine, and I include, as cosponsors, Senator Lieberman, Senator Faircloth, Senator Boxer, Senator Helms, Senator Glenn, Senator Durbin, Senator Feinstein, Senator Bingaman, Senator Moynihan, Senator Hatch, Senator Wellstone, Senator Akaka, Senator Dodd, Senator Kerry from Massachusetts, Senator Inouye, Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Bumpers, Senator Reed, Senator Smith of Oregon and Senator Rockefeller join me as cosponsors in the amendment; and Senator Chafee, the chairman of the committee. And all together, we have 23 bipartisan cosponsors. That is the way it ought to be because this is on behalf of the victims of drunk driving crashes--over 17,000 deaths and about one million injuries each year. 
This amendment, the Safe and Sober Streets Act, establishes the legal limit for drunken driving at .08 blood alcohol content in all 50 States. Establishing .08 as the legal definition of drunk driving is responsible, effective, and it is the right thing to do. This amendment, if enacted into law, will save lives. And it is our moral imperative, as legislators, to pass legislation that will make our communities, our roads and, of course, our families safe. 
This is the logical next step in the fight against drunk driving. It will build on what we started in 1984, when Democrats, Republicans, and President Reagan joined together to set a national minimum drinking age to 21. And since that time, we have saved over 10,000 lives. And contrary to the concern of the restaurant and the liquor business, those businesses have not gone under, like many warned us about at the time. 
Mr. President, the question before us is, should a 170-pound man be allowed to have more than four beers in 1 hour, on an empty stomach, and get behind the wheel of a car? And our answer is, absolutely not. This amendment goes after drunk drivers, not social drinkers. 
And while we are pushing for enactment of this legislation, I have had the honor of getting to know some families who have experienced the ultimate tragedy--the Frazier family from Maryland. Randy and Brenda's daughter Ashley, 9 years old, was tragically killed by a .08 drunk driver 2 years ago. This person's blood alcohol content level was .08. What we are trying to do is to establish the fact that .08 is a dangerous level for people on our roads and highways. The Fraziers have lent themselves courageously to this fight, to enact this .08 BAC level across the land. 
Last March, Randy Frazier issued a call to Congress, a call that I believe captures what this issue is all about. He said, `It is time for leadership and action here in the Congress to draw a safer, saner, and more sensible line against impaired driving at .08. If we truly believe in family values, then .08 ought to become the law of the land. 
Four beers-plus in an hour--now, that is on an empty stomach, Mr. President. That is not casual. That is not a casual level. An empty stomach, four beers in an hour--a 170-pound person is already impaired in their reaction to situations. They 
should not be allowed to get behind the wheel of a car and create a situation that is the antithesis of what we call the protection of the family. 
As we debate this issue, I want each of my colleagues to consider two things: First, ask yourself, have we done enough to combat drunk driving in this country? The answer to that question, in my view, is absolutely not. Second, is a person whose blood alcohol content is .08 percent a threat to themselves and others on the road? And the answer to that one, of course, is a resounding yes. 
Adopting this amendment will simply bring the United States of America into the ranks of most other industrialized nations in this world in setting reasonable drunk driving limits. 
Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, all have a .08 BAC limit. France, Belgium, Finland and the Netherlands have a limit of .05 BAC--half of what we commonly have in our country. Sweden is practically down to zero--.02 BAC. 
We heard today from President Clinton. He is very aggressively supporting this amendment. Other supporters include Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater. They include organizations like the National Safety Council; the National Transportation Safety Board; the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control of the Center for Disease Control; the American Automobile Manufacturers Association; Kemper Insurance; State Farm and Nationwide insurance companies; MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, of course; the American College of Emergency Physicians. 
I had a talk with a physician today at the White House when we presented this BAC .08 bill. And a physician, the head of an emergency room in the State of Wisconsin, told me that emergency rooms are sometimes so filled with drunk drivers who had been in accidents, that they cannot adequately calibrate the blood alcohol testing machine. The room is sometimes so filled from the victim's liquor-stained breath that they had to leave the room to set the calibration on the blood alcohol testing machine. 
Other supporters include the Consumer Federation of America, National Fire Protection Association--the list goes on--Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. But more important than the scores of businesses, health and science organizations, governmental agencies, public opinion leaders, is the support from the families and friends of victims of drunk driving--like, as I mentioned before, the Fraziers. They come from Westminster, MD. They lost their 9-year-old daughter Ashley. 
I have also gotten to know very well some people from New Jersey, Louise and Ronald Hammell of Tuckerton, NJ. They lost their son Matthew who was growing up in the full bloom of life--very positive, doing things for the community and others. He ultimately sought to be a minister, the wonderful young man. He was rollerblading on the other side of the highway from the car that became involved in his death, and that driver crossed over the yellow line dividing the two lanes of traffic, and came all the way to the shoulder and killed this young man, and so early in his life that he had not really yet begun to develop. 
Who opposes this amendment? That is the question we have to ask ourselves. The American Beverage Institute, the National Restaurant Association, the Beer Wholesalers, what is it that they have in mind when they oppose this? They say that `Oh, we're going to lose business,' that you ought to be targeting the chronic heavy drinker. 
Well, we are after the heavy drinker. That is why we have those roadblocks. And it is sometimes very hard to stop those who are so addicted to a substance that they cannot control themselves and wind up harming others. But does that mean that we ought not to bother because some get away with it? We know that we have to have traffic rules, we have to have red lights. Some people do not obey them. But the fact of the matter is, the majority is well-served by having rules that protect the public. 
Organizations, Mr. President, which support this amendment have one thing in mind--the public's interest, the health and safety of our communities and of our roads and of our families. Organizations who oppose this amendment have one interest in mind--they only care about protecting their narrow special interest. 
We have to make that judgment here. Drunk driving continues to be a national scourge that imposes tremendous suffering on the victims of drunk driving crashes and their loved ones. 
In 1996, 17,126 people were killed in alcohol-related crashes. About one million people were injured in alcohol-related crashes. And I point out, Mr. President, that in the worst year of the Vietnam war--an event that scarred the hearts and the minds of people across our country--in 1 year, the worst year in Vietnam, we lost just over 17,000 people. So here, every year, we lose 17,000-plus people in drunk driving crashes. And it compares to the worst year of a war that left our Nation in mourning for many years. 
Every one of these deaths and injuries could have been prevented had the driver decided to call for a ride, hand the keys to a friend, or do anything other than taking that wheel. When that person takes that wheel, it is as if they are carrying a gun. The only question--when is that thing going to go off? It is no different. Murder is murder, and the victim is just as dead whether it comes from a drunk driving accident or whether it comes from the pulling of a trigger. 
Deaths and injuries that are due to drunk driving are not `accidents.' They are predictable and preventable. Every 30 minutes someone in America--a mother, a husband, a child, grandchild, brother, sister--dies in an alcohol-related crash. 
In the United States, 41 percent of all fatal crashes are alcohol-related. Alcohol is the single greatest factor in motor vehicle deaths and injuries. The first step in combating this epidemic is to inject the sense of sanity in our Nation's drunk driving laws and by enacting the Safe and Sober Streets Act. The amendment we have in front of us will go a long way toward reducing the deadly combination of drinking and driving. 
Mr. President, my amendment, which would have the effect of lowering this Nation's tolerance for drinking and driving by 20 percent, is what ought to be considered now. This amendment requires all States to define the point at which a driver would be considered to be drunk as .08 blood alcohol content. Fifteen States already have .08 BAC and would be unaffected by my amendment. My State of New Jersey does not have a .08 BAC, nor does the State of my chief colleague in this, Senator Mike DeWine, from Ohio, who is well aware of that deficiency in the State law. 
Mr. President, .08 is a reasonable and responsible level at which to draw the line in fighting drunk driving. Despite what we are all hearing from special interests and their lobbyists, at .08 a person is drunk and should not be driving. Their reaction is impaired. They can't stop quick enough; they accelerate too fast; they turn too erratically. 
In fact, Congress, in its wisdom, set the limit for commercial motor vehicle drivers at .04 BAC in the 1980s. So, Congress clearly understands the connection between the consumption of alcohol and the critical ability needed to drive a vehicle safely on our highways. 
Mr. President, .08 BAC is just common sense. Think of it this way: You are in your car, driving on a two-lane road at night. Your child is traveling with you. You see a car's headlights approaching. The driver in this case is a 170-pound man who just drank five bottles of beer in an hour on an empty stomach in a bar. If he were driving in Maryland, he would not be considered drunk. But if he were driving in Virginia, he would be. Does it make sense? We should not have a patchwork quilt of laws when we are dealing with drunk driving. 
We had the privilege of hearing the chief of police of Arlington County, VA, today at the White House. He talked about what has happened since Virginia reduced its BAC level to .08. They saw a marked improvement in the reduction of deaths on their highways. Here was someone who had the practical responsibility, the practical knowledge of seeing these victims, of tending to the injured people. He said it works. Let's do it. 
Regarding this amendment, .08 utilizes what sound science and research proves, and interjects some reality in our definition of drunk driving and applies it to all 50 States so someone can't drink more and drive in New York than in New Jersey, or in this case, someone drinking in Maryland and driving to Virginia when their blood alcohol level is beyond .08. 
Mr. President, there are 10 facts that demonstrate the need for this amendment: 
Fact No. 1: Drunk driving continues to be a shameful epidemic that destroys our families and communities: 17,000 deaths each year to drunk driving. Isn't 17,000 too many? Each year in this country more people are killed in alcohol-related crashes than are murdered by firearms. Families and friends of drunk driving victims experience tremendous grief which changes their lives forever. Moreover, deaths and injuries from alcohol-related crashes have an enormous economic impact as well. Alcohol-related crashes cost society over $45 billion every year. 
One alcohol-related fatality is estimated to cost society about $950,000, and an injury averages about $20,000 in emergency and acute health care costs, long-term care and rehabilitation, police and court costs, insurance, lost productivity, and social services. 
The problem exists, and we must do more to reduce drunk 
driving. The American people agree. Reducing drunk driving is the No. 1 highway safety issue for the American people. 
Mr. President, here is a chart reflecting a Lou Harris poll conducted 1 year ago that found that 91 percent of the respondents believe that the Federal role in assuring highway safety is critical. What do Americans consider to be the No. 1 highway safety problem? Fifty-two point nine percent look at drunk driving as the No. 1 highway safety problem; 18.6 percent look at drivers who exceed the posted speed limit by more than 15 miles per hour; 13.7 percent, young or unexperienced drivers; 6.2 percent, elderly drivers; 5.7 percent, highways in poor condition. 
The poll showed the two principal causes of problems on our highways are drunk driving and those who are speeding, with drunk driving overwhelmingly the most feared matter for highway safety. 
Fact No. 2: It takes a lot of alcohol for a person to reach .08, contrary to what most people think and contrary to information being given out by the alcohol lobby. I want to clear this up. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Safety Council, a 170-pound man would have to drink four and one-half drinks in 1 hour on an empty stomach to reach .08 BAC; a female weighing 137 pounds would have to have three drinks in 1 hour, no food, and she is still below .08. The male, at 170 pounds, drinks four drinks and is still below .08. We are not talking about the kind of drinking that is a casual single glass of wine with dinner, contrary to what the lobbyists would have you think. 
Mr. President, people with .08 BAC are drunk. Or as others say, they are blitzed, wasted, trashed, bombed. The last thing they should do is get behind the wheel. We used to use an expression around the country, and I remember hearing it often, `Let's have one more for the road.' That is the last thing that we want to encourage. That is out. That happy hour is long since gone. 
Fact No. 3: Virtually all drivers are seriously impaired at .08 BAC and shouldn't be driving. Here is a chart from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. They say at .08, concentrated attention, speed control, braking, steering, gear changing, lane tracking and judgment are impaired. When you get down to even lower levels, half of what the current level is in 35 States in the country, .05, you are talking about problems with tracking, divided attention, coordination, comprehension, and eye movement. 
We are not looking to abolish social drinking. We are not looking to create a new temperance in society. What we are saying is that .08 is dangerous if you are driving. 
Fact No. 4: The risk of being involved in a crash increases substantially by the time a driver reaches .08 BAC. The risk rises gradually with each BAC level, but then rises rapidly after a driver reaches or exceeds .08 BAC compared to drivers with no alcohol in their system. In single vehicle crashes, drivers with BAC's between .05 and .09 are 11 times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash than drivers with a BAC of zero. 
Fact No. 5: .08 BAC laws have proven to reduce crashes and fatalities. One study of States with .08 BAC laws found that the .08 BAC laws reduced the overall incidence of alcohol fatalities by 16 percent. In other words, the involvement in fatal crashes is pervasive when alcohol is taken before the driver gets behind the wheel. 
This study also found that .08 laws reduced fatalities at higher BAC levels, meaning they had an effect on extremely impaired drivers. Separate crash statistics have confirmed that finding. When the National Highway Traffic Highway Safety Administration studied the effect of .08 in five States--California, Maine, Oregon, Utah, and Vermont--it found significant reductions in alcohol-related crashes in four out of the five States, ranging from 4 percent to 40 percent when compared to the rest of the States with .10 BAC laws. You may hear that there is no `objective evidence' showing that .08 works. We have heard statements like 
that before from the tobacco industry, always declaring it is not proven, it is not sure, and it is not certain, but the person who is dead is dead and the family that is broken-hearted stays broken-hearted for life. 
Fact No. 6: Lowering the BAC limit to .08 makes it possible to convict seriously impaired drivers whose levels are now considered marginal because they are at or just over the .10 BAC, and the judge says, in many cases, `OK, you are at 0.11; listen, watch yourself and don't do it again.' Drinking and driving is a serious offense which should be handled by the appropriate authorities. 
Because .08 BAC laws are a general deterrent and have proven to deter even heavier drinkers from driving, the public has an increased awareness and understanding of what it takes to be too impaired to drive. After Virginia passed the law I mentioned before, not only did traffic fatalities go down but arrests also were reduced. Mr. President, .08 laws are not the problem. They are the solution. 
Fact No. 7: Most other Western countries already have drunk driving laws that are .08 or less. Here are some of the countries: Canada and Great Britain are .08; Australia varies between .05 and .08; Austria, .08; Switzerland, .08; France, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Finland, .05; Sweden, .02. Are we owned by the liquor-producing establishment? Are our families to be governed by rules established by the liquor lobby? I think not. This amendment would bring us into the civilized world when it comes to drunk driving laws. 
Most other countries have adopted these laws because they work. For example, over the past few years France has systematically reduced its legal limit for drunk driving and has seen measurable results. In France, the country that is first in per capita wine consumption, a motorist can have his or her license revoked at .05 BAC and can be jailed if caught driving at .08 BAC. It is estimated that 33 percent of all traffic fatalities in France are alcohol-related. 
Fact No. 8: The American people overwhelmingly support .08. When the question is asked, Would you be in favor of lowering the legal blood alcohol limit for drivers to .08, 66 percent of the males said yes, 71 percent of the females said yes; the female, the mother, the one who inevitably feels most pain in a family when there is a loss, 71 percent said, Please, America, stop this; get the blood alcohol limit down to a sensible point. 
And as we saw even at .05 people's actions are impaired. So what we are doing is the right thing here. We hope we can get the liquor people and some of the restaurant people and beer wholesalers to come on over, join us, and be the kind of corporate citizens that we know you would like to be. 
So NHTSA surveys all show that most people would not drive after having two or three drinks in 1 hour and believe that the limit should be no higher than that which would get them there. 
Fact No. 9: We need a national drunk driving limit. The best approach is the one we employ because it works. This amendment is written the same way as the 21-year-old drinking age law. If the medical and scientific evidence show that a person is impaired at .08 BAC and should not be driving, why should someone be deemed to be drunk in one State but not the other? If they cross the State boundary and kill somebody, that person is just as dead, and that family is just as wounded. This bill will save lives, and it is a much more compelling argument than any other. 
As President Reagan said when he signed the 21 minimum drinking age bill into law, `We know that drinking, plus driving, spells death and disaster . . . The problem is bigger than the individual States . . . It's a grave national problem, and it touches all our lives. With the problem so clear-cut and the proven solution at hand, we have no misgivings . . .' President Reagan, who was strictly a person who liked to limit Federal power, said that. `. . . we have no misgivings about this judicious use of Federal power.' 
Sanctions, which is what we are proposing, work and soft incentives do not work. Since .08 BAC laws were part of the incentive grant program in 1993, only a handful of States have adopted .08. Incentive grant problems are the alcohol industry's best friend because they rarely have positive effects. Most telling, no single State lost highway funds as a result of the 21 drinking age law, and we expect no State to lose highway funds from the zero tolerance law. Some initiatives are important enough to employ that tool. 
Fact No. 10: Based on past history, adopting .08 will not hurt the economy. There is no evidence that per capita consumption of alcohol was affected in any of the five .08 BAC States examined by NHTSA. A different, four-State analysis conducted by several alcohol industry organizations showed virtually no effect on overall consumption. 
In the alcohol industry analysis, Maine, which adopted .08 in 1988, saw a slight dip in alcohol consumption in 1988, but restaurant sales actually increased 11 percent. Restaurants and the alcohol industry should support this bill because they care about their patrons. They don't want to hear about someone who just left their establishment and wound up killed on a road a few miles away. I don't care how much somebody drinks. They can drink until they fall off the bar stool; but just don't get behind the wheel of a car. This is a reasonable amendment. 
We are not talking about prohibition. Remember, when you are in a bar and look at a table full of people, .08 applies to only one of those people--the driver. 
As my colleagues read the materials disseminated by the opponents of this measure, you have to think to yourself, is .08 the right or the wrong thing to do? You can only have one conclusion if you care about your constituents. Don't get tangled up in whether this is too broad a reach for the Federal Government. Is it too broad a reach when the Federal Government saves lives, or when the Federal Government enacts environmental legislation that takes lead out of public buildings? Is it too much of a reach when the Federal Government posts warnings about air quality? Not at all. So don't get fooled by the alcohol lobby's machinations out there, saying, `You can't prove it. It's not so. You should work on the chronic alcoholic.' Yes, we want to work on the chronic alcoholic, but we want the casual drinker, someone who doesn't realize that when they get to .08, they are in dangerous territory 
when they get behind the wheel. So I hope my colleagues will all join in and support this amendment. 
Consider what the Wall Street Journal said:  
Safe alcohol levels should be set by health experts, not the lobby for Hooter's and Harrah's. The Lautenberg amendment isn't a drive toward prohibition, but an uphill push toward a health consensus. 
Mr. President, the Senate has heard my policy arguments. The facts are on our side. I want all Senators to weigh those facts carefully. But I also want them to think about one other issue--not a fact, but a person. I want them to think about the Ashley Fraziers in their State. The child in this photograph was 9 years old. We heard her mother and father talk about her today. This accident took place about 2 years ago. They still mourn every day. When her mother Brenda talked about Ashley, she said they still set a table for four, even though they know there are only going to be three people sitting at that table, because they don't want to forget Ashley. Ashley was killed by a woman, underage, driving with a .08 blood alcohol content. Mr. President, I hope that Senators and the American people can see this child, because there isn't any one of us who is a parent or a grandparent who doesn't so treasure the life of a child like this that we would give our own lives to protect her. We are not being asked to give our lives; we are being asked to give our judgment, we are being asked to give our support. 
Two years ago, Ashley's parents heard a noise and saw a sight that they will never forget. She said this morning at the White House, in the presence of the President, that they want to make sure that this never happens to other people. They were unselfishly baring their souls, anguish, and grief to prevent the possibility of someone they don't even know from losing a child like this beautiful young girl. This was a tragedy. Stop and think about the senseless death of this 9-year-old. It pulls our heartstrings, all of us. I ask all Senators to think of this when they vote on this amendment. Think of a family's pain when they lose a child, a loved one, and help us to try to prevent this from happening again. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Lautenberg-DeWine amendment to keep drunk drivers off the roads and keep them away from our kids. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to praise my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have fought long and hard to get campaign finance reform legislation on the Senate floor. Like them, I have fought hard for progressive campaign finance reform legislation since I have been in the Senate. 
Regrettably, opponents of campaign finance reform are once again using parliamentary tactics to try to block passage of the McCain-Feingold campaign reform legislation. This is unfortunate because a majority of the Senate favors the McCain-Feingold proposal. 
Because of the steadily growing amount of money spent on political campaigns and its adverse impact on public attitudes and governing, achieving the goals of McCain-Feingold is of paramount importance. McCain-Feingold would ban `soft money,' the very large, unregulated contributions that individuals, corporations and labor unions have been making in ever greater amounts to political parties. Under existing election laws, these contributions are permitted to promote general political party activities, such as voter registration, voter education and efforts to encourage voters to turn out on election day. 
However over the past several years, these large soft money contributions have become a means of donors and parties circumventing limits on campaign contributions to individual candidates. The two national political parties and state parties have used these funds to purchase TV ads that specifically mention candidate names and essentially amount to advertising by political parties or groups on behalf of individual candidates with money that the candidates cannot use themselves for this purpose. Advocacy ads of this nature, fueled by large and undisclosed contributions, are a means of circumventing campaign finance restrictions on the size of contributions to individual candidates. 
I support limits on very large campaign contributions to candidates, in order to prevent undue influence by special interests on those who govern. The McCain-Feingold bill would uphold existing limits by banning soft money and requiring that independent expenditures for so-called issue advocacy advertisements by political parties or advocacy groups deal exclusively with issues, rather than being designed to persuade the public about a particular candidate. McCain-Feingold re-defines `express advocacy' as any broadcast television or radio communication that mentions the name of a Federal candidate within 60 days of an election. Parties and groups that meet the new guidelines would be required to finance their ads in accordance with Federal election laws. 
This reform does not stifle free speech. It just closes a loophole that has developed in our election laws which permits unlimited, soft money expenditures to be made to buy advertisements for or against specific candidates. The bill does not in any way prevent groups or parties from publishing scorecards or voter guides. 
Mr. President, I am and have always been a staunch advocate of free speech and very protective of First Amendment rights. I agree with legal scholars that the McCain-Feingold bill does not restrict free speech, but is important for reducing the influence of big, special interest money in our campaigns and political system. The amount of money now flowing through our electoral system is enormous and breeds a deep cynicism in the public. We need to break the choke of special interest money on the nation's Capitol and restore America's faith in our election system. 
The McCain-Feingold bill will help cleanup American politics. It will ban unlimited, unregulated soft money that is compromising our electoral system. It will also make other improvements in our election system. For example it will begin to regulate shell 
organizations that exist to circumvent existing campaign laws. Many of these front organizations claim that they are independent but they are not. They are simply tools of the political parties and special interests and are primarily engaged in electioneering. 
In 1997, political parties raised $67 million dollars in soft money--more soft money than ever before raised in a non-election year and more than double what was raised in 1993. The largest single soft money check written in the last half of 1997 was for $250,000 to the Republican National Committee. And who wrote this check? Phillip Morris. 
Does anyone in the Senate believe that allowing tobacco companies to write unlimited checks to political parties is a good idea? Especially at a time when Congress is considering comprehensive tobacco legislation? 
Congress is now considering legislation that could mean that the tobacco companies would have to forgo billions of dollars of profits. Yet while we debate possible special legal protections for this outlaw industry, our campaign finance system allows them to write unlimited checks to our political parties. This is wrong. 
Mr. President, last year, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee held hearing after hearing about the problems associated with soft money. We all witnessed the disturbing testimony and all of the abuses that were prevalent in both parties during the 1996 election. 
Now we have a chance to do something about soft money. Unfortunately, some of the same Senators who were highlighting the problems associated with soft money last year in Committee hearings, are now the ones filibustering the McCain-Feingold bill that will get rid of soft money. This is tragically ironic. 
We must continue the fight to clean up our political system. The American people believe that our political system is corrupt and we need to clean it up. 
Mr. President, I urge the Republican leadership to let us have a full debate on campaign finance reform. Let us vote on McCain-Feingold and the Senate will pass it and the President will sign it. 
So, I urge my colleagues to reject these parliamentary tactics to kill the McCain-Feingold bill and allow it to become law. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to speak in strong support of the HEALTHY Kids Act, which was introduced by Senator Conrad. Senator Conrad chaired our tobacco task force, on which I served as vice chairman, and I thought, as did most on our side, that he did an incredibly thorough job in researching the issues and hearing from the various affected parties. 
Mr. President, this bill today reflects the consensus of our task force. It is the vision of the Senate Democrats and has cosponsors from all sectors of the Democratic Party. Although some of us differ on certain specific points, all of us who are cosponsoring this legislation agree that this bill contains the right approach to tackling the devastating health problems that come from smoking cigarettes. 
At the heart of this proposal is a per pack price increase of $1.50. This price increase will be phased in over three years and then indexed to inflation to maintain a deterrent effect on youth smoking. 
I am particularly pleased, Mr. President, with this aspect of the HEALTHY Kids Act because it was adopted from a bill I introduced last year, the Public Health and Education Resource Act, which is S. 1343. 
I believe now--as I did then--that if we are serious about reducing teen smoking, we have to increase the price swiftly and dramatically. It seems to have the most deterrent effect of all measures on youth because when the price goes up that far they cannot afford to pick up the habit, for which we are grateful. 
This bill also includes much of the bill that Senator Kennedy sponsored, and that I had the opportunity to support as a cosponsor, again representing the views of several of our Members to be included in this consensus package. 
The focus of any tobacco legislation must be on improving the health of future generations of Americans, and this bill accomplishes that very clearly. In addition to funding various programs that will reduce teen smoking and benefit the well-being of children, it provides unfettered FDA jurisdiction. As the President has stated many times, full FDA power over these deadly products is essential. 
Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Budget Committee I am also pleased that this bill is consistent with the President's budget proposal. Both approaches recognize that comprehensive tobacco legislation requires a strong investment in America's children. Our approach keeps children away from this addictive product, improves their health, provides adequate child care and gives them a learning environment that fosters health and knowledge and progress. 
That is a real investment in our children, and that is the focus of the Healthy Kids Act. 
Mr. President, I often hear that we in Congress cannot pass any legislation that the tobacco industry does not first agree to support. They speak as if Big Tobacco has some sort of veto right over legislation affecting their industry. 
I must tell you. I fail to find in the Constitution of the United States--or in any of the Senate rules--any provision that gives them the right to veto legislation. The Congress not only has a right--but a duty--to rein in on an industry that has been out of control targeting our children for addiction and lying about the dangerous nature of their products. 
Mr. President, there has also been a great deal of talk about providing special protection against liability to this industry. First of all, one must question why in the world this industry, which has engaged in more corporate misconduct than any other, deserves unprecedented special protection from civil liability. 
Secondly, this industry continues to this day to hide from the public critical information about tobacco's effect on our health. Congress shouldn't even consider limited civil liability protections until we have full and absolute disclosure from the companies. It is time for them to stop hiding behind false claims of privilege and come clean with the American people. 
Mr. President, this bill, the Healthy Kids Act, presents Congress with a historic opportunity. I welcome, very sincerely, my friends from the other side of the aisle to cosponsor this bill, to work with us, as I know that they want to, to question perhaps the methodology or process. But I hope that won't stand in the way. We both want to save children's lives. We want to invest in their future. It has to be a bipartisan goal. I expect that many of our friends on the Republican side will join us at some point. 
Mr. President, as can be expected in any omnibus legislation, some Senators will disagree on specific provisions of the bill. In fact, I have some reservations about certain provisions of this act, such as the secondhand smoke restrictions, which I believe could be tougher. But I ask all of my colleagues to keep their eye on the big picture--reducing tobacco's seductive grip on our kids. 
Their target--it is very clearly understood--is to get 3,000 kids a day to start smoking because they know once you start it is hell to try and stop. And we don't want to permit them to get a grip on our children, on their lives, on their health, or on their habits. 
So, Mr. President, I hope that we will be working together in a bipartisan way. We will make this happen if we can possibly do so. And I invite all of our colleagues to join us. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to repeal a 1996 law that requires the Navy to maintain two antiquated battleships in its reserves, even though they will never again see even one more day of battle. This provision requires the Navy to maintain two Iowa-class battleships as mobilization assets, even though the Navy will never again rely on them to protect American interests. 
The Iowa-class battleships were commissioned during World War II. They were built at the request of President Franklin Roosevelt to be the American Navy's fastest battleship, and their 16-inch guns were designed to pummel our adversaries' shores. There is no doubt that these battleships are of significant historical importance to the American military heritage. They represent America's pride in its Navy. They symbolize our admiration for those who worked so hard to build and serve aboard our battleships. 
In 1995, the Navy determined that all four of the World War II era Iowa-class battleships in its arsenal--the USS Iowa, USS New Jersey, USS Missouri, and USS Wisconsin--were no longer essential to our national defense. Subsequently, the Navy struck these four ships from the Naval Vessel Register. The laws governing the disposal of ships stricken from the Register allow the Navy to donate these ships to states, local communities, and non-profits for display as memorials and museums. Thus, in 1995, the Navy was set to begin the process of donating all four ships. 
But the Senate Armed Services Committee disagreed with the Navy's decision to release these ships, the Committee included a provision in the fiscal year 1996 Defense Authorization Act mandating that the Navy maintain at least two of the Iowa-class battleships on the Naval Vessel Register. The Navy subsequently chose the USS New Jersey and the USS Wisconsin to comply with this provision. The bill I am introducing today would repeal this requirement, enabling the Navy to once again strike these ships from the Register and make them available for donation to interested communities. 
Mr. President, I hope the members of this distinguished body will approve my proposal to repeal this law. It makes sense from a national defense perspective. Navy Secretary Dalton has said that the Navy has no plans to reactivate these ships. In a recent letter to the Appropriations Committee, he wrote, `the Navy does not intend to return the ships to service. . .' They will never again fire their 16-inch guns to support an amphibious landing or operation ashore. They will never again serve as a platform for surface fire-support. Instead, they will only continue to sit, mothballed at Naval ports, awaiting a call to duty that they will never hear. 
This bill also makes sense from a fiscal perspective. According to Navy estimates, the cost of maintaining these ships is approximately $200,000 per ship per year. To date, the Navy has already spent close to $1 million to mothball ships that will never again be reactivated for purposes of national defense. I see no sense in the federal government's paying for the Navy to keep ships ready for a war in which it will never call them to serve. The American taxpayer deserves a better deal. 
Although these ships have been deactivated for good, they can still continue to be of immense public benefit. On the eve of the twenty-first century, many of our nation's waterfront cities are struggling to resurrect their economies. The federal government spends millions each year on projects to help revitalize blighted waterfront communities. Since the laws governing the disposal of former Navy assets allow their donation, we are presented with a unique opportunity to contribute to the economic development of our cities--at no further cost to the federal government. Many of our communities want to compete to berth a ship on their shores, as a museum and memorial, to anchor a waterfront development project. But the 1996 law is depriving these communities of a chance to undergo major revitalization efforts. 
The citizens of New Jersey recognized the economic development potential of these battleships many years ago. My constituents have been preparing for the return of the USS New Jersey as the only Iowa-class battleship which may be berthed as an educational museum and memorial in her namesake state. Tens of thousands of volunteers have devoted countless hours to this long-standing, state-wide project. The New Jersey legislature created the Battleship New Jersey Commission, which has undertaken an ambitious fundraising effort to obtain the USS New Jersey. To date, the Commission has secured approximately $3 million for this effort through sales of a `Battleship New Jersey' license plate, a state income tax check-off, and private donations. But New Jersey's efforts are hamstrung by the 1996 law requiring the Navy to maintain the Iowa-class battleships on the Naval Vessel Register. 
Repealing this law will have a three-fold public benefit. First and most obvious, we will no longer need to provide funding in our defense budget for ships that will never be reactivated. This alone warrants the support of my proposal. Second, we will contribute to the economic development of our cities at no further cost to the federal government. And third, we will enable generations of Americans to honor the history of our battleships by facilitating their display as memorials and museums. 
Forcing the Navy to keep the Iowa-class battleships ready for war is the equivalent of forcing NASA to keep the Apollo rockets ready to blast off into space. As we all know, the Apollo project was undertaken to send Americans to the moon. Will we ever want to send an American to the moon again? Probably--but not in an Apollo rocket. Even though advances in technology have rendered the Apollos relics of the American determination to succeed, their preservation at locations throughout the country allows the public to admire and appreciate their legacy. And NASA doesn't have to keep paying for them. 
Mr. President, I look forward to working with the members of the Armed Services Committee to pass this bill. It is good for the American taxpayers and our national defense, and I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be placed in the Record.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to voice my opposition to this bill. 
Mr. President, I certainly have respect for our former President, Ronald Reagan. I served in the Senate during his two terms as President and we worked together on many pieces of legislation. One of my proudest achievements was the passage of the national minimum drinking age bill that established a national drinking age of 21. 
That law, which President Reagan proudly signed, is credited with saving nearly 1,000 young lives each year. I am thankful to President Reagan for being a part of that fight. While I did not agree with him on a number of other issues, I do respect him and believe his legacy is a powerful one. 
However, Mr. President, Washington National Airport in Alexandria, is already named after a great American--George Washington, our first president. George Washington's role in our nation's history and in this area's history is rich and well documented. 
George Washington, the father of our country, the man who led our troops against the powerful British army, the man who chaired the Constitutional Convention, the man who lived a short 15 miles away at Mount Vernon in Virginia, certainly does not deserve to have his name stripped from the airport, and replaced by another, which this bill would effectively do. If this legislation passes, most people will refer to it as Ronald Reagan airport, and President Washington's name will rarely be associated with this facility again. 
Mr. President, a short time ago, Congress named the second largest federal office building in the nation--second to the Pentagon--after Ronald Reagan. 
Naming the Federal Triangle Project in downtown Washington the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center is a fitting tribute to President Reagan, who signed the authorization for that project into law, and who believed strongly in free trade. In the wake of honoring President Reagan with that naming, this bill is not necessary. 
Mr. President, I have other concerns with this legislation, and I believe that those issues would also concern President Reagan. 
There is a serious question as to whether it is appropriate for Congress to change the name of Washington National Airport. The bill would impose Congress's will upon the local authorities by forcing them to change the airport's name. This would be done with no input from the local communities. No hearings. No votes. No discussion. No opportunity for public comment. Simply put, the airport authority must adopt the name as determined by Congress, the federal government. This clear mandate from the federal government, imposed on the local communities, is precisely what President Reagan would object to. 
His legacy is clear on this matter. We should not offend that legacy in an attempt to honor the man himself. 
I am not ruling out any legislation with respect to this issue, but the underlying bill will have to be improved before I will vote for it.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to discuss the report pending that should come over from the House of Representatives in the next while on the appropriations bill that relates to the Commerce, State, Justice Departments. And part of what is in this report that we expect to see relates to the importation of surplus military weapons that were manufactured in the United States and, many years ago, were sent abroad as part of our military assistance program. 
Now, although there was initially no bill or report language on the issue in either the House or the Senate bills before conference, the issue has nevertheless consumed an enormous amount of time over the past few weeks, and it has generated some significant controversy. I have had a deep interest in this subject because I believe that when we load this society of ours up with more guns, we ought to know why we are doing it. 
It has been the policy of three administrations--Reagan, Bush, and now the current Clinton administration--to ban foreign governments from exporting to our shores and selling these American-made military weapons that we gave or sold them at sharp discounts to help us fight common enemies, and sell these weapons to the U.S. commercial markets. 
Nonetheless, the National Rifle Association and the gun importers supported an attempt--in the dark of night, I point out--to slip a provision into the conference agreement on this bill to overturn this longstanding policy and allow military weapons made for military use to flood America's streets. 
The administration strongly opposed this attempt. In fact, the President's senior advisers, at one point, said they would recommend that the President veto the bill--this important bill--to finance our Justice Department, our State Department, and our Commerce Department--if it included an amendment to allow foreign governments to export large quantities of military weapons for commercial sale in America's cities and towns. They don't restrict whose hands these fall into.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Fortunately, Mr. President, the provision was not included in the conference agreement that the Senate will consider later this evening and these dangerous military weapons will not flood our streets. This is a huge victory for the American people. 
Mr. President, the weapons at issue were granted or sold to foreign governments, often at a discount, through military assistance programs, and some were given to or left in foreign countries during wars. They are called curios or relics because they are considered by some to have historic value or are more than 50 years old. 
One of them I carried in World War II when I was a soldier in Europe. It was an M-1 carbine. It may be a curiosity now or a relic. But I can tell you it was there to be used for my protecting myself or to kill the enemy. Fortunately, neither happened. But I carried it by my side when I served on the European Continent. 
But they are not innocuous antiques or museum pieces. They remain deadly weapons. 
Proponents of allowing the importation of these weapons argue that they are historic firearms that are not dangerous. In fact, the amendment would have flooded the market with millions of lethal killing weapons. 
Under the amendment that was rejected, 2.5 million, semiautomatic military weapons--including the M-1 carbine, M-1 Garand, and M-1911 pistol--would have flooded the streets. The M-1 carbine can easily be converted into an illegal, fully automatic weapon. 
These semiautomatic military weapons may be old, but they are lethal. Thirteen American police officers have recently been murdered with M-1's and M-1911's. 
In New Jersey in 1995, Franklin Township Sgt. Lee Gonzalez was killed by Robert `Mudman' Simon during a routine stop. Simon was a Warlocks motorcycle gang member. Simon, who had just committed a robbery, shot Gonzalez twice, once in the head and once in the neck, using an M-1911 semiautomatic pistol. That's the same weapon that would be imported under the rejected amendment. 
In Texas in 1991, Pasadena police officer Jeff Ginn was killed with an M-1 carbine. He was responding to a call about smoke coming from a house in the neighborhood he was patrolling. Ginn found Marvin Harris holding a woman hostage in her own home. When he saw police officer Ginn, Harris shot him in the leg. Ginn hobbled to the front of the house, where he leaned up against a tree, begging not to be shot again. Harris murdered officer Ginn by shooting him in the temple and the abdomen with the M-1 carbine. 
In New Hampshire--the home State of the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Judd Gregg, who knows only too well of the impact of the use of that weapon--Sgt. James Noyes of the New Hampshire State Police was killed in the line of duty with an M-1 carbine in 1994. 
And there are many innocent civilians who have been threatened and murdered with these weapons as well. In 1995 and 1996, M-1's and M-1911 weapons were traced to more than 1,800 crimes nationwide. Already, nearly 1,000 crimes have been traced to these weapons in 1997. 
Allowing the importation of large numbers of these killer weapons would undermine efforts to reduce gun violence in this country. 
And everybody would like to have that done. I can tell you. It doesn't matter what State or what kind of community--rural or urban. That is the biggest fear that people have; that is, that they will lose a loved one to a violent act, or someone will pick up a gun, or either randomly or directly shoot one of their children, brother, sister, mother or father. 
This would also reduce the cost of weapons, because there would be a marketplace filled with 2.5 million--the maximum capacity for exportation--making them more accessible to criminals. 
It would also provide a windfall for foreign governments at the expense of the U.S. taxpayer. The weapons were paid for by the American taxpayer and were provided to foreign governments through our assistance program. The market value of the 2.5 million that can be traced to foreign governments exceeds $1 billion. 
That adds insult to injury. 
Allowing millions of U.S.-origin military weapons to enter the United States would profit a limited number of arms importers and would not be in the overall interest of the American people. These weapons are not designed for hunting or for shooting competitions; they are designed for war. Foreign countries should not be permitted to sell these weapons on the commercial market for profit. 
There is no doubt foreign governments would make a handsome profit from their sale in the commercial market. Consequently, countries that the United States assisted in times of need, such as South Korea and the Philippines, and even a country like Iran could make a profit out of these sales. Imagine permitting weapons to be imported into this country that would send dollars back to Iran. It is an outrage. 
In lieu of approval of an amendment to import these weapons, the administration is being asked to provide a report on the curios or relics issue. The report will provide information about the quantity of applications and articles that have been approved for importation as well as an estimate of the number of firearms available for importation from overseas. It will also explain how an M-1 carbine can be converted into an illegal machinegun or assault weapon. 
I have no problem asking the Government to prepare a report for the use of the House or the Senate. But I would like to make sure that this is a balanced report, that it doesn't simply list statistics. But I want to explain why it is important for the President and Secretary of State to retain their authority to retain control over firearms granted or sold by the Government exclusively for foreign military use and never intended for private use. 
I would also encourage the administration when it submits a report to include information about applications in the Bush and Reagan administration as well. After all, this administration is upholding a policy that was first established by President Reagan and upheld by the Bush administration. 
I believe the administration should include in the report a description of any law enforcement or grand jury investigations of alleged illegal conduct related to the importation of M-1 or M1911 firearms. A grand jury previously investigated one attempt to import these weapons by a company with a peculiar name called Blue Sky. There were serious allegations that the law was manipulated for personal gain, and the investigation ended when the lead witness mysteriously died in a plane crash. The American people have the right to understand what happened in this inquiry. 
The report I believe also--this is an expansion on what is in the report requested of the administration. It is something I didn't agree with. But we are at a very late point in time when these bills have to be considered. So we have accepted this report against, frankly, my best judgment. 
The report also should provide an analysis of the number and types of weapons that have been added to the curios or relics list since 1980, the process by which those weapons are added to the list, and the entities that have petitioned to have weapons added to the list. The American people have the right to understand more about the way military weapons are designated as curios and relics. 
Finally, I believe it should include a comprehensive overview of the number of homicides and violent crimes committed against police officers and against civilians with M1's or M1911's, regardless of the manufacturer, or any other firearm on the curios or relics list. Though curios and relics may have some historical interest for collectors, many of these firearms remain of concern due to crime. 
Mr. President, I am delighted that this effort to overturn U.S. policy behind closed doors in the dark of night was defeated. And just to clarify, for the information of those who might not understand our arcane way of operation, there is a bill, and in the bill there is a mandate that certain things be done. Report language is suggested on top of that bill but does not have the effect of law. That is what I am talking about here--this report language, not the bill itself. 
I am delighted, again, that this effort to overturn U.S. policy behind closed doors was defeated. It would have been an insult to the American people to overturn a longstanding policy behind the closed doors of the Appropriations Committee. 
I have introduced legislation, S. 723, to repeal a loophole in the Arms Export Control Act that could enable these weapons to enter the country under a future administration. I hope that my colleagues will support this bill. 
In the meantime, Mr. President, this is a victory for the American taxpayer and a victory for all concerned about safety. 
I hope we reject the notion that we ought to take back and pay for things that we gave away, or that we sold at sharp discounts. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the work of Straight and Narrow, a non-profit organization headquartered in Paterson, New Jersey, which has been a pioneer in the field of substance abuse treatment with impressive results. 
Straight and Narrow serves more than 750 people a day, almost all of them poor. Its services cover the whole spectrum of the substance abuse field, from effective prevention services for young people to treatment of the chemically dependent. Straight and Narrow's programs have been proven to deliver effective treatment at a significantly lower cost per patient than most treatment programs. National studies of Straight and Narrow's work have concluded that its results have far exceeded those of other approaches to substance abuse treatment. 
Straight and Narrow is currently working in conjunction with the New Jersey Department of Corrections and the National Development and Research Institutes [NDRI] on a research and demonstration proposal to develop a national model of Straight and Narrow's approach to substance abuse treatment. This proposal includes clinical trials of the use of patient work combined with psychological counseling, family therapy, education, job training, and after care for treatment of substance abusers from disadvantaged backgrounds, including non violent prisoners. 
Mr. President, I am proud of Straight and Narrow's accomplishments in New Jersey, and I believe that it would be most advantageous for the Federal Government to assist in the development of a model for the implementation of Straight and Narrow's programs on the national level. I believe that Straight and Narrow's proposal is one that the Department of Justice should seriously consider supporting, and I hope the Department will give this proposal serious consideration.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Equity and Public Involvement in Superfund Act of 1997 [TEPI]. 
Hazardous sites, the legacy of our industrial growth, litter the landscape across America. Many of those sites are toxic and pose real threats to the groundwater, the air and our water, and accordingly, our health and the health of the environment. The worst of those sites are so foul and so polluted that they are beyond the capacity of most States to handle. These sites, placed on the national priorities list for clean up under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation, and Liability Act commonly known as Superfund can take years to clean up and cost tens of millions of dollars to clean up. They are ticking time bombs that threaten the health and survival of entire communities. 
Over the years the hazardous waste clean up program has been heavily criticized as being too slow, involving too much litigation and too expensive. Congress addressed many of those problems in 1986, and Administrator Carol Browner of the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] has instituted many reforms to speed up the cleanup program. The results are dramatic. EPA has completed cleanup construction at 498 sites and more than 500 additional sites are in construction. Taxpayers have saved $12 billion because polluters responsible for these sites are performing or funding approximately 70 percent of Superfund long-term cleanups. But, problems remain, partly because big corporate polluters are using the present law to drag tiny merchants and other parties who are minor polluters, or innocents who merely sent solid waste to a municipal landfill, into expensive lawsuits. 
A recent story televised by `60 Minutes' on the Keystone landfill in Pennsylvania showed the scope of the problem. The story centered on Barbara Williams, the owner of the Sunny Ray Restaurant in Gettysburg, PA, who was being sued by the sites' toxic polluters for $75,000 because of the mashed potatoes she sent to the dump. Tiny gift stores, and other small businesses were dragged into a Superfund suit because they had sent regular trash to the Keystone Landfill.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation with Senators D'Amato, Moynihan, and Torricelli that addresses the growing problem of cargo theft. This crime, which covers the interstate theft of cargo from ports, airports, rails, and roads, causes losses as high as $10 billion a year in the United States. The `Cargo Theft Deterrence Act of 1997' increases the incentive for prosecutors to pursue this crime and for defendants to cooperate with law enforcement. Furthermore, this legislation clarifies what is covered by existing law. 
Cargo theft continues unabated as criminals discover that the risks of getting caught and prosecuted are far lower than for comparably lucrative crimes. This tends to be an under-reported crime that has received a relatively small amount of attention by Congress. I believe this must change. Mr. President, let me cite a few statistics that should demonstrate to my colleagues the seriousness of this crime and why we should act. In 1994, the dollar value in goods stolen from a single tractor-trailer rig in New Jersey was higher than all of the bank robberies combined in my state for that year. 
While certain regions of the United States, such as New Jersey/New York, Southern California, and South Florida, sustain higher cargo theft losses than others, consumers nationwide are affected. For example, one industry group estimated that computers cost an average of $150 more because of cargo theft, and that approximately $3.5 billion of computers, chips, and software are stolen annually. The risk management director for one computer company said that `it's a rare company that hasn't ever lost a truck.' Most people do not realize that the value of computer chips per pound is higher than gold. And, unfortunately, the resale value of stolen items is much higher than what one might believe. Many of these goods end up overseas while others are sold in the same city. 
Mr. President, virtually no product is safe from this crime. While theft of computers and computer products, fragrances, and designer clothes are not uncommon, items ranging from frozen seafood, pineapple pulp, cough drops, refried beans, and insulation have been reported stolen. 
The industry maxim of `cargo at rest is cargo at risk' is no longer a truism--all cargo is a risk--and contrary to the belief that this is a victimless crime, an alarming number of tractor trailers have been hijacked. This occurred just several weeks ago in New Jersey, when a truck was hijacked right after leaving a port. Fortunately the driver was unharmed though one million dollars' worth of clothes were stolen. Tighter measures taken by port authorities and manufacturers at their plants have caused such hijackings to increase. 
Mr. President, the need for this legislation is not a criticism of our law enforcement. The Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, for example, has made significant strides at curbing this crime in the New Jersey/New York region. Unfortunately, existing law does not provide an adequate deterrent because the penalties are not sufficiently severe nor is there an incentive for defendants to cooperate with prosecutors. 
Let me explain, Mr. President, what my legislation will do. It will bring efforts to fight this crime into the next century. Enacted in its earliest form in 1913, the statute that my bill modifies covers such older modes of transportation and distribution of cargo as wagons, depots, and steamboats. My bill recognizes the advances we have made in intermodal connections and transportation by adding such terms as `trailer,' `air cargo container,' and `freight consolidation facility.' The days of cargo theft from wagons are gone. Furthermore, the Cargo Theft Deterrence Act broadens the statute's coverage to clarify that cargo is moving as an interstate or foreign shipment at all points between the point of origin and the final destination. Merely because a container is temporarily at rest awaiting transport to its final destination should not prevent law enforcement from prosecuting a defendant under this statute. Existing law currently covers cargo moving as a part of interstate or foreign commerce. 
My legislation increases the penalties for convictions under this statute. Current law provides that those convicted of this provision shall be fined or imprisoned not more than one year, or both. My bill increases this maximum prison term to three. This statute, as currently written, requires the government to prove that not only did a defendant embezzle, steal, or unlawfully take the cargo, it must show that he did so with the intent to convert to his own use. This seems duplicative at best and is an unnecessary hurdle for the prosecutor to demonstrate. The Cargo Theft Deterrence Act eliminates the term, `with intent to convert to his own use' from this statute. Since we have removed this intent language, we have created the affirmative defense that the defendant bought, received, or possessed the cargo with the sole intent of reporting the matter to either law enforcement or the owner of the cargo. 
The Sentencing Commission is directed to provide a sentencing enhancement of two levels for this crime similar to enhancements made for offenses involving organized schemes to steal vehicles or if the offense involved more than minimal planning. This Act also requires the Attorney General to report annually to Congress on the progress made by law enforcement investigating and prosecuting this crime. Additionally, upon motion by the Attorney General, a court may reduce the penalties if a 
defendant cooperates with law enforcement. Use of informants is essential in reducing this crime and this provision creates an appropriate incentive. 
Finally, Mr. President, my legislation creates a Cargo Theft Advisory Committee that will study and make recommendations about the establishment of a national data base of information about this crime. A constant complaint by industry and law enforcement is that there is a lack of good data about cargo theft. Industry tends to under-report it and law enforcement frequently classifies it in such categories as theft, robbery, hijacking, and burglary. This Committee, which shall exist for one year and report its findings and recommendations to Congress and the President, will also review the desirability of creating a centralized office within the federal government to oversee efforts designed to curb cargo theft and to increase coordination with the private sector, and state and local law enforcement. 
Mr. President, I thought an advisory committee was the most prudent course because legitimate questions have been raised about whether this data base should be maintained by the public or private sector, who should be able to access it, and what information should be collected, yet remain confidential. Moreover, there are several logical agencies that could house an office on cargo security so I thought it is appropriate to have cargo security experts in both the public and private sector make this recommendation.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to comment on S. 1454, the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 1997, which the Senate adopted last night. This bill allows States to obligate funds for six months, to ensure that transportation funding continues to flow for highways, mass transit and safety programs. In addition, this bill will enable continued operation of the United States Department of Transportation. 
Each state will be assured access to transportation funds equaling at least 50 percent, and not more than 75 percent of the state's total transportation funding in FY1997. Moreover, states will have until May 1, 1998, to obligate those funds. No state will be able to obligate Federal funds after that date. 
Every member should understand that this approach essentially creates another transportation funding crisis in only a few short months. This is far from a comfortable situation. 
Next year, when we take up the ISTEA reauthorization bill, we will be in the middle of the FY99 budget discussions and a decision about whether to allocate new funds that may become available as a result of improved budget projections. So, the debate over ISTEA, and the reality of another funding cutoff, will likely coincide with discussions over the FY99 Budget Resolution. As the Ranking Democratic Member of the Budget Committee, I can assure you that I will be doing my best to make additional investment in our transportation infrastructure a high priority during these discussions. 
Mr. President, when it became clear over one month ago that there was not enough time to fully debate a multi-year authorization bill, I starting calling for enactment of a short-term extension of ISTEA. This was the logical approach toward ensuring that States' transportation funding would not run dry. 
The States need additional funds now to meet their immediate transportation needs. ISTEA expired over a month ago, and although States have funding left over from previous years, these available funds will begin to run dry very soon for many States. Highway safety programs have been particularly hard hit because they have no leftover funding. Mass transit programs have no funding reserves. 
A straightforward reauthorization of ISTEA for six months is, to me, the easiest and fastest way to proceed. A House bill to do just that is currently pending on the Senate calendar. By simply continuing current law, this short-term extension also bypasses the controversy caused by enacting changes to the existing funding formulas or apportionments. In addition, passage of the House extension bill would allow us to immediately send this legislation to the President, rather than having to begin new discussions in a conference with the House. However, I understand that controversy is in the eye of the beholder, and there is a feeling among many in this body that allocation of new money will inevitably result in a discussion of formulas. So here we are. 
Mr. President, in the absence of a six month extension of current law, I reluctantly support the Bond compromise, which identified those needs that had to be addressed in a stop-gap measure. 
Mr. President, it is imperative that by the time Congress adjourns this year, both the House and Senate agree on an approach and send a bill to the President that can be signed into law. It is clear to most, that failure to enact some stopgap measure before we adjourn will have a severe impact on the transportation programs of the States. All State plans for new transportation construction, maintenance, and repair activities will be stopped. State transit agencies, metropolitan planning organizations, safety programs, and State planning and bidding activities will immediately suffer from funding shortages. Without a bill, important agencies within USDOT will shut down by mid- to late December. As a result, no projects involving Federal funding could go forward. This would have a huge impact on the States. Federal funds pay for over half the capital costs of State and local highway projects. 
The situation is even more bleak for all the other programs authorized under ISTEA--the safety programs, Intelligent Transportation Systems program, research programs, and--something very important to my state--the federal transit program. There are no funds left over to continue these programs. 
Perhaps the most distressing effect of our failure to act is the safety risk imposed on our constituents, as drunk driving prevention programs, truck and bus safety enforcement, bridge inspections, and highway/rail crossing projects are suspended. For safety reasons alone, we must ensure that some authority is extended. This bill does just that. 
While this bill is important, I do have some concerns. Under this bill, States would have the flexibility to shift unobligated balances among programs to ensure that states can use their scarce funds where they are most needed. For instance, a State could use its left-over CMAQ or enhancement funds to pay for a highway construction project. Language is included to prevent States from abandoning the responsibility to pay back the accounts from which they transferred funds. I remain concerned that these pay-back provisions will not be honored. States must be strictly required to pay back all of these transfers, including transfers from their CMAQ accounts, otherwise valuable programs, critical to our Nation's health and welfare, may be depleted. We must watch this closely to ensure that the program is protected. 
Mr. President, this bill authorizes the additional funding needed to keep crucial safety programs running, to allow States to continue their transportation projects and plans, to keep the U.S. Department of Transportation operating, and to continue the federal transit program for six months. Although this bill will most likely lead to yet another funding crisis in the near future, I want to do all I can to make sure that the Senate does not adjourn without somehow addressing the lapse in transportation funding. I prefer a straight extension of current law, and urged Senator Lott to bring it up. However, he rejected that path. Since that option is not before the Senate, I support this proposal as an acceptable compromise to carry us over until an ISTEA reauthorization bill is passed into law.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to highlight language in the Senate's committee report on the fiscal year 1998 Labor-HHS bill under the National Institute of Health's [NIH] National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [NIAID]. This language notes the significant research on emerging infectious diseases being conducted at the Public Health Research Institute [PHRI]. I would like to clarify that PHRI is a component of a scientific research and collaborative venture in New Jersey known as the International Center for Public Health, located at University Heights Science Park in Newark. Furthermore, I would like to clarify that the intent of the Senate's report language is to encourage NIAID to give appropriate consideration to proposals received from the International Center for Public Health, one component of which is PHRI. 
I would like to ask my colleagues Senators Specter and Harkin if they agree with this interpretation of the intent of the Senate language? Furthermore, I would like to ask my colleagues if they agree that the International Center for Public Health's efforts to create a world class research and treatment complex to address infectious diseases are consistent with the committee's objectives for the Department of Health and Human Services, specifically the NIH's NIAID?

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to provide permanent residency in the United States for 13-year-old Vova Malofienko and his family, residents of Short Hills, NJ. An identical bill is being introduced in the House of Represenatives today by Congressman Steve Rothman and Congressman Bob Franks. Vova Malofienko has leukemia from his having lived 30 miles from the Chornobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine during and after the infamous disaster. His leukemia is in remission only because of the emergency medical treatment he's received in the United States. 
Were Vova forced to return to Ukraine, the United States would be placing an innocent child near the front of the line on death row. Vova was one of eight children of Chornobyl who came to the United States in 1990--and when the seven others later returned to Ukraine, they died one by one because of inadequate cancer treatment. Not a child survived. 
On behalf of the Malofienkos, I ask my colleagues for their invaluable support for this legislation. We are a compassionate nation that should open its heart to Vova and his family, who came in dire medical need. 
Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to tell my colleagues a bit more about Vova and his family. Vladimir `Vova' Malofienko was born on 6/29/84 in Chernigov, Ukraine. His mother, Olga Matsko, was born on 9/29/59 in Piratin, Ukraine, and his father, Alexander Malofienko, was born on 12/25/57 in Chernigov, Ukraine. 
Vova was only 2 when the Chornobyl reactor exploded in 1986 and exposed him to radiation. He was diagnosed with leukemia in June 1990 at age 6. Vova and his mother came to the United States later in 1990 on a B-1 visitor's visa so that Vova could attend a cancer treatment camp for children, sponsored by the Children of Chornobyl Relief Fund. Vova was invited to stay in the United States to receive more extensive treatment and chemotherapy. In November of 1992, Vova's cancer went into remission. Vova's father, Alexander Malofienko joined the family in 1992, also on a B-1 visa. 
The Malofienko family is currently in the United States with extended voluntary departure through March of 1998. Alexander Malofienko's second application for labor certification is pending before the New Jersey Department of Labor. The first application for Labor certification was denied. 
Vova and his family desire to remain in the United States because of the extraordinary health concerns facing Vova. Regrettably, as I mentioned earlier, Vova is the only survivor from a group of eight children of Chornobyl who came to the United States together in 1990. The seven other children returned to Ukraine and have since died. Now that Vova is in remission, it would indeed be tragic to return him to an environment which would once again endanger his life. The air, food, and water in Ukraine are contaminated with radiation that people residing there for several years have grown accustomed to, but which could be perilous to Vova's weakened immune system. 
Furthermore, treatment available in Ukraine is not as sophisticated and up to date as treatment available in the United States. Before Vova came to the United States, no aggressive treatment for his leukemia had been provided. Although Vova completed his chemotherapy in 1992, he continues to need medical follow-up on a consistent basis, including physical examinations, lab work and radiological examinations to assure early detection and prompt and appropriate therapy in the unfortunate event the leukemia recurs. 
According to Dr. Peri Kamalakar, Director of the Valerie Fund Children's Center at Newark Beth Israel hospital, where Vova has received care, Vova's cancer is considered high risk with a threat of relapse. He is also at risk to develop significant late complications secondary to the intensive chemotherapy he received, including heart problems and secondary cancers. Another significant risk is relapse in the bone marrow, testis, or central nervous system. Dr. Kamalakar has concluded that Vova's chance for a permanent cure is considerably better if he stays in the United States. 
Every one of the risks to Vova's health would be magnified by what is only the recent emergence of the full effects of Chornobyl. Birth defects in the Chornobyl area have doubled. Thyroid cancer has increased 80 times--a rate too horrifying to comprehend. And the total number of children whose health will be at risk for the rest of their lives is over a million.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, millions of young people cry out for help. It would be irresponsible to turn our backs and do nothing when a solution is not only at hand--but has already proven a helping hand. The problem is `at-risk' youth. The solution is mentoring. 
Mr. President, let me give you some idea of the scope of the problem. Last month the census released a report that said half of America's 16 and 17 year olds are at-risk children. Half. That's 3.7 million children at just those two ages. Other estimates run as high as 15 million for children of all ages. 
Among the factors putting these children at risk are poverty and being raised in a single-parent family. Twenty-one percent of our children live in poverty--a six point increase since 1970. Twenty-eight percent live in one-parent households--a 16-percent increase since 1970. These `at-risk' children are more likely to drop out of school and be unable to find work. And that, Mr. President, is the path to drugs and crime. Mentoring is a proven way to reach out to these kids and provide them with caring role models who can help turn their lives around. 
Earlier this month, Attorney General Janet Reno reported that violent crime by teenagers had dropped for the second straight year. Among the reasons for the drop, General Reno cited the community mentoring programs that we created with the original Juvenile Mentoring Program, or JUMP, in 1992. 
Since its enactment, JUMP has funded 93 separate mentoring programs in more than half the states. The competition for JUMP awards is great: Over 479 communities submitted applications for the recent round of grants. 
JUMP grantees use a variety of program designs. Mentors include law enforcement and fire department personnel, college students, senior citizens, Federal employees, business people, professionals, and other diverse volunteers. 
The children are of all races. They come from urban, suburban, and rural communities, ranging in age from 5 to 20. In its first year, JUMP helped to keep thousands of at-risk young people in 25 States in school and off the streets through one-to-one mentoring. 
Mr. President, this program has proved popular and effective and that is why today Senator Coats and I are introducing the JUMP Ahead Act of 1997. I want to thank Senator Coats for his commitment and I am pleased that he is an original cosponsor of this bill. 
General Reno was not speaking idly when she touted the benefits of mentoring. A 1995 scientific study of the Big Brothers/Big Sisters Programs bears this out. 
The study tracked 959 children in eight cities. Of the children studied, 40 percent came from broken homes, 27 percent had been abused, 28 percent came from homes where the spouse was abused, and 15 percent had suffered the death of a parent. This was a classic pool of at-risk children. 
The results after just 1 year were startling. Compared to children who were on a waiting list to enter the program, the children in the study abused alcohol 27 percent less, were 32 percent less likely to engage in violent behavior, and missed 52 percent fewer school days. 
These dramatic results were achieved at a cost of just $1,000 a match. Compare that to the $24,000 a year we're willing to spend to put someone in jail once they've dropped out of school and turned to crime or drugs. You are going to hear a lot of statistics today. But too often we lose sight of the human aspect of these numbers. So let me tell you the story of a single child. 
Recently, I hosted a conference on mentoring in my home State of New Jersey. There I met 11-year-old Kenneth Jackson. Once Kenneth had been a troubled student who was considered likely to drop out. Now, thanks to his mentor, Kenneth reads and does arithmetic at two grades above his actual sixth grade level. And the best news--Kenneth told me that now he thinks school is cool and that he never thinks about dropping out. It's hard to argue with success like that. 
Sadly, Kenneth's mentor--Dwight Giles--is no longer with us. He recently died of a heart attack. Dwight was a good friend and I mourn his passing. And I would like to dedicate this bill to his memory. 
Mr. President, we need to take this successful program to the next level. The JUMP Ahead Act reforms the basic successful structure of JUMP and increases funding to $50 million per year for four years and increases awards to up to $200,000. 
This initiative will not only vastly increase the number of mentoring programs able to receive grants, but will also create a new category of grants to enable experienced national organizations to provide technical assistance to emerging mentoring programs nationwide. The legislation also requires the Justice Department to rigorously evaluate the programs and document what is effective, and what is not. 
Finally, Mr. President, we like to talk a lot about pulling yourself up by your boot straps. But that doesn't mean much for a child unless you also provide a solid path to walk on. I grew up poor in Paterson, NJ. But I had rich role models in both my hard-working parents. Too many children today don't have that same blessing. 
Mentoring tells our at-risk kids that we as a nation care about them--that their lives are precious to us. Mentoring tells them that if they are willing to pull on those boots and try to walk away from a dead end life, they will not have to walk alone. 
Mr. President, I have told you the scope of the problem. And in America, when we have a problem we don't just wring our hands and say nothing can be done. We roll up our sleeves and get to work.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am joining Senators Kennedy and Durbin in introducing the Healthy and Smoke-free Children Act of 1997. Likewise, Senators Kennedy and Durbin are cosponsoring legislation I introduced last week, the Public Health and Education Resource Act, S. 1343, or PHAER. As we join forces behind comprehensive tobacco legislation to reduce smoking, especially among our young people, and to enhance the public health, we urge Senators of both parties to unify behind our approach. It is a simple and straightforward but effective model for drastically reducing the 400,000 preventable deaths each year in our country caused by a deadly addiction to nicotine. 
Mr. President, it's time for Congress to act. We have the legislative packages to get started. The message we are sending out today is clear: the goal of comprehensive tobacco legislation is to prevent kids from becoming hooked on tobacco--not to get the tobacco companies off the hook. 
Our legislation would raise the price of cigarettes by $1.50 per pack in order to reduce teen smoking and fund critical public health programs. It explicitly prohibits the industry from deducting the cost of increased excise taxes from its corporate tax payments. With the proceeds of the tax, states will receive back funds for public health and children's programs, including health, education, and smoking cessation programs aimed at both children, teenagers, and adults. Further, our bill will fund a significant increase in medical research. To increase industry incentives to reduce teen smoking, the legislation we are introducing today will impose penalties on companies which fail to meet teen smoking reduction targets. Finally, recognizing the potential dislocation to tobacco farmers that could flow from a reduction in national smoking rates, our bill provides transitional assistance to farmers and displaced tobacco workers. 
Mr. President, of critical importance, our legislation affirms the authority of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco as a drug and drug delivery device. It gives FDA explicit authority over the advertising, marketing and sale of cigarettes. It also calls for larger and more explicit warning labels on cigarettes and ingredient disclosure, drawing on legislation I introduced earlier this year, and permits states to enact more restrictions on tobacco. It also incorporates the essence of the Smokefree Environment Act which I also introduced earlier this year, to protect non-smokers from secondhand smoke. 
The President has called for comprehensive tobacco legislation that gives the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate nicotine. He has also called for a $1.50 increase in the price of cigarettes to deter teen smoking and help pay for a variety of public health programs. Our legislation accomplishes that. 
Mr. President, the tobacco industry has been trying to convince the Congress and the public that the only way to accomplish the President's goals is through its proposed settlement with the state Attorneys General. We know that this is not the case. Our legislation offers a more efficient and effective way of serving the public health. The Congress can move ahead without permission from the tobacco industry and we should do just that. 
Mr. President, our proposals embody the goals outlined by the President and embraced by the public health community. In fact, a broad range of groups supported the introduction of S. 1343, the PHAER Act, when I introduced it. These groups include Action on Smoking and Health, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Cancer Society, the American College of Physicians, the American College of Preventive Medicine, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the American Medical Association, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, the National Association of Counties, the National Association of County and City Health Officials, and Partnership for Prevention and Physicians for Social Responsibility. 
Mr. President, these bills eliminate the tobacco industry as the middleman in achieving public health goals. We have laid out an ambitious, but achievable, program for reducing smoking and death and illness. Congressional action on comprehensive tobacco legislation should live up to the standards we have established. 
Beyond taking strong, preventive steps to reduce smoking domestically, we should also pursue legislation affecting our tobacco companies' commercial activities overseas. If we don't, in the next few decades we will experience a worldwide health epidemic attributable to tobacco. Earlier this year, I introduced S. 1060, the Worldwide Tobacco Disclosure Act, to require warning labels on exported packages of cigarettes and to codify current trade policies that prevent government agencies from promoting tobacco sales overseas and from weakening public health measures undertaken by foreign governments. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us on the public health side of this fight by endorsing our comprehensive tobacco legislation.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support the compromise Amtrak reauthorization bill being offered by Senator Hutchison. Passage of this bill brings us one step closer to putting Amtrak on firm footing by extending authorization for 5 years, and most importantly, by giving Amtrak $2.3 billion in tax credits for much-needed capital investments. 
But let's not pretend we are completely solving the problem today. The General Accounting Office has warned us over and over again that making Amtrak self sufficient will be difficult and that realistically we have to look at continued investment in the system beyond the year 2002. 
Mr. President, our national transportation system is crucial to our economy. And a national rail system is a crucial part of any national transportation plan. But over the years we have consistently shortchanged Amtrak. 
For instance, over the course of this decade, Germany has decided to invest nearly $70 billion on what is already an excellent railway system in a country a fraction of the size of the United States. 
What have we done? Well, since 1971, we've invested just $19 billion in Amtrak. And now we are preparing to phase out operating subsidies entirely. I think this is unrealistic. 
Mr. President, let me put this in perspective. We continue to subsidize every other form of transportation. 
Over the past 15 years, in relative terms, we've increased spending on highways by 73 percent and aviation by 170 percent, while we have cut Amtrak's funding 62 percent. 
As we starved our national rail system during most of this decade, service declined and so did ridership. Between 1994 and 1996 Amtrak went from 21.1 million passengers to 19.7 million --meaning Amtrak lost even more revenue and was being sent into a downward spiral toward bankruptcy. 
And those 1.4 million riders Amtrak lost still had to get to their destinations somehow and that likely meant more cars, buses, or planes in our already congested airports and highways. 
Coming from the State of New Jersey, I can speak first hand about the importance of Amtrak to my State and the rest of the northeast corridor. 
The New York/New Jersey metropolitan area is one of the most congested in the nation. A recent study said that every day people waste more than 2 million hours in traffic--2 million hours a day. 
To put that number into perspective, that means that people here will waste more time in traffic in a single year than the man-hours to build the entire Continental railroad. 
And if Amtrak wasn't there, another 11 million people would be dumped onto our roads. 
How many billions of dollars would we have to spend widening roads in order to accommodate this new traffic? How much time and money would trucking companies, businesses and commuters lose as a result of increased traffic and congestion? I do not think that anyone can legitimately make the argument that highway users do not benefit from Amtrak's operations. 
Amtrak does not just reduce congestion on our highways. It carries over 40 percent of the combined air-rail market between Washington and New York. Loss of Amtrak service in this corridor would require another 7,500 fully booked 757 jetliners to carry Amtrak's passenger load each year. How many billions would we have to invest in our air infrastructure to accommodate these travelers? 
Mr. President, while I've spoken about my region, Amtrak is also a national passenger rail system that provides important service in areas of the country that are not as congested. In many cases, Amtrak provides residents of small rural towns with their only form of intercity transportation. Each year, some 22 million passengers depend on Amtrak for transportation between urban centers and rural locations. Amtrak provides service in 45 of the 50 States. 
Ask any Amtrak passenger, traveling through the State of Montana, perhaps stopping off at Havre, on their way to Glacier National Park, whether Amtrak is important to them. Of course it is. 
Mr. President, this agreement in front of us today strikes a compromise on very difficult labor issues. It asks Amtrak's workers to make signficant concessions. 
Mr. President, I worked hard to make these funds available to Amtrak. During the budget negotiations, I worked with Senators Roth and Domenici to include a reserve fund for Amtrak to allow us to make additional capital funding available in future legislation. 
Thanks to the leadership of Senators Roth and Moynihan, the Finance Committee found a way to provide this funding in the tax reconciliation bill through a $2.3 billion tax credit. 
Mr. President, I would like to end by commending all of those who worked so feverishly to put this compromise together. In particular, Senators Kerry, Hollings, Lott, Hutchison, McCain, Roth and Breaux deserve special recognition for their efforts and leadership in this matter. 
I urge my colleagues to support this Amtrak reauthorization compromise. 
I think this step we take today to begin rejuvenating our national rail system might someday be considered just as historic as the century-old congressional decision to build it in the first place. 
But we must not kid ourselves. More will need to be done if Amtrak is to thrive, not just survive.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation I believe will encourage many of our trading partners to improve their protection of American intellectual property rights. This is not an insignificant matter, Mr. President. It is estimated that American companies lose approximately $50 billion every year from intellectual property violations. This theft not only affects a company's bottom line, it means losses to America's competitiveness, and, most importantly, it means loss of American jobs. 
The `Rights of Intellectual Property Owners Fairness Facilitation Act of 1997,' or RIP-OFF, will require participants in the Generalized System of Preferences program to expedite their implementation of the intellectual property agreement contained in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In addition, to continue as a GSP beneficiary, a country must fully comply with the terms of any bilateral or other multilateral intellectual property agreement it has with the United States. 
Mr. President, the Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, known as TRIPS, requires signatories to improve and better enforce the rights of intellectual property holders. Unfortunately, too many countries are able to delay implementation of TRIPS for an inordinately long period of time. Developing countries have until 2000 and least developed countries are permitted to delay some TRIPS requirements for as long as 2006. The United States simply cannot afford to permit piracy to continue unabated for such a lengthy period. 
The GSP program enables certain products from developing countries to be exported to the United States duty-free. Through the years, Congress has conditioned the receipt of these tariff preferences on such factors as whether a country enforces arbitral awards in favor of US citizens, whether it affords internationally recognized worker rights to its workers, and whether it harbors terrorists. Although GSP beneficiaries are supposed to provide 'adequate and effective' intellectual property protection, it is an amorphous standard that has only been used a handful of times against countries, and then, only for a limited period of time, and with limited success. By tying the GSP program to expedited implementation of TRIPS and full compliance with agreements they have negotiated with the U.S., countries will know what they must do and by when to continue receiving GSP benefits. It also demonstrates our commitment to protecting American intellectual property rights overseas. 
My legislation conforms to current law, which provides the President with the discretion, via a waiver, to continue or extend GSP benefits to a country that does not comply with the requirements of this bill by allowing a waiver. The President has every right to determine that designating a country as a GSP beneficiary is in the national economic interest of the United States. I thought it was important to maintain the existing flexibility in this program. My bill will also enable our government to provide support and technical assistance to countries having difficulty meeting their intellectual property protection requirements. 
The GSP program provides countries with a benefit, not a right. Congress continues to downsize the federal government. Resources are scarce. In this climate, it is inappropriate to provide GSP benefits to countries that do not uphold our intellectual property rights. Industries reliant upon strong intellectual property protection, pharmaceutical, telecommunications, and motion picture companies, for example, are among this country's most competitive. We should be fostering this competitiveness by using appropriate tools to protect our innovators. Mr. President, this legislation will accomplish this goal. 
This legislation is very similar to a bill I introduced several years ago with Senator Roth. The modifications I have made account for the time countries have already had to commence changes to their intellectual property laws and regulations. Additionally, the bill clarifies that the standards provided in TRIPS should be the floor for intellectual property agreements, and that our government should continue seeking stronger protection for American intellectual property owners. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be inserted into the Record along with letters of support.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, when a child is murdered, families are devastated and communities are rocked to their very core. When a murderer is prosecuted, grieving parents and siblings are forced to relive the often brutal details of the most profound tragedy imaginable. And, if a conviction is obtained, in too many instances, the families of a young victim must repeatedly relieve the crime every time the murderer goes before a parole board. 
The families of murder victims, especially murdered children, need closure. They need to know that they can put the horror and a tragedy behind them. They need to know that they can begin rebuilding their lives. But most importantly, they need to know that the person responsible for the crime will never bring harm and grief to another family. 
This is why, Mr. President, I am today joining my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Torricelli, in introducing legislation that will significantly increase the penalties on criminals convicted of a Federal crime where a child under the age of 14 is killed during the commission of that crime. I also want to commend and acknowledge Congressman Bob Franks, also from New Jersey, who introduced similar legislation in the House. 
Mr. President, this legislation is a Federal companion for an important New Jersey law called Joan's Law. Joan's Law was named after a 7-year-old New Jersey girl, Joan D'Alessandro, who was raped and murdered in 1973. Joan's murderer, a man who lived across State lines and actually had the gall to participate in the family's desperate search for their missing daughter, was located, convicted of the crime, and sentenced to 20 years in State prison. He is now eligible for parole, and has twice sought release since his incarceration. 
To their horror, frustration, and understandable anger, Joan's family has repeatedly had to fight parole for this cruel killer. They have been forced to relive this tragedy again and again and to beg that others be protected from the brutal individual who ripped apart their family. 
The bill we are introducing today will impose a similar, equally severe and necessary penalty--life imprisonment--on anyone convicted of committing a Federal crime where a child, 14 years of age or younger, dies as a result of that crime. 
The bill sends a strong message that our society will not tolerate nor forgive the brutal acts of a criminal who takes a young life. This bill sends the message in no uncertain terms that society will take the steps necessary to protect itself from cold-blooded killers who victimize children. This bill will help to protect all of our families and children from the repeat offenders who, all too often, insinuate themselves into our communities and prey on defenseless children. 
Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to join with Senator Torricelli and I in support of this bill and to work for its fast enactment.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, last spring, various State attorneys general announced that they had reached a global agreement to settle ongoing State lawsuits against the tobacco industry in exchange for certain concessions by the industry aimed at reducing teen smoking. This truly historic agreement followed a persistent effort by President Clinton to empower the Food and Drug Administration to regulate nicotine and develop strategies to stop the addiction of our children to this deadly drug. President Clinton is the first President in our Nation's history to take on the tobacco industry on behalf of the American people and he deserves enormous credit for his bold and relentless leadership on this issue. 
Since the announcement of the global tobacco settlement, President Clinton, his health advisers, former FDA Commissioner David Kessler, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, our leading public health groups, and many of us in the Congress have reviewed the proposed settlement. While the attorneys general pushed the industry as hard as they could, they had to make significant compromises along the way to keep the industry at the bargaining table. An examination of their deal with the industry reflects the limits under which they were operating and shows that the settlement is flawed in many respects. 
The Congress, Mr. President, is in an entirely different position vis-a-vis the tobacco industry. The Congress has no need to make the kinds of concessions to the industry that the attorneys general did. The Congress does not need permission from the industry to take steps to reduce teen smoking and put an end to hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths each year. We don't have to settle. Our job is to develop legislation in the public interest and promote the public health. 
Mr. President, virtually no one in the Congress today supports the settlement proposed by the industry and the attorneys general. The settlement is dead. It is gone with Joe Camel. After extensive review, President Clinton recommended to the Congress that we enact comprehensive tobacco control legislation, and focus on the public health--not the tobacco industry's interests. 
Mr. President, I share President Clinton's deep reservation about the settlement as a framework for this legislation. Instead, I would like to propose an alternative framework for my colleagues and others in the public health community to consider. I hope it will influence our deliberations next year, and contribute to the enactment of effective and comprehensive tobacco legislation. Mr. President, this approach is not premised on the notion of a deal with the industry. Instead, it attempts to build on the extremely thoughtful and knowledgeable work of Drs. Kessler and Koop, and many other public health experts and economists, who have studied these questions for a long time. It is a public health measure, pure and simple. 
Mr. President, today Representative Jim Hansen and I are introducing the Public Health and Education Resource Act--or the PHAER Act. The PHAER Act is, in some ways simple and straightforward. It goes right at the problem. It would raise the excise tax 
on tobacco by $1.50, consistent with the President's recommendation on pricing. It specifically targets the revenues raised to public health, with an emphasis on reducing youth smoking rates. This bipartisan, bicameral proposal is intended to serve as the blueprint for accomplishing the public health goals that the President and public health leaders have outlined. 
Mr. President, the overarching goal of the public health community is to decrease the rate of tobacco addiction in children. I believe the PHAER Act is the simplest and most direct way to accomplish that goal. Every health expert concludes that the single most effective way to reduce youth consumption of cigarettes is to increase the price. According to the Congressional Research Service, a $1.50 increase in the price of cigarettes will result in a 45-percent reduction in youth smoking rates. The President has made this a prerequisite to any tobacco legislation. 
So, Mr. President, the question before Congress is how to accomplish this price increase and serve our public health interests. The tobacco settlement would raise prices by funneling money through the tobacco companies to accomplish a price increase. This approach relies on the industry to raise the price--which is a Catch-22. If the industry does raise the price by a $1.50, then there is no guarantee that all of these revenues will go toward the public health. In fact, health experts and the Federal Trade Commission have concluded that under the proposed settlement, the companies would make a substantial profit from such a price increase--as less than half of the $1.50 would actually go toward settlement payments. 
On the other hand, the companies might not ever raise their prices to a point that actually makes a real dent in teen smoking. They could choose to simply raise it high enough to cover their settlement costs--estimated at 62 cents per pack. 
Neither of these outcomes are positive for America's health. That is why the only fair way to accomplish these goals is through the PHAER Act I am introducing today. 
Mr. President, we know that an increase in excise taxes is the single most effective step we can take to reduce teen smoking, and through PHAER we can ensure that every penny of the price increase is targeted to programs that will further reduce illegal youth tobacco consumption and promote other critical public health priorities. This is the most effective and reliable mechanism to guarantee that prices go up and that revenues are targeted to the proper programs. 
Mr. President, this is not a partisan issue. Senators from both sides of the aisle have stated that the excise tax is the most efficient and effective way to reduce teen smoking and decrease the cost of tobacco illness in our country. This is one of the few taxes that people actually support increasing. It is one of the few taxes that can be directly linked to positive policy goals. Now, all we need is the will to act. 
Mr. President, we propose a revenue pipeline to the public health rather than relying on the Rubik's cube payment scheme offered by the industry. Under my bill, excise tax 
increases will turn teenagers away from cigarettes and the proceeds of the increase will go directly to benefit America's health. These funds are targeted to public health and educational programs to further reduce teen tobacco addiction. 
Our PHAER tobacco excise tax increase will be phased in over 3 years. Each year the fee will increase by 50 cents until it reaches $1.50. Once at $1.50, the PHAER fee will be indexed for inflation to guarantee that its price-deterrent effect continues to be strong enough to maintain the reduction in teen tobacco use. 
Mr. President, many have stated that a price increase alone will not sustain a long term decrease in youth tobacco addiction, and they are right. That is why the revenues from the PHAER fee will be targeted to public health programs, with an emphasis on those that will directly decrease the number of kids who begin to smoke every day. 
Three-quarters of PHAER funds will be disbursed at the State and local level for health and education programs that bring home to young people the deadly consequences of smoking. These funds will be distributed to the States with the supervision and assistance by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. We should set out national goals for reducing teen smoking, and insist on accountability, but we should also give States the flexibility to develop the best programs for their people. 
Mr. President, each State will be able to design teen smoking cessation programs that are most effective for its particular circumstance. An average of $15 billion per year will be available for these States programs. Eligible uses include smoking cessation programs and services, school and community-based tobacco education and prevention programs, counteradvertising campaigns, expansion of the children's health insurance program created in the budget act, and other public health purposes. 
Mr. President, it is critical that smoking cessation and addiction treatment programs be put into place, and the PHAER Program will do that. I hear a great deal of talk about adult choice. Well, most adults who smoke are not really choosing to smoke--they are addicted. It is not merely a habit--it is an addiction as powerful as the addiction to cocaine. And as the price of cigarettes goes up, we should put a system in place that will help bring addicted smokers off nicotine. Cessation and treatment programs should be available to all Americans, regardless of their income. 
Mr. President, these programs will be coordinated at the State level and the States will have flexibility to design their own programs. The States vary widely in the patterns of tobacco use. Some States have youth cigarette consumption rates reaching catastrophic levels; other States have a more pressing problem with chewing--or smokeless--tobacco. 
Mr. President, the remaining 25 percent of PHAER funds--an average of $5 billion per year--will be available at the Federal level to expand critical research at the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control. They will also be used to adequately fund tobacco control programs at the Food and Drug Administration and to assure that tobacco farmers, factory workers, and their communities will not suffer economic devastation 
as we move to reduce smoking. The PHAER Act would also contribute to tobacco prevention programs at the Veterans' Administration, the Drug Czar's office, and across the world through assistance to international programs. PHAER would also fund Medicare prevention programs and premium and cost-sharing assistance for low-income Medicare beneficiaries. 
Mr. President, all of these goals--and many more--can be accomplished, and we do not need to ask the tobacco industry's permission to do it. We just need to raise the tobacco excise tax and use the revenues to promote clear public health objectives. 
Mr. President, the reason we can accomplish these goals is that the PHAER fund will raise $494 billion over 25 years--an average of nearly $20 billion per year. This estimate is based on the tobacco consumption curve developed by the Joint Committee on Taxation. It is a realistic calculation of the revenues that will flow from this excise tax boost, even given anticipated reductions in tobacco consumption. 
Mr. President, this revenue projection of $494 billion over 25 years is much more reliable than the $368.5 billion figure projected by the tobacco industry and State attorneys general as a result of their proposed settlement. Those numbers are full of holes and deceptions. The Federal Trade Commission recently found that the much-publicized $368.5 billion figure so widely associated with the proposed tobacco settlement failed to take into account the effect of reduced consumption of tobacco on the industry's payment obligations under the terms of the settlement. A more realistic estimate would peg the proceeds of the proposed tobacco settlement closer to $250 billion over 25 years. 
Mr. President, when you look at real numbers, it is clear that the PHAER Act will provide States with considerably more funds than the proposal by the tobacco industry and the attorneys general. 
Finally, Mr. President, our bill includes a series of sense-of-the-Senate provisions. We include them in the bill to reflect our recognition that comprehensive tobacco legislation should include a broader range of measures than the revenue proposals in PHAER. These provisions state that any final legislation should include: stiff penalties to serve as an incentive for the industry to stop targeting kids, full authority for the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco, disclosure of documents, restrictions on secondhand smoke, ingredient and constituent disclosure and a ban on the use of Federal Government resources to weaken nondiscriminatory public health laws abroad. 
Already this year, several key pieces of tobacco legislation have been introduced that should be part of congressional action next year on tobacco. I have introduced the Tobacco Disclosure and Warning Act, dealing with ingredient labeling, the Smoke-Free Environment Act, which would restrict secondhand smoke, and the Worldwide Tobacco Disclosure Act, which would set out our international trade policy on tobacco. I have also cosponsored Senator Durbin's legislation, the No Tobacco for Kids Act, which would set up real penalties to stop the industry from targeting kids. 
In addition, along with Minnesota State Attorney General Humphrey and others, I have 
called for a full disclosure of hidden documents from the industry, including those that have been fraudulently concealed under the cloak of the attorney-client privilege. I have asked relevant committee chairmen to subpoena documents being held by Minnesota courts because Congress must have the unfiltered truth before we legislate on such a critical issue. 
Hopefully, Mr. President, the State of Minnesota will do what the Congress of the United States has so far failed to do. Minnesota--which did not sign on to the supposedly `global' tobacco settlement--is expected to go to trial in January. That case should bring significant information to light--information on tobacco and health that will be critical to crafting appropriate legislation in Congress. 
Mr. President, opponents of strengthening the proposed tobacco settlement assert the industry will `walk away' if any legislation is too favorable to the public health. Last time I checked the Constitution of the United States, only duly elected U.S. Senators could vote in this Chamber, and only Members, staff, and former Members could have access to the floor. As far as I'm concerned, the tobacco industry can walk anywhere it wants to--but not onto this floor to cast votes for or lobby against this legislation. 
Mr. President, all of us were elected to serve the people of our individual States and the Nation as a whole. There are few things that I could do for the people of New Jersey--especially the young people and their parents--that are more critical than preventing children from inhaling a deadly and addicting toxin into their body. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the PHAER legislation. It is not time to strike a deal with Big Tobacco, but rather it is time to make a healthy future real for America's kids. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters I have received from public health groups supporting the approach taken in this legislation be entered into the Record. This includes a letter from the ENACT Coalition, which is signed by the American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Preventive Medicine, National Association of County and City Health Officials, Partnership for Prevention, and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. In addition, I am inserting letters from the American Lung Association and the National Association of Counties, which also indicated support for the introduction of the PHAER legislation. 
I also ask unanimous consent to insert the bill, a fact sheet, and a chart reflecting how many more lives would be saved under the PHAER Act as opposed to the tobacco industry's proposed settlement into the Record.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, all across America toxic time bombs lurk beneath the soil. Many of our families find their futures poisoned by a long-gone industrial past. 
And sadly we've made our families--especially our children--the canaries in the coal mine. Only after they've been stricken, do we move on the danger. 
We need to change our emphasis. 
Mr. President, we should help local communities meet the health treats bubbling up from toxic waste sites. That is why I am today introducing the Environmental Health Protection Act--legislation to require the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry [ASTDR] to actively work with local community health and safety leaders both to design and train local health authorities to better manage a potential toxic hazard and to design site-specific remedies and monitoring systems. 
Today, the ranking member of the Environmental and Public works Committee, Senator Baucus, is joining with me in introducing legislation to significantly boost the role that public health considerations play in Superfund decisions. 
Mr. President, the potential health hazard posed from toxic waste dumps is great and growing. 
According to a recent study of 136 Superfund toxic waste sites by the Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry [ASTDR], more than half the sites they examined represent serious, ongoing public health hazards. ATSDR placed an additional 23 percent of toxic waste sites in an indeterminate hazard category because they potentially pose a long-term risk to human life. 
Communities and community leaders must have the tools and resources to meet these potential disaster--just like we prepare communities to meet potential natural disasters. 
ATSDR recently determined that 11 million Americans reside within 1 mile of the 1,309 Superfund National Priority List [NPL] sites. These families are at particular risk from the hazardous substances wafting through the air they breath or oozing into water they drink. 
The problems that communities face from toxic waste dumps are immense and complicated by the need for specialized knowledge, training and skills to address toxic waste problems. Dr. Barry Johnson of the ATSDR recently testified before the Superfund Subcommittee of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee about the kinds of health problems communities face. He told the committee that: 
ATSDR health investigations at hazardous waste sites across the country found that nearby residents were exposed to increased health risk from a wide variety of maladies including: birth defects; nerve damage; skin disorders; leukemia; cardiovascular abnormalities; respiratory problems, and immune disorders. 
Two sets of studies in my home State of New Jersey--one carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] and the other by the New Jersey School of Medicine and Dentistry--showed an increase in cancer cases in counties surrounding hazardous waste sites. The New Jersey Medicine study by Dr. G. Najem found that age-adjusted gastrointestinal cancer morality rates were higher in 20 of New Jersey's 21 counties than national rates. 
An ATSDR 1995 study of residents of Forest City and Glover, MO, who live near Superfund sites, showed an increase in reports of breathing disorders and decreased pulmonary function; especially among nonsmoking women. 
Compilation of studies in California report the occurrence of an increased risk of birth defects in the children of women living near the State's 700 hazardous waste sites. 
The results of another recent study funded by ATSDR and performed by the New Jersey Department of Health, are particularly disturbing and, understandably, have frightened many of my constituents in the town of Maywood, NJ. The study reviewed data gathered on 15,000 residents living near Superfund sites and found the incidence of brain cancers running at 50 percent above the expected level. In addition, the study found cancer clusters--areas with unusually high rates of certain forms of cancer--existing in Ocean County and distressing 50 percent increase in various kinds of childhood cancers. 
In short, ATSDR research demonstrates how important it is to the health of Americans living near Superfund sites to clean up those sites as quickly as possible. And this is no small task. 
Communities struggling to come to grips with the potential health hazards of a toxic waste dump are too often left to fend for themselves. No one agency is specifically charged with coordinating the various health-relief efforts these families need. 
Currently, EPA uses a risk assessment process to write plans for dealing with the problems posed by toxic sites. As a result, the selection of containment as a remedy rather than removing the toxins from a site has grown to 30 percent of the EPA remedy decisions. If containment is to work for the communities surrounding Superfund and other toxic sites, we must increase health monitoring and provide other health care assistance, advice, and tools to those living with near these sites. 
Congress established ATSDR specifically to address possible health problems arising from Superfund sites. Now is the time to use what we have learned and to actively involve local communities in their efforts to meet the health challenges posed by the hazardous waste sites. This bill requires ATSDR to do just that. 
First, my bill both allows ATSDR to study any location where there is concern that hazardous wastes threatens public health and requires that ATSDR work closely with State and local health officials in making its assessment. Presently, Mr. President, State and local health and environmental officials are only required to be involved at sites listed on the Environmental Protection Agency's national list of priority sites--the National Priority List [NPL]. By mandating that ATSDR work with the State and local officials from the get-go at any potential site, we will be insuring the understanding, cooperation, and consultation necessary to effective environmental cleanup exists in a community. 
Second, critics frequently complain that ATSDR's health assessments are completed too late in the process to be of any real use to the local officials struggling to manage the health impact of a hazardous waste site on a community. This bill changes the way EPA and the health authorities do their job. It requires EPA to notify local and State health officials early in the process that an investigation is commencing and to better coordinate its activities with local authorities so that EPA's proposed remedy better reflects local conditions and needs. 
Third, this bill requires EPA to directly involve State and local health officials in decisions concerning analysis and sampling methods used at hazardous sites. State and local health officials are often the frontline experts. They have important first-hand information on how a toxic waste dump affects their community. Working with EPA, they can better determine and analyze possible health problems patterns in a community and whether that arises from a toxic waste dump. With this information, EPA can zero-in on those areas for additional sampling and further studies and design a site appropriate remedy that meets the special circumstances of the affected community. 
Fourth--and this is critically important--better training and up-to-date information are essential to helping communities deal with hazardous waste sites. This legislation will ensure that State and local health officials receive the training and technical information they need to diagnose and treat environmental health problems, and it will also empower local authorities to help EPA make appropriate, site-specific decisions about clean up remedies. 
Fifth, this bill requires that when EPA selects to leave toxic wastes in place, then EPA must work with local health officials to design a site specific health monitoring program. This will be paid for by the parties responsible for the hazard, and those requirements will become an enforceable part of any clean up agreement. It will no longer be adequate for a polluter to simply build a fence around a toxic waste site and hope the toxins stay in and community residents stay out. EPA's remedy must now ensure that the health of the residents in the line of fire is protected first, foremost, and always. And, when EPA revisits a site to evaluate whether the clean up is working, EPA will now specifically have to consider the recommendations of local health officials on the effectiveness and appropriateness of the solution. 
Since the Superfund amendments of 1986, the communities near hazardous waste sites have appealed to us to strengthen the public health requirements of the law. A major focus of our efforts in cleaning up toxic waste must be the health of our people. This bill will put community health and safety back at the top of the Superfund agenda. It will increase the information available to the public and cooperation between public health officials at all levels of government. It will result in health considerations being made a central part of any discussions of clean up strategies and effective long-term monitoring of toxic waste sites. This bill will ensure that the remedy chosen by EPA better protects the millions of Americans who live around our nation's hazardous waste sites.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I, too, view this report as does my friend and colleague and chairman of the subcommittee. It reflects what I think is a good outcome after being forced to work with less resources than I would like to see devoted to transportation. But that is life in the present fiscal climate and consistent with our determination to have a balanced budget by 2002. As a matter of fact, the news is fairly good on that front. We may actually achieve that balance before then. But, meanwhile, we are taking the appropriate steps to our transportation bill to conform with the responsibility that we have undertaken as a result of the budget agreement. We spent a lot of time and energy trying to ensure that transportation would be treated as the appropriate priority, as we see it. And it has some very positive results. 
The Coast Guard is going to get a 12.7 percent boost so that it can continue to execute its many essential missions. 
Funding for FAA will increase by almost 10 percent. Within that amount, we have rejected the proposal by the administration to cut airport improvement grants by more than 33 percent. Instead, we have provided an increase for airport grants of more than 16 percent. 
Funding for Federal-aid highways went to a historically high level of $21.5 billion. This increased funding will be especially critical as we address the many vexing challenges that currently surround the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA, or ISTEA II, or whatever the name is that we are going to give the next 6-year or 5-year program. 
Funding for formula assistance for the Nation's transit systems will increase by 16.3 percent. I want to point out that in my view this includes a balanced approach in addressing the needs of all of our States in all transportation modes. 
When the bill was first marked up, I voiced concern that while we were providing a much needed increase in funding for highways, the needs of the transit agencies were not getting appropriate attention. 
I am pleased to say that between the amendment I offered during full committee consideration of the bill and the final deliberations of the conference committee, the increase in formula funding for transit was brought to a level comparable with the increases in formula funding provided for other infrastructure investment programs in the bill. 
Moreover, I am pleased that the conference agreement includes my amendment to provide greater flexibility to all transit agencies, large and small, in the use of the Federal transit formula funds. 
Mr. President, all in all, as I said, I think it is a good outcome. 
The funding level for Amtrak is one that concerns me because Amtrak plays such an important part in the transportation of people throughout the Northeast corridor--and other parts of the country as well but predominantly in the Northeast corridor, and were we not to have Amtrak, which could be the outcome if we failed to fund it properly, we would need 10,000 additional flights of 737's a year between Boston and Washington and New York to accommodate the requirements for transportation. So that certainly does not look to be an outcome we can tolerate. But nevertheless the Congress has insisted on cutting Amtrak's operating subsidy at a much faster rate than they say they can absorb. 
Almost 3 years ago, the leadership of Amtrak developed an operating plan to reduce its dependency on Federal operating support. Their plan called for reduced appropriations in each and every year for 6 years. Unfortunately, for the last 2 years, the Congress has insisted on cutting Amtrak's operating subsidy at a much faster rate than Amtrak said it could absorb. 
Their financial status, therefore, is in dire straits. 
The bill initially laid down proposed some truly severe cuts, some of which could certainly put Amtrak into bankruptcy. But the subcommittee amended the funding level for Amtrak's operations account in the subcommittee and the full committee to get that level up to $344 million, which was the level requested by the administration. 
Also, Chairman Shelby agreed to hold a special hearing of the subcommittee to take a fresh look at Amtrak's operating needs. I am pleased to say that the final conference agreement includes the full $344 million for Amtrak's operations as passed by the Senate. It also includes needed boosts in Amtrak's critical capital accounts, and it will only be through this kind of capital investment that Amtrak can one day become free of Federal operating subsidies, which I, and I am sure all of us here, would like to see. 
However, we are not, I warn all Members, `out of the woods' with Amtrak. Amtrak has to gain access to more than $2 billion which was provided in the recently enacted tax bill so it can make the kind of capital investments that will bring us a real first-class passenger railroad, and we need to find a mechanism to do that without exacting punitive measures against the hard-working employees at Amtrak. 
On another issue, more parochial perhaps, Mr. President, I call attention to that portion of the conference agreement which pertains to the closure of Bader Field Airport in Atlantic City, NJ. The conferees carefully reviewed the statutory provisions pertaining to Bader Field as well as another airport that deserves to be closed. And after careful review, it was determined that statutory language was not necessary for the FAA to make the necessary findings. So I am pleased that the conference agreement continues our progress toward the closure of these airports as soon as possible. 
I want to take a minute, Mr. President, to thank my friend and colleague, Senator Shelby, for his ability to work closely with others to try to resolve disputes and see if we could do the best possible job with the resources that were available to us, and I think he has done just that. It was a pleasure working with him. As Senator Shelby noted, I was once the chairman of the committee, and I promised that should I become chairman again I would work with Senator Shelby just as carefully and courteously as he has worked with me. 
He has been consistently fair-minded in the distribution of funds between transportation modes and between projects. He has sought to accommodate the priorities of all Members of the Senate. That has been the longstanding tradition in the Transportation Subcommittee and it continues to be the tradition under Senator Shelby's leadership. 
I close by thanking my staff also, Peter Rogoff, and thank Senator Shelby's chief of staff, Tom Young, and Wally Burnett. It is a pleasure getting this done, and I am pleased to see that we have come fairly close to the beginning of the fiscal year in having a transportation bill which can take care of our needs for next year.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, once again, I thank you. 
Mr. President, we are about to consider a radical departure from the structure as we have known it to take care of our highway and transportation needs for the next 6 years. But I view this approach as somewhat premature and want to discuss what some of the problems are with it. As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and also, Mr. President, as having been the chairman of the Senate Transportation Subcommittee of Appropriations, and currently the ranking member, I view it from a particular vantage point. 
So I want to use this opportunity to alert my colleagues to some of the problems that I see with the bill and those opportunities perhaps to change it. I know, Mr. President, that when I discuss concerns with this bill that I also reflect----

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, once again I thank you. I sense that the excitement about the comments that I want to make has just overtaken the Senate and it is hard for people to settle down. But if they will settle down and listen, their fondest dreams will be realized. 
Mr. President, I think we ought to take some time to pause before we talk about amendments to the bill known as ISTEA to consider what it is that we are about to discuss, and amendments we will be offering once we are engaged in debate about the bill. But before we start that debate, again I want to point out what I think are some of the serious discrepancies in its development. 
I am not alone in my concerns about it. As I have indicated, other States--I know my friends and colleagues from Illinois have distinct concerns about it. I was particularly interested in a discussion that we had just a while ago in a conference with some of the Democratic Members to learn some of the facts about Illinois roads that I am sure the senior Senator from Illinois will want to discuss. Our colleagues from Massachusetts have some misgivings about the bill. The Senators from Maryland have also indicated the fact that they are not happy with what has been offered in this bill. My colleagues across the river in the State of New York have indicated to me that they are looking seriously at the bill, as other States not exactly in the Northeast corner have also indicated--as I mentioned, the State of Illinois. I know there are some concerns in the State of California and some concerns in the State of Pennsylvania. Again, I will not speak for those Senators, but those are the States where the formula change wound up dealing with these States in a fairly negative fashion. 
So, Mr. President, as we begin to discuss bringing this bill to the floor for discussion, it is time, I think, to begin debating not simply the motion to proceed but the substance of the bill. 
This 6-year authorization bill which governs transportation spending and planning is going to set the future of every State's transportation system into the next century. As we go forward with this debate, we better be sure that the serious transportation needs of the American people, of their businesses, of their jobs, of their regions, and their States are being met by this bill. 
Frankly, there is some good to be said for this legislation. I have my doubts that ultimately it achieves the goal that the distinguished chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the distinguished ranking member are seeking. Those are not the objectives that we see being met as we discuss the reauthorization of ISTEA. 
Transportation, as we all know, is not just about roads, rail, and bike trails. It is about the economy. It is about jobs. It is about moving goods efficiently and effectively. It is about building better communities. It is about a quality of life that surrounds our transportation networks or, in fact, is developed as a result of efficient and competent transportation infrastructure. It is about smart investment. It is about protecting our environment and human health. It is about quality of life in its fullest expanse. It is about making sure that we do what we can to leave a clean environment for future generations. It is about being more independent and not simply just asking other countries to supply us with oil at whatever price they determine the market will bear. We never know when that changes, as we saw if we look at history back just a couple of decades. 
So this is far more than simply, again, roads and rails and waterways. It is about quality of life. It also, frankly, tells us what America is going to be doing in the next century to be more competitive in this global marketplace. That is a very serious question for us, because as we see the European Union forming to establish its economies, we know they are going to be using the latest in technology. They have far, far better rail and transit systems than we see typically in our country--high-speed rail. We see roads where the pavement endures a far greater period of time than do those in our country and in our States. 
So we have to think very long and hard about how this Congress is going to make its mark on transportation investments and policies for the next 6 years. The question is, Does this legislation fully address the needs of the national transportation system and provide necessary funding and guidance where it is most needed? Do we consider transportation issues as if they affect the whole country? Because whether they are about roads in New Jersey or roads in Illinois or roads throughout the Northeast or North-South, the fact is it has a bearing on the way society functions, the way our country's economy produces. 
Sometimes those issues get lost, Mr. President, when we see the regional differences kind of expand, when we see that now suddenly in the closing period when the original version of ISTEA was produced, there is a change being attempted in a very short period of time to change formula, to change the way we function. I do not care which party is in power or which region of the country has more seniority. The fact is that we have to work together as a national enterprise because otherwise we will pay a price that is not yet seen nor understood. 
When we talk about a transportation bill, do we consider such critical factors as relieving choke points of congestion, ensuring adequate infrastructure in ports and along corridors to necessitate the free flow of goods, providing sufficient access to remote areas of the country. I know that we hear from Senators whose States are more rural than mine or some of the States that I have named in my list, but that does not mean that those people ought not have available transportation facilities so that they can get their children to school or get to the 
marketplace or get to their jobs. I am honestly concerned about that. The Senators from the more rural States know very well that Senator Frank Lautenberg from New Jersey has tried to preserve things like essential air service so that communities are not suddenly isolated and removed and not able to communicate with the rest of the world outside their direct boundary.

<TEXT>
Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Illinois for her question because it ties exactly into things that I see. The situation is not dissimilar, as I am sure the Senator is aware, from my State of New Jersey. Much as Chicago and environs in Illinois are just at the crossroads where the traffic flows east and west from the rich agricultural sectors of our country to the export opportunities at the ports on the east coast or the marketplaces on the east coast and to the places where habitation is large and the materials have to move rapidly in order to get there at an appropriate time for the product to be effective in the marketplace, we have the same thing. Our corridor is north-south. 
If one travels north-south in New Jersey, it helps originate some of the jokes that frankly I don't like about, `You live in New Jersey. What exit?' People, trying to make jokes--again, I think poor jokes--think of New Jersey as a large highway with some occasional rest stops along the way. But we carry that traffic. We want to play our role in the national being, in the national economy. 
We try to make it convenient for the trucks and the traffic to pass through expeditiously, but we can't do it unless we have particular funding addressed to those issues. Why should New Jersey be the recipient of foul air created by that incredible amount of vehicular traffic when it is not ours? We do not gouge the travelers at our service stations or towns. Our prices are in keeping with the marketplace because we want it to be a comfortable place. We don't want the trucks and everybody else to wind up in traffic congestion, spewing foul air. But we cannot pay for it entirely by ourselves. We are being asked to carry a load for the whole sector of the country. The Senator is right on the mark, and I hope she will take note of that as she evaluates this bill that is being proposed.

<DOCNO>105-lautenberg-nj-16-19971008</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. LAUTENBERG. We certainly must consider that. If one looks back to the origination of the highway system, going back into the 1950's, much of that was designed to assure that, if necessary, our defense capability was strong, that we could move the traffic, move the equipment, move the personnel rapidly through our society. And that cannot be ignored. So that all of these things relate to the same needs. 
That emphasizes the fact--and once again I am grateful to my colleague and friend from Illinois--it emphasizes the fact that this has to be considered a national enterprise. And, suddenly, one region's gain against another's does little for the country. It may look like a new sector is gaining something. They gain nothing if they don't have the marketplace, if they don't have the access, if we can't move our troops and equipment, Heaven forbid at a critical time, rapidly and efficiently. Then we have lost a lot more than the simple gain from an adjustment, untimely as this one, frankly, seems to be.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. My answer is that if there was--and there has been--a concern about the formulas by which funds were distributed, that a review is certainly in order. But the review, in my view, ought to take place in an orderly fashion so it can be debated here on the floor, so it can be debated in the respective committees. There are several committees that have jurisdiction over parts of this. So it takes a little bit of time to get this done. 
Now, because we have procrastinated so long in getting this done, it seems we have to rush to put in the new bill. Something that affects so much of the way we function as a society I think deserves more than a rush to judgment. Frankly, my offhand suggestion would be that we extend the current bill for a period of time. And I think 6 months would be a disaster; probably a year, so that we can consider in a thoughtful forum what we ought to be looking at. 
The Senator mentioned something very interesting. Right now there has been a change in the manner, the philosophy of the way this body operates. Power has moved in a particular direction. But what goes around comes around, as is said. Are we going to be looking at changes in structure for something as important as our transportation infrastructure differently every time there is a power shift? If it's Democrats one time and Republicans the next; if it's western one time and eastern or southern or central the next, will we therefore at that point in time suddenly make changes that take care of our region? Do you know what that will produce? Everyone knows what that will produce: Chaos. It will produce competition at the worst level. 
I see it now in State after State, where some States are willing to modify their environmental requirements, willing to modify their labor requirements, to try to steal business from another State. What good does it do us in the final analysis? It does us no good because eventually the price is paid. I am going to talk about that a little bit later. 
My State is a State that has prospered. We benefited from some of the ingenuity that went into the development of the industrial revolution. Much of it took place in the State of New Jersey. Edison and his numerous inventions were largely out of New Jersey. We have a high-technology business in pharmaceuticals and electronics and computers. As the Senator knows, I was in the computer business before I came to the Senate. Some days, ruefully, I look back, especially payday. But the fact of the matter is that we are a high-technology State and thus we have been able to create a pretty good job market. 
The result is that New Jersey is No. 50 among States--last--in getting a return on the tax dollars it sends here to Washington. And I hear about it from all of my constituents, let me tell you. They don't understand why it is we are sending money down here and, where we have a slight advantage, which has been in ISTEA, the transportation bill, suddenly now it is being taken away. The question is being asked back home, whether by a newspaper or in town meetings or just individual discussions: Are they after New Jersey again? Do they want to make us pay more of our tax dollars into the national interest so States that are poverty stricken or don't have the job network or don't have the economic infrastructure that we have, they want to take it again from New Jersey? My answer, unfortunately, has to be, `I think so.' Because that is the way it looks, based on what the formulas are. 
I want to see the day when we stand on the floor of this U.S. Senate and we talk about distributions of tax dollars received here in Washington. Maybe what we ought to do is put this under an umbrella that says everybody gets 100 cents on the dollar. Every State, send your money to Washington, you get it back. We will see how the roads that cross through some States function; and we will see how welfare, and how education 
assistance, and nutrition for children gets taken care of in those States.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Once again, I say to my colleague from Illinois, I agree fully with the response that was elicited, because of the nature of the question. It is our Nation. It is a national goal. It is a national objective and we have to keep that in mind. 
I know the Senator from Illinois shares my view that when an emergency comes in our country, and whether it be floods or earthquakes or tornadoes, our hearts are breaking here. I say, this was across party lines, both parties. When we saw the people in North Dakota and South Dakota and States like that during the flood, I never voted against funding for FEMA, for our Federal Emergency Management Agency, or those actions that were taken to get a community restored after a natural disaster. It is then and then only, it seems, that we are reminded that we are a national unit, that we are a national federation, that we are one country. 
Suddenly we will spring into action when it comes to relieving the distress that results from a natural disaster; a consequence. We have to keep that in mind when we look here at what we are doing on the floor of the U.S. Senate today. That is, ensuring that all States in all parts of the country are treated with a degree of fairness. I know we will hear from other colleagues who say: Well, New Jersey has been a donee State, gotten back more than it has sent down in gasoline tax. 
I say yes, that is true. That is true. It was the only place, as I mentioned earlier, that we could make up for the deficiency in return on our tax dollars that we usually get from the transmissions that we make. So this is why I am so intent on making sure that this new piece of legislation, this reauthorization, this NEXTEA, or whatever we want to call it, reflects the fact that New Jersey is being shortchanged here as are these other seven or eight States, drastically shortchanged, and that we want to try to restore it if he we can and bring sense to the thing. We will have an earnest debate, however long that takes, to see that the adjustments are properly made. 
The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, known as ISTEA, expired less than 2 weeks ago. ISTEA in its origination was far-reaching and visionary, and we ought to keep that as a theme for what we are doing now. It declared for the first time that the interstate system was complete and that transportation policy and planning should shift the focus from building eight-lane highways to improving the transportation systems in our communities. 
Earlier transportation policies specifically encouraged people to abandon existing communities and cities in favor of new development in previously untouched green spaces--the suburbs.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the suburbs have become the residential location of choice, and traffic patterns have shifted accordingly. I have seen it, once again, in my own State, and I have seen it in bordering States, where a new highway will be built which is designed to serve traffic that exists there and traffic that might develop. Within no time--and I say this, again, coming from the most densely populated State in the Union--in no time, there are traffic jams on those highways, be it Highway 78, Highway 24 or Highway 80. I can give you the list of highways that were built which looked like they were the highways of the future and, before you know it, they are the highways of yesterday, because people took advantage of the opportunity to move out of town: `Let's get out of here.' 
It hasn't spoken very well of our urban policy, I will tell you that, because what happened in the grand design that emerged in the early fifties by my former commander in chief, also the commander in chief of the Senator from Rhode Island, then became President, was a system for national highway transportation that had an unfortunate consequence. The distinguished Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, often talks about how it enabled people to leave the problems of the cities behind, move out to the suburbs and, as a consequence, we have had the despair that has followed in the cities because the revenue bases were taken away from them. 
We found out that that is not a particularly good policy for America and that we have to make sure we have a balanced transportation network, one that permits a city dweller to get to work in another part of the city or another city, just as it does to aid the rural resident in getting to his or her place of work and the needs that each of the families has. 
A 1996 report conducted by the Eno Transportation Foundation entitled `Commuting in America II,' found that today, the dominant commuting flow pattern is suburban, with 50 percent of the Nation's commuters living in the suburbs and over 41 percent of all jobs located there, up from 37 percent in 1980. Suburban areas are now the main destination of work trips. The report also found there was a substantial increase in reverse commuting, central city to suburbs, commuting rose from 9 percent share of growth over the decade from 1970 to 1980 to 12 percent from 1980 to 1990. 
However, earlier transportation policies also discouraged land use planning, creating new and growing congestion around new and growing communities. While our cities died, our metropolitan areas grew too quickly and overwhelmed the infrastructure. So there is a paradox here: In one way, the cities were falling moribund and, in another way, suddenly these metropolitan areas just grew around them and became almost the definition of--certainly far more than a metropolis. The suburban sprawl drew industry to the suburbs and drained cities of income and jobs. This trend continues today and is even expanding. 
The effect of this trend on such critical issues as quality of life, safety, the environment and economic development is undeniable. I want to read from a study by the Surface Transportation Policy Project. It said:  
One of the most far-reaching effects of our transportation spending patterns is the increasingly spread-out pattern of American cities. The results of this new pattern range from the loss of open space-- 
We know that happens regularly. sprawl consumes a million and a half acres of farmland each year--to more driving and the problems it creates. 
One study found that vehicle miles traveled per household increased by 25 to 30 percent when residential density is cut in half. Just think about it. Vehicle miles traveled per person increased by 25 to 30 percent when residential density was cut in half. 
Do you know what that means, Mr. President? Cars, cars, cars, cars, cars. And how do you handle them efficiently is a large question. We have talked at times about the elimination of Amtrak as a real possibility if we don't tend to its capital needs, the elimination of our only major inter-city passenger rail service in the country. Look at what happens if that disappears. 
If it disappears, the airspace between Boston and Washington would require that we put up 10,000 737 flights a year or more. Can you imagine? Right now, look at Newark Airport. It is beautifully designed, a very progressive airport. Constant delays. Why? Because the airspace above the airport cannot accommodate the number of flights we would require. 
Look at the highways. It would put hundreds of thousands of cars or more per year on the highways between Boston, New York, and Washington. Not a terribly good idea. 
ISTEA was designed to try and grapple with these problems in trends in a fair, sound, and efficient manner. It sought to employ sounder land-use planning by incorporating communities into the process. It recognized good transportation policy does not mean simply pouring more concrete and asphalt. Instead, it focused on moving goods and people in a way that makes the most sense for our Nation, our States, our economy, and our communities. 
ISTEA increased planning and flexibility and placed emphasis on local decisionmaking, encouraged new technology and made environmental and social needs a priority. I saw some of that new technology in place yesterday when a coalition of firms appeared in the Capitol and showed us what might be by way of new transportation opportunities with the use of technology. 
They talked about an experiment near San Diego, CA. A 7.2-mile section of road was equipped with magnets. We heard from someone from the Department of Federal Highways about a ride that she was taking at fairly high speeds, the normal speed for this section of the country on these highways. She suddenly realized that her driver was reading USA Today looking at the sports section. 
I asked if he got in the back seat and she drove the car. She said, no, he was still in the front seat behind the wheel, and here he was reading a newspaper as he was traveling along at 60 to 70 miles per hour. They employed new technology, and when they equip the cars with the appropriate transmission and receiving response from the magnets on the highways, they are able to move along with the traffic. You can go to sleep if you want to, and if the traffic slows, the vehicle slows. 
It is a wonderful thing, but it needs investment. In order to do that, we have to make sure that our transportation planning incorporates all of these suggestions, as well as more highways and more transportation opportunities are made available. 
I know that in the New York-New Jersey region, there is a new technology to pay tolls. It is relatively painless until you get the bill, and then you see it has been a daunting experience. But with just a little device put on the windshield, you can ride through tolls on the George Washington Bridge, and the other bridges and highways around the New York area. It is going to be expanded. It shows what can happen when there is cooperation among various agencies on a bi-State basis. You can improve things without impairing any State's right to grow and develop. It is working very well. That is just a small precursor of what we might expect in the future if we employ technology properly. 
Those are the kinds of things that we have to think about as we invest in our transportation system. 
ISTEA is where this regard for technology really developed. It was then called Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems. I was the author of much of that part of the bill. I tried something different. I tried to develop what we might call intelligent drivers. It was an impossible task, Mr. President. So instead, we tried to develop intelligent technologies so that the car would take over driving; it didn't have to depend on the driver's emotion to keep it cool and keep it straight. 
It worked very well. The advances are just beginning to develop. That is so consistent with what our future planning ought to be about that we have to make sure that everything is encompassed in this very important piece of legislation. 
ISTEA increased planning and flexibility, placed emphasis on local decisionmaking, encouraged new technology and made environment and social needs a priority. 
ISTEA strongly reaffirmed the Federal commitment in transportation planning and investment. While the Nation's existing infrastructure continues to decay and we face reduced budgets, economic competition demands ever increasing efficiency and growth. Federal policy should continue to emphasize these goals while empowering local and regional governments to make their own decisions on transportation investment. As we approach the close of the 20th century, we need to build upon ISTEA's successes to prepare for more intense global economic and technological competition. 
Transportation investment has a direct and indirect impact on our economy and society. Transportation by itself generates 20 percent of the gross domestic product. Each billion dollars invested in transportation produces more than 25,000 construction-related jobs. A sound, efficient, and innovative transportation system will make a major contribution to national efforts to match the productivity of our trading partners. 
As we begin to consider the next surface transportation reauthorization bill, we need to think more deeply about what it is that we really want to achieve. The most important goal is to ensure a sound transportation system, one that recognizes that commerce and travel does not necessarily stop at a State's border. It recognizes that we are a nation of States and not autonomous nation-States. Our economy depends on the free and efficient flow of goods. It depends on one sector taking advantage of its natural opportunities, be it agriculture or lumber or other things, while another State takes care of its availability of energy and another takes advantage of its ability in telecommunications and electronics. 
That is what makes us the Nation that we are. I have great respect for the farming and agricultural population of our country. The exchange of opportunity for them is important to me. I cooperate, as I said earlier, when they need flood control measures or irrigation opportunities. That then ought to beget reciprocation from those parts of the country when we look at a State like New Jersey, an industrial State. 
The distinguished occupant of the chair is not at liberty to answer, but I will pose a rhetorical question. That is, which State has the most horses per acre of any State in the country? I will answer because I know that the occupant of the chair, being a Senator from Wyoming, would love to respond, but I will take advantage of my position having the microphone to answer. It is New Jersey. New Jersey has more horses per acre than any other State in the country. 
That surprises people because they think of us as having more smokestacks than any other part of the country. Well, the fact is that New Jersey is a place where people like to live, horses like to live, and we raise them. We do not have, I do not think, the bucking bronco type that we see in Wyoming, but we have horses fleet of foot and the headquarters of the equestrian society in this country. 
So we are interconnected, interrelated. That is what intermodal talks about. Simply put, that means the success of our transportation policy cannot always be measured by an evaluation of dollar-for-dollar return on gas consumption or other criteria that denies real transportation problem solutions and trends confronting the entire Nation. 
I would wager--and I have traveled across most of this country, so that I have seen small cities in less populated States--one thing I have noticed is that they all have something in common, the cities in my State and the cities in other States. They have traffic congestion at the wrong time--at perhaps the right time, because that is when people are commuting from work and from school and from home and shopping and all of those things. 
Our policy should not be designed to pit State against State but should be designed for effective, efficient, and economically sound transportation, while at the same time it encourages rational and reasonable planning and new construction to meet anticipated new growth. 
As I have said, I fear that for all of its good intention, this bill does not succeed in accomplishing this goal. We need one national transportation policy to promote a national system. In an era of a shrinking budget, the least we should do is prioritize our investments, the least that we should do is to ensure that our existing transportation system is adequately maintained and preserved before there are significant investments in new capacity. 
Unfortunately, the incentive at the State and local level is to build new roads, complete with ribbon-cutting ceremonies and all of the hoopla that goes along with an occasion like that, but to rather do that, it seems, than the less glamorous job of investing in the proper maintenance of existing roads. That is a less glamorous pursuit and does not get the same kind of interest. But if you are driving along and you are bouncing on potholes and you can't get by road construction projects, it is quickly understood. 
Since 1991, more than half of the highway money available for repairs and to be spent in metropolitan areas has been diverted to State departments of transportation to pay for the construction of new highways. This, in my judgment, is a bad way to invest. Building a new road costs far more per mile than repairing an existing one. 
New roads in metropolitan areas have been estimated to cost as much as $1 billion a mile. And I can give a specific example in the New York metropolitan area. In contrast, the Federal Highway Administration estimates that it costs approximately $1.26 million for 1 mile of pavement reconstruction on urban highways. 
Put another way, the way to fix what we have in favor of building new capacity also costs money. The FHWA estimated the cost of routine maintenance of pavement in good condition at about 8 cents per square foot, whereas the cost of rehabilitating failed pavement was closer to 80 cents per square foot--10 times the amount that it would require if it was maintained in good condition. 
There is another thing, and we have been reading a lot about it of late, and that is the time that pavement lasts in other countries, especially in Europe, is far, far longer than we see in our country. We ought to be looking at that problem as we review our highway needs to see whether we can get longer use out of existing roads without having, again, construction blockades and things of that nature. 
This bill as written abandons ISTEA's programs that place emphasis on preservation and maintenance of the existing infrastructure in favor of laying new roadbed. In my opinion, we are headed in the wrong direction. We must first take care of what we have rather than spend billions of dollars on new paving. 
Mr. President, I have not risen to speak in order to deny new transportation needs. That is not my mission, because I have had a long record of involvement with transportation. I am in the Senate now 15 years and have been involved with transportation for all of those years, because in my State transportation is the lifeblood of our existence. 
So I favor spending more money on transportation infrastructure. I favor the modality of rail and high-speed trains and aviation and highways and waterways. We are now seeing a proliferation in the New York area of ferries crossing the Hudson River and the East River to get people from State to State without having to wait for long lines through tunnels and bridges and congestion, and working very well. 
So all of these things have to be considered. I want us to invest in all of them. What I am talking about this very day is to consider that these are national obligations and we ought to invest accordingly. 
Any legislation we consider and pass should recognize the fact that what we face in critical transportation corridors is crumbling infrastructure, roadways that are falling apart and unable to bear the load they carry. 
My plea here is for prudence and sound economic policy. What I am talking about is ensuring that our tax dollars are used wisely and well and that our transportation policies will meet the real needs of both today and the next century. 
We underinvest in our transportation infrastructure, Mr. President. Our Nation's future standard of living depends on our infrastructure. Yet, for many years we have failed to make needed investments, and Americans are paying a price for this failure. In metropolitan and suburban areas throughout our country traffic congestion has become a major problem. Commuters waste hour after hour sitting in traffic. They sit in their cars unproductive, tempers running away from them, time lost, time away from families, away from spouses, away from children. It is a terrible waste of time, and it is eroding the quality of life for millions of Americans. 
Our roads are not being maintained. Potholes mar our streets and highways. Bridges are deteriorating. Our railroads and transit systems are not being maintained sufficiently nor being invested in sufficiently to take advantage of new technologies. 
Too many airports are underequipped, and delays are rampant. The sky can be used far more efficiently than we are using it. We get tied up with weather delays in this country. In other countries, some of them have figured out how to land in weather in which it is almost ground zero. It is because the technology is available. We do not use those techniques in our country. The scope of these problems is enormous, Mr. President. 
In 1994, the Federal Highway Administration estimated that 57 percent of all roads have been allowed to deteriorate into poor quality, into mediocre or fair condition. They also estimated that 30 percent of major urban roads suffer from congestion. 
According to the 1995 National Bridge Inventory, there are 186,000 structurally deficient or functionally obsolete bridges. That is a terrible condition. We have seen the bridge collapses. We have seen tieups around bridges. We have seen sudden emergency calls to replace the bridges which cannot be done in a hurry. We ought to be taking care of the maintenance of these things in a proper fashion. 
Mr. President, failing to meet our transportation infrastructure has real economic needs. One study estimated that congestive roads in our Nation's 25 largest urban areas costs motorists $43 billion annually in wasted time and fuel-- $43 billion. I guess when it is said like this, the impact isn't real. When it is translated into costs per person or cost per family, it comes down to a significant burden that we all have to carry. 
Another study estimates that American motorists spent an additional $21.5 billion in extra vehicle operating costs in 1994 as a result of driving on roads in poor or fair condition. 
I will not identify the community, but I was driving Friday night, it was after dark, about 8 o'clock at night, and I hit a pothole that was so deep that I thought the wheels fell off my car. I got out to see if there was any damage, and I could not see it. But this thing was 1 1/2 feet deep. Imagine hitting that if you are going 30 miles an hour and suddenly--and it had to be 2 feet wide, so it caught the wheel very, very fully. 
We see it all the time in all the States across the country. I hear about the condition of roads. The Senator from Illinois held up a newspaper article in which it said Illinois had among the worst roadways in the country. Well, I think that can be imagined by lots of people as they travel the roads in their own States. It is an inexplicable condition that arises around when we say that we want things to be better but we are unwilling to make the investments in maintenance and care that we ought to. 
Meaning no slight to the auto and truck repair industry, with statistics like these it is clear that at least one sector of our economy will continue to prosper if these conditions are not addressed. 
According to the Department of Transportation, in 1994, $57 billion in capital investment would have been required from all levels of Government just to maintain--now that is in 1994, $57 billion would have been required just to maintain 1993 conditions in performance. Imagine that. In 1 year we created a need for $57 billion in capital just to maintain the level of quality that existed on our roads. 
In 1993, by comparison, we spent only $40 billion on highway and transit capital investment compared to the $57 billion that would have been required a year later. 
In other words, to simply maintain current conditions and performance on our highway and transit systems we would have to have increased investments by over 40 percent. This kind of dramatic underinvestment, Mr. President, simply cannot be sustained without our entire country paying a severe price in the long run. Keep in mind, Mr. President, that what we need to do more than simply maintain current conditions of performance if America is going to compete successfully in the future, we need to make improvements, as well. There is just no escaping the need for a greater commitment of resources. 
For example, to invest in all those highway improvements that would yield greater benefits than costs, the Department of Transportation estimates we would have to invest $80 billion. In other words, to improve conditions to optimal levels based on economic and engineering factors, we have to double our current capital investment in highway and transit. 
We, in this body, often talk about the importance of the marketplace in driving the economy. Well, Mr. President, I have owned, started, and operated a business and I know firsthand that investment in the long term is required. The first question that we should ask of any legislation that purports to address transportation needs is whether in the long term it is going to help or hinder our Nation's ability to compete effectively in the global marketplace, and whether it will meet the needs of our citizens on a day-to-day and year-to-year basis. 
I feel especially strongly about the importance of transportation because in my State, as I said earlier, it is critical.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. It certainly is. To answer the question of the Senator even more broadly, the fact of the matter is that in this change in program some States have had adjustments that are as high as 48 or 50 percent over their previous year, while other States took a cut. So when the Senator asks is it critical to every State, absolutely. 
In a State like that of the Senator from Maryland or my State, it has a unique character because of the crowded conditions under which our people live--densely populated States, metropolitan States.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I could not agree more. 
What has happened is the proposed formula is a much more mathematical exercise. It says if you put in this dollar's worth of gas tax, that you have to get back your dollar's worth of investment in the highways. 
On the other hand, States like yours and States like mine get a far less return on our total tax dollars, those dollars sent to the Federal Government, than many or most States in the 
country. In my case, we happen to be number 50 in return on dollars that we send down to Washington. This was one place that there was an opportunity to regain some of the advantage that was rightfully ours, and it is being ignored. 
So to answer the Senator's question, there are many conditions that ought to be evaluated in terms of a national transportation investment that go beyond simply the dollar-for-dollar return on gas tax. It ought to consider what contribution does the State of Maryland, does the State of Rhode Island, does the State of New Jersey make to the national economy, to the national well-being as a result of having its roads available and open and in decent condition so that traffic that goes from place to place--from the market, from the farm to the port, from the factory to the airport--what kind of a return ought we to get for that? What kind of compensation ought we get for that?

Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is correct, and it is an appropriate deficiency to note. 
By the way, as the Senator talks about the State of Maryland and a change in formula, ours goes from 2.82 to 2.41. There is a difference of more than 15 percent in just that change in formula. 
The Senator was not in the Chamber when I talked about the fact that if changes were necessitated in formula, they should have been debated at length. They should have had the appropriate kind of committee reviews. I know the Senator sits on the committee where transit needs are considered. We have the Commerce Committee involved with aviation and rail, we have the Environment Committee on which I sit and under whose auspice this bill is presented for highway and road travel. To suddenly change that formula without considering the national aspects of the requirements that Maryland has imposed upon it or that New Jersey has imposed upon it--Maryland happens to be in a critical location in terms of our defense needs. If there is an emergency, we have to be able to move troops and equipment through in a hurry. That readiness costs something to maintain. 
There is also a requirement, I know the State of Maryland shares with New Jersey an interest in having high-speed rail service pass through your State and commuter rail service. Look at the success we have seen just with the establishment of WAMATA. The investments in those areas are critical if we are going to have a national perspective. 
Can you imagine a system to serve the Capital and environs that isn't contributed to in significant measure by the Federal Government? As it happens, it is, but it describes very poignantly the need that exists when you participate in a national scheme.

I had an observation earlier today in a discussion that we had in miniconference out here that more money is more money, except that if more money comes and we continue to lose our share, it doesn't do what we think it ought to do, which is to improve the system generally, but not at the expense of our respective States. That is really the nub of our discussion.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I hear the Senator from Montana's interests and concerns. I know that he is sincere. We have worked together for many years, as I had with the chairman of the committee. But if this bill goes as it is, the chances for recovery, I think, are pretty slim. And once in place, we will be running uphill to try and recover. 
What I would rather see is some kind of a consensus developed that includes the States that are now disadvantaged. I was looking at the States and I see that percentage points in a State that borders both of our States--Pennsylvania--is down to 20-some percent from its formula share from where it was --22 percent, I think. We can't deal in this room, at the moment, with the poor fate that befell Pennsylvania. I don't know how their Senators are going to respond to it. I think if an adjustment is going to be made in the formula, there has to be a period of transition so that States are held harmless from where they were as adjustments take place. This isn't to suggest that review is out of order, not at all. I think reviews of the formula are always in order. But I think the Senator from Maryland made an important contribution to this debate when he highlighted the national interests and national obligations that some of our States have, being corridor States, as expressed earlier by the Senator from Illinois. A corridor that runs east and west produces a lot of traffic through the State of Illinois.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Senator is right. The fact of the matter is that among the items that have to be considered in establishing a proper formula has to be the amount of mileage recorded within the States' roadbed systems. In my State we have north-south I-95, east-west through to I-80, and all kinds of cargo and material pass over these roads and cause enormous traffic congestion in New Jersey. Our roads are beat up, with heavy trucks taking more than their fair share of the abuse. We stand there and kind of grin and bear it. But it is in the national interest. 
If one wants to use an analogy, we have to look at what happens in environmental legislation. New Jersey, being in the location that we are on the east coast, is the unfortunate recipient of material carried by the prevailing winds from west to east. They carry all of the pollutants and all of the particulate that is thrown up by stacks across the rust belt, or the iron belt, or the steel belt in the midwestern States. Some of that material travels hundreds of miles to arrive at its place of deposition, which is New Jersey, Maryland, and New York, in the eastern States. 
So, as we consider environmental legislation, we try to accommodate what causes the problem. The problem is caused by the energy and industrial nature of things from the Midwest. That is part of the formula. Here we are saying, listen, as we create new formulas, we ought to debate them more thoroughly and let's talk about the congestion on our roads that we receive as a result of being a corridor State. 
New Jersey is a corridor State. Commerce travels in the Northeast and the rest of the country. Over 60 billion--with a `b'--vehicle miles are traveled on my State's roads annually. Our State is the Garden State. It is one of the most important links in our Nation's transportation system. 
The Senator from Maryland talked about the value of the port. I know that the Senator from Rhode Island, the chairman of the committee, is trying valiantly to improve the efficiency of the port outside of Providence by making sure that there is rail access and truck access that is good. I respect him. And, frankly, I see it as a positive thing for my State of New Jersey. Could it be competitive? Of course, it could be competitive. But I don't look at it that way. I think our country is obligated to continue to produce to the best of our ability to the maximum of our capacity. So we need these facilities. 
So whether it is specifically located in New Jersey or Maryland or Rhode Island, the fact of the matter is that what happens in the West, what happens in the South, and what happens in the center of the country depends very much on the capacity of our States in the East to be able to help their export market, which is such a big part of things, and also the industrial market because parts go from one place to another and assemblies are done in different States often than where most of the parts are manufactured. It is an essential part of our national being. Ten percent of the Nation's total freight either originates, terminates, or passes through New Jersey. Almost 60 percent of this tonnage is strictly through traffic. 
Imagine that, 10 percent. Goods traveling just 24 hours on a truck from New Jersey will reach a market of 40 percent of the population of the United States and Canada--over 100 million people. 
Mr. President, these aren't just cars from New Jersey; they are vehicles from every State in the Nation, as well as Canada, Mexico, and other nations. 
In short, and to rephrase an old joke--I don't like jokes about my State--but if you are traveling on the east coast and you don't go through New Jersey, you just can't get there from here. 
Millions of people travel along New Jersey's highways. They travel from the South, the West, New York City, Boston, and New England. People in New York and New England on their journeys travel to places like the sea shore, Florida, Washington, DC, the Eastern Shore, or trying to get to Long Island Sound and sallying up out of Rhode Island and those places. So we have to make sure that our roads are efficient and functioning, and that we are not drowning in pollution. 
Every day 324,000 tons of goods made in my State of New Jersey are transported on New Jersey's roads by 134,000 trucks. Many of these trucks are coming from the ports of Newark and Elizabeth. They are transporting cars and other goods that arrive from countries like South Korea, Great Britain, Germany, Taiwan, and Indonesia. The entire port of New York and New Jersey is the busiest port on the east coast. Despite the critical importance of New Jersey's infrastructure to the Nation, it is in dismally poor shape and getting worse by the hour, by the day, and by the week. Nearly 20 percent of New Jersey's interstate mileage is in poor or mediocre condition, and more than 45 percent of our bridges are in deficient condition. They are functionally obsolete in many cases. 
Mr. President, New Jersey's roads and bridges take an unbelievable pounding in hot summers, and harsh winters take a huge toll on our infrastructure. Road salt in the winter and ocean salt year round add to the damage. 
In addition, New Jerseyans and those who travel through my State often face unbearable congestion. Travelers in cars and trucks struggle for hours every day with New Jersey's highway stops and starts, and our heavily used roads and bridges are badly in need of additional maintenance. 
Mr. President, the status of New Jersey's transportation infrastructure has a direct effect on the State and the region's economic vitality and on every resident's quality of life. But more importantly, it affects the entire Nation's economic vitality. The future challenges to that infrastructure are ominous. In the next 6 years there probably will be more travel on our roads, more cargo coming into our ports, and more rapid deterioration of our transportation infrastructure. That is not a particularly pleasant prospect, and I think that we have to prepare for it in the best possible way. The best possible way is to recognize that States like mine and those such as the State of Maryland have unique conditions that have to be met. 
I once again would like to review and restate the number of States that are included--Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, California, and Massachusetts, to name but a few. There are eight States in all that seem to have the heaviest share of the load. Unfortunately, the ISTEA bill before us does not adequately respond to the challenge that we face. It doesn't address New Jersey's growing needs. 
Note that the highway title addresses density on highways, or congestion. While it recognizes the particular situation of some States, when it comes to heavily used, densely populated urban States with significant commerce and trade traffic, the bill is virtually silent. If a State's motorists choose to not guzzle gas, either by using mass transit, walking, or biking, this bill will penalize them. Therefore, it has to be improved. I am not saying that New Jersey should get more than its fair share. I am simply saying, Mr. President, that it should and must get its fair share--nothing more, nothing less. The bill just doesn't do that. 
Mr. President, there is another bit of word and verbiage that goes into the debate on highways. We talk about donor States and donee States. The distinguished colleague of ours from Louisiana said you can't explain that to the folks back home and said they want to see whether or not their road and their infrastructure is getting attention, whether the potholes are being filled, and whether the roads are being maintained in a suitable fashion. 
So I get tired of hearing complaints that emanate from the so-called donor States. To make it very simple for any who might be listening or watching, donor States are those that send down more in tax revenues, gasoline taxes in particular, than they get back. The others are called donee States. The donor States complain about how they don't get their fair share of highway and transit funding. Many of those donor States do quite well when one examines the total of Federal return on the dollar. Many of these States simply don't have the same needs as New Jersey and other high-density transportation corridors. 
Mr. President, when it comes to defense spending, spending by the Interior Department, agriculture spending, many urbanized, densely populated States come out year after year after year as big losers. But we have not said yet that the Government must spend as much on national parks in our region as we spend in western States. We have not yet demanded an equal share of the defense spending or an equal share of agricultural spending. It is not realistic. Those States that now have these investments being made have particular needs. 
Those needs strike me as being part of the national requirement. If there is a national park in Colorado, I would like to see it maintained because in visits by my constituents or my family or people from around the country, I want them to be proud of it. I want them to say, why, there is nothing prettier than Estes Park and other parks that exist in Colorado, and so it should be. I want to make sure if airspace is needed so that our airplanes can fly and practice and train--our Air Force Academy is in the State of Colorado--we continue to invest in that and in that skill we have. I think it is going to be more required in the future. But a large part of that investment vests in Colorado. So what. It is part of my national interest. 
Or an equal share of agriculture spending. New Jersey is still called the Garden State, and despite the density of population that we have--the most densely populated State in the country, I remind everybody--about 25 percent of our State is still forested, and that is really pleasant to see. I see it often from airplanes. We have one reserve that is a million acres today. But we are not looking for assistance with our agriculture, even though our farmers perform an important service for the community, because these demands are unrealistic. They do not take into account the real needs of the entire Nation. They do not consider that there is a benefit for all Americans by strategically focusing resources to meet critical problems. 
I said earlier and I repeat, when floods took over the Dakotas and parts of Minnesota or Missouri, I wanted us as a country to help out, and I was very vocal about it. I felt it was a responsibility that we had, again, to confirm that we are one nation. 
The fact is each State has its own individual needs, and they change from time to time. New Jerseyans send $15 billion more per year to Washington than they receive in total Federal dollar return--$15 billion more. The Federal Government's job is to apportion funding where need is greatest, and sometimes we swallow hard and we say, if one State has a higher need for family spending, welfare, OK, we are willing to take some share of that. 
On the other hand, Mr. President, when it is our turn, I think we ought to get some consideration. The one area where we are a donee State is transportation, and that is because there was some recognition that so much of the Nation's traffic load was carried by the State of New Jersey. But now the intention is to change it. If I may say so--and I do not mean to castigate --the fact is that it was almost whimsical in its development, because States like mine took some pretty big hits. 
Well, my State and my region's needs are largely in transportation. That is our equivalent to agriculture for Iowa and Nebraska and those States. We are in the most densely populated part of the country, with some of the most highly traveled and congested roads. Anyone who has driven the New Jersey Turnpike, Route 1, Atlantic City Expressway, Interstate 80 can attest to these needs. As I have already noted, many of these vehicles on these highways are from States other than New Jersey. My kids used to love to play a game when they were little. We would write down the States from the license plates that we saw, and we would get pretty close to 49 besides ours because there were so many. I didn't always enjoy being in the middle of that confluence of traffic, but at least it kept the kids seated. 
Mr. President, New Jersey isn't just asking from the Federal Government transportation dollars. We are investing our own funds in our infrastructure as well. State and local governments in New Jersey spend more highway dollars per lane mile than any other State in the Nation--our money, reinvested in our infrastructure. We made this commitment to transportation simply because our needs were so great. But that does not excuse getting our fair share from the Federal Government. 
There is nothing in any study, census projection, or economic trend to indicate that these needs will diminish in the future. In fact, quite the opposite is true. Some States are arguing that they should get back at least 90 percent of those payments they have made into the highway trust fund. But I still think that their needs have to be examined before that return is justified. It is part of a contribution to the national well-being, and it makes no sense to take away funds from regions that have greater needs. 
I remind everyone that we are a single nation, one nation, and not a collection of autonomous sovereignties. Can you imagine what would have happened if at the Constitutional Convention our delegates included a clause in the Constitution mandating that each State must get back from the Federal Government 90 percent of what it paid in taxes? What would have happened to our country? We have people now who individually say, well, I don't want to pay for this. We have people from extremes on the right like militia who say, I don't want to pay for the kind of liberal judicial system that we have, or I do not want to pay for that program or this program. Then we have 
people on the other side who say, I am unwilling to have my dollars go for defense needs. But we say, too bad; you are an American; you are part of American society. You are part of a great nation. You are part of a country the likes of which has never existed on this Earth before and perhaps never will again. But we say, that's your obligation. We are one country. We are one people with sometimes different actions, but we come together when we have to. 
Those of us old enough to have served in World War II saw it, as did the distinguished chairman of the Environment Committee, who had a very distinguished war record. Mine was not so distinguished, but I did what I had to in Europe in World War II. We came together as a country. We sometimes forget that obligation, that we are one nation and we ought not to pick at one another's opportunities or advantage and say, OK, you've got this because you are a donee State and therefore we are going to take it away from you. 
Unless the whole picture is examined, it is not a complete one. We certainly never could have maintained our great national parks and forests; we could never have saved thousands of family farms from bankruptcy in difficult economic times; we could never afford to pay for emergency relief from earthquakes, floods or hurricanes; we would certainly not have a national transportation system; some States would have paved roads and some States would have dirt roads; there would be no interstate highway system, no airports in rural areas if we said it wasn't part of the national responsibility. 
I repeat that I am a supporter of essential air service for which the Federal Government pays a significant subsidy. For every passenger that flies into some of those airports, the Federal Government will pay two or three times, four times the cost for the seat because we do not want to see those communities isolated. They are very dependent. So we say, OK, it is part of an obligation we have. We certainly wouldn't have a national passenger rail system. It may be more regional than national, but it travels through important regions of the country. I don't know of any State, as infrequent as Amtrak rail service might be, that wants to give it up very quickly. We would not have a space program; we would not have a National Science Foundation; we would not have the National Institutes of Health; more importantly, we probably would not exist as a nation because we would have no national defense, no Army, Navy, National Guard, Air Force. 
Thanks to the wisdom and forethought of our Founders, there is no minimum guarantee clause in the Constitution except to protect the individual rights. Perhaps some in New Jersey think we might be better off if there were. We have a high per capita income, but we ought not to be penalized for it. We make our contribution in many ways. The fact is our Nation is stronger because Federal aid has been provided to areas with the greatest needs, and that is the way it ought to be. 
I want to talk for a moment about another matter that is important to my State, mass transit. Good public transit increases the efficiencies of existing roadways, especially in congested areas where many people live. Transit is essential to rural, suburban and urban residents. It is a cost-effective solution to health care access, a key to successful welfare reform, and an environmentally sensible way to meet commuting needs. It is an increasingly important service for the elderly, for persons with disabilities, for students and those who cannot afford a car. 
Anyone who questions the necessity for transit services only has to visit some of the more populated States like New Jersey or New York or California, where they do not have enough public transportation, or Maryland or the District of Columbia. The most densely populated State in the Nation, New Jersey has also the most vehicle density on its roads. Located between two heavily populated metropolitan areas, New Jersey is known as the corridor State. Over 60 billion vehicle miles are traveled on New Jersey's roads annually. The ability of trucks and cars to move freely on New Jersey's roads directly affects our economy. It affects the congestion, which has a dramatic effect on the individuals living there. 
It is also a primary commuter State. Millions of New Jerseyans face serious commuter problems each day. In many areas of New Jersey there is nowhere else to put a new road. Many of our people work in New York City, and their residences are in New Jersey. Or in the southern part of our State, many of our people work in the city of Philadelphia. They have to be able to get back and forth to work. But we simply can't build ourselves out of congestion. That is why my State is so heavily reliant on mass transportation. Nearly 10 percent of the New Jersey work force uses mass transit. 
We have a line just recently created called the Midtown Direct, a project in the urban core, which is a program very successful thus far, designed to bring together railroad connections that exist throughout our State into New York. Midtown Direct was one part of it, and it was inaugurated 1 year ago. Within weeks, the ridership doubled its projections. 
Transit in New Jersey is well used and well supported. Nationally, transit has also proven to reduce congestion and, of course, save dollars. 
A 1996 report conducted by the Federal Transit Administration found that the annual economic loss to U.S. business caused by traffic congestion is $40 billion, and the additional annual economic loss if all U.S. transit commuters drove instead would be $15 billion. So we are looking at huge differences in our economy. 
It is also obviously good for the environment. According to the Federal Transit Administration, transit use saves 1.5 billion gallons of auto fuel in our country each year, 1.5 billion gallons. If one wants to worry about what happens to America's independence, one need only look at the quantity of imported oil that we are bringing into the country. Transit is energy efficient, and the less gasoline used the less the United States is dependent on foreign oil. 
Americans also see direct public health benefits from transit use. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, up to 110 million Americans breathe air that is unhealthful. The American Lung Association estimates that the national health care bill for air-pollution-related illness is $40 billion a year. Transportation sources cause 40 to 60 percent of pollution that produce ozone, and 70 to 80 percent of carbon monoxide emissions. Nearly one-third of carbon dioxide emissions, the most significant greenhouse gas, comes from transportation sources. And, on this debate, no matter how detached or how unbelieving a person might be, one cannot be unconcerned about what we see happening with our climate, what can be happening with our health in this country. Much of the problem, in my view, emanates from the fact that we have these emissions in ever-increasing quantities in this country, as much as we fight against it. 
The fastest growing source of carbon dioxide emission is the transportation sector. Transit produces real environmental benefits. On average, riding transit instead of driving cuts hydrocarbon emissions that produce smog by 90 percent and carbon monoxide by more than 75 percent. One person using mass transit for a year instead of driving to work saves our environment 9 pounds of hydrocarbons, 62 pounds of carbon monoxide, and 5 pounds of nitrogen oxides. 
It doesn't stop there. Over the past 30 years, the U.S. transit industry and its riders have prevented the emission of 1.6 million tons of hydrocarbons, 10 million tons of carbon monoxide, and 275,000 tons of nitrogen oxides into the air; the importation of 20 billion gallons of gasoline; and the construction and maintenance of the 20,000 lane-miles of freeways and arterial roads and 5 million parking places to meet demands, saving at least $220 billion a year. 
Transit is an important part of our Nation's transportation system, and we ought to ensure that it is afforded the same priority as other modes of transportation. 
It is obvious, this bill also needs to address a crucial safety question, and one that I have worked on very hard over the years. That is, in the pursuit of safer highway travel we ought to do what we can to get drunken drivers off the road. This bill has to include a reduction in the blood alcohol measure, from .10 to .08 as a national standard. It is already, by the way, the standard in 15 States. 
Let me explain why we need this new standard. In 1996, 17,000 people died in alcohol-related traffic accidents; 17,000 people. By the way, if we examine the history of the Vietnam war, where we lost over 50,000 of our service people, the high year was about 17,000 people killed. Every year in America, 17,000 people die in alcohol-related traffic accidents. It is a national disgrace. Of those, 3,700 people, almost 9 percent, had alcohol levels below the .10 standard that most States enforce. Mr. President, .08 BAC laws have proven to have an effect on even heavy drinkers. The beverage industry fights us, and will continue to fight us on this. They tell you that it will ruin business, that the .08 law targets social drinkers and makes criminals out of them. Nothing could be further from the truth. When I wrote the law that made the drinking age across this country 21, the minimum drinking age, the beverage and the hospitality people said you are going to ruin our business. 
Ruin their business? We saved 10,000 kids from dying on the highways since I wrote that law in 1983. Mr. President, 10,000 families don't have to mourn the loss of a young child. One can hardly say that business in restaurants, taverns, and social places has been bad. They can't say it now. 
To make the point, a man of my height and weight could drink four beers in an hour on an empty stomach and still not hit .08. If I drank a fifth beer, I would be over the .08 but I would still be under .10. Should anyone be legally entitled to drink that much alcohol and then get on the road? The question answers itself. Of course not. Keep this in mind, when you look at a group of people in a bar or restaurant having drinks, the .08 law would only affect one of those people, and that is the person driving a car. 
We are not asking people to stop drinking. This is not a morality play. I am not telling people that they should not drink to their pleasure. If someone falls off a bar stool, as long as he doesn't fall on me it doesn't hurt me. But if he 
gets behind the wheel of a car, Heaven forbid, he could take away a child, a grandchild, mother, father, brother, sister. It should not be allowed. It's a criminal act. It turns an automobile from a thing of pleasure to a lethal weapon. 
We say just control your habits. There is a point at which they need to put the cork on the bottle for their own safety and for the safety of everyone else who shares the road with them. Studies have shown that States that have adopted .08 laws have had significant drops in alcohol-related traffic deaths and that a national .08 law could prevent up to at least 500 to 600 fatalities a year. Just that difference, from .08 to .10, could save 500 to 600 people a year from dying on the highways. 
In the State of Virginia, after it adopted its .08 law, it saw a drop not only in traffic deaths but in driving under the influence arrests as well. 
The Federal legislation that I introduced years ago to make 21 the national drinking age engendered a heck of a fight with the liquor lobby. But the law has saved 10,000 lives, it is estimated. I believe that .08 will save thousands more in a period of time. If we want confirmation whether or not we are on the right track, the people who support the .08 limit include the American Medical Association, the American Insurance Association, the American Trucking Association, the National Safety Council, and the National Sheriff's Association. 
Those who oppose .08, and I have to ask why, are principally in the beverage and hospitality area. We ought to let them know that we don't oppose social behavior of one's choice in restaurants and public gatherings, but we don't want to add anything to the fatality rate that can be prevented. 
Another safety issue that we are talking about in the legislation is big trucks. Trucking companies are trying to get Congress to allow bigger trucks on the highways, double and triple trailers. My view, and that of many others, is no. Motorists in my home State of New Jersey want relief from the rising death toll of the past few years. Consider what we are talking about here. A triple trailer can be 120 feet long, longer than a Boeing 747 jetliner. And it can weigh 64 tons. That is quite a behemoth on the highway. I am sure if you let your imagination work, and think about what the consequence can be when you are driving on a highway on a dark night, it is raining, doing about 55, maybe 60 miles an hour. That's a safe speed in these conditions. 
Suddenly a line of trucks starts to pass you. It is scary enough when the truck is a standard 44-foot length. But what is it like if a line of three of these 120 footers went by, each one of them three times, practically, the size of the single truck that has you worried in the first place? It would be like driving through an eclipse. For more than a solid minute the trucks would block your view of the road except for what is directly in front of you. For more than a minute your windshield would be sprayed by the tire wash off 32 sets of wheels. 
Your heart jumps each time one of those triple trailers weaves slightly into your lane. You know this type of truck needs at least 1 1/2 football fields to come to a stop. Imagine that, 1 1/2 football fields. And it's worse in the rain. This kind of heart-thumping drive would become more common if we allowed triple trailers greater access to highways. I know the people in my State don't want it. In 1994 to 1995, fatal accidents involving trucks were up 13 percent. Trucking accidents overall were up 16 percent, 84 people died in each year, 1994 and 1995, and one stretch of road in my State, route 287, saw the numbers of accidents involving trucks quadruple between 1988 and 1994. 
I agree with them, the only cargo vehicle this size should also have wings and be racing down a runway, not barreling down a highway. 
Mr. President, the debate on ISTEA is not only inevitable, it's essential, because this is such an important piece of legislation in our national structure. I agree that the chairman of the Environment Committee, the ranking member of the Environment Committee, wants to do the same things in their objectives as I do, and almost everyone else does. That is to continue to invest in our infrastructure, our transportation infrastructure, making sure that we develop and refine, to the best of our ability, each of the modes of transportation: Highways, aviation, rail, transit, waterways. We want to know that all of these things are operating in the safest manner that can accommodate most of our people efficiently. 
The potential is there. I have been working publicly and privately to help meet that objective, as have my colleagues, but this bill just doesn't do it. I want to help bring a bill to the floor that meets these needs.

<TEXT>
Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I think our colleagues in the House have the right idea, and that is to pass a temporary extension. If we pass a temporary extension, I think it has to be based on the formula, upon the structure of ISTEA as it presently is, not a newer version that changes things. Then we can sit down and create a plan that is fairer to all States in all regions and addresses these crucial needs. But it will take some significant discussion. 
This is a major, major change that is contemplated, and because it was concentrated in ultimately a few hands doesn't mean that it didn't pursue the right path, but what it does mean is that it has not fully considered all of the needs of the country, as we see from the resistance to this, opposed by a number of us from States particularly in the East, but not exclusively. 
My proposal is to see if we can find, not necessarily in order of importance, A, a substitute; B, a program that in transition will give States a chance to make adjustment, will hold those States that are being asked to take less of the funding pie harmless from year to year as the formula changes. I think that is the fairest way to do it; C, to listen carefully to what our colleagues in the House of Representatives have to say about their version of ISTEA. I am not talking about the 6-month bill that we see out there, necessarily, because I don't see a 6-month extension coming unless it proceeds under the present formula and structure. But to take perhaps another year in transition and try to develop a fairer piece of legislation, try to develop a piece of legislation that considers the needs, not just the tax cash-flow that results from gasoline taxes, because, to be repetitive for emphasis, just because a State sends down a dollars' worth of tax dollars doesn't necessarily mean that it ought to get a dollar in return on transportation investments if it, in fact, gets other returns that are far greater than the tax dollars they send down. 
I call painful attention to the fact that my State is 50th in return on the Federal tax dollar. The State of New Jersey is 50th. To make it abominably simple, it means that if we send down a dollar in taxes, we get 69 cents back--69 cents; 31 cents of New Jersey taxpayers' contributions go to programs that benefit other States, other regions of the country. 
We haven't seen a tax revolt in New Jersey. We swallow hard. We think we ought to get more. We don't have the need for an agricultural subsidy, but listen, if it is going to be given away, we are going to want our share. If when we do have some advantage because of need, like transportation, and we are not getting our fair share return on that, then we are going to say, hey, listen, when I look at the defense bill--and I sit on the Defense Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee--I want to look at that bill to see if New Jersey gets a fair share. 
How absurd a conclusion that would be. Can you imagine, someone looking at the defense bill and saying, `Wait a second, does my State get its fair share,' or is the question really, is my country best protected? As silly as that sounds, to say, well, give me my fair share, that simply means spend the money in my State, even though we don't accomplish the objective, I hope that it will be out of consideration because it just doesn't make any sense. 
A bill that doesn't take care of the needs of my State, which I interpret as the needs of the country, is equally unfair. So I hope as the discussion goes on that those who agree with me that this bill needs some further review--I realize that this is not untimely to consider reauthorizing the bill because the other one has expired, but I would like to make sure that we include the needs that my State and others have. 
I would like to reread the policy statement that accompanied the original ISTEA legislation. These are the views of our distinguished colleague and friend to just about everybody here and one of the best-informed people on transportation infrastructure. That is Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of the Empire State, the State of New York. Again, Senator Moynihan has studied the transportation needs of this country. He knows so much about the origins of parts of our transportation system, going from the early canals to the development of the National Highway System. He said:  
I am especially proud of the principles we set out in ISTEA 6 years ago and wish to include them in this bill. 
It is the policy of the United States to develop a National Intermodal Transportation System that is economically efficient and environmentally sound, provides the foundation for the Nation to compete in the global economy, and will move people and goods in an energy efficient manner. 
The National Intermodal Transportation System shall consist of all forms of transportation in a unified, interconnected manner, including the transportation systems of the future, to reduce energy consumption and air pollution while promoting economic development and supporting the Nation's preeminent position in international commerce. 
I think it is fair to say that that summarizes certainly the beginning principles of ISTEA's development, and we are living off of what I would say is a successful period of investment in our transportation needs, intermodally balanced, not quite perfect in every aspect, not quite sufficient funding. 
When I see what we invest in our transportation infrastructure in this country, it saddens me because in some cases we are ranked among the lesser developed countries of the world instead of the most developed countries of the world. When I look at high-speed rail passenger service, our per-capita spending is way below the average, and it is not right. This Nation ought to have a transit that can move at 180 miles an hour on a consistent basis as they have in France, or faster in Japan. I saw the other day where a train in Japan for a limited length of travel was at over 300 miles an hour, and they are looking to make it even faster. It would relieve our skyways, it would relieve our highways, and would broaden the opportunity if we have the investment in intercity rail that we need. 
So, Mr. President, I am sorry that we have not come to an agreement on what is an appropriate renewal or a new version of ISTEA as it expires. Again, I am hoping that we will have time for debate on it. It is also my understanding that we are going to have a discussion on the appropriateness of continuing an affirmative action program in ISTEA, and I welcome that debate because I believe that DOT's affirmative action program continues to be necessary and could withstand constitutional scrutiny under the standards set forth in the Adarand decision. 
I have been told that the junior Senator from Kentucky may be offering an amendment to strike the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program from this legislation. Perhaps he is content to believe that we are now in a colorblind society, but I plan to oppose that amendment because I don't think we are. 
The Department of Transportation's Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program, or DBE Program, provides a 10-percent national contracting goal for socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. Congress created this program in 1982 because minorities and women were shut out of transportation construction contracts, shut out not because they were any less able to perform the terms of the construction contract, shut out not because their bids were higher than their competitors, but shut out because they were not white, in some cases they were not men. We decided in the 1982 highway bill that the old boy network was no longer acceptable in Federal transportation construction contracts. We were right then, and the chairman of both the Transportation Subcommittee and the full committee were right to continue this program in S. 1173. 
I expect we will hear opponents of the DBE Program say that it imposes a quota or a set-aside for women- or minority-owned firms. It doesn't do that. The statute provides a 10-percent goal which may be modified by the Secretary of Transportation. States and municipalities are able to set their own goals which may be higher or lower than 10 percent. If a State doesn't reach its goal, there is no adverse consequence. 
I repeat, Mr. President, because it is an important point and one which the opponents to the DBE Program may not mention, the DBE Program provides a goal, and if States do not meet this goal, DOT does not directly withhold transportation dollars. There is no adverse consequence. 
So why do we still need an affirmative action program for Federal construction contracts? Because we know the private sector looks to the public sector for leadership on this issue. If we eliminate the DBE Program at this time, we will return quickly to the good old boy network that excludes women and minorities. How do we know that? Because several States eliminated their versions of DOT's DBE Program, and within a matter of months, minority- and women-owned and controlled businesses received fewer, if any, construction contracts. 
Minorities comprise approximately one-fifth of our population. Just under 10 percent of construction firms are minority owned and controlled, yet receive only 5 percent of construction receipts. 
I will give you another statistic, Mr. President. White business owners in the construction industry receive over 50 times as many loan dollars of equity capital as minority owners with the same borrowing characteristics. 
Mr. President, I ask opponents of the DBE affirmative action program to explain why these numbers are so disproportionate if we did, in fact, live in a colorblind society. 
I expect, Mr. President, we are going to have a lengthy discussion about the DBE program and whether or not it is constitutional. Again, I look forward to the debate because I believe after a full discussion, the majority of my colleagues will agree that the DBE program is constitutional under the Adarand standard. 
In the 1995 Adarand decision, seven of the nine Supreme Court Justices recognized the continuing need for affirmative action programs to remedy the lingering effects of racial discrimination. After Adarand, affirmative action programs must serve a compelling governmental interest and be narrowly tailored to address that interest. 
The first court to apply this strict scrutiny standard set forth under Adarand found that Congress met the compelling-Government-interest component. It disagreed that the DBE program was narrowly tailored, but the district court judge went far beyond the Supreme Court's holding by virtually deciding that no affirmative action program can be narrowly tailored. 
The Justice Department is rightfully appealing this decision. 
Mr. President, there will be time to discuss this matter further at a later time. I look forward to that. 
I am confident that the Senate will accept the responsibility of looking at this program calmly and rationally rather than simply trying to fuel the fires of passion and hatred which the issue of affirmative action can ignite. Should the junior Senator from Kentucky offer this amendment, I hope my colleagues will oppose it. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in the House of Representatives yesterday an amendment that would have allowed foreign governments to export to the United States for commercial sale millions of lethal military weapons the U.S. previously made available to them was dropped from the Treasury Appropriations bill. I have vigorously opposed this amendment in the Senate, and have worked to keep it out of Senate Appropriations bills. I congratulate Representatives McCarthy, Lowey, Kennedy, Shays, and Maloney for successfully working to delete the provision from the House bill. 
As my colleagues may know, the amendment was originally adopted during the House Appropriations Committee markup of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998 without discussion or debate. Last year a similar amendment was slipped into the Senate version of the Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary Appropriations bill, but it was not included in the final version of the spending law.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for this bill. I am pleased that the conferees included several projects important to the quality of life and safety at New Jersey's military installations, and I thank the conferees for their efforts to ensure that New Jersey's defense infrastructure needs received adequate funding. 
I appreciate the willingness of the conferees to provide funding for three important projects at McGuire Air Force Base. The bill includes $9.954 million for an Air Mobility Operations Group Warehouse, which will increase the efficiency of the base's mobility operations. Additionally, it includes $35.217 million for an ambulatory health care center replacement. This new facility will house a full-service outpatient operation and provide adequate space for clinics, ambulatory surgery, ancillary services, storage, offices, and administration. It will improve the quality of care provided to our military personnel. 
I am also pleased the conferees included $8.8 million for a new fire station at McGuire. McGuire's current fire station is inadequate to provide the fire protection and response to aircraft casualties that its mission requires. This facility has inadequate communication and alarm equipment, insufficient vehicle storage areas, deficient living quarters, and inadequate space for training and administrative duties. Due to these conditions, in certain situations, I am told that the base cannot respond simultaneously to a fire emergency and a 911 call. The funding provided for a new fire station will improve the base's ability to respond more adequately and will allow firefighters to execute emergency response operations in a more efficient and timely manner. 
For Fort Monmouth, another important military installation in New Jersey, I am pleased the conferees included $2.05 million for a new fire station. The fort's fire station is currently housed in a World War II vintage structure. This station is charged with protecting the base's numerous research and development facilities, as well as its over 1,000 military family housing units. The funding provided for a new fire station will ensure that facilities on the base are adequately protected, and that the Fort Monmouth community has access to the timely response and fire protection services it deserves. This project is vital to the safety of the entire Fort Monmouth community, and I am pleased the conferees agreed to provide funding for this important project. 
I also appreciate the willingness of the conferees to include funding for two important projects at Picatinny Arsenal. I am pleased they provided $7.3 million to build 35 units of family housing on the base. The existing units have deteriorated since they were constructed in 1940. Most of these units are undersized and lack basic conveniences such as air-conditioning. Their electrical, plumbing, and heating systems are poorly configured and inefficient. The funding provided by the conferees will improve the existing living conditions and the quality of life for the enlisted and their families. It will produce units of family housing that meet current standards of quality of life, energy conservation, size, and safety. 
I am also pleased the conferees agreed to provide $1.3 million in design funding for a new software engineering facility at Picatinny. This funding will allow Picatinny to consolidate the design, development, testing, configuration control, field release and maintenance of weapon systems, simulators, and trainers. It will result in reduced cost for the Army and will improve efficiency in the software engineering process. 
These projects are vital to the safety and quality of life of New Jersey's defense infrastructure. Again, I thank the conferees for their support of these important projects in the fiscal year 1998 military construction bill.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with Senators Hollings and Thurmond to temporarily suspend the rate of duty imposed on imported ferroboron. Ferroboron is the key raw material in amorphous metal electrical power distribution transformer cores. Transformers using these cores reduce energy losses and greenhouse gas emissions associated with these losses by 60 to 80 percent when compared to other transformer core technologies. This provides both increased energy conservation and decreases environmental degradation in those developing nations where the most promising market opportunities exist. 
While these benefits are tangible and significant, they, and the extensive research and development that yielded them, are costly. An amorphous metal transformer has an initial cost 20 to 30 percent higher than the less energy efficient and environmentally friendly transformers it seeks to replace. Fortunately, because of its many benefits, the total owning cost of an amorphous metal transformer over its 20- to 30-year life is far lower than the initially cheaper competition. Reducing the cost of an important and costly raw material, by suspending the duty paid on it, helps to ensure the cost-competitiveness of the end product in the export markets. This is good for manufacturers, for American workers, and for our economy. 
Mr. President, I have received assurances from my constituent, AlliedSignal, Inc., that there is no U.S. manufacturer of ferroboron, thus, this legislation does not adversely affect any American business.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I just want to register my support for the Durbin-Collins amendment to repeal big tobacco's rebate in the tax reconciliation bill that granted a $50 billion giveaway--$50 billion giveaway--to the tobacco industry. The condition that has created so much suspicion about the tobacco companies and their industry is that there is no time, no time at all when they come forward cleanly, let the smoke clear away, and offer direct and candid explanations about what it is they have been up to all these years. 
I will have some comments later about the speech given last night by the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch. He asked for a quick conclusion--let's get going. He asked that the President send down a bill that we can discuss and vote on, get it done with. 
Well, Mr. President, this attack on the American people's health has been going on for decades, more than 50, 60 years. I remember when I was a soldier and part of the ration kit that I got to be used as an emergency food supply had some cigarettes stuck in it. It was so much a part of our structure, so much a part of our culture that cigarettes became more valuable than currency in some of the countries during the Second World War. 
So there is a lot of information that has been accumulated over a lot of years, and contrary to the comments of the distinguished Senator from Utah last night, I think we ought to take our time. I think we ought to make sure that we have the most complete review of millions of pages of information. I think that we can find what we want within a group of documents about 1.5 million pages long. They are called the Minnesota Select Set. There has been a consolidation of information to fewer pages than the full 33 million that the court in Minnesota is going to have for review. 
Last night, the distinguished Senator from Utah talked about 33 million pages. He said, what do we need that for? Well, I think it is quite clear to people within earshot here and who have been watching what has been going on in the Capitol when the committee now reviewing campaign expenditures or campaign revenue raising, fundraising, has requested over 10 million documents for review from the AFL-CIO alone, by the Senator who is chairman of that committee, Senator Thompson. 
So, Mr. President, we are talking about a very complicated piece of agreement. We have by the most conservative yardstick probably 5 million people killed as a result of smoking, who died prematurely as a result of smoking. We know that 430,000 die each year from respiratory-related conditions--lung cancer, you name it, emphysema. We learned recently from a study by the Harvard public health school that 50,000 heart attacks per year, fatal heart attacks per year, take place among those who are subjected to passive smoking, not smoking themselves. So again by the most conservative of calculations we say that some 500,000 people have been dying as a result of smoking-related illness. 
If I might ask, Mr. President, my friend from Illinois for another minute.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. So, Mr. President, I hope that we will not be rushed into doing something, get it behind us, get it over with. There is much too much to be gained by a thorough review of all of the documents, and we should not ask the President of the United States to come down here pell-mell, willy-nilly with a bill for us to consider and pass. If it takes time, I think that time can be valuably used despite the fact that I would like the assault on our children to stop as quickly as possible. I do not want any more seduction of our children to pick up smoking because the tobacco industry knows, in their spurious attempts at trying to ensure their marketplace, they have directed their marketing at children, trying to get 3,000 kids a day to pick up the smoking habit so a million a year of new smokers will be there to replace that market which is affected by those who are dying prematurely. 
So, Mr. President, I look forward to an extended debate. I hope that the Durbin-Collins amendment will be supported overwhelmingly to show the American people that we are not going to knuckle under to the machinations of the tobacco industry. We are not going to let it get through the front door or the back door. We want to close down what the tobacco industry has been doing to our citizens for these many years, and it is perhaps going to take more time than would be thought to be necessary to arrive at a proper settlement. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Durbin-Collins amendment to repeal Big Tobacco's rebate in the tax reconciliation bill. I will speak about this critical amendment in a minute, but first I would like to talk about an issue that was raised on the floor last night. 
That issue is whether Congress should subpoena hidden tobacco documents. 
Mr. President, we need to know the truth about nicotine and tobacco. That is why I, along with Senator Leahy and many of our colleagues, have asked the chairmen of the various committees with jurisdiction over portions of the settlement, to subpoena critical documents that the tobacco industry has conspired to hide from the American people. 
In debate on the floor yesterday, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee raised the issue of whether to subpoena these documents. The senior Senator from Utah has long been dedicated to saving our children from the dangers of tobacco. He has been outspoken about the critical need to reduce teen smoking rates. 
Yet, the chairman questioned the necessity of Congress subpoenaing these documents which have been kept from the public because they were falsely stamped attorney-client privilege. The chairman raised some valid concerns, and I would like to respond. 
Mr. President, we are at a critical juncture in the war between the tobacco companies and the public health. The tobacco industry wants the American people to disarm. They want to strip Americans of their right to seek punitive damages for harm caused by the tobacco industry's deceitful practices. The industry wants Congress to grant it unprecedented protections from legal liability. 
In return, the American people are promised a reform of our public health laws that will protect loved ones in the future from the dangers of tobacco addiction and illness. It would be up to Congress to write these laws. That is a heavy responsibility. 
In order to properly execute this responsibility, we owe it to the American people to collect the most complete information about the effects of tobacco and nicotine on human health. Through our subpoena power, we have the ability to collect this information. We need information on whether a safer cigarette could be manufactured, or if we can produce a less addicting form of nicotine. 
Mr. President, that information is in the hands of the tobacco industry, and they have consistently hidden it from the American people for decades. If we are to enter into a legislative settlement with this industry, then it must come clean with Congress and the American people. Since it has not done so yet, we should start issuing subpoenas for the truth. 
Mr. President, some have suggested that the document disclosure provisions in the proposed settlement are sufficient. However, I strongly disagree. The proposed settlement would merely set up a clearinghouse for documents already produced in court cases. In other words: it discloses nothing new. 
Mr. President, we have learned more details in recent weeks about how the tobacco companies routinely funneled documents through their lawyers in order to fraudulently mark them as attorney-client privileged. In fact, many of these documents relate to health concerns and were simply given to the lawyers to cloak them in a false shroud of the attorney-client privilege. 
These are the most critical documents. They hold the keys to saving millions of lives. 
Congress has the power to subpoena and examine these documents before we enact a legislative settlement. We need that information to craft effective public health policy. The settlement would allow the industry to delay court review of these documents for years after a settlement is enacted. 
Now, review of these documents might be time consuming. The distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in his floor statement yesterday, noted that over 33 million pages have been collected in the State of Minnesota's suit against the tobacco industry. Our estimate is that we'll find the information we need in at most 1 1/2 million pages. 
The Minnesota attorney general, in preparation for his trial against Big Tobacco, has bound, numbered and indexed around 500,000 pages into a volume called the Minnesota Select Set. This set of documents contains critical information we need in order to draft appropriate public health legislation. We should subpoena this set. 
In addition, the Minnesota court hearing the case has collected around 1 million pages of material that the industry has claimed is privileged. However, we know that the Industry has a history of falsely claiming this privilege in order to hide critical health information. 
It is unclear how many pages are in the privileged set, but it has been estimated to be about 1 million pages. Both of these sets are being held in warehouses in Minneapolis and London under the control of a Minnesota court. 
Mr. President, I would like to clarify that my subpoena request is for, at most, about 1 1/2 million pages. Although this is a lot of material, one need only watch another child light up a cigarette to realize it is well worth the time. 
Let me put this into perspective: The Governmental Affairs Committee has subpoenaed over 10 million pages of documents from the AFL-CIO alone in its campaign finance investigation. 
This subpoena request for tobacco industry documents is about the lives of American children. Isn't that worth the time needed to carefully review these documents? Why rush into a settlement in 50 days with an industry that has lied to America for 50 years? 
Therefore, I ask my colleagues to support the request of Senator Leahy and myself to the chairmen of relevant Senate committees to subpoena these hidden tobacco industry documents. 
I hope that this discussion clarified this issue for my colleagues. 
Now, Mr. President, I would like to address the Durbin-Collins amendment to repeal the provision in the tax reconciliation bill that granted a $50 billion giveaway to the tobacco industry. This clause should never have been snuck into that bill and it is time to remove it. 
This provision of the recently enacted tax reconciliation bill would divert $50 billion away from the public health and into the pockets of Big Tobacco. If comprehensive tobacco legislation is eventually enacted, Big Tobacco will write 50 billion off the top of their payment obligations. 
This shortfall could mean billions of dollars in programs to keep kids away from cigarettes will be lost. It could mean billions of dollars in smoking cessation programs will not be paid for. 
In any settlement, the tobacco industry must pay its fair share. If the industry gets a $50 billion break in the settlement, that cost will have to come out of taxpayer's pockets. That is unacceptable. 
The tobacco companies shouldn't get a rebate. They're not a car dealership--they're a drug dealership. 
There are those who say that this rebate was part of the proposed settlement deal. Well, that's news to the attorneys general who negotiated it. They never signed off on such an arrangement. 
Mr. President, this is another example of why we can't trust this industry. After claiming to act in good faith, they scheme behind closed doors to undermine the American people. As we embark on public health legislation for the next century, let's work to keep this process out in the open and get rid of the smokey back room deals on tobacco. 
Mr. President, I therefore urge my colleagues to support the Durbin-Collins Amendment and join us in repealing the $50 billion credit for Big Tobacco. The last thing the tobacco industry is entitled to is a rebate.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the May 27, 1997 31st anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Guyana. The word `Guyana' is an indigenous word that means land of many waters. But Guyana is also a land of many peoples, with East Indians, Africans, Chinese, Amer-Indians, and Europeans counted among its ancestors. Guyana is also a country that embraces freedom of religion, which allows Christians, Muslims, and Hindus to worship side by side. 
My colleagues may be aware that Guyana achieved independence and observed its first free and fair election in 1992, after more than three centuries of British, French, and Dutch colonialism. Guyana's first constitution bore the influence of British legal traditions, and former President Jimmy Carter supervised the team of international observers to guarantee the fairness of the 1992 elections. 
Guyana's three decades of unpopular and repressive rule slowed economic progress, but Guyanese are working to overcome these hurdles. I hope that they will succeed. 
Guyanese-Americans have much to be proud of. Their history is rich, and I hope the future of Guyana will be bright.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from New York. I commend him for his ever-present concern about the well-being of our friends around the world, Israel in this case, and his staunch defense of freedom and democracy against terrorism. I thank him for his initiative today. 
It is heartbreaking for all of us, when we see innocent people carried away in stretchers, and the mayhem and the destruction that terrorists visited upon Jerusalem this day. It is not a unique happening. It has gone on for too long. The attempt to suggest that this is a way to obtain peace, or to coerce friends who want democratic societies throughout the Middle East, kind of modeled on what Israel has done--it is a democratic society, as my friend and colleague from Connecticut said. They elected a Prime Minister. It is not for us to agree or disagree. It is irrelevant. The fact of the matter is, it is a democratic society. And what we try to do is encourage the Palestinian Authority to take democratic leadership and represent law and order and defend against terrorism. But we have been grossly disappointed of late. 
I was in Israel 2 years ago in April when a bus was exploded by a terrorist. On that bus was a young woman from New Jersey whose family I now know very well. She died in a few days; 21 years old, an innocent victim. She wasn't there trying to hurt anybody. She was there because she was interested in studying Hebrew and the history of the Jewish people. Sometime later another young woman, also from New Jersey, was killed in a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv--just a random explosion, someone willing to take his life, convinced that he would be rewarded for killing himself and killing others. 
The one thing we have to insist on in this country is we should not talk to anybody who, in addition to a formal relationship with us, supports terrorism. Syria by way of example. We have an ambassador there. They have representation there. But they are on a list of countries that support terrorism. And we ought to say listen, if that is the way you are going to conduct your life, in terms of the region that you exist in, that you want to encourage terrorism on the one hand and be a friend of this great democracy on the other, it's no go. We ought to say that to countries all around the area. If you in any way--even those that we have established some friendships with--if you in any way encourage or inflame the fire of violence and terrorism, our relationship is going to change. We cannot sit by and simply pour our hearts out and say, `Isn't it sad? Somebody lost a son, somebody lost a daughter, mother, father, sister.' It has to be more overt than that. 
We have seen what happens with terrorism. We have seen it in our own country. It shocked everybody, in Oklahoma, the Port Authority building in New York, the Trade Center. It is frightening. It is a disgusting, revolting act. Think of it, that someone feels justified, for political or personal reasons, to take others' lives in the name of a cause. We ought not let it be misunderstood, that we will never, never, never accept a handshake on one hand from someone who is going to support terrorism with the other hand.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. The question my colleague from New York State raises is a very complex one. Because we want to continue a peace process. I spent some time in Ireland. I visited in the north. We made investments in that society, in the northern section, so that people could elevate their standard of living and reduce some of the anger and the rage. And we continued. I was pleased to see, in the last couple of days, discussions taking place that include the Sinn Fein, with some Members of the Senate and so forth, to try to say, `Stop the killing, stop the killing.' 
I met with people in New Jersey, and we disagreed on the tactic that was being used, the violence in the North, to try to bring about the kind of equality that all of us like to see for our families and our friends. Thusly, I am reluctant to say just offhand that we ought to simply cut off the relationship. 
I have faith that the Palestinian people also want peace. I don't think that they, any more than anyone else, likes the prospect of a son or a daughter dying in a conflict. There are those madmen--we have them in our society; we saw it in Oklahoma--people who are part of our culture who do something that is so outrageous. We see it in violence around the country all too frequently. We just saw it in New Hampshire. 
I will say this, though, that I think the Senator confirms what I was talking about, and that is, we have to, as they say, tighten the screws. We cannot have a Hamas operating under one disguise in one place doing a good deed here and there--and I don't care how many good deeds they do--if the alternative is to have another branch of that organization that kills people, those who might disagree with them, while they tend to the needs of others who are indigent medically, troubled, et cetera. 
So we have to make sure that if you want to be a friend of the United States, if you want us to work with you in any continued way of support for democracy, for economic betterment, that you have to leave out any assistance or any encouragement for terrorism, and that means reacting to terrorist acts by saying, `We condemn it and we condemn those who did it,' and not hedge what they are saying, not permit them to say, `Well, we don't like terrorism, but, in this case, maybe'--baloney. 
What we say is, if anybody participates in any support of terrorism, they can't be friends of ours and they can't derive any benefit from it. 
I will relinquish the floor with a word of encouragement for Secretary Albright to continue her effort, for all the peacemakers to continue their efforts, to try to get by this but at the same time to make certain that those who commit terrorist deeds know that they cannot sit at the table at the same time that the peacemakers do. I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of this amendment to restore funding to the Food and Drug Administration so it can enforce its rule in the war on teen smoking. At stake are the lives of millions of our children. 
This rule prohibits--nationwide--the sale of tobacco products to anyone under the age of 18. It also requires retailers to check the ID of any purchaser of tobacco who appears to be under the age of 27. 
Isn't this just common sense as matters of both public policy and public health? Apparently not. 
Madam President, if I wasn't seeing this with my own eyes, I would not believe anyone doubted the need to fund FDA enforcement of this rule. The rule against teen smoking is overwhelmingly supported by the American people. It was validated by a North Carolina judge. Yet, here we are on the floor of the U.S. Senate, trying again to save this rule from obliteration. 
Madam President, the tobacco lobbyists have spread a great deal of money and misinformation about the need for this initiative. I would like to clear the air. 
The tobacco lobby has been telling Senators that we should wait until we pass settlement legislation before we fund the FDA's teen smoking enforcement efforts. That is nonsense. The ultimate disposition of the proposed settlement--which is far from being in place--has nothing to do with this fight against teen smoking. Nothing. The settlement negotiations, assumed that these rules would be in place and fully funded. 
Once you eliminate this nonsense, it comes down to a basic question. Should we simply sit back and watch 3,000 kids a day pick up an addiction that will kill or cripple many of them? Or should we fund this program and start saving lives? The money we approve today is a bargain compared to what we'll be forced to spend in later years on treating smoking-related illness. 
Everyone, including the tobacco companies, says they are against teen smoking. Our Nation's parents, the medical community, and public opinion support the President's fight against teen smoking. 
And make no mistake about it. If you vote against this funding, you gut the President's plan and take a stand for tobacco and against America's kids. I therefore urge you to support this amendment.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will speak for a couple minutes. 
There is a sense of the historical significance of what it is that we are about to do. It is not simply the accomplishment of having put in place a balanced budget. It goes further than that; that is, to note that this agreement has been developed, if I might use the word `hammered' out, by bipartisan cooperation. My friend and colleague, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, and I and others, of course, labored long and hard to help present the views of all of our colleagues into an understanding and a package that would be acceptable as a consensus product. 
So we are here at this moment, and within 1 hour it is believed that we will have passed this reconciliation bill and will embark upon the work of passing the second reconciliation bill which will complete the task. 
I think we have set some records here this year, not only because we will have achieved a balanced budget, which is the best belief of all Members here who will be supporting this, but I took a moment, I say to Senator Domenici, to check on where we stand with our appropriations bills. There were 9, I believe, that have been completed, and perhaps a 10th one ready. That is quite fantastic, not yet August and having done those. 
I want to say to all of my colleagues, I am proud that we were able to get this job done under fairly stringent conditions. We do not have as much money as we were accustomed to having in the past, but with what we had we made it do very well. We have covered lots of things that needed attention, child health care, assurance of the solvency of Medicare, an opportunity for kids to get an education, to be investing in research in our society, a number of things that are very positive outcomes, again, within the context of the resources we had available. 
All Members of both parties deserve to be proud of our accomplishment. We have shown America something, that we can work together for the common good, and at the same time we can be fiscally responsible and we can help prepare for the next century, which is around the corner. 
This agreement will lead us, I think, to a positive path as we prepare to enter the 21st century, investing in all kinds of good things, as I have said, and education, particularly, I think as the cornerstone for the development of our society. 
The agreement shows that it is not inconsistent to be both fiscally responsible and progressive. There is now broad consensus that we simply have to live within our means, but there is also appreciation that the future will not simply take care of itself. It takes work. We have to prepare for it, investing to make sure that our people are ready for it. 
That is what we are doing in this legislation: getting our fiscal house in order. We are investing in our children. We are extending the educational opportunities for millions of Americans. In short, we are getting ready, and our children and grandchildren will reap the rewards in decades ahead. 
So, Mr. President, I am proud to be here as this balanced budget legislation is approved. We want to see it get to the White House. It is a moment in history, and I hope it will be regarded as a very positive moment in the record books years from now. I am grateful and proud to have been a part of the process. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this motion to waive the Byrd rule. 
Mr. President, this has been a long budget process and we are near completion of these important bills. However we are still in the midst of a battle to save our kids from the health hazards and addiction of tobacco. This battle has just started. However, there are some in Congress who are hijacking this budget reconciliation process in an attempt to give the tobacco industry the upper hand in legislation implementing a global settlement of claims against the tobacco industry. 
We cannot allow this to happen. That is why I am opposing this motion to waive the Byrd rule. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Illinois has raised a point of order to a provision in the tax bill conference report that would credit the tobacco industry toward payments due on any legislative settlement with the revenue raised by the tobacco tax. This is ridiculous. This revenue is targeted toward children's health in this package. You can't have two uses for one revenue source. 
This is simply a nonsensical device designed to give yet another break to the tobacco lobby. Well, I will do everything I can to prevent this from happening in a global settlement.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank all of you here. I thank our Chaplain, Dr. Ogilvie, and I thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to present my rabbi. Youthful though he is, he is wise. I think the Presiding Officer knows one does not have to have age to have wisdom. And we credit Rabbi Daniel Cohen with having wisdom. 
This is an honor that I so much wanted to have bestowed upon him because he has earned the respect and the admiration of so many in our congregation. I think about 800 families worship and have their children taught by Rabbi Cohen. 
He is a native of New Jersey, as I am. And it is just an honor to have him and Mrs. Cohen, who is witnessing this from the balcony, join us this morning. 
Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to hear from Rabbi Cohen. 
I am pleased and proud to have Rabbi Daniel Cohen from my own Temple Sharey Tefilo-Israel in South Orange, NJ here today to convene this session of the Senate. 
The fact that Rabbi Cohen is here to give this invocation means a great deal to me. It speaks to the diversity of religions and races that make up this body, and this great Nation. 
As Rabbi Cohen said, we are all privileged to live in this country. And it benefits us to work together and to use our individual talents to make this place as great as it can possibly be. I couldn't agree more. 
Rabbi Cohen and I have similar family backgrounds and share many values. 
He and I are respectively the grandson and son of immigrants. We have gotten to where we are today by taking advantage of the opportunities that were given to us, and we are both committed to giving back to the communities that treated us so well. 
We both believe in the right and ability of all people to be accepted and get ahead. It is symbolic that the name of our synagogue, `Sharey Tefilo,' means the `Gates of Prayer.' These gates of prayer to me represent open gates through which people of all faiths and backgrounds should be able to pass in order to succeed, find refuge from persecution, or simply start a better life. 
I want to add some quick words about Rabbi Cohen himself: 
He grew up in Berkeley Heights, NJ. 
He did his undergraduate work at Duke University, getting his degree in anthropology and religion. Some of that time he spent abroad studying in Israel. 
He went on to receive his masters in Hebrew letters from the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, and received his rabbinic ordination in 1993. 
He has been with my temple in New Jersey since his ordination, first as a rabbinic intern and then as the assistant rabbi. He currently serves as the associate rabbi of our congregation, enjoying a great deal of respect from members of the temple. 
He does a great deal of work in our synagogue with youth groups and educational programming, but has an exceptional ability to reach everybody in the congregation, both young and old. 
I want to thank Rabbi Cohen for coming today, and I am proud to have been able to share a bit of my heritage and home State with my colleagues in the Senate.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will in just a couple minutes because I want us to be able to hear from the leadership. I did not know whether or not Senator Daschle had some remarks that he wanted to make, but I would certainly be delighted to yield the time so that we apportion it with the time remaining on the majority side, so that the distinguished majority leader has the time that he needs to make his remarks. For the moment, I would just say that we are not done yet, in the words of the distinguished New Jersey philosopher Yogi Berra, who said, `It's not over `til it's over.' We are getting ever closer. I don't yet feel the attention that comes with championship bouts or things of that nature; we have another 10 hours' worth of debate on the second part of the reconciliation bill. 
At this point, I would be happy to yield the time back that we have, if the Parliamentarian could tell us how much time is remaining on our side.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. We will try to split the time. I want to say, also, to the majority leader, thank you for the accolades and for the encouragement that you gave Senator Domenici and me throughout the process and for the comments about our other colleagues, all of whom worked diligently, worked honestly on getting the mission accomplished. At times, I can tell you that Senator Domenici--it's no secret--would kind of lay down the book and say, `We have to check this upstairs.' I don't think he meant all the way up. I think he meant only as far as the majority leader's office. Or, `We have to turn to the leadership.' I would do the same thing. 
But persistence was the keynote, persistence and patience. I want to say this about the majority leader and about the way he has conducted things. Serving in the minority, it's easy to find fault with the majority leader. But one has to give credit where due. The fact is that this majority leader has, with diligence and persistence, moved legislation through this place. He has come up to me, and I am sure other colleagues, and said, `Frank, let's try to make sense out of this. What is it that you are trying to accomplish? Can it be done this time? Well, I don't think so. I think we can get halfway there, I think we can get three-quarters of the way.' Or he'll say, `That's not a bad idea and I do want to help you with that.' And he made a commitment with me on trying to make sure our national passenger rail system keeps on functioning. He reaffirmed his commitment to help find a way to get that done. 
So I want to say, relatively, as we say around here--looking around here, looking at my white hair, I can say it comfortably--the new kid on the block, the majority leader, has done a good job. It's particularly evident when we look at the accomplishment of this piece of legislation, the one we are about to pass. And he is right; it's going to pass overwhelmingly. We want to have as many people on both sides say yes as we can, to indicate to the American people that we believe in this assignment that we took on. 
So, I thank the majority leader for his skill, his patience, and his persistence. I think he helped calm the waters a little bit. Because I don't remember, throughout the 7 or 8 months of discussion, often late at night, often without lunch, munchies, or otherwise, that the patience--the tempers never really got real hot. Am I right? Pete, once in a while, you know, would stamp on the floor or something like that, but he would come right back, bouncing up. We pushed our way through. 
So I thank everybody involved in the effort, and I am delighted to be here, to serve in this place and serve at a time like this when we have accomplished something.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report on the tax reconciliation bill. 
Mr. President, before I begin to discuss this legislation, let me take a moment to again congratulate the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan, for their leadership on this legislation. Both these distinguished Senators reached out to Members on the other side of the aisle to make this happen, and they deserve enormous credit for their leadership. 
Mr. President, I am supporting this legislation for four primary reasons. First, it will help ordinary, middle-class families and especially their children. Second, it will promote education. Third, it will help clean up our environment and promote economic development. And, fourth, it's part of a broader bipartisan agreement that will balance the budget and prepare our Nation for the 21st century. 
First, Mr. President, this legislation would provide valuable assistance to middle-class families in the form of a $500 tax credit for children under the age of 17. This credit will help millions of ordinary people who are raising their children, working hard, and struggling to pay their bills. For these Americans, an extra $500 or $1,000 per year can go a long way. And, so long as our Nation can afford to provide this relief in the context of a balanced budget, I think it's the right thing to do. 
Mr. President, I am especially pleased that the child tax credit included in this legislation will be available to lower income families who also qualify for the earned income tax credit, or EITC. This proved to be one of the most contentious issues in the conference, much to my surprise. Yet some around here argued that providing direct tax relief to police officers, nurses, and teachers somehow amounted to welfare. I never understood the logic of that. But, fortunately, Democrats made this a top priority. And, in the end, these hard-working Americans will be able to benefit from the child tax credit. 
Mr. President, the second major element of this legislation is the section that promotes education. The bill includes a $1,500 tax credit to help students afford the first 2 years of college. In addition, there's a tax credit worth up to $1,000 for those who want to pursue additional education beyond that. 
This latter benefit will be available to adults of all ages. And it's especially important. In an increasingly technological age, education must be a life-long process. And it's something that we should encourage and support. 
Mr. President, the third major reason why I'm supporting this legislation is that it includes new incentives to clean up thousands of contaminated, abandoned sites in economically distressed areas. That not only will improve the environment, but it will help encourage redevelopment of these areas, known as brownfields. It's a win-win approach that will make a real difference for communities around our Nation. 
Mr. President, the final reason I am supporting this legislation is that it's part of the broad bipartisan budget agreement that I helped negotiate with leaders from both parties and the President. That agreement will provide several benefits outside the tax area that we never could have achieved without this broader compromise. 
We're getting $24 billion to provide health care coverage for uninsured children. We're restoring disability benefits for legal immigrants. We're ensuring that 30,000 disabled children don't lose their Medicaid coverage. We're investing $3 billion to move people from welfare to work. And the list goes on. 
None of these important advances would have been possible without a broad bipartisan agreement. And to get that agreement, Democrats had to accept some significant new tax breaks that we otherwise would have resisted. 
Mr. President, I, for one, do not share the faith of my Republican friends that cutting taxes for rich Americans is the ticket to economic growth. We've tried trickle-down economics in the past. And it's proved not only unfair, but ineffective in promoting the economy. 
Most Democrats have a different approach, Mr. President. We like to focus on tax cuts for ordinary Americans. The people who work hard, raise their kids, and who often have a hard time keeping their heads above water. 
In other words, Mr. President, rather than showering tax breaks on the rich and having that money trickle down, we'd rather provide relief to ordinary Americans, and allow those funds to flow back up. 
Fortunately, Mr. President, while this bill does contain some new tax breaks for the very wealthy, the bulk of its benefits are focused on the middle class. The most expensive element in the package is the child tax credit. The next most expensive area is education. Both of these types of tax relief are targeted on people who really could use the help. 
Having said that, Mr. President, there clearly are other provisions, such as the capital gains rate cut and the backloaded IRA, I'm concerned about the costs of these new tax breaks, especially in the future. If it were up to me, I would have done much more to constrain those costs. 
But, Mr. President, these provisions were necessary to reach the broader agreement. There simply would not have been a deal without them. And so, on the whole, many on this side of the aisle felt that this was the price we had to pay to get the other benefits in the budget agreement. 
At least, Mr. President, the legislation before us does not include some of the more egregious proposals that would have exploded the deficit in the future. 
But the bottom line, Mr. President, is that, though it has real flaws, I am going to support this legislation. And I would encourage my colleagues to do likewise. 
No, it's not perfect legislation. But it's part of a compromise that will do a lot of good. It provides significant tax relief to middle-class families. It will help millions of Americans afford college. It will encourage millions of others to pursue their educations throughout their lives. It will lead to the cleanup and redevelopment of many abandoned sites around our nation. And it's part of a bipartisan plan that will balance the budget and prepare our Nation for the next century.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, millions of young people in America live in areas where drug use, violent and property crimes are a way of life. Unfortunately, many of these same young people come from one-parent homes, or from environments where there is no responsible, caring adult supervision. These at-risk children are on the brink--their lives could go in either a positive or destructive direction. There is indisputable evidence, however, that at-risk children who have responsible adult mentors choose the right path. 
Mr. President, that is why today I am introducing legislation, the JUMP Ahead Act of 1997, that will take mentoring in this country to the next level to meet the needs of millions of at-risk youths and their families. 
All children and adolescents need caring adults in their lives, and mentoring is one effective way to fill this special need for at-risk children. The special bond of commitment fostered by the mutual respect inherent in effective mentoring can be the tie that binds a young person to a better future. Through a mentoring experience, adult volunteers and participating youth make a significant commitment of time and energy to develop relationships devoted to personal, academic, or career development and social, artistic, or athletic growth. 
Although in recent years there has been an increasing understanding of the importance and benefits of mentoring, too few at-risk children are being reached. It is reported that between 5 and 15 million children in the U.S. could benefit from being matched with a mentor. The status quo cannot meet this need. 
As I rise today to talk about the value and importance of mentoring to at-risk youth, we are in the midst of a crisis in the form of a growing tide of juvenile crime. While overall crime rates have been stabilizing and even decreasing in some areas, crime among our youth has been on the rise. If trends continue, juvenile arrests for violent crime will double by the year 2010. 
In addition to juvenile crime, today's youth faces other serious problems. Every day in America 2,795 teens get pregnant, 1,512 teenagers drop out of school, and 211 children are arrested for drug use. 
If we don't act quickly and decisively, we risk losing a whole generation of young people. We need to save our kids. 
Mr. President, that is why in 1992 I authored the Juvenile Mentoring Program (JUMP). JUMP is administered by the Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). JUMP is targeted specifically at reducing juvenile delinquency and gang participation, improving academic performance, and reducing the dropout rate by introducing adult mentors as role models, counselors, and friends for at-risk youth. Both local education agencies and public/private non-profit organizations receive JUMP grants. 
Since its enactment, JUMP has funded 93 separate mentoring programs in over half the States in the Union. The competition for these JUMP awards is great: Over 479 communities submitted applications for the recent round of grants. JUMP grantees use a variety of program designs. Mentors are law enforcement and fire department personnel, college students, senior citizens, Federal employees, businessmen, and other private citizens. The mentees are of all races they come from urban, suburban, and rural communities, and range in age from 5 to 20. Some are incarcerated or on probation, some are in school, and some are dropouts. In its first year, JUMP helped to keep thousands of at-risk young people in 25 States in school and off the streets through one-to-one mentoring. 
Mr. President, now is the time to take mentoring to the next level. The JUMP Ahead Act enhances the basic successful structure of JUMP, and increases awards to up to $200,000. It also increases authorized funding to $50 million per year for 4 years, for a total of $200 million. This initiative will not only vastly increase the number of mentoring programs able to receive grants, but it also creates a new category of grants that will enable experienced national organizations to provide needed technical assistance to emerging mentoring programs nationwide. Also, the legislation mandates the Justice Department to rigorously evaluate the program to document what is effective, and what does not produce results. The increased funding allows the DOJ to award grants to a wider group of applicants, allowing for greater diversity and creativity. However, the high standards set by the JUMP program still must be met by all grantees. 
Mr. President, mentoring works. Not only is this confirmed by common sense and life experience, but also by scientific study. Perhaps the most well-known mentoring program is the world-renowned Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America, a federation of more than 500 agencies that serve children and adolescents. About one quarter of all JUMP grantees are Big Brothers/Big Sisters affiliates. They have been providing mentors to young people for over 90 years with wonderful results. And now those results have been scientifically validated. 
A carefully designed independent evaluation of mentoring programs found tremendously positive results and that mentoring programs offer great promise. Most noteworthy among those findings was that mentored youth were 46 percent less likely to initiate drug use. An even stronger effect was found for minority Little Brothers and Little Sisters, who were 70 percent less likely to initiate drug use than similar minority youth. 
Additionally, Mr. President, mentored youth were 27 percent less likely to initiate alcohol use, and minority Little Sisters were only about one-half as likely to initiate alcohol use. The study also found that mentored youth skipped half as many days of school, felt more competent about doing schoolwork, skipped fewer classes, and showed modest gains in their grade point averages. These gains were strongest among Little Sisters, particularly minority Little Sisters. 
Mr. President, effective mentoring programs require agencies that take substantial care in recruiting, screening, matching, and supporting volunteers. These are critical functions for an effective mentoring program. The investment in comparison to the benefits to individual kids and society as a whole is minimal; approximately $1,000 per child. Such a small price for such an enormous payoff. 
Mr. President, experience and now research tells us that there is a desperate need for a new, more positive approach to developing youth policy and discouraging juvenile crime and violence. Mentoring has proven to be one of the best way to get to kids before they get into trouble. We have been talking for years about the need to provide our children with a better future, to give our kids something to say `yes' to. JUMP was a great, but small, first step in the right direction. Now it is time to take a giant leap--a JUMP Ahead. 
In Washington, we talk easily about investing in our kids' future. Whenever we want to build a highway or a bridge, we call it an investment for the future. If we want to ratify trade treaties, we call it an investment in our future. The same goes for everything from cutting the deficit to building sophisticated defense systems to sending probes to Mars. 
Mr. President, there cannot be a more important investment in the future of our country and our people than directly investing in saving our kids. And that is what mentoring is all about. Mentoring works. Effective mentoring programs can significantly reduce and prevent the use of alcohol and drugs by young people, improve school attendance and performance, improve peer and family relationships, and curb violent behavior. 
Mr. President, what greater investment can we make?

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, in supporting the conference report on this budget reconciliation bill, which, along with the conference report on the tax bill, will finally implement a bipartisan plan to balance the budget. 
I have to ask Senator Domenici, because he talked about the five words that appeared in the Washington Post, I wonder whether it read like this. I heard him say, `This is a big deal.' Or did it say, `This Is A Big Deal?' I wasn't sure quite where the emphasis was. But I assume it was the way it was intended.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. The way the Senator read it himself as opposed to, `This is a Big Deal?' 
I want to say to Senator Roth, who was pulled from so many directions, I was amazed to see him arrive in one piece each day. He listened with great patience--great patience and great interest. Everybody is pleased. I will speak about it from the Democratic side. People don't realize, when there is a majority and a minority, the minority doesn't always get a chance to present their views. But Bill Roth, Senator Bill Roth of Delaware, is known as someone who is a fair-minded person, and while he would not always agree, he would almost always listen. I have never found him to say `no,' and I appreciated that. I think it produced a very good product. It is, under the circumstances, I think, perhaps the best that could have been gotten. All of us wish there were other things in there--everybody. If you ask any Member of the Senate whether they did not think there was another thing that should have been in or another thing that should have been out, they would have, I guarantee, a menu of things they would like to select from. 
I am so pleased that we are joined in the Chamber by the ranking member of the Finance Committee, my good friend and colleague from New York, Mr. Moynihan. Senator Moynihan is a man with vast knowledge about so many things that I often say I would enjoy, even with all my white hair, going to college with Professor Moynihan and hearing his views on things. But there is always a background of information that adds so much to the dialog and the debate, and I congratulate him for his role and for his willingness to hear the arguments and to work to try to get a consensus in the legislation which we now have in front of us.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will continue to extend congratulations to some who are not here. I have to take my time to salute the efforts of Senator Daschle, who was ever present in his encouragement to get this job done--let's see what we can negotiate together, let's see if we can make this adjustment or that adjustment, or talked to his counterpart on the other side. And I want to say for Senator Lott, the majority leader, he, too, was someone who wanted to get this bill behind us, get this job done, and he has shown his interest in doing that as he runs the Senate from the majority leader's position that we do move things along. There were Members on both sides of the aisle who also helped, too numerous to mention, but I think it is fair to say that those whom we have talked about had a significant role. 
Pete Domenici and I were among the four elected representatives to be negotiating, and we were often closeted days at a time. Though the atmosphere got stuffy, I think neither one of us did, and we were able to continue talking in a civilized fashion. 
The bill before us is the culmination of those many months of intense effort and people of both parties deserve to be proud of this accomplishment. This budget proves that when leaders with good will come together, we can overcome partisan divisions and find common ground. That is good news for all Americans. 
I will say this. We have gotten a lot of salutations, a lot of compliments about getting this job done. Threaded through those comments were the kinds of remarks that might surprise, like: Finally, the bickering has stopped, there is no partisanship involved; hurrah, the Senate and the House are working to get our interests put up front. I think that was kind of a noteworthy thing. It's not that we spend all of our time in the boxing ring here. But sometimes, when people's positions on legislation get too entrenched, they lose sight of the fact that we have to stop the argument and get on with producing a product. So, I think the Nation is going to be better off because of this. 
The budget agreement is not perfect. It is not drafted exactly as I, as I said, nor any other Senator would have written it. But it is an honorable compromise that, on balance, is an enormous step forward. It will lead to the first balanced budget in this country since 1969. It invests in education and helps ordinary Americans afford college. It provides health coverage for many of America's uninsured children. And it provides tax relief for middle-class families. It provides important protections for kids and legal immigrants, people who were invited to come here and who later became disabled. And it helps accomplish something that President Clinton has had on the agenda for a long time--to move people from welfare to work, and to provide the means with which to make that transition. 
More generally, it shows we can both be fiscally responsible and true to our highest values as a nation. This budget agreement will produce roughly $900 billion in net deficit savings over the next 10 years. It will give us the first balanced budget in a generation. It will build on President Clinton's tremendous success in reducing the deficit. And one cannot ignore--and Senator Domenici knew this was coming--one could not ignore the incredible accomplishments, economic accomplishments that have been made since President Clinton has been in office--with a budget deficit that was at $290 billion when he took over in 1993, and at the moment looking like it is going to be something less than $50 billion for the year 1997. It will build on President Clinton's tremendous success in reducing that deficit. It will build on the success that we have had in getting new jobs for people in our country--12 million new jobs created. And the stock market--one can't help but notice that indicator. I noticed today, after hearing the news and yesterday after hearing the news, the market continued to move upward. Inflation is in check. People feel very good about the strength of the United States, leading the world's most developed countries in competing in the marketplace. That is a terrific record upon which to build. 
This balanced budget amendment is an extension of all of those good things. But I think the President is due a lot of credit for having brought that deficit down to where it was, based on his hard work and, yes, a turn of very good events at the same time. But it was his foresight and his planning that helped enable us to get to this point. 
The budget agreement, also, will move our Nation into the 21st century by providing the largest investment in education in 50 years. I, as a recipient of the benefits of the GI bill--I served in the war. I don't always like discussing which one. Sometimes people ask me if it was the Spanish American? It was not. It was World War II. But, without the GI bill, my widowed mother, age 36 when my father died, and the poor circumstances in which our family found ourselves when I was discharged from the Army--never, never would have enabled me to get a college education and get a start on a career that has been very satisfying for me and, I hope, worthwhile for the country. So I saw the value of helping someone get a head start in life, someone getting an education and being able to contribute to our society. That is what I want to see us do and the President certainly led us to that point. 
The tax bill we are going to be considering also will include a $1,500 tax credit to make the first 2 years of college universally available. There will be a tuition tax credit for all working Americans who want to pursue lifelong learning, continue to learn. That enriches the mind, enriches the body, and enriches the quality of life. That is what we have seen in so many cases. If you look in the universities and research laboratories and so forth, you see the people who continue to learn and who gain vitality and youth, even as they do that. These provisions are critically important to the future of our economy. 
In addition, the budget agreement also includes $24 billion for children's health care, the largest increase in children's health care since the enactment of Medicaid in 1965. This will help provide health insurance to millions of uninsured children and it is a tremendous achievement. 
The budget agreement also protects Medicare and extends the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by roughly another 7 years. Unlike earlier proposals, it does not ask senior citizens to bear unfair burdens and it doesn't threaten the quality of their health care. Instead, it reforms and modernizes the program and includes significant new preventive benefits. 
We all know there is going to be a more thorough review of Medicare in the years ahead, to see whether we can comprehensively make changes that will guarantee that solvency for as long as one can imagine. 
In addition, the agreement provides tax relief for the middle class. As we will discuss when we turn to the tax bill, the agreement provides a $500 tax credit for children under the age of 17, to help families to be able to bring up their children in the fashion that would provide them with sustenance and direction, and perhaps help them get started on their education. Importantly, that credit will be available to working families with lower incomes. This sounds a little mysterious but there are people whose incomes are supported by assistance from the Government, earned-income tax credit, in which a family that is below a certain level of income gets a stipend or a tax refund from the Government. It often makes their lives livable. But there was a huge debate about whether or not this credit would be available for people who do not pay taxes in the first place. But we know they are working families and they do pay payroll taxes and we decided, jointly, that it would be appropriate to give some credit on those payroll taxes that they pay. 
We, the Democrats, made that a priority. With support from our Republican friends we won an important victory for millions of ordinary Americans. 
The conference report also restores a basic level of fairness for people who have come into this country legally, who have obeyed the law, paid their taxes, and then fate delivers them a disability whether through accident or just sickness. Last year the Congress pulled the rug out from under these people and eliminated their disability benefits; for some, the only provision that they have that enables them to get along. But today we are restoring that basic safety net. It is the right thing to do. As the Senate sponsor of this amendment I am particularly pleased that it will be enacted into law. 
Another important section of the conference report will protect 30,000 disabled children who otherwise would lose Medicaid coverage. This corrects a serious defect in last year's welfare legislation and will make a huge difference for these children and their families. I am also pleased that the budget agreement includes a renewed commitment to environmental protection. We will be enacting new incentives to clean up thousands of contaminated, abandoned sites in economically distressed areas. That not only will improve the environment, but it will help encourage redevelopment of these areas, known as brownfields. 
I have seen it in towns in New Jersey, industrial cities that had a glorious past but now suffer from the delinquency that often results from industrial pollution. Some of these communities have had these sites, dormant sites, small sites that were unused, yet with people begging for work not blocks away, able to get there; people begging for retail facilities--they are not used. We have seen, in New Jersey, where we have cleaned up a few of these sites, good retail activity--in one site in Hackensack, NJ, with a couple of hundred people working in a discount store, a marketplace that people can go to, to get their goods, buy their food. It has been a miracle, almost, to see these things. And it is, often, for very small sums of money. 
So we now have brownfields that I worked very hard on. It's now in place. It's a win-win approach that will make a difference for communities around the Nation. 
Additionally, the conference report includes important provisions to move people from welfare to work as I mentioned. One million long-term welfare recipients stand to benefit from this initiative. And the Nation as a whole will benefit, as more Americans leave welfare and become productive members of our economy, lift their heads high, lift their spirits, provide some vision for themselves and their families. It is a wonderful vision and I am pleased to see we are putting the resources there to make it happen. 
Mr. President, I am going to leave to others the discussion on some of the other details of this legislation. But I once again take the opportunity to congratulate the President, President Clinton, for his outstanding leadership in this effort. We are here today on a bipartisan basis only because the President decided it could happen and he wanted to make it happen. His people were all over the place, working alike with Democrats who occasionally disagreed and Republicans who occasionally disagreed. He brought us all together and we are grateful for that. I think his commitment will be acknowledged for many years to come. 
Mr. President, I don't think, as I said earlier, there is anyone who would say they are 100 percent happy with this 
agreement. But, while no one sees it as perfect, everyone should see it as good. It is fair, it is balanced, and it will serve our country well. It will balance the budget. It will invest in education and training. It will provide tax relief to the middle class. It will protect Medicare. It will provide health care coverage to millions of children. It will throw a life vest to disabled legal immigrants. It will invest in environmental protection, move people from welfare to work, and will make life better for millions of ordinary working Americans. 
So I urge my colleagues to put aside as much challenge as they can. Yes, everybody in this place is free to make their statements, to say what they want. But I hope in the final analysis they are going to support this budget agreement enthusiastically, because it sends a message to the American people. It will say yes, this wasn't something that was nurtured through an inch at a time. This is something that was supported by people across the room from different States and from different parties. That is the way it ought to be. It is the right thing for America and I am proud to have been a part of it. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in the almost afterglow of feeling pretty good about things, we worked hard, everybody together. There were no fingers pointed. 
I chided the chairman of the committee this morning when he excerpted from the headline of the Washington Post. He said that the headline in five words said, `This is a Big Deal.' I 
asked a question. Was the intonation properly affixed, or did it say, `This is a good deal?' It is quite a different meaning.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is a big deal; a giant deal. I think, without breaking our arms or patting ourselves on the back, there was a lot of goodwill that was injected into the discussion and into the debate. 
My colleague from Idaho, who is a man who has a way with words, kind of laid it on us and included the President in there as someone who did buy into the balanced budget notion but was dragged kicking and screaming. 
Mr. President, I wish it was 1 o'clock in the afternoon and we were all energized and we had a chance to talk a little bit. But I will not prolong the process except for a minute or two to say, since it took what I thought was a slight partisan turn--it makes me unhappy when things have gone this well this way to say that I have been here long enough to remember Presidents Reagan and Bush. I like them both. They are nice people. But people on their watch, as we say, who managed to have this deficit of ours skyrocket right up into the air--turn up the tax cuts and let the deficits run. That is what they did. 
When our President and the Democratic Party took over in 1992, 1993, he inherited a deficit that year of $290 billion without a balanced budget amendment but with the interest that was generated. Yes, we were profligates, and we spent too much money, and perhaps we did a few things wrong. But it was an honest try all the way. And the assertion or the insinuation that these guys didn't care or those guys didn't care, it is not a way to do business. I don't care if we never get a balanced budget amendment. I want to tell you right now. As a matter of fact, I hope you don't. I love the Constitution, and the Constitution loves America, and it is the best document ever written. The fact that we have altered it so few times is a testimony to the strength and the wisdom of the Founders and those who have written amendments. 
The only time we wrote an amendment that kind of restricted our activity was prohibition, and it was soon canceled. It is a wonderful prescription for how a society should function, preserving individual rights and making sure that the freedoms as much as possible are extended to every citizen in our country. 
So I just felt like I had to respond. No one worked harder than the man on my right, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici. I didn't always agree with him, but nobody worked harder, and no one assembled a more honest attempt to do it in a bipartisan fashion. There were things that he wanted that we on my side of the aisle didn't want. But he was willing to explain them and willing to take a deep breath when necessary not to fight them. I have gained great respect for him, as well as personal affection, honestly. 
Mr. President, I just want to change the tone for a minute, and let off a little steam and say that I hope we will move on to pass this document into law and make sure that everybody understands there was a good attempt by everybody working in this place to get it done with, to get on with the task that we have a very good start on because of the shape of the deficit that we see now. 
So, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I know the Senator from New Mexico has a UC that he would like to propose. I hope that we will have a chance to hear that.  
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first, I want to say thank you to my colleague from Alabama, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation of Appropriations, for the manner in which we have been able to work together to resolve problems on this bill. I support the leadership he has provided in getting us to this point where we are able to present the Transportation and related agencies appropriations bill for fiscal 1998. This bill was reported by the Appropriations Committee just this past Tuesday, a week ago. 
I don't believe that we give sufficient importance to our investment in transportation infrastructure in this country. There is hardly a State, that I am aware of as I talk to my colleagues, that is satisfied with its ability to deal with congestion, its ability to move people and goods from place-to-place efficiently. But I will say this. In view of the sparseness of budget dollars, this bill went quite well. It is the culmination of a very long and arduous effort to reestablish transportation as a priority in 
our Federal budget. 
As the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, I, along with Senator Domenici and several other members, spent a great deal of time and energy trying to ensure that transportation would be treated as we like to see it, as a priority under the budget resolution. That is where it all starts, the allocation of funds in the budget resolution to the various functions of Government. 
Transportation was not one of the priorities that the administration brought to the table. It was a congressional priority. The Congress decided we needed more money for transportation, and we have succeeded in getting it. We are interested in a balanced transportation network. I think the bill now before the Senate does exactly that. 
Our efforts on the budget resolution are well reflected in the sizable funding increases contained in this bill for critical transportation infrastructure programs. I want to thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens for the funding allocation he granted to this subcommittee. He is serving as chairman of the Appropriations Committee for the first time this year and he is doing an excellent job. He and Senator Byrd, the ranking Democrat, worked hard to grant the Transportation Subcommittee an allocation that was consistent with the priority that was placed on transportation when we did the budget resolution. 
Mr. President, this bill has gone through a steady series of improvements as it moved through the process. In the view of this Senator, the bill that was presented to the subcommittee on July 15 just did not go far enough in reflecting the needs of all transportation modes as well as the needs of all regions of the country. The bill had very sizable increases for important national programs such as the Federal-aid highway obligation ceiling and airport grants. However, the bill also provided a freeze on formula funding for mass transit and included insufficient funding for Amtrak's operating subsidy. This funding shortfall in Amtrak could have rapidly brought about the bankruptcy of the railroad very early in the coming fiscal year. 
There are very few countries that have, frankly, as insufficient intercity rail service as does the United States. When you look at the major developed countries of the world other than the United States, all of them, without a doubt, whether it be Japan's bullet train or the French TGV or trains in Germany or other parts of the world that zip along at 180 miles an hour--all of them depend on sizeable operating subsidies from the government. 
I am not sure, nor is the chairman, whether everybody would want to get to Washington in an hour and a half from New York, but we at least ought to make it possible. We could certainly do that and save time waiting at airports. But we must continue to invest, in Amtrak to make that happen. They have new equipment ordered that will accelerate the pace at which passengers can go from Boston to Washington. 
But we needed the cooperation of the chairman, Senator Shelby, and we were able to work together to boost Amtrak's operating subsidy by $154 million above the level originally presented to the subcommittee. The funding level now stands at the level that was requested by the administration. We were also able to provide an additional $200 million in transit formula grants at full committee markup so the percentage boost for transit formula assistance would begin to approach the percentage increases provide for highway formula assistance and for airport grants. 
What we are saying with these important adjustments is that we salute a balanced transportation system in this country that includes highways, includes aviation, includes rail, includes all of the modes of mass transit so we can have the kind of efficiency in our transportation system that we need. 
These adjustments in the bill were made through careful negotiations between Chairman Shelby and myself. They were made without the need for a rollcall vote in either the subcommittee or 
the full committee. That fact is indicative of the cooperation and fair-minded spirit that the chairman has brought to this bill. 
With these changes now included in the transportation funding bill, I am pleased to recommend this bill to the entire Senate. It is a balanced bill that provides desperately needed funds to our States and communities to address the crushing problem of congestion in our cities and towns. As a matter of fact, in our region they are about to celebrate the initiation of another technological improvement in the collection of tolls. Some people do not support the rapid collection of tolls. They want to hang onto their money as long as possible. But the choice, Mr. President, is to sit in traffic for 15 minutes, 20 minutes, or a half hour at the toll gate. I drove, on Sunday, through one of what they call the easy pass tollgates. I want to tell you, it was a pleasure. They had a little thing on the windshield and when we got to the gate, up went the gate, down went my $4. But the fact of the matter is, it does improve the way we move ahead. 
That is the kind of improvements that we need. We have to continue to present technological innovation to improve the way our highways, our airports, and our railroads function. 
So, I think it is fair to say that this funding will accelerate our efforts to address improvements in our transportation infrastructure, which is deteriorating faster, frankly, than we can replace it. The bill will also provide critically needed funding, as you heard from the chairman, to maintain safety in all our transportation modes. I want to point out, there is still one significant hole in this bill, and that is the funding for Amtrak's capital account. Those are the investments necessary to build the infrastructure, buy the equipment, update the rail signals, to upgrade the trackage that we have down there. We need more investment in the capital account so that we can operate more efficiently. 
The bill does not include any funding for Amtrak's capital needs because we believe the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, is currently seeking to provide for these needs through the reconciliation process. I know the chairman and I have a commitment that this is going to be taking place. I would only point out Senator Shelby's decision not to put any more capital funding in this bill was because he, as I said earlier, believed that Senator Roth was going to take care of it in the finance package. I hope that that ultimately gets to be the case, because that would provide Amtrak with a stable source of funding to address their capital needs over a period of several years, get that railroad up to the level that it ought to be in a country as great as ours. 
Last, Mr. President, I commend my colleague and friend, Senator Shelby, for his excellent work in his first year as chairman of this subcommittee. He quickly gained a great deal of knowledge about how the committee functions. 
I offered to take over the chairmanship temporarily to show him how, but he said, no, he would take care of it. We worked together, with our fine staff--the names of whom Senator Shelby mentioned--to get it done. 
When it comes to the distribution of funds for the Member-specific projects, those projects they put forward as being critical in nature to their States, Senator Shelby has been fairminded in his allocation of funds. He sought to accommodate Members' priorities to the best of the subcommittee's ability, and he has continued to operate that way. 
I must say, I tip my hat to the fact that he is determined and has shown in this first chairmanship year that he can deal in a bipartisan fashion, and everybody got along. We occasionally had to face up to some tough discussions, but we always did it in an amicable way and we got a good bill. 
That has been the tradition with the Transportation Subcommittee, and that is do it in a bipartisan way. The American people don't want to see us bickering. They want to see us getting things done. They want to see us function as we are supposed to function. Disagree, if you will, make the points you have to make, but get the job done. I think it is fair to say that the Appropriations Committee, on which both of us have sat for some time, is maintaining almost a revolutionary pace in terms of getting the job done this year, and I am proud to be part of it and proud to work with my colleagues on the committee. 
With that, Mr. President, I hope we can move this bill with expediency. I yield the floor.  
Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am pleased also, Mr. President, to support this project. And I have reviewed the plans several times over these last couple of years. It increases the ability of that port to function and to expedite the movement of freight from the port into the main line system. Otherwise, there are some problems with heights and of the cars that can pass underneath the bridges, so it needs some work. And we hope that Rhode Island will get this completed. 
We all know that essential to our economic development is the capacity to get people and goods to and from the business opportunities that either exist or want to be developed. So this one sounds like a pretty good idea. 
Senator Shelby said it. He said we have heard from Senator Chafee periodically, regularly. We have heard from the Governor of the State who, if I remember, is about 6' 4', something of that nature. They made sure they brought him in. We got the message, Mr. President. Senator Reed was also involved. So it is a unified delegation. And they are working hard to get it done. And we want to help wherever we can.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if I may say to my colleague, the chairman, I will just take the floor for a couple minutes and say that we have now been here 2 hours. It was the understanding when we left last week that the Transportation Subcommittee's bill would be up this evening with an opportunity to offer amendments and consider the business of the bill. We have had hardly a response. 
I do not have to lecture my colleagues, certainly, but this is the last week before we adjourn for August and get home to do the things we have to do with our constituents. I hope we can help move the process along. We ask our colleagues to join in to get the business of the people done, to get those amendments up here as quickly as we can tomorrow. 
We intend--and I discussed this with Senator Shelby--to be here long enough to get the work done, but we cannot do it unless people offer their amendments and take advantage of the opportunity to make those suggestions that they think improve the bill. 
So I send out this plea, Mr. President, probably to those who are just turning off their TV sets around the Capitol and say that we hope you will remember the bill will be open again tomorrow after the votes which are now listed and that we can get to work on passing the appropriations bill for 1998, one that we can send over to the House and get a conference on. We are moving along at a very good pace with our appropriations bills for next year, and we ought to continue to help that pace, get done, and let the people across the country know the appropriate investments are going to be made in the things that are included in this bill. 
With that simple admonition, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am submitting legislation expressing the sense of Congress that the Postal Service should issue a postage stamp should be issued to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America. I am pleased to be joined by my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania and chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Senator Specter. 
The Jewish War Veterans of the United States was founded in 1896, earning it the distinction of being the oldest veterans organization in the United States. The goal of its founders was to counter criticism in some of the major national publications of the day that suggested that Jewish Americans were unpatriotic and had not served in the Civil War. Not only did many Jews serve with distinction in the Civil War, but thousands have honorably served their country in subsequent military conflicts. More than 250,000 Jews served in World War I. During World War II, approximately 11,000 Jews were killed and 40,000 were wounded. 
Today, the Jewish War Veterans organization continues its mission of fighting anti-Semitism, promoting religious tolerance and defending the first amendment. Moreover, through its National Museum of American Jewish Military History and other activities, it educates the public about the contributions Jews have made to the defense of our Nation. The organization also serves a vital role of advocating on behalf of adequate treatment of all war veterans. 
My legislation is identical to legislation submitted to the 103d Congress. Senate Concurrent Resolution 60, which I was proud to cosponsor along with 62 of my colleagues. This legislation overwhelmingly passed the Senate on August 11, 1994. Unfortunately, despite the Senate's wishes, the Postal Service has refused to issue a commemorative stamp honoring this worthy organization. Thus, I believe that it is time to reaffirm the Senate's position of this important matter. I urge my colleagues to join in cosponsoring this legislation.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is with a sad and heavy heart that I rise to pay tribute to a great American and New Jerseyan, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., who passed away yesterday at age 91. The thoughts and prayers of all the people of our State and country are with his wife Mary, his three children William J., III, Hugh, and Nancy, as well as his seven grandchildren. 
Mr. President, during nearly 34 years on the Supreme Court, Justice Brennan had an enormous impact on this Nation's constitutional jurisprudence. Justice Brennan was a consistent champion of freedom of expression, of strict separation of church and state, and of equality for the poor, racial minorities, and women. In fact, he was a life-long defender of the freedoms of all Americans. 
William Brennan's life was truly the epitome of the American Dream. He was born in Newark, NJ, on April 25, 1906, the second oldest of the eight children of an Irish immigrant who started as a laborer but rose through the ranks to become an important labor leader and the city's commissioner of public safety. `Everything I am,' the justice later wrote, `I am because of my father.' 
He was an outstanding student at Barringer High School in Newark. He then went on to study at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Finance and Commerce. He was graduated with honors and won a scholarship to the Harvard Law School, from which he received a degree in 1931. 
Upon graduation, Bill Brennan embarked upon a successful and distinguished career in private legal practice. He later served his country by entering active military service in 1942, eventually becoming a colonel and troubleshooter for Army procurement. 
After returning from the war, he quickly emerged as a leader of the New Jersey bar, particularly his involvement in New Jersey's court reform movement under a nationally renowned Chief Justice Arthur Vanderbilt. His talents were widely recognized in the legal community, leading to his appointment to the New Jersey trial bench, from which he rapidly ascended to the State supreme court. 
Mr. President, it was during this tenure on the New Jersey court that Justice Brennan first gained national attention. He was one of the first public figures to take on the infamous Senator Joseph McCarthy and the excesses of the McCarthy-era. 
Specifically, in one famous speech at the Monmouth County Rotary Club, he boldly referred to certain congressional inquiries as modern counterparts to the Salem witch trials, sentiments very much ahead of his time. 
After 8 years as a State judge, 4 on the State supreme court, Bill Brennan was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Justice Brennan served on the Nation's highest court for 34 years before poor health forced him, at age 84, to retire in 1990. His tenure spanned those of eight Presidents. In the High Court's history, only William O. Douglas wrote more opinions. 
In fact, Justice Brennan's own confirmation as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court was opposed by some because of views that he had expressed about McCarthyism--the speeches that later caused Senator McCarthy to be the lone dissenting vote to President Eisenhower's nomination of Brennan to our Nation's High Court. 
Mr. President, it is not his remarkable life or long tenure on the bench that made William Brennan a towering figure in our Nation's history. Rather, his true legacy is the preservation and expansion of the individual rights all Americans enjoy today. He was, in short, our country's strongest champion of the individual. 
A recent survey of 96 scholars listed Justice Brennan as fifth in the list of all-time great Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. Ahead of him ranked only John Marshall, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Earl Warren, and Louis Brandeis. 
Justice Brennan crafted many landmark decisions associated with the Warren Court of the late 1950's and 1960's. His ruling led to the one-person, one-vote principle of political reapportionment, and empowered everyday citizens to use the courts to fight city hall. 
In more than 1,200 opinions, Justice Brennan defined obscenity and broadened the rights of any person--including the poor, mentally handicapped, or imprisoned--to seek redress against the Government through the courts. He also gave news organizations first amendment protections in libel lawsuits. 
During the Berger and Rehnquist years, he continued to champion the Bill of Rights and the 14th amendment. In all of his opinions and dissents, liberty and equality were his bywords. 
Historian David Halberstam described the source of Justice Brennan's greatness. William Brennan, he wrote, never forgot where he came from. He never forgot his immigrant father shoveling coal for a living, courageously joining a union in an era when to do so could cost a man his livelihood, if not his life. Brennan grew up on a house that knew the meaning of layoffs and discrimination. He instinctively identified with the disadvantaged and the dispossessed. 
Justice Brennan himself revealed the secret of his unfailing humanity, compassion and passion for individual freedom. He wrote that he always focused on the people behind the cases, always aware that the case before the Court was there because of `a person who cried out for nothing more than common human dignity. In each case, our Constitution intervened to provide the cloak of dignity.' 
Mr. President, through it all, Justice Brennan remained universally liked, even adored, by colleagues, law clerks, Court personnel, and virtually everyone who came in contact with him. He was always described as warm, gracious, and utterly without pretense. 
I had the privilege and the honor to get to know Bill Brennan on a personal level. Although it was late in his tenure on the bench, he was remarkably alert, witty and warm, and I greatly enjoyed our conversations. 
Mr. President, Bill Brennan's character, personality, and intellect were perfectly matched, each so unique so as to be totally unforgettable. 
Despite the brevity of our personal relationship, every meeting that we had--perhaps a half-dozen in all--left me feeling like I had just seen a lifelong friend. 
He stood for so much that he helped me stand taller for those I serve. Knowing him was one of my life's most treasured experiences. I deeply regret that our paths will not cross again. 
In a tribute to Justice Brennan, his colleague Justice Byron White once remembered that Bill Brennan's creed was that a judge should proceed with `a sparkling vision of the supremacy of the human dignity of every individual.' 
Mr. President, that majestic statement is a fitting tribute to the life and work of Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am very pleased that today the Senate will recognize the contributions of my dear friend and former colleague, Howard Metzenbaum, by approving this bill designating the Federal Building Courthouse in Cleveland, OH as the `Howard M. Metzenbaum United States Courthouse.' Ohio's two Senators, Senator Glenn and Senator DeWine, were original cosponsors of this legislation, along with Senator Hatch, when I introduced on June 5, 1997. 
Mr. President, I proposed naming a courthouse after Howard because a courthouse is a symbol of justice where all people can come and be treated equally under the law. Howard Metzenbaum deserves this honor because he was a dedicated public servant, who served his home State of Ohio for 18 years in the U.S. Senate. Howard's sense of fairness and equality for all Americans led one of his former colleagues to suggest that Howard would have made an exceptional U.S. Supreme Court Justice when he retired from the Senate in 1994. 
Mr. President, naming a courthouse after Howard is only a small gesture in attempting to remember a man so committed to justice and fairness. Howard's contributions to the Senate are extraordinary, and we commemorate his unique contribution by passing this bill in celebration of his 80th year, his 18 years in the U.S. Senate, and also the special character he brought to our body. 
I pay tribute today to a man who always stood up for what he believed was right, fighting hard to preserve opportunity for those for those yet to come. As a Senator, Howard had a broad range of interests and he pursued them with dogged perseverance, sincerity and clarity. 
Howard and I worked on many issues together during our time in the Senate. Individual rights and environmental preservation were major concerns. He poured his energy into clean air protection, nuclear regulation, cleaning up superfund sites and recycling. Howard provided strong leadership on antitrust issues as chairman of the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Monopolies and Business Rights on the Judiciary Committee. 
He was a persistent gun control advocate, taking the lead on many antigun initiatives in the Senate. He was one of the lead sponsors of the Brady bill handgun purchase waiting period, as well as the bans on assault weapons and plastic explosives. 
But Howard's true passions lay with America's underprivileged and needy communities, which never had a bolder champion. His work on behalf of the poor, the disabled, and the elderly reflect his remarkable compassion for those members of society who face challenges that many of us cannot fully appreciate. He tirelessly defended their interests and fought for their protection. He was dedicated to eradicating discrimination, ensuring adequate health care to those in need and boosting public education. It has been said many times, but for good reason, that Howard brought not only his conscience to the Senate, but also the courage to act on his convictions. 
Howard remains a good friend to me, but was also a mentor and a teacher during his years in the Senate. He gave me good advice and plenty of it. And, I might add, he continues to do so today, which I welcome! But more than that, his dedication to the office of United States Senator is an example by which to live. He stood tall for the little people. 
Some will affectionately remember Howard as determined, argumentative, and even irascible. I cannot deny that those words come to my mind every now and then when describing Howard. He was always at his best then, and for good reason. I heard it said by one Senator, and not a good friend: `If there wasn't a Metzenbaum here, we'd have to invent one to keep us alert.' 
I have missed working with Howard Metzenbaum in this great institution, a place that has been truly enhanced by his presence. I salute him on celebrating his 80th year.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to express my support for Cooper Hospital's Trauma Reduction Initiative. 
Cooper Hospital is located in Camden, NJ, one of the most troubled cities in the Nation. Between 1994 and 1995, the number of violent crimes declined 4 percent nationwide, while in Camden they rose 8.6 percent. Homicides in Camden rose 28.88 percent, while homicides declined 6 percent nationally. With an estimated population of 82,000, Camden ranks as the sixth most violent city in the country when compared to all cities and towns. 
Cooper Hospital's Trauma Reduction Initiative links hospital staff, community leaders, and churches throughout Camden as the frontline of crisis intervention. The Trauma Reduction Initiative represents a community-based approach to deal with the types of violence that disrupt our neighborhoods and burden our health care system. 
According to Government research, by 2003, firearms will have surpassed auto accidents as the leading cause of injury death in the United States. But unlike victims of car accidents, who are almost always privately insured, four out of five firearm victims are receiving public assistance or are uninsured. Thus, taxpayers bear the brunt of medical costs that have grown to $4.5 billion a year in the past decade. Cooper Hospital's violence prevention program is designed to help stop the spiral of violent crime and retaliation in Camden. This program could serve as a model for other cities to follow. 
The Trauma Reduction Initiative has received funding from the Bureau of Justice Assistance. I ask my colleagues, the chairman and ranking member of the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Subcommittee, if they agree that the Trauma Reduction Initiative is worthy of BJA's continued support?

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I want to express my support for the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey's [UMDNJ] Violence Institute, which provides valuable assistance to our efforts to curb violent behavior in all aspects of our society. The Violence Institute's programs are not directed solely at violent behavior of a criminal nature, but also focus on issues of domestic violence, and violence against women and children. I want to note that the Violence Institute was one of only a handful of projects recommended for special funding in the conference report accompanying the fiscal year 1997 Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill. 
I ask my colleagues, the chairman and ranking member of the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Subcommittee, Senators Gregg and Hollings, if they agree that the Violence Institute's initiatives to curb violent behavior are consistent with the Department of Justice's objectives and that such programs are worthy of the Department's support?

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague, the Senator from North Dakota, for his persistence on this issue and on issues of fairness altogether. His leadership on so many issues has been, frankly, the motivator for many here to take up causes that he so ably leads. And in this case, once again, he has indicated how important it is for us to be a fair society. 
Mr. President, I was one of those privileged to be part of the negotiating team. I say `privileged'--some days I am not sure--because the decisions were tough ones. But as we review the tax cuts that are going to be made in the reconciliation bill, the bill to put into place the elements of the budget that we prescribed as a direction, I want to talk about the importance of ensuring that any tax cuts that we make be principally targeted to ordinary middle-class families and that we not permit an explosion of the deficit in the future as a result of tax cuts. 
Mr. President, we are coming off of a really good period for America. The economy is strong. People are working, inflation is down, and we are assured by the comments yesterday of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve that inflation still looks like it is going to stay down. It is the kind of scene that almost a writer could produce in terms of what you would like to see in an ideal world. 
Our deficit was $290 billion when President Clinton took over, now predicted to be $45 billion for this fiscal year ending September 30. And it is believed that in the year 1998, if things continue as they are, that we will actually be at a zero deficit or perhaps even have a surplus in the 1998 year. That is a wonderful thing to be able to think about because one of the things that we want to do is relieve the burden from our children, our grandchildren in the future to have to pay off debts and to pay the debt service that incurs with deficits. 
But, Mr. President, despite all of the good news--and I come out of the corporate world. I spent 30 years of my life building a business. And I know lots of people who have been successful in business, and I still talk to them. And I have learned in my informal polling that lots of people who have been successful, corporate leaders, CEO's, chief operating officers, chief financial officers, marketing managers, they will say to me in public, `Frank, I don't need a tax cut. What I need is an America that's going in the direction that it is going, that people can count on jobs, where people can believe that inflation and that deficit growth will not be a burden to their children.' That is hardly the legacy that we want to leave. 
As I heard one CEO I had occasion to meet over this weekend describe, who runs a giant, giant company, with over 30,000 employees, he said, `I don't need a capital gains tax cut and I don't need an income tax cut. We don't pay enough,' he said--this is a corporate executive--`We don't pay enough in this country for the benefits we get out of this Nation of ours.' 
And so as we talk about our tax cut, we know where we have to direct it. It has to go to the middle-class families. It has to go to the people who find that two of them have to work in order to do what one was able to do in the past, that they pay the price in many ways for their two-job requirements. They neglect their children, not intentionally, not the kind of neglect that comes with abuse, but they just do not have the time or the energy to put into their families when mother works and dad works and they meet only as they pass through the door. 
I had occasion to meet with one of the service organizations across this country that does mentoring where they tie an adult and child and make sure that child has someone to answer to, someone to converse with. And I asked them about the profile of the children that they see. A lot of them are obviously from poor families, but not all. They said to me a lot of the kids that they are seeing are kids whose families are so beset with the need to earn a living that they do not have time for them. And the kids resort to strangers' encouragement to just get a lift and to get some attention. 
So as we discuss these tax cuts, I plead with my colleagues, make sure that we put them in the hands of the middle class so people can talk to their kids about their education in the future and know very well that they have a chance to get out of the economic difficulties that they may see their parents in, that they can get the education they need, they can get the skills that they need. 
These families love their children. They do not see them much. And they want to plan for their future. And we can help them, Mr. President. We can help them by directing these tax cuts primarily to the middle class so that they can help their kids with their education and provide for their own retirement. These are the people who need the tax relief. 
But, unfortunately, these are not the people who are going to get the bulk of the relief in the House and the Senate tax bills. Those bills provide roughly 45 percent of their tax cuts to the top 10 percent of income earners in the country. And it is just not right. There is a better way, Mr. President. And President Clinton has shown us how. His plan provides many of the same types of tax cuts that are included in the Republican plan, and the total amount of tax relief is roughly the same but the provisions in the President's plan are structured differently to give most of the benefits to ordinary hard-working Americans. 
Under the President's plan, the middle 60 percent of income earners receive two-thirds of the tax cuts, the middle 60 percent get two-thirds of the tax cuts. By contrast, under the Senate and House plans, the middle-income working families receive only one-third of the benefits--one-third. 
The President's plan provides a $500 tax credit for children, but unlike the Senate and the House plans, it makes the credit available for working families with little or no tax liability. In fact, the Senate and the House plans deny the child tax credit to millions of hard-working families who pay taxes and earn less than $30,000 a year, the subject that the Senator from North Dakota was addressing just moments ago. 
Some in Congress are claiming that providing tax breaks to teachers and police officers, firefighters somehow amounts to welfare. It is ridiculous and it is an insult to millions of hard-working American families. 
The President's plan cuts capital gains taxes. It cuts estate taxes, and it provides new incentives for savings. But the President does it in a fair way that benefits primarily the middle class. And that is the key difference. Another advantage of the President's tax plan is its costs do not explode in the outyears, the years after those that we are talking about with our budget prescription now. 
The Senate and House bills include several provisions with costs that increase substantially in the future. Why should we give a tax break today and have to pay for it doubly in the 5- to 10-year period after this? 
Yesterday, the Treasury Department released an analysis showing that the House's capital gains rates balloon from $35 billion in the first 10 years to almost $200 billion in the subsequent 10 years--from $35 to $200 billion. And that is an exploding tax cut if there ever was one. There is no way for us to function. 
Mr. President, I have heard it argued there is no way to cut taxes without disproportionately benefiting the wealthy. Some serious people make that argument, but it is an absurd argument. Surely, if we can plan to get to Mars and do all the great things that this country has the capacity to do, we can find a way to target tax cuts to the middle class. It does not take a rocket science. It is much simpler. It does take, however, a commitment not only from the head but from the heart as well. And President Clinton's plan proves it can be done. 
So, Mr. President, I want to continue working with all of my colleagues to make the tax bill as fair as possible. I would like to cut the taxes for the middle class and working Americans, the people who need it the most. And I would like to see it done in a fiscally responsible way that does not burden future generations with the exploding deficits in the future. 
I yield the floor.  
Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Worldwide Tobacco Disclosure Act of 1997. I am joined by Senators Wyden, Durbin, and Harkin. Our bill will address a loophole in current law that enables packages of cigarettes to be exported from this country without warning labels and to prevent the executive branch from undermining other countries' restrictions on tobacco. 
Within a few decades, the World Health Organization estimates that 10 million people will die annually from tobacco-related disease, up from 3 million per year. An astonishing 70 percent of those deaths will be in developing countries. To give my colleagues a basis for comparison, in America, today, approximately 400,000 die a year from tobacco. While smoking has declined 10 percent since 1990 in developed countries, the WHO concludes it has risen an alarming 67 percent in developing countries during that same period. American tobacco exports have increased by almost 340 percent since the mid-1970's, and these exports now account for more than half of our tobacco companies' sales. 
America is rightfully proud of its exports and the standards it upholds in international trade. But with tobacco, we're exporting death. We are the largest exporter of a product we know kills, and that is not something about which we should be proud. With marketing savvy and millions of dollars, American tobacco companies have significantly increased cigarette consumption in developing countries. It is estimated that cigarette consumption increased by 10 percent as a direct result of American tobacco companies entering the markets of Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan. 
Why should Congress care if hundreds of thousands of teenage boys and girls in China become addicted to nicotine? Why not let their government deal with this matter? Mr. President, morally, we are obligated to warn them, to the extent we know of tobacco's dangers. We are obligated to support the efforts of our trading partners to protect the health of their citizens. 
Mr. President, cigarettes kill and the label should clearly state that. One component of the proposed tobacco settlement between the State attorneys general and the tobacco industry was stronger warning labels on cigarette packages, similar to those I included in legislation introduced earlier this year. While we are taking additional steps to make our citizens more aware of the dangers of tobacco, my colleagues may be surprised to know that our Government requires no warning on exported cigarette packages. We know that smoking is addictive and can kill, but you would never guess that by looking at a pack of Camels exported from this country into Africa or Eastern Europe. When we enacted the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965, we may have thought that other countries would require their own warning labels 
and these would be adequate. We know, Mr. President, that this is simply not the case. 
Too many countries, especially in the developing world, have no warning labels on cigarette packages, and those that do, are inadequate to fully alert their citizens to the dangers of tobacco. Coupled with a poor national health system, citizens in these countries have no chance against tobacco promotional giveaways or slick advertising. Not knowing of the health risks associated with cigarettes, they are easily addicted and a significant percentage of them will die from this product. 
Mr. President, barring further steps, a health crisis resulting from tobacco will occur in the developing world within the next few decades. Our country alone spends $50 billion a year more on health care as a result of tobacco. Imagine what the worldwide cost of tobacco related illness will be in 20 years. Today limited funds are spent combating hunger, AIDS and other infectious diseases, and infant mortality worldwide. In about 10 years, we can add tobacco related illnesses to the list. 
One part of this legislation, Mr. President, requires exported packages of cigarettes to have warning labels in the language of the country where the cigarette will be consumed. Before exporting hazardous materials, Congress requires exports to alert our Government prior to export so that we might warn the government of the importing country that a certain product is being shipped to its borders. Cigarettes are a hazardous product and should be treated differently than an exported widget. Foreign subsidiaries of American tobacco companies will also be required to comply with this legislation because we do not want to put our farmers at a competitive disadvantage. This is a global problem that must be addressed by whatever means we have available. Should a country require more stringent labels than ours, the administration could grant a waiver of this provision for that country. 
Mr. President, the success tobacco companies have had selling death overseas is not solely due to their own own efforts. In the past, the U.S. Government assisted U.S. tobacco companies in hooking foreigners by using trade policy to dismantle foreign tobacco regulations, such as advertising bans, in several key markets. While most of this assistance occurred in the 1980's, its effects are felt today. Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan were on the other side of this dispute with our Government over their antitobacco laws. They lost, their citizens lost, and the U.S. tobacco companies won. Smoking in those countries is higher as a result of past action by the U.S. Trade Representative. 
Our bill will prevent the USTR from undermining another country's tobacco restrictions if those restrictions are applied to both foreign and domestic products in the same manner. If a country has an advertising ban on tobacco products, our Government should not be spending money trying to dismantle that law if it equally affects foreign and domestic companies. 
This legislation is consistent with a GATT decision from 1990, which held that member nations can use various policies to protect health as long as they are applied evenly to domestic and foreign products, and with statements made by our current U.S. Trade Representative. Charlene Barshefsky stated last year that the U.S. Government should not object when foreign government take steps to protect their citizens by adopting health measures to restrict the consumption of tobacco. 
Mr. President, I hope my colleagues would agree that we should not, in good conscience, turn a blind eye to the untold suffering caused by U.S. exports of this deadly product. We know too much about tobacco to sit idly by while our companies poison tens of millions throughout the world. And if foreign governments do not warn their citizens of tobacco's dangers, enacting this legislation is the very least we can and should do. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my legislation be printed in the Congressional Record along with letters of support for this legislation from the American Lung Association, the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, and the American Heart Association, and two articles from the Washington Post documenting our Government's actions in Asia in the 1980's and how U.S. tobacco companies are targeting overseas markets.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to mark a special anniversary. This year is the 25th anniversary of the restoration of the Permanent Diaconate in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Paterson, NJ. In the Catholic faith, a deacon is a layman who willingly gives his time, talent and treasure to help not only his own church community but, through his work, the entire community. His is a life of service. 
Mr. President, I deeply admire the commitment of these lay people to serve others. They bring to mind the words of the great humanitarian, Albert Schweitzer, `The greatest gift we can give to another, is the gift of ourselves.' 
The work done by the 146 deacons of Paterson's Diocese also reminds me of the long tradition of service which communities of faith have in America. Whether Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or other religion, these communities not only minister to individuals' spiritual needs, but to all of their needs. They may provide tangible support like food and shelter, or simply compassion, counseling, and concern. 
Mr. President, I offer my congratulations to the Diaconate of the Diocese of Paterson, and to Msgr. Ken Lasch who, 25 years ago, laid the cornerstone upon which the Diaconate's success has been built. As a native of Paterson, I am pleased that we have these dedicated men in our midst who are serving both their church and our community.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for several New Jersey projects included in the Senate's version of the fiscal year 1998 military construction appropriations, as well as several New Jersey projects included in the House version of this legislation. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I hope all of these projects will be included in the final version of the bill. 
I appreciate the willingness of the chairman and ranking member to include $1.3 million in design funding for a new software engineering facility at Picatinny Arsenal. This funding will allow the Picatinny to consolidate the design, development, testing, configuration control, field release and maintenance of weapon systems, simulators, and trainers. It will result in reduced cost for the Army and will improve efficiency in the software engineering process. 
I also appreciate the willingness of the Senate subcommittee to provide funding for two important projects at McGuire Air Force Base. The Senate's bill includes $9.954 million for an air mobility operations group warehouse, which will increase the efficiency of the base's mobility operations. Additionally, it includes $35.217 million for an ambulatory health care center replacement. This new facility will house a full-service outpatient operation and provide adequate space for clinics, ambulatory surgery, ancillary services, storage, offices, and administration. It will improve the quality of care provided to our military personnel. 
In addition, the House version of this bill provides $9.03 million for an ammunition supply point at Fort Dix, $8.8 million for a fire station at McGuire Air Force Base, $2.05 million for a fire station at Fort Monmouth, and $7.3 million to build 35 units of family housing at Picatinny Arsenal. These are meritorious projects that deserve the support of the conferees. I hope the conferees to this bill will agree to include these projects to improve the quality of life and to support the missions at New Jersey's military installations in the final version of this legislation. 
These projects are vital to New Jersey's defense infrastructure, and to those who work on these bases. I hope the chairman and ranking member will support these important New Jersey projects in the conference agreement to the fiscal year 1998 military construction bill.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I support this amendment and am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this effort to require the General Accounting Office [GAO] to report to Congress on the effects of the VA's veterans equitable resource allocation [VERA] system. I support the effort to fund all veterans health care networks at least at the fiscal year 1996 level until this report is complete. 
As a member of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, I voted against the implementation of VERA because I believe it would unfairly shift veterans health care resources away from New Jersey at a time when our aging veterans population has an increasing need for VA health care services. New Jersey's veterans fought hard for our country and they deserve direct access to quality medical care. I share the concern of many of my Northeastern colleagues that the VERA system may disproportionally affect our veterans access to quality health care services. 
This amendment makes sense. It requires the GAO to report to Congress on the effects of VERA. It allows for a pause in the shifting of resources, which began in April, until Congress is certain that VERA will not hurt veterans in the Northeast. If the study shows that VERA will disrupt health care services to veterans in New Jersey and other Northeastern States, Congress will have the information necessary to ensure that these services are not compromised. Until Congress has this information, services should be provided at the pre-VERA levels. We should pause and assess the impact before moving forward with VERA. I hope the chairman and ranking member will include this provision, or one similar to it, in the final version of this bill.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for a provision in the House version of the fiscal year 1998 VA-HUD appropriations bill to provide $21.1 million in funding for the construction of an ambulatory care addition at the Lyons, NJ, VA Medical Center. This facility is sorely needed by the veterans in New Jersey, and I hope the Senate will recede to the House on this issue during the conference. 
The Lyons VA Medical Center serves nearly 75 percent of New Jersey's veterans, and this funding will provide vital medical care for veterans who receive care on an outpatient basis. It will provide for necessary construction and renovations to enhance Lyons' clinics, diagnostic and treatment services, emergency department, and support functions. The funding will make a significant contribution to improving the access to quality medical care by New Jersey's veterans. 
At a time when New Jersey's aging veteran population has an increasing need for VA health care services, we have an obligation to ensure that their health care needs are met. As a member of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, I urge my colleagues on the committee to include this funding in the conference agreement.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies appropriations bill presents an all too common dilemma--inadequate funds and very deserving programs--and the choices we must make are very difficult indeed. 
I appreciate the difficult job the chairman and ranking member had in dealing with an insufficient Section 602(b) allocation. 
However, as a strong advocate for our environment, and as ranking on the Budget Committee, I am very disappointed at the level of funding for the Environmental Protection Agency's operating budget. The mark for EPA's operation is $200 million below the President's request and the budget agreement. 
I am specifically concerned that we are continuing to add duties to EPA without the accompanying resources. This budget does not provide the funding needed to meet Congress's demands that EPA carry out more cost-benefit analysis in its regulations, for additional outreach to small businesses, and for fuller consideration of stakeholders in the regulatory process. 
Nor does it provide adequate funding to combat global warming. Indeed, at a recent Environment and Public Works Committee hearing the only issue on which all the witnesses agreed was the need for more funding for critical climate change research. 
I am also disappointed that the mark does not include any funding increase for superfund. I understand the chairman believes that superfund must be reauthorized before that money is appropriated. I disagree with that assessment. However, I am working closely with Senators Smith, Baucus, and Chafee and I expect we soon will have a bipartisan bill. 
If that bill comes after this appropriations cycle, I will urge my colleagues to support a supplemental that funds hazardous waste clean up to the level in the budget agreement. The millions of people living near superfund sites deserve our efforts to fully fund this program. 
I am also disappointed that the chairman's mark zeros-out Community Development Financial Institutions, or CDFI. One hundred twenty-five million dollars was included in the budget agreement. I understand the House included full funding for this important program and I look forward for a better outcome during the conference. 
Mr. President, I am very pleased the Appropriations Committee, the members unanimously agreed to my amendment to transfer money for investigations of chemical accidents from EPA and OSHA to the Chemical Safety Board. 
An independent Chemical Safety Board, with its expertise and objectivity, is the proper body to investigate and identify steps needed to prevent future accidents. In 1990, Congress established the independent Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board to do just that. The board was modeled on the respected and influential National Transportation Safety Board. As part of its reinventing government program, the administration cut funding for the chemical board and tried to transfer its authority to EPA and OSHA. Subsequent events, including an investigation in New Jersey, show that this reorganization was ill-advised. 
By reviving the board, Congress is reasserting its authority and protecting the workers and communities around chemical industrial sites. 
I want to thank those who helped revive this board. First, I want to acknowledge the help of Senator Bond and Mikulski. I also want to thank the public interest groups, the oil, chemical, and atomic workers, and the companies that have publicly recognized the advantage of having this board. I want to single out for acknowledgment Marathon Oil and 
the Rohm & Haas Corp. in that regard.

Mr. Lautenberg. Finally, I want to thank the Chairman of the Committee for including report language assuring the citizens of Toms River, N.J. that the study of the cancer cluster will be completely carried out. The language in the report underscores the Federal commitment to pursuing the cause of the cancer cluster and making sure this research is completed. 
Mr. President, as I close my statement, I want to once again acknowledge Senator Bond and Mikulski for the difficult job they did in face of inadequate resources.  
Exhibit 1 July 17, 1997. 
Hon. Ted Stevens, Committee on Appropriations, Capitol, Washington, DC. 
Dear Chairman Stevens: As members of social justice, environmental, religious, and labor organizations we are writing to express our full support for a $6 million appropriation to fund the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board. We request your support and that of others on your committee in passing the Lautenberg amendment which would provide this funding. 
Modelled after the respected and influential National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSHIB) was established by the 1990 Clean Air Act to independently investigate the root causes of chemical accidents and offer recommendations on ways to prevent accidents in the future. However, seven years after its authorization and several years after the confirmation of three of its members, the board is still without funding. 
In 1994, the Administration decided that the Board was redundant in light of efforts to reinvent government. Thus, the Board's duties were subsequently passed to two regulatory agencies, EPA and OSHA. To date these two agencies have done an abominable job in investigating chemical accidents. For example, 27 months following a major accident at Napp Technologies in Lodi, N.J., which claimed the lives of five workers, an accident investigation report has yet to be released. This is not the fault of the dedicated compliance personnel in the field. OSHA and EPA are primarily concerned with determining violations of specific standards, not with the kind of comprehensive investigations needed to determine the root causes of major chemical accidents. Further, questions have been raised about the legal jurisdiction of those agencies. For example, following an accident at a Tosco oil refinery in Martinez, Calif., EPA was barred from entering the facility to investigate the accident because the agency could not provide proof of their authority to enter. Finally, jurisdictional problems have plagued the attempt to delegate authority to investigate the causes of chemical accidents within two separate agencies 
The Chemical Safety Board, on the other hand, is an independent, non-regulatory body, and the Board's findings, conclusions, and recommendations cannot be admitted as evidence or used in litigation. In both this case and the case of transport accidents, Congress wisely chose to separate the regulatory agencies from those charged with investigations. Thus, the Board can investigate the root causes of industrial accidents, conduct research, oversee the performance of chemical safety standards, and recommend improvements in chemical manufacturing, processing, transport and storage free from political and industrial interference. Federal agencies, such as EPA and OSHA, are required to respond to, but are not bound to adopt, the high-profile recommendations issued by the Board. As is the case with recommendations made by the highly regarded NTSB, we would hope that those made by the Chemical Safety Board would be quickly and efficiently adhered to by industry. 
Chemical accidents continue to occur on average 21 times a day in the United States, costing human lives, causing untold damage to property and the environment, and increasing health care and environmental clean-up costs. Recent chemical disasters clearly illustrate the need for this independent board and its work to refine, coordinate, direct, and improve federal chemical safety activities. Proper oversight could have prevented many of these tragedies, such as an accident last month at a fertilizer factor in Helena, Ark., which claimed the lives of several firefighters. This accident parallels a similar accident three years ago at another fertilizer factory near Sioux City, Iowa, which claimed the lives of three individuals. 
We strongly support an appropriation of $6 million to fund and finally make operational the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board for the health and safety of our workers, communities, and environment. Thank you for your favorable consideration. 
Sincerely,

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased that Senator Kennedy is an original cosponsor of this amendment along with Senators Moynihan, D'Amato, and Torricelli. 
This amendment would withhold 5 percent of funds made available in this bill to any country that the President determines violates United Nations sanctions against Libya. The amendment exempts development assistance and humanitarian assistance. 
As my colleagues know, the United Nations imposed sanctions against Libya in 1992 in response to the Libyan Government's failure to extradite to the United States or Scotland two Libyan intelligence agents indicted for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. One hundred and eighty-nine Americans were killed in that terrorist bombing. The families of those innocent victims are still waiting for justice. 
Among other things, the U.N. sanctions prohibit international flights into and out of Libya. They also prohibit supply to Libya of aircraft and aircraft components. 
Nonetheless, some countries in the international community continue to help Libya's Khadaffi violate the sanctions. 
For example, five countries have allowed Libyan airlines to land on their soil in violation of the sanctions. These countries include Niger, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Ghana. 
The amendment we are offering today would force countries that help Libya violate U.N. sanctions to choose between 5 percent of their foreign assistance and their support of a terrorist state. 
The amendment is forward looking. It does not penalize any country for past actions. Let me repeat that. It does not penalize any country for past actions. Nor does it single out any country. 
Rather, it lays down a marker and sends a signal that in the future violating the international sanctions against Libya will have a financial cost. 
I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation reauthorizing the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route. The New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail is the crown jewel of the Jersey Shore and my bill will provide the necessary funding to complete the trail and preserve it for future generations of New Jersey residents and visitors. 
The Coastal Heritage Trail Route was first authorized in 1988 through Public Law 100-515, legislation authored by former Senator Bill Bradley. I was proud to cosponsor. The legislation allowed the Secretary of the Interior to design a vehicular route that would enable the public to appreciate, enjoy, and work to protect, the nationally significant natural and cultural sites along the New Jersey coastline and the Delaware Bay. When completed, the trail system will include five self-discovery theme trails which travel along the coast of New Jersey. The 275 miles of the trail which will travel through eight counties, will begin north in Perth Amboy, continue down the Atlantic Coast to Cape May in the south, and head northwest along the Delaware Bay shoreline to Deepwater. The trail will be accessible from the Garden State Parkway and Route 49, and well-marked routes will lead from the corridors to regional welcome centers which will include interpretative information. 
The National Park Service, through a partnership with the State of New Jersey, the Pinelands Commission, and local communities, recorded nearly 400 sites and developed alternative concepts for trail protection and interpretation. These activities were documented in the `Resource Inventory and Study of Alternatives', released in November 1990. In April 1991, after public review and comment of this document, the Park Service established an overall trail concept. 
The Maritime History Trail, which opened in 1993, celebrates and explores the coastal trade, defense of the Nation, and the fishing and ship building industries. Visitors to this trail can stop, for example, at the Belford Seafood Co-op, a cooperative commercial fishing operation located on the shores of Sandy Hook Bay. The community of Belford is over 200 years old and is reported to be the oldest fishing port on the east coast, with many third- and fourth-generation fishers. 
The Coastal Habitats Trail, which opens this year, explores barrier islands, wetlands, estuaries, and other habitats from sandy beaches to maritime forests that provide homes to many plants and animals. Also opening this year is the Wildlife Migrations Trail, which explores places along the Atlantic Flyway, a critical nesting and feeding area for many species of birds. It also celebrates the habitat of the horseshoe crab along the Delaware Bay. 
The Historic Settlements Trail explores historic communities whose economies were based on local natural resources such as the bog iron community at Allaire State Park, the cranberry and timber industry located at Double Trouble State Park, and the glassmaking communities in Cumberland and Salem Counties. 
The Relaxation and Inspiration Trail will explore how people used their leisure time, and includes the religious retreats of Ocean Grove and Cape May's historic district and boardwalks, and visits the artists who were inspired by the Jersey shore. 
Mr. President, the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route exemplifies how successful the National Park Service has been in forging partnerships with State and local governments, and private individuals and organizations. Since its beginning in 1988, the Park Service has received less than $1 million in Federal assistance. The authorizing legislation appropriately called upon the Park Service to match 50 percent with non-federal funds. The Park Service has gone well beyond that target, raising over $818,000 in non-federal funds. Yet in fiscal year 1998, the authorization ceiling of $1.25 million will have been reached. My bill would increase the authorization level for the trail to $4 million, and extend the authorization to the year 2004, which would give the Park Service the additional time it needs to complete the trail. This is a small investment, I believe, to preserve the richness of New Jersey's and the Nation's history. 
The Coastal Heritage Trail Route has brought national recognition and stature to many of New Jersey's special places, and helps to contribute to New Jersey's second largest industry, tourism. I invite my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation which will ensure that many more of these gems of New Jersey and the Nation are understood, celebrated, and protected.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to ask the senior Senator from South Carolina, and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, and the senior Senator from Michigan, and ranking minority member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, to clarify the committee's position on land conveyance provisions in the Defense authorization Bill. 
It is my understanding that the chairman and ranking member oppose special legislation for the conveyance, at other than fair market value, of any properties, facilities, or installations which have been closed or realigned under the jurisdiction of the Base Closure and Realignment Commission [BRAC] if such legislation would interfere with the statutory disposal process for BRAC properties. Thus, the committee has not included any such conveyances in the fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill. 
Further, it is my understanding that the Senate conferees to the fiscal year 1998 Department of Defense authorization bill will oppose any conveyances of properties, facilities, or installations closed or realigned in the BRAC process if those conveyances would interfere with the BRAC disposal process contained in current law.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. As the chairman and ranking member are aware, I have requested that the committee include provisions to facilitate conveyances to two New Jersey communities in the fiscal year 1998 Department of Defense authorization bill. However, I have been told that since my requests concern properties closed under the BRAC which are already in the midst of the statutory closure process, the committee could not support these requests. 
Accordingly, if any provisions for conveyances of properties, facilities, or installations closed or realigned by BRAC that would intervene in the statutory BRAC disposal process are included in the conference agreement to the Defense authorization bill, I request that provisions also be included to convey the Naval Reserve Center in Perth Amboy, NJ, to the city of Perth Amboy, for economic development purposes, and the Nike Battery 80 family housing site, East Hanover Township, NJ, to the township council of East Hanover, for low and moderate income housing.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, 50 years ago this week, a young 22-year-old rookie named Larry Doby took the baseball field for the first time as a Cleveland Indian. Although Larry did not make a hit during that first at bat, he did something more: he made history. On that day, July 5, 1947, Larry Doby became the first African-American to play in the American League. I have had the great privilege of knowing Larry since our days growing up together in the streets of Paterson, NJ. I have developed a deep admiration for him. I ask that the text of an article that appeared recently in the Washington Post that captures Larry's character be printed in the Record.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate adopted an amendment to require the Pentagon to study the effectiveness of the military's programs aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles among members of the Armed Forces. By March 30 of next year, the Secretary of Defense must submit a report which outlines programs aimed at preventing tobacco and alcohol dependence, in terms of education, rehabilitation, and intervention. I commend the Senator from New Mexico for his leadership on this issue. As a cosponsor to this amendment, I am glad that my colleagues view the health of our military personnel an important factor when considering our Nation's security. 
Over the past year, the Pentagon has taken important steps to reduce tobacco use among its personnel. Despite strong opposition from the tobacco industry and its friends in the Congress, policies to remove subsidies from tobacco products sold through military commissaries have been implemented. Further regulations on tobacco advertising and product placement are due to take effect in the future. These are positive steps that have been long overdue. 
The need to attack tobacco addiction in the military was crystallized in a report by the Inspector General of the Department of Defense last December. The DOD IG's analysis concluded that between health care and lost productivity attributed to tobacco use, tobacco addiction costs the Defense Department, and American taxpayers, about $930 million a year. Roughly $453 million of this is in hospitalization costs alone. In this Senator's view, that's $930 million too much. 
The need to address this issue head-on couldn't be clearer. Tobacco use among military personnel has continued at higher levels than that of the civilian population. Nearly 36 percent of civilian males aged 18 to 25 smoke cigarettes. However, for the same age group in the Army, 41 percent smoke tobacco products as do 39 percent in the Navy and 44.7 percent in the Marine Corps. In light of the fact that the health of our troops, and all members of our military, should be of the utmost importance, this disparity is shameful. 
I commend those in the Pentagon who have begun to seriously address the problem of tobacco sales and addiction in the military. They are doing a great service for military personnel by removing subsidies from cigarettes sold in commissaries in an effort to protect their health. They are taking the bold step of evaluating ways to discourage use, an effort which is clearly at odds with the low prices of tobacco products sold on military bases compared to prices in retail outfits in the rest of the country. While I agree that for their service, members of the military should get certain benefits, a line should be drawn at an addictive and destructive product such as tobacco. 
Mr. President, I hope that when this Congress receives the report from the Secretary of Defense, as directed by this amendment, it will include bold proposals aimed at curbing addiction. Our fighting forces need to be the best prepared and the healthiest in the world.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to prevent the cruel and unsporting practice of `canned' hunting, or caged kills. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Graham, Kennedy, Boxer, Moynihan, Torricelli, and Murray. 
In a canned hunt, a customer pays to shoot a captive exotic animal on a small game ranch where the animal typically is trapped inside a fenced-in enclosure. The enclosed space prevents the animal from escaping and making it an easy prey. The so-called hunter returns home with the animal's head to mount on his or her wall and the ranch owner collects a large fee. No hunting, tracking or shooting skills are required. The animals are easy targets because they typically are friendly to humans, having spent years in captivity, and having been cared for and fed by the canned hunt ranch owners. 
There are reported to be more than 1,000 canned hunting operations in the United States. At these ranches, a customer can, for example, `hunt' a Dama gazelle for $3,500, a Cape Buffalo for $6,000 or a Red Deer for $6,000. The rarer the animal, the higher the price. 
My bill is similar to legislation I introduced in the 104th Congress, S. 1493. It is directed only at true canned hunts. It does not affect cattle ranching, the hunting or breeding of any animals that live in the wild in the United States, rodeos, livestock shows, petting zoos, or horse or dog racing. It merely bans the procuring and transport of non-native, exotic mammals for the purpose of shooting them for entertainment, or to collect a trophy. The bill would not affect larger ranches, where animals have some opportunity to escape hunters. Nor does the bill affect the hunting of any animals that live in the wild in the United States. 
Many hunters believe that canned hunts are unethical and make a mockery of their sport. For example, the Boone and Crockett Club, a hunting organization founded by Teddy Roosevelt, has called canned hunts `unfair' and `unsportsmanlike.' Bill Burton, the former outdoors writer for the Baltimore Sun and a hunter, testifying last year in support of this legislation, stated, `There is a common belief that the hunting of creatures which have no reasonable avenue to escape is not up to traditional standards. Shooting game in confinement is not within these standards.' 
Canned hunts also are strongly opposed by animal protection groups. As the Humane Society of the United States has said about animals in canned hunts, `the instinct to flee, their greatest natural defense, has been replaced by trust--trust that is rewarded with a cruel and brutal death.' Indeed, many animals killed in canned hunts suffer immeasurably as they receive shot after shot to non-vital organs. This practice is intended to preserve the head and chest regions intact so that the animals will make more attractive trophies. 
The practice of keeping captive animals for canned hunts may also pose a danger to native wildlife or livestock if the captive animals escape. John Talbott, acting director of the Wyoming Department of Fish and Game, stated that `Tuberculosis and other disease documented among game ranch animals in surrounding States' pose `an extremely serious threat to Wyoming's native big game.' This is one reason why Wyoming has banned canned hunts. Other States that have banned these hunts include California, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. 
Unfortunately, in most States, canned hunts are largely unregulated. The lack of State laws, and the fact that many of these animals move in interstate commerce, make Federal legislation necessary. 
I urge my colleagues who want to understand the cruelty involved in a canned hunt to visit my office and view a videotape of an actual canned hunt. You will witness a defenseless Corsican ram, cornered near a fence, being shot over and again with arrows, and clearly experiencing an agonizing death, then only to be dealt a final blow by a firearm. Then I urge you to join me in support of this legislation which will put an end to this needless suffering.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Jesse Brown, who will retire as Secretary of Veterans Affairs on July 1, 1997. 
Since his appointment to this post on January 22, 1993, Secretary Brown has been the champion of our Nation's 26 million veterans. But his commitment to those who fought for this country began long before he accepted the awesome responsibility of heading the Federal Government's largest Department. 
Secretary Brown's service in the Marine Corps formed the foundation for his strong commitment to veterans. He later worked for the Disabled American Veterans, where he was an advocate for the highest quality healthcare and benefits for veterans and their families. Secretary Brown translated his personal experiences into action as he accepted the charge of providing for those who have protected our country. 
As a fellow veteran, I appreciate all of Secretary Brown's work on behalf of our Nation's veterans and their families. In the 4 1/2 years since he accepted this challenging post, he has worked diligently to move the VA into the 21st century. His personal commitment to veterans has produced numerous accomplishments. 
Secretary Brown has overseen the Department's first national summit on homeless veterans. He has worked to expand the Department's services to women veterans. And under his leadership, the VA has opened community based outpatient clinics, giving more veterans wider access to VA healthcare services. In all that he has done, his commitment to broadening veterans' access to the system has never faltered. 
Throughout his service, Secretary Brown has gone out of his way to ensure that those who honorably served their country receive the attention, benefits, and services they deserve. Last year, Secretary Brown visited New Jersey, where he personally met with veterans to address their concerns about benefits and the VA healthcare system. After this meeting, numerous veterans from New Jersey contacted me to convey their appreciation for Secretary Brown's work on their behalf. 
Mr. President, Secretary Brown's service to this country will be sorely missed. As a fellow veteran, I join all of the veterans in New Jersey and across the country in thanking him for his work and wishing him well in his future endeavors.

The amendment would radically change current budget rules by allowing temporary, unspecified cuts in discretionary programs to pay for permanent tax cuts. That would violate the bipartisan budget agreement and could explode the deficit in the future. 
This amendment also brings back the discredited Gramm-Rudman system of automatic across-the-board cuts, the system that led to a proliferation of gimmicks and rosy scenarios, and we didn't significantly reduce the deficit until we got rid of it.

There are already budget rules that limit the use of savings that come from tax loopholes. This amendment would go much farther and make it tougher to invest in children's health programs.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment is a fast-track ticket to deep cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. It would essentially create a cap for these and other essential mandatory programs like the Medicare and Medicaid. 
Mr. President, we ought not punish the people who are on Medicaid or Medicare just because these programs grow faster than a particular rate. Sometimes growth in these programs could be good. 
For example, the first reconciliation bill includes money to recruit 3 million uninsured Medicaid-eligible children to sign up for the program. If this happens, obviously Medicaid spending is going to increase. But the question is, What do we want to do? Do we want to take care of those kids or don't we? This would not be a good reason to cut the program. This is a dangerous gimmick. We can balance the budget without it. Furthermore, we ought not accept an amendment that could force quick, drastic cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment to protect Medicare and Medicaid.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am strongly opposed to this amendment. It creates a 60-vote point of order against any budget resolution that shows a unified deficit after the year 2002. We are all committed to protecting against the rising deficit. This amendment, however, means that next year even a modest change in CBO's long-term economic forecast could trigger the need for deep and hurtful cuts. It would be outrageous to cut Medicare or Social Security just because CBO changes its guess about what the economy will look like in 5 years. CBO cannot even predict what the deficit is going to look like in the next 5 months, never mind 5 years. Their recent record is absolutely abysmal. This amendment also requires that Social Security surpluses be used in calculating the deficit and could make it impossible to use those surpluses in the future to pay for Social Security benefits of retiring baby boomers.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to join with my friend and colleague, Senator Bob Torricelli, in introducing a bill to name a U.S. post office in my hometown of Paterson, NJ after a true American hero, Larry Eugene Doby. 
Mr. President, 1997 marks the 50th anniversary of the breaking of major league baseball's color barrier. In April 1947, Jackie Robinson played his first game with the National League's Brooklyn Dodgers and ended segregation in our national pastime; simultaneously, he entered America's pantheon of heroes. 
While we rightfully honor Mr. Robinson, we cannot forget that heroes rarely fight their battles alone. Larry Doby is one of those heroes. Only 11 weeks after Jackie Robinson first graced a major league diamond, Larry Doby of Paterson, NJ took the field with the Cleveland Indians, becoming the first African-American player in the American League. Once on the team, he brought an ability and level of consistency to the game that few could match. He was the first African-American player to hit a home run in the world series, and he was named to six straight American League all-star teams. During his 13 year career, he attained a .283 lifetime batting average and hit 253 home runs. 
Mr. President, the day Larry Doby first took the field was definitely a great day for baseball enthusiasts. Millions of fans were able to enjoy the excitement he brought to the plate and the skill he brought to the field. 
But it was also a great day for every American. Along with Robinson's earlier integration of the National League, Doby's joining the American League was a double play against racism and inequality. And in the early years it wasn't easy. Doby had to meet the challenges of the game, while also facing sometimes angry opponents. But whether he was faced with a curve ball hurled by an opposing pitcher, or a foul remark hurled by a bigoted fan, he handled it with dignity, grace, and skill. 
Because of the manner in which he handled such adversity, he not only tore down the walls of exclusion, he also opened the windows of opportunity for many other African-American players, who followed him into the major leagues. Thanks to his example, we all learned that, in the words of Martin Luther King, `We must judge a person on the content of his character, and not the color of his skin.' 
Mr. President, Larry Doby is rightfully called a legend for his consistency on the field and a hero for his character off the field. But I have the privilege of also calling him a friend. We grew up together on the working class streets of Paterson. As a baseball fan, an American and a friend, I admire the contributions that Larry made to both the game of baseball and to the struggle for equality. 
When it comes to Larry, others may have filled his uniform, but no one will ever be able to fill his shoes. Above all, Larry Doby proves that good and great can exist in the same individual. 
Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to join with Senator Torricelli and me in celebrating Larry Doby by gracing the post office located at 194 Ward Street in Paterson, NJ with his name.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the Daschle amendment, which would provide significant tax cuts for ordinary, middle-class families, without leading to exploding deficits in the future. 
Mr. President, throughout this Nation, millions of middle-class families are struggling simply to live the American dream. They love their children, but they don't see them very much. They work long hours. They're trying to save for their retirement, and their kids' education. But they're having a hard time just paying their bills, and making ends meet. 
Mr. President, these are the people who most need tax relief. 
And yet, Mr. President, those are not the people who get the bulk of the relief in the underlying bill, as reported by the Finance Committee. The committee's bill provides more benefits to those in the top 1 percent of the population than to the entire lower 60 percent, combined. That's not right. And this amendment would correct the problem. 
Mr. President, this amendment provides many of the same types of tax cuts that are included in the Republican plan. And the total amount of tax relief is roughly the same. But the provisions are structured differently, to give most of the benefits to ordinary Americans. 
The Democratic alternative provides a $500 tax credit for children. But, unlike the Republican version, it makes the credit available for working families with little or no tax liability. 
The Democratic alternative provides significant tax relief to help Americans handle the costs of higher education. And it provides substantially more benefits for those attending lower-cost community colleges than the Republican legislation. 
The Democratic alternative would cut the capital gains tax rate. But, unlike the Republican version, it gives most of its benefits to the middle class, not the very wealthy. 
The Democratic alternative also reduces estate taxes. But instead of lavishing huge breaks on the heirs to multimillion dollar estates, it focuses benefits on small businesses. 
Mr. President, another advantage of the Democratic alternative is that it costs do not explode in the out years. The underlying bill has several provisions the costs of which increase substantially in the future, such as the so-called backloaded IRA and capital gains breaks. This problem is addressed in the Democratic alternative, which is much more fiscally responsible. 
So, Mr. President, in many ways the Daschle amendment is a far superior alternative to the underlying bill, and I would urge my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. President, while I have the floor, I wanted to take just a few minutes to discuss the first reconciliation bill that the Senate approved yesterday. 
Mr. President, as one of the principal negotiators of the bipartisan budget agreement, it pained me to have to vote against the first reconciliation bill. Unfortunately, that bill went far beyond the bipartisan budget agreement, to a point that I felt I could not support it in good conscience. 
I am especially concerned, Mr. President, that the first reconciliation bill includes substantial changes in Medicare--changes that have not been adequately considered, and that could be very harmful to the program, and to the millions of Americans whose health will depend upon it in the future. 
For example, the bill would eliminate Medicare coverage for individuals aged 65 and 66. Yet it provides no alternative for these people. This could leave millions of older Americans without access to affordable health insurance. And that's not right. 
The bill also would encourage higher income beneficiaries to leave the program, by completely eliminating all subsidies of their premiums. That could undermine Medicare's universal support, and lead to a two-tier system in which sicker, less wealthy seniors would be forced to pay more for less. And that's not right. 
Finally, the bill would create a substantial economic burden for many frail and sick elderly Americans, by establishing a new copayment for home health benefits. This copayment could cost up to $760 per year--a substantial percentage of many seniors' income. And that copayment would come on top of an already substantial increase in premiums called for under the bill. 
Mr. President, that's just not right. 
Mr. President, none of these provisions was included in the bipartisan budget agreement. And none have really been seriously debated in the 105th Congress. The public has had little opportunity for input on this, and most Americans probably don't even know what's being considered in the Senate. 
Mr. President, let me make one thing clear. There is no question that we will have to make changes to the Medicare program as the baby boomers reach retirement age. However, changes like these are too important to rush through Congress as part of a reconciliation bill that must be considered under very expedited procedures. These are serious issues that deserve serious attention and public input. 
Mr. President, I am hopeful that the final version of the first reconciliation bill will not include most of these problematic provisions. The President, and many in the House of Representatives, share many of my concerns about the Medicare changes. And so I continue to hope that these provisions will be eliminated in the final version of the legislation, and that I will be able to support it.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Torricelli and myself, I rise to introduce the Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure and Health (BEACH) Act. 
Mr. President, coastal tourism generates billions of dollars every year for local communities nationwide. Moreover, our coastal areas provide immeasurable recreational benefits for millions of Americans who want to build sand castles, cool off in the water, take a walk with that special someone, or just relax. New Jersey's tourism sector is the second largest revenue-producing industry in the state. Without a doubt, the lure of my state's beaches generates most of this revenue--over $7 billion annually. 
Mr. President, this heavily used natural resource can actually pose a threat to human health if it is not properly managed. Studies conducted during the past two decades show a definite and alarming relationship between the amount of indicator bacteria in coastal waters and the incidence of illnesses associated with swimming. 
Water-borne viruses are the major cause of swimming-associated diseases--gastroenteritis and hepatitis are the most common ones worldwide. And because an individual afflicted with these diseases are contagious, the risk of sewage-borne illness does not end with the bather. 
Nationwide, state and local governments reported almost 4,000 beach closings or warnings because of bacteria contamination. 
New Jersey has been particularly aggressive in protecting public health at the beach. New Jersey is one of only a few states to have a mandatory beach protection program that includes a bacteria standard, a monitoring program, and mandatory beach closure requirements. The program is designed to address water quality from both a health and an environmental perspective. Beaches are closed when bacteria levels exceed the standard regardless of the pollution source. 
Ironically, New Jersey is penalized because it does more to protect public health than most other states. In past years the annual losses from beach closures in New Jersey have ranged from $800 million to $1 billion while beaches remain open in competing states that do not publicize the questionable quality of their water. 
I have introduced over this legislation several times over the past several years. The bill, the Beaches, Environmental Assessment, Closure and Health Act, is known by the acronym `BEACH' bill. The bill will address the uneven efforts to protect beach goers by establishing uniform testing and monitoring procedures for pathogens and floatables in marine recreation waters. 
This bill requires the EPA to establish procedures to monitor coastal waters to detect short-term increases in pathogenicity and to set minimum standards to protect the public from pathogen contaminated beach waters. And it will assure that the public is notified when beach waters exceed the standards and public health may be at risk. 
Going to the beach should be a healthy and rejuvenating experience. A day at the beach shouldn't be followed by a day at the doctor. Whether they go to the beach in the Carolinas or in California, in New Jersey or New York--Americans across the country have a right to know when the water is and is not safe for swimming. Beach goers should be able to wade or swim in the surf without the fear of getting sick. 
I am very pleased that EPA has recognized the seriousness of this problem and the need for a federal solution. As a result of BEACH bills that I have introduced, the EPA announced its own Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure and Health program. Under this program, EPA has begun to survey state and local health and environmental directors on the quality of coastal recreational waters for posting on the Internet next year. By next summer, the website will serve as a clearinghouse to provide the public access to health-related information available from states and other sources on the quality of recreational water. The goal is to expand the beach public's `right to know' on the quality of the nation's beaches. The aim is to encourage those beaches that keep their water quality from the public to make that information as readily available as is done in New Jersey. 
However, without mandatory, uniform regulation these EPA programs will be ineffective. While some states use EPA guidelines, others have no programs for regularly monitoring their beach water for swimmer safety. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) found that only 7 states--New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, New Hampshire, Ohio and Indiana --comprehensively monitor their beaches, and a mere 6 states consistently close beaches when bacteria water quality standards are violated. Additionally, NRDC found that while a high bacteria level cause beach closures in one state other sates may allow people to swim despite the identical health risks. This discrepancy threatens public health. That is why we need to pass this legislation as soon as possible. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the importance of protecting public health at our nation's beaches by cosponsoring this legislation.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I join with Senator Domenici in offering the amendment. It implements a provision in the bipartisan budget agreement that relates to the budget process. Without the support that comes from this, I think the work that had been done would be relatively penetrable in so many ways that we would not be able to come up with the final target that we are shooting for, and that is to make certain that we have the deficit down to zero at the end of 2002, and 
then we have preserved the caps that were placed there to achieve that objective. 
The amendment extends several provisions in the Budget Enforcement Act that otherwise will expire and preserves the existing system for enforcing the fiscal policies established by the Congress. 
Madam President, current law establishes an overall cap on the amount of spending that Congress can appropriate each year, but discretionary spending--I am referring to the programs appropriated annually by the Congress, including the entire gamut of Federal Departments and Agencies and most of their day-to-day operations. By contrast, discretionary spending does not include entitlement spending, Social Security, Medicare, which flows without the need for annual congressional action. 
Under current law, total spending on discretionary programs cannot exceed the prescribed limits. However, these limits expire in fiscal year 1998, and the amendment would extend these limits to 2002 in accordance with the budget agreement. The levels established are the same as those adopted in the agreement and in the budget resolution. 
In addition, the amendment extends the so-called pay-as-you-go or pay-go system. Under that system, all tax cuts, all increases in entitlement spending have to be offset by either revenue increases or reductions in other entitlements. The amendment will extend this system through 2002. 
There was little disagreement in the bipartisan budget negotiations that the discretionary spending limits and the pay-as-you-go system ought to be extended. These two budget mechanisms are at the very core of the Budget Enforcement Act. The act has been in place since 1990 when it replaced the old Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, and the system has proven to be successful. 
There are many ways to measure success, but I begin by pointing to the bottom line. Since BEA, the Budget Enforcement Act, was put into place, our deficit has been reduced from $270 billion plus down to about $70 billion, a $200 billion reduction. By contrast, the old Gramm-Rudman system had promised dramatic deficit reduction, but when it came to producing results, frankly, it laid an egg. 
When Gramm-Rudman came into effect in 1986, the deficit was $221.2 billion. By 1990, when Gramm-Rudman was repeated, the deficit had moved from $220 billion to the same level, $221.2 billion. That, Madam President, is not my idea of progress. Beyond helping to implement the real deficit reduction, the Budget Enforcement Act has avoided many of the political and policy distortions that were originally created by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation. The old system created an incentive for both Congress and the White House to use unrealistic economic assumptions and other gimmicks in order to game the system. 
Since BEA was enacted, while there are still plenty of games in Federal budgeting, the process has dramatically improved. For example, Presidential budgets have used much more realistic economic assumptions, and we have largely been free of the threat of massive across-the-board cuts in defense and domestic appropriated programs that used to be so disruptive. 
So, Madam President, I, along with Senator Domenici and Congressman Kasich, Congressman Spratt and the administration, all in the negotiations agreed we should retain the basic framework of the Budget Enforcement Act system. That is what we are proposing in the amendment before us. It is a fairly simple proposition. 
In addition, this amendment includes separate spending limits for defense discretionary programs and nondefense discretionary programs in the next 2 fiscal years. This also reflects the bipartisan budget agreement. 
Along with many other Democrats, I have long been skeptical of firewalls, but I remind my colleagues that these firewalls apply equally to both sides of the discretionary budget and could protect domestic initiatives from those who would shift funding from domestic discretionary to the military. I will also note that the separate defense and nondefense caps expire after 2 years. 
Another provision in this amendment, which also implements the bipartisan budget agreement, would revise the rule governing scoring of asset sales. Under the proposal, asset sales could be counted in budget calculations only if they do not increase the deficit. This should help ensure we don't sell assets only for short-term income if those assets would generate significant revenues in the future. An example might be a Government-owned recreational facility that generates significant user fees. 
Madam President, this amendment also includes provisions that establish reserve funds for Amtrak, highways and transits. These provisions will allow us to implement the comparable reserve funds that were included in the budget resolution, and they have been top priorities for me and, given my longstanding commitment to transportation investment, I worked very hard to make sure that we were going to provide the funds necessary to provide the investment in infrastructure so critically needed in our country. 
Finally, Madam President, this amendment includes a variety of technical changes that are designed to correct errors and eliminate unnecessary reporting requirements and to revise the outdated provisions. So, I hope my colleagues will support us in this amendment. I express my appreciation, once again, to Senator Domenici and the staff, especially Sue Nelson, my Budget Committee staff, for their hard work and cooperation in the development of this legislation. I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to prohibit firearm sales to, and possession by, individuals who are obviously intoxicated. 
Mr. President, a casual observer might think that this legislation is not necessary. Most Americans probably think that it is already illegal to sell a gun to a visibly intoxicated person. At the very least, the average citizen likely believes that it is only common sense that a gun dealer would never sell a gun to a drunk customer. Unfortunately, neither assumption is correct. Some gun dealers do sell guns and ammunition to visibly intoxicated persons. My bill will deter these sales, and punishes those who persist in making such dangerous sales. 
Federal and state laws currently prohibit the sale of alcohol to obviously drunk individuals, to protect both the intoxicated individual and others. Likewise, it is against the law for intoxicated persons to operate a motor vehicle. Unbelievably, it is not against Federal law to sell a firearm to a visibly intoxicated individual, or for an intoxicated person to possess a firearm. 
Worse still, Mr. President, some firearms dealers simply ignore common sense and sell guns and ammunition to any customers if they are clearly intoxicated. The absence of a legal prohibition on such sales allows these gun dealers to escape liability for the absolutely tragic, and foreseeable, consequences of such outrageous conduct. 
For instance, Deborah Kitchen, a mother of five children, is now a quadriplegic after being shot by her ex-boyfriend with a rifle he had purchased from a Florida K mart. This man was so drunk when he purchased the rifle that the store clerk had to fill out the Federal firearm purchase form on his behalf. By his own admission, the ex-boyfriend had consumed a fifth of whisky and a case of beer the day he shot Ms. Kitchen. Nevertheless, the store sold him a .22 caliber bolt action rifle and a box of bullets. He then used these to paralyze Ms. Kitchen from the neck down. 
Ms. Kitchen sued the K mart for it's outrageous conduct. A jury found the store liable of common law negligence, and returned a verdict in the amount of $12 million. A Florida appeals court overturned the jury's verdict, citing the lack of statutory prohibition on the sale of firearms to intoxicated persons. 
Or, Mr. President, consider the case of Anthony Buczkowski, who suffered severe injury after being shot by a drunken ammunition purchaser. William McKay stumbled into a Michigan K mart store after a day-long drinking spree. Although obviously drunk and an admitted `mess', he was still sold a box of shotgun shells. He later used this ammunition to shoot Mr. Buczkowski. Although the trial court entered a judgment against K mart for the damages suffered by Mr. Buczkowski, the Michigan Supreme Court reversed, citing a lack of legal prohibition for such sales. 
Unfortunately, common sense and a sense of civic obligation have not been sufficient enough to deter these sales. Perhaps the threat of criminal and civil liability will do the job. Mr. President, it is my fervent hope that this legislation, if enacted, will end any future sales of guns and ammunition to intoxicated persons. 
Mr. President, I do not claim that most licensed gun dealers do or would sell guns or ammunition to intoxicated individuals. But the fact is that these sales do occur--and when they happen, the consequences can be devastating. 
Mr. President, our country now understands that alcohol and automobiles are a deadly mix. Common sense, and heartbreaking experience, tells us that alcohol and guns also do not mix. It is time that our laws reflect this common sense notion.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. I thank the chairman of the committee for accepting this. 
The purpose of the amendment is very simple. It is to provide fairness for people who come to this country legally, who paid their taxes in good faith and played by the rules, and then perhaps suffer from a serious disability caused by an accident or a serious illness. 
Whatever the cause, they are here at our invitation, left unable to work and unable to support themselves. And so, Mr. President, the budget agreement includes a very specific provision to ensure that these people get help. Unfortunately, the bill before us provides funding for only 1 year of these benefits. I hope we will be able to hold this amendment. It is very important. I think it establishes our attitude about those who have come here at our invitation, and we say, pay your taxes, do your work, and then we want to take them out of the protection stream. 
So I hope that this amendment, which will restore them personally, will take care of it.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment to restore Medicaid coverage for children who were removed from the SSI rolls in last year's welfare bill. 
Mr. President, last year's welfare bill significantly restricted the types of disabilities that enable a child to qualify for the Supplemental Security Income Program. In some cases, the same disability that will qualify an adult for SSI now will be insufficient to quality a child. Among the children most likely to lose benefits are those who suffer from multiple problems, no one of which is severe enough to meet the more restrictive legal criteria, but the combined effect of which is substantial. 
The Social Security Administration estimates that 135,000 low-income disabled children will be removed from the SSI as a result of the new law. Others put the number much higher. 
In any case, since SSI eligibility is linked to Medicaid eligibility, many of these children will be terminated from the Medicaid Program, unless they qualify on other grounds. The administration believes that, in the end, about 30,000 disabled children from low income families will lose Medicaid coverage. 
Mr. President, the loss of Medicaid coverage is likely to create serious problems for these families. Private insurance will be very difficult to find And even it it's available, the costs will reflect the conditions that these children have. 
Compounding matters, these families also will be suffering large income losses because of the loss of their children's SSI benefits. 
Mr. President, these families had low incomes even before these benefits were withdrawn. And now they are facing severe financial hardships. Allowing these to keep Medicaid coverage is the right thing to do. Otherwise, we are likely to see even more children become uninsured. 
Mr. President, one of the core principles of the bipartisan budget agreement was to provide health care coverage for as many as 5 million uninsured children. And it was my understanding that the budget negotiators agreed to restore Medicaid for these roughly 30,000 SSI kids. Not as part of the $16 billion child health initiative, but as a separate, binding commitment. That is clearly the understanding of the administration, as well. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, Senator Domenici has a different recollection of what was agreed to, and I know he holds that view in good faith. So we have an honest disagreement. 
But regardless of whose recollection is more accurate, Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to protect these vulnerable children and their families. 
Mr. President, I know that Senators on both sides of the aisle share a commitment to covering all of America's children. And so I hope that this amendment will win broad support. 
Keep in mind that that these children don't just come from low-income families. They are disabled, even though they don't meet the new eligibility standards for SSI. And many of them will be become completely uninsured if we do not correct this problem. 
I also want to make sure that Senators understand that this amendment would not restore any SSI benefits. All it would do is restore Medicaid coverage for these children. But that would greatly ease the hardships facing many of these families, and reduce the number of children who otherwise would join the ranks of the uninsured. 
So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will stand with these 30,000 disabled children and their families, and will support this amendment.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an individual who truly personifies courage and compassion. When the dark night of Nazi occupation descended across most of Europe, and the spark of humanity was crushed beneath Gestapo jack boots, Dr. Jan Karski knew that he couldn't just curse the darkness. 
Dr. Karski was a wartime courier for the Polish underground, and he is often credited as being the first person to alert the Allies about the existence of the death camps and the extermination of the Jews. 
Karski's secret work began in 1939. He was riding in a cattle car, with other Polish soldiers, heading for forced labor in Germany, when he jumped from the window and joined the underground movement. Between the winter of 1939 and the early summer of 1940, Karski was sent by the underground back and forth from Warsaw to France on successful missions as a courier. However, in 1940 he was arrested by the Nazis in Slovakia and brutally tortured. Eventually, he was rescued by the Polish underground and continued to fight for freedom. 
Karski clandestinely surveyed conditions in the Warsaw Jewish Ghetto and even volunteered to be smuggled into the Belzic death camp to gather evidence of the Nazi's extermination policies. In 1943, he was sent by the Polish government-in-exile to inform American officials about the situation in his native country, among the prominent individuals he met with was President Roosevelt. In fact, shortly after meeting with Karski, Roosevelt ordered the creation of the American Refugee Board, an organization whose main task was to protect Jewish escapees and place them in the United States. 
After the war, when Poland traded Nazi totalitarianism for Soviet totalitarianism, Karski moved to the United States. He earned his Ph.D. in Georgetown and has been teaching at the university since 1952. Among other honors, Karski has received the highest Polish military decoration, a special citation by the United Nations, and was declared a `Righteous Gentile Among Nations' by the state of Israel. 
Mr. President, the great humanitarian Albert Schweitzer once noted, `A great person helps others, but a good person touches the lives of others.' If that's true, then Dr. Karski proves that good and great can exist in the same individual. He continually demonstrated that one person can make a difference, and at a time when many were content to curse the darkness, he kept the candles of hope and humanity burning. Undoubtedly, he is an example for our times and a hero for the ages.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I want to congratulate Karin Elkis, who is being honored on June 30, 1997 as the Sid Levy Memorial Volunteer of the Year by the Jewish Community Center of South Jersey. This annual award is presented to the volunteer who best captures the JCC's commitment to community service and self-giving. Karin is in charge of the Lautenberg Senate office in South Jersey and it is of no surprise to me that she is receiving this honor. Karin gets more done in one hour than most people accomplish in a single day. She is energetic, caring, selfless, and always thinking about others. She brings the same commitment and concern to her volunteer activities that she brings to her work to serve the people of New Jersey. 
Despite a more than full time job, three young children, and other family responsibilities, Karin has found time to make a major contribution to the JCC by chairing its Festival of Arts, Books and Culture this year. Further, she's served as a liaison to the Early Childhood Department, a member of the Budget Committee, chaired the Camp Committee and been a member of the Executive Committee. If I listed all of her activities at the JCC over the past few years, this statement would be longer than a James Michener novel. 
Through her work, Karin has touched the lives of many. She is truly an extraordinary person, with many talents, enormous energy and drive, and a compassionate heart. I am proud to have Karin on my staff and to include her as a friend. She makes an enormous contribution to the South Jersey community, through her work as a Senate employee and her work as a volunteer. 
Mr. President, I again congratulate Karin on this well deserved recognition. I know that she will continue to serve the people of New Jersey in many ways for years to come and that our pride in her accomplishments will continue to be justified.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the Senator will yield, I would like to make a comment. When Senator Byrd makes a statement, talks about a rule, talks about the process, I think it is kind of like the investment banker's advertising slogan that `when they talk, everybody listens.' When Senator Byrd speaks here, everybody listens, and much of the country at the same time, because of the experience and knowledge that he brings to this body and the concern that he has for being forthright with our constituents. 
I would just like to say this to the Senator. There was a degree of diligence--excessive haste, I agree. I will say one thing. I think that we appropriately learned a lesson about the process of stacking votes. I even suggested to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia that perhaps another Byrd rule could be put into place. I don't have the courage to 
offer it in my own name. But another Byrd rule might say that no more than 5 amendments, or 4 or 5 votes, or something like that, could be stacked at any time so that we would not get ourselves into this mad dash not to deceive and not to obscure, but rather to accommodate this very complicated process. 
As the Senator from West Virginia knows, the Senator from New Mexico and I spent roughly 2 months, almost every day, reviewing and negotiating the points in the budget agreement. We tried--I speak for myself, and I am sure the same situation occurred on the Republican side of the aisle--to keep our members on the committee informed because, as the distinguished former chairman of the Appropriations Committee knows, it is very hard to conduct an honest negotiation and debate when there are 20 people in the room. So what we tried to do is consolidate a consensus view and do it that way. So we met with the committee members and then we met with the members of the Democratic Caucus, because there were questions that arose. 
So I have to say this to the distinguished Senator. In my 15 years here, I honestly don't think that there has been a tighter review of matters related to the budget resolution than I have seen, because I have been on the Budget Committee almost all of the time that I have been here. We kept learning each year. I found the chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, good to work with. We had lots of different views, but the one thing that we didn't differ on is that the other person had a right to respect, a right to offer their opinion, and we did it that way. It got tedious at times, especially when one could not listen to one's self. On the other hand, we did gain, seriously, a lot of knowledge during that period. 
I would say this. As I look around the room, we have experts in specific areas. If you want to talk about health, you know you would be talking quickly to the Senator from Massachusetts, and others on different matters of concern. And these matters were reviewed, not perhaps as thoroughly as we would have liked because we were committed to a time constraint overall. But, last night, I was here with the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee until past 10 o'clock--about 10:30--and we were hung up on a single amendment, reviewing it and trying to get into a position that we felt would satisfy our respective constituencies in the Senate, and back home, and across the country, as well. So the effort was put in. 
I think there is a mistake in the process, or a fault in the process, that needs to be corrected. I thank the Senator for raising the issue because, in these last hours, I have heard complaints from other Members of the Senate, as well, about this being too quick, too rushed. But we had a commitment. This is an unusual budget, a budget committed to a goal of zero deficit in 5 years. A lot was packed into it. The negotiations included members of the administration. It has been a very complicated, very tedious process, but no one, in my view shirked their responsibility. 
I hope that, from this point forward, we will remember another Byrd lesson. I remember many of them. Despite my white hair, I feel like I am going to `professor' Byrd's class when I do attend appropriations meetings or other meetings. I would say this, `professor": I don't know what kind of a report card I have gotten, but I hope that it is better than a failing one and that you will say, OK, go forward and learn from this and next time I want to see a better performance. Thank you very much.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will be brief. I sense that everybody would like to hear a long speech, but I am going to disappoint them. I just want to say, Mr. President, that I, too, enjoyed my work with the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee. We managed to resolve all of our problems without too much dispute, without any confrontation. There wasn't a moment that we walked out on anything. This reconciliation bill is consistent with that. We did, as it was appropriately noted, rush through some things. But that does not at all, in my view, suggest that we rushed through and didn't have the appropriate knowledge or review of the items that we were processing. 
I thought it was a job very well done. I must say, if we didn't have some time constraint on this, Heaven knows how long we would all be here. We would see summer come and go and we would still be debating. 
Again, I enjoyed the process and my first time at bat with the Budget Committee in the position that I have. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope that Senator Domenici will, as my ranking member in the not-too-distant future, also enjoy it. I promise to be cooperative. 
I want to thank the staff of the Policy Committee, but particularly my senior staff here--Bruce King, Sander Lurie, Nell Mays, Marty Morris, Amy Abraham, John Cahill, Jodi Grant, Matt Greenwald, Phil Karsting, Sue Nelson, Jon Rosenwasser, Jim 
Klumpner, and Mitch Warren--who did a terrific job, as I know Bill Hoagland and his team did. I won't go through the names, but I will say that I have gotten to know them and respect them and admire the work they have done. I thank everybody for their cooperation, particularly my colleagues on this side.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will yield myself such time as needed to respond with my opposition to the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire and rise in support of the provision in the reconciliation package that was developed by Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan and other members of the Finance Committee. 
Mr. President, the reconciliation bill establishes a new program known as Medicare Choice, which will give Medicare beneficiaries more options for the type of health care that they will receive in the program. Seniors will be able to choose from HMO's, PPO's, and medical savings accounts, among several other options. The committee's proposal is intended to increase Choice for seniors. At the same time, it is meant to avoid the risk that the Medicare Program would move toward a two-tiered or multitiered system in which some seniors, especially the healthier and wealthier, enjoy benefits not available to the others. 
Under the committee-reported bill, providers of different services are paid a set amount. They then can compete for the consumers based on the quality and types of benefits they provide. If, for example, one HMO can operate more efficiently, it can plow the resulting savings into providing services that other less-efficient HMO's could not. This type of system is intended to ensure that seniors get the best quality care for each Federal dollar that gets spent. I think that makes sense. 
The Finance Committee also wanted to avoid a situation in which providers limit their benefit package to attract those who are healthy and who therefore could take advantage of a cheaper plan that offers fewer benefits. This could ultimately lead to a Medicare system that segregates the healthy from the ill and that forces sicker people to pay more to get the health care they need. 
Mr. President, I am going to stick with the Finance Committee's proposal on this. Let's give seniors more choice but let's make sure that the choices offer the type of quality health care they need and deserve. 
When I think of plans that may offer premiums--maybe they offer theater tickets or baseball games or what have you--to seduce or induce people to go their way, I think that is a terrible idea. It can provide a large provider with a monopoly of opportunities. `Spend your money now, you will get it back.' You will have these people locked into your service, so spend it up front. It is a calculated marketing cost. Frankly, I hate to see our senior citizens get caught up in a scheme like that. 
Mr. President, I hope we will be able to muster the support that is required here for the Finance Committee. Once again, this is now a new proposal. It alters the bill as originally developed. I do not think we ought to be doing it at this time. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Time is flying and we will be finished at about 7:30 tonight, I think it is, with no more time left. And then should any amendments be offered, they will be offered without debate or discussion and just voted upon. 
So I say to all of our colleagues within earshot, or through the staff, if you have amendments, you better get them here because pretty soon the time will have expired and you won't have an opportunity to do so.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield myself just a couple of minutes because I listened with interest. One could not avoid listening. 
The fact of the matter is, it is so easy, so easy to stand here at $135,000 a year with all kinds of benefits and everything and say, `I am willing to sacrifice, I am willing to sacrifice. I am willing to do what I have to. I have 35 years.' Go down to the factory and talk to somebody who is hanging on to his job by his fingernails, ask the poor fellow who has been downgraded as companies shrink their size. I love these heroics we get in this place, big speeches on lofty pinnacles. Talk to the people who are doing the work every day, bringing home the lunch pail, and see what we have. 
Sacrifice? I'll tell you how to sacrifice. Cut the benefits here. Cut them now. Stand up and say we will take less for our health insurance and our retirement and everything else. If you want to pull a nice heroic stand--somebody's last stand--stand up here and recommend a cut in benefits instead of talking about, shrieking about, how people have to sacrifice--from this lofty place. 
I will not say anything further. I yield 2 minutes to my friend from Iowa.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield myself 3 minutes. Mr. President, a significant part of the discussion has been why it is that we do not, to use the expression, bite the bullet, get it going, set the program into place so that over the years this will work its way into the system and we will have done better by Medicare. 
Well, Mr. President, I was the senior Democratic negotiator in developing the budget resolution, and we shook hands and we came to the consensus, and this bill before the Senate, part of the reconciliation package, now is supposed to put into place, as I understand it, the things that we agreed to in the extensive meetings that we had, including participants from the White House and the House of Representatives, as well. 
Having gotten that into place, suddenly now we are approached with something that I describe and Senator Kerry from Massachusetts before described as coming in from nowhere, coming 
in from outer space. I say coming in from left field. Suddenly, we had a new proposition to consider whether or not we will say to those who are anticipating that their coverage would fall into place at age 65, well, no, we have a new kind of novel idea. We are going to extend it to age 67 and we want to get it into place now. 
Mr. President, in the development of this bill, this big booklet I am holding, there is a chapter on commissions, and we say that the commission shall meet and within 12 months after their appointment--it is a 15-person commission, bipartisan in character, with 3 appointees by the President--we say in 1 year we will have a report, we will have recommendations. It is not going to be done in a half hour or half day on the floor of the Senate. We are going to take good time and thoroughly review it. We will debate it, as our leader said just now, debate it, have hearings, review it, make sure we are all certain about what we want to do. But, no, suddenly that is too slow. We want, in reality, to take 20 or 30 years to develop it, but it has to be done today to kick it off. I think that is part of the absurdity of this, Mr. President. 
I look at this legislation, and I am wondering what happened between the Finance Committee's final deliberation and this moment here. 
We talk about the purpose of this. The purpose of this is purportedly to present more solvency to the Medicare Program. There is only one problem: The program will perhaps be more solvent, but more individuals will be insolvent. That will be the outcome. There is nothing more worrisome today--and I see it in conversations, social, business and otherwise--than any other time that I ever remember, people saying, `I hope I don't 
lose my health insurance if my company closes down.' 
I understand that even now in separation agreements in marital disputes that a part of the responsibility that is being asked of the income earner is, `I want to be provided,' says the person being left, `with health insurance. I need to protect myself. I can't be there with the children and be exposed to a sickness or an accident.' 
People worry about that all the time. People who have saved all their lives so they would have a little nest egg for retirement are saying, `Wow, you see what it costs to be in the hospital these days, see what it costs to have an operation. It costs so much I would be bankrupt if I had to go through one of those things.' 
We are dealing with a very sensitive issue, a very complicated issue. I hope, Mr. President, that all of our friends on the floor of the Senate will give this a chance for the commission to get to work to review it and not introduce this new--I will call it--extraneous subject, and I am not defining it in terms of the budget process but in terms of the place that it holds. 
I hope we will work, Mr. President, not to permit the waiver of the budget agreement.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee, just gave us an assurance that the text here will be considered original text for the purpose of further amendment. It is acceptable on our side. This amendment, as we have heard, just to repeat for a moment, has three major elements. It includes $1.5 billion to protect low-income individuals with incomes that are up to 120 percent of poverty from having to pay additional premiums in the future. This provision is designed to bring the bill into compliance with the bipartisan budget agreement. The amendment also would change the means-tested deductible into a means-tested premium. This is in response to the broad criticism of the Finance Committee's original bill as unworkable and inequitable. However, I want to make it clear that I intend to support a motion that we are going to hear about shortly to strike the means-tested premium. 
Finally, the amendment includes a modest initiative to explore the concept of a means-tested deductible. This is a very limited test that would not force any seniors to pay a means-tested deductible but would allow a very small number of them to do so, rather than paying a higher premium. 
So we are again willing to accept this amendment.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the proposal to means test Medicare part B premiums. 
Mr. President, I am not opposed in principle to asking wealthier Americans to pay more for certain Government services. At the same time, I think we have to be very, very cautious before making fundamental changes in a program as important as Medicare. And it's not something that should be done on a fast-track reconciliation bill, with little opportunity for public input or debate. 
Mr. President, Medicare is a universal program that can benefit each and every citizen. The universal nature of Medicare provides a broad base of beneficiaries that helps maintain the program's economic viability. By covering all eligible individuals, no matter their health risks, Medicare spreads those risks broadly, as an insurance program must do. 
Yet increasing the costs of Medicare to better-off individuals threatens to drive wealthier and healthier individuals away from the voluntary part B program. And, at some point, that could undermine the broad base of beneficiaries that is necessary. I am not prepared to say that the particular proposal in this bill would do so. I don't know. But it's a serious issue that deserves careful consideration before we move forward. 
Mr. President, beyond the need to ensure Medicare's economic viability, there's also a need to ensure that the program maintains broad support among the public and in the Congress. That's why so many Medicare supporters are concerned about turning the program into anything that resembles a welfare program. 
Now, Mr. President, at some point, these concerns may have to give way to the stark economic realities of upcoming demographic changes. But if we are to move toward some type of means testing, we need to do it very carefully, to ensure that the public understands, and supports the change. The stakes are too high to rush into this without preparing the way, and making sure we're doing it right. 
Mr. President, beyond the broad economic and political concerns involved with introducing means testing into Medicare, there are practical issues to resolve, as well. If premiums are to vary based on income, who is to evaluate a person's income, and how? Will the IRS take on the responsibility? Or will we create a whole new bureaucracy to do the job--some might call it, Son of IRS. 
This proposal seems to adopt the latter approach. But many believe this is duplicative and inefficient. It also raises questions about whether this new bureaucracy will adequately protect the confidentiality of senior citizens' private financial information. 
A related question is how we can monitor the changing incomes of beneficiaries. Take an individual who last year received a sizable salary, but who was laid off at the end of the year, and now has no income. How are we supposed to know that this person now cannot afford a higher premium? I wonder whether this type of issue has really been thought through. 
Mr. President, all of these issues need to be considered carefully before we rush into a proposal of this magnitude. Yet the proposal to means test premiums comes to us now at the last minute. It has not been subject to hearings. Nor has the public been involved in the debate. 
Mr. President, there is a more appropriate avenue for considering this kind of proposal. The bill before us calls for a commission that would study long term changes needed to sustain the Medicare system. So my suggestion would be to wait, and have the commission study the proposal and options for implementation. The commission is required to report back within a year. So this issue will not get deferred indefinitely. But we need to do this right. 
Mr. President, I would remind my colleagues that we do not need to means test Medicare premiums to balance the budget. Nor is it necessary to make Medicare solvent for an 10 additional years. We've accomplished those goals in the bipartisan budget agreement, and without resorting to means testing. 
So, Mr. President, I would suggest to my colleagues that we should act with caution when it comes to a program as important as Medicare. Means testing has potentially huge implications for the economic and political viability for the Medicare Program. And, in my view, it's not something we should be doing on a fast-track bill with little opportunity for serious review and public input.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, late last night, the Senate passed a resolution by a unanimous consent agreement establishing July 2d of this year and the next as National Literacy Day. As the proud author of this measure, I want to acknowledge its passage and thank the 53 Senators who joined me in cosponsoring this legislation. 
Mr. President, the ability to read is something most of us often take for granted. For most of us, it is difficult to imagine not being able to read a menu, street sign, magazine, or phone book. But for many of our citizens, these seemingly simple activities are impossible. This is so because they are illiterate. I am pleased that this resolution will be able to draw attention to the pressing issue of illiteracy. I thank my colleagues who have joined me in cosponsoring this important measure. 
All of us should be more aware of the problem of illiteracy. A recent study found that over 44 million adults cannot read. An additional 35 million read below the level needed to function successfully in society. These numbers alone are alarming and warrant our special attention. But even more disturbing are the personal hardships people must face each day due to their inability to read. The embarrassment parents face when they cannot read to their children. The discouragement able workers feel when they cannot fill out a basic job application. The disappointment we all endure as the ranks of the illiterate grow annually by over 2 million adults. 
Mr. President, the 18th century writer, Joseph Addison, once wrote `Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.' I couldn't agree more. Reading enriches our lives in countless ways. But there are far too many of our citizens who cannot read the instructions on a doctor's prescription bottle, let alone share the experience of reading one of Addison's great poems. This needs to change. 
Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to thank the many citizens across the country who dedicate their lives to beating back the forces of illiteracy. I want to express my gratitude to the teachers, volunteers, parents, and others who donate their time and talent to help those who cannot read. In my own State of New Jersey, I want to give special recognition to Caryl Mackin-Wagner, executive director of Focus on Literacy, Inc., for her leadership on this issue. My thanks to all involved. 
Mr. President, we must focus our attention on the problem of illiteracy. All of us should make sure we do our part to ensure that citizens who need help know where services are available. We need to recognize the detrimental effects illiteracy has on our society. Most important, more of us need to enlist in the battle to close the book on illiteracy. 
Mr. President, for these reasons, I am very pleased that we passed this resolution establishing July 2, 1997, and July 2, 1998, as National Literacy Day.

<TEXT>
Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to commend our friend and colleague from North Dakota for being aware of what is potentially taking place here. 
Mr. President, this is a small example of the kind of document that you might have that has all kinds of bad goodies in here. One of the things that you have to do around here is to make certain that everybody is on the alert to the fact that some things get into these bills without being discussed, without being formally introduced. It has a way of sneaking in there. There is an osmosis process in which they fall down from the sky and get in there. This is one that is really kind of sky-high. 
I express very serious concerns about the provision in this bill, that it will allow, as the Senator from North Dakota said, 
in this case Texas, but any State--to have private companies determine the eligibility for low-income benefits like Medicaid, WIC and food stamps. 
Mr. President, this is a budget reconciliation bill, not a Government management reform bill. In my view, the privatization provision does not belong in fast-track legislation--fast track, that means to get it through here as quickly as you can--that is designed primarily to implement the budget resolution. This provision has no real impact on the deficit except to potentially make it worse in the years ahead, and it would represent a significant policy change with broad-ranging implications. 
I also note that this provision is outside of the bipartisan budget agreement. It was never discussed at any one of the negotiating sessions because I personally sat there at every one of them, and it never appeared in any early drafts of the budget agreement. 
This provision raises some very important policy questions. For example, will these private companies have an incentive, as the Senator from North Dakota pointed out in his chart, to exclude people that they would rather not carry from low-income programs. Will they receive bonuses for doing so? Will they feel inclined to do so in order to win other State government contracts? 
Now, Mr. President, I kind of grew up, if I can say, in the computer business, and we have seen some of the finest companies in the world make mistakes. We have seen it here with the FAA contract, a fairly complicated piece of business, and it was pointed out that it was Unisys and EDS and names that are very well known in the computer field. Mistakes are made and sometimes these things run way over the original cost estimate, as demonstrated in the example we saw, so we cannot afford to put all of our citizens subject to what might go awry here and spend $2 billion to take care of an arrangement, whatever that arrangement is. Ask every citizen here whether they would feel like kicking into this thing, and I am sure that given a proper questionnaire they would say, `Heck, no.' This is not for us and no State ought to be so privileged as to get that kind of an advantage. 
Mr. President, the Department of Health and Human Services reports that there may be 3 million children eligible for Medicaid who are not enrolled in the program. It is a serious problem and I feel could even get worse under a privatization program. If private companies are put in charge of enrolling more children for Medicaid, would they really conduct aggressive outreach programs to enroll children, to encourage people to bring them in even if it meant that the State's Medicaid costs would go up? I would not bet on it. 
I want to be clear. I am not necessarily opposed to privatization of some Government services. However, it must be considered very carefully, especially when the lives of vulnerable Americans are at stake. This proposal really breaks new ground. For the first time, private interests would be handed complete power to make benefit decisions that are of critical importance to people with low incomes. 
It is like turning our military over to private hands and letting them design what conflicts we are going to get involved with. The fact is that much of the allure of privatization is to save money, and there is a place for that. For example, Congress has to decide to have private companies operate some of its cafeterias and do some of its cleaning, and perhaps that translates into more savings and better service for congressional employees. But Congress has wisely limited the roll of private companies in many functions of Government. Private companies are not allowed to operate our military installations, nor do we have private companies administer our Social Security system. We draw the line at some point. 
I am concerned that privatizing decisions about benefits for low-income individuals may go over this line. At least, at the very least, it needs careful and thorough study. Yet, I understand that the Finance Committee has not reviewed the details of the Texas waiver, has never seen the full proposal, and since the Senator from North Dakota is also a member of the Finance Committee and talks about the secret nature of this agreement, that further confirms what the rest of us who are not on the Finance Committee might not know and that is that it has never had appropriate scrutiny, never had appropriate review.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Never, not even in the years that I spent in the private sector, and I ran a pretty good-sized company with 16,000 employees when I left. It did better after I left. It now has 30,000 employees. 
Never have I seen it. Never, when one works with Government, have I seen this kind of an arrangement that has a peculiar odor, and it is not Chanel No. 5. The fact is that to give away Government funds in a program as sensitive as this to take care of the poor--listen, all of us have seen the abuses of private sector companies that have taken over health care and things of that nature. 
It just blows one's mind when you see that the president of a company that is in the health care business made $22 million in a single year and meanwhile is squeezing down because that is where the profits are going to come from, from cutting conditions. They are cutting programs that are supposed to take care of people's health. 
Well, do you want to have someone up there whose bonus, whose stock options, whose salary depends on making sure that they service as few people as possible, reduce expenses as much as possible when, in fact, the WIC Program is designed to take care of people who are really impoverished, people who need the nutrition that comes through the program to sustain them? So do you want to have some executive sitting at some remote place--and I liked that executive life when I was there, but it was never at the Government's expense--at Government expense. We see constant reference to cases being tried, investigations being conducted where programs were turned over to the private sector. I talk about things like jails--we have tried that in New Jersey--which were dismal failures because they could not protect the guards sufficiently in these jails because they did not hire the right kind of people. They did not provide them with the right kind of tools. The facilities were not built enough to make sure the inmates incarcerated were properly cared for. 
So we see this time and time again, and here we walk in and say, `OK, here is a bunch of poor people. You take care of them. Do the best you can at the best price you can.' What an outrage.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will tell the Senator how it strikes me. I say thank God that the Senator from North Dakota has brought this to the attention of the Senate and to the public. 
My friend has done a real service in doing this. The notion that an individual working for a private living, perhaps their salary dependent upon their ability to curtail services, is hardly the way you want to treat a sick patient in the hospital. That is hardly the way you want to treat a family problem. That is hardly the way you want to protect a mother who has been battered. That is hardly the way we want to do things in a society with the conscience this country has. 
I am delighted, again, that the Senator introduced it. I am concerned that privatization like this is not going to do the job. Before we go ahead with approval of a waiver, we ought to at least hold a hearing and review the details. Mr. President, Congress has established these safety net programs for people in our society who are truly in need, impoverished. They are designed to ease suffering, to provide nutritional assistance to help children, help struggling people get into the work force to get themselves off welfare, to do whatever they can to sustain themselves. These programs can literally mean the difference between homelessness and independence, and we ought not to rush to hand them over to a private interest at this time, perhaps never, but we sure ought not to do it in the hasty manner that this is being undertaken. We can always revisit this issue, Mr. President, without constraints of a reconciliation bill. 
I fully support the action being proposed by the Senator from North Dakota and commend him for it, I must tell you.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to commend my colleague from Massachusetts for being on the alert here. I worked very hard with my distinguished chairman from the Budget Committee to try and assemble a consensus agreement that we could all support, and suddenly now we are offered a change and that change says, `Well, senior citizens who have home health care pay $5.' It sounds trivial almost, but Mr. President, when we have someone who needs sometimes two, sometimes three visits a day to keep them going, $100 a week, when the average for many of these people, whose income is $15,000 a year or less--you get up to $3,000, $4,000, or $5,000 a year, that is torment. That takes away their very life sustenance because they cannot afford the rent, they cannot afford the heat, they cannot afford the nutrition. 
On top of that, to impose this new burden, I say, Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is always on the lookout for a balance in our society to try and provide equal service to those who need help--the promise for the future, an education for their children--Senator Kennedy is always there. In this case I must tell you, I heartily agree with him. 
The target group are people, usually women, 75 on balance in years, with incomes of under $15,000. They are old, very often frail, sick people who do not take home health care if they can get out of their homes, if they have any mobility, if they have any opportunity to go visit the doctor. These are often critical, life-sustaining services that they need. 
Some argue, Mr. President, that most people subject to this copayment will not really pay because they have Medigap policies that cover copayments and deductibles. That is misleading because a new copayment would lead to increased Medigap premiums. So seniors would either have to pay the new copayment or their insurance bills would go up. Either way, the bottom line would be higher out-of-pocket costs. Already, seniors typically pay more than 20 percent of their income on these costs. 
As the Senator from Massachusetts said, unfunded mandates, States will have to come up with $700 million, I think is the figure the Senator used. This is not a particularly good way to get this bill back on track, especially when we know immediately hereafter in the next part of the reconciliation we will be looking at tax relief for lots of folks who do not need it, who can get by 
very comfortably without it, and here we are talking about $5 out of the pockets of the poverty stricken, typically those who need help, and whose only contact often with the outside world is with these groups, and they want to charge them $5 to have somebody come by. 
I commend the Senator from Massachusetts and I support him. I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator is correct. The one thing that I found most disturbing about the proposals that have come in the reconciliation is the fact that suddenly we are in to a whole new area having very little to do with the mission that we have set out for us, to get a balanced budget, to try at the same time to invest in education, to try at the same time to make sure impoverished senior citizens do not have to pay more as a result of the transfer of home health services to part B--all of those things. 
Suddenly, now we are seeing that something might be called bait and switch, where senior citizens are being told now, well, you may have to pay a higher premium for your part B, your deductible may be going up, that the most modest-income person would have to pay $5, perhaps to get an insulin shot or something like that. Five bucks, when you ain't got it, to put it crudely, is an awful lot of money. These people do not have it. They do not have contact with the outside world. They are frail, they are elderly. For God's sake, where is our conscience on these things?

And it's true that, in the past, we have not permitted the so-called balanced billing, which simply says the service was advertised or talked about at this level and now it is at a higher level, so you are going to get a bill for it.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I may ask the Senator a question, this isn't, I take it, your idea of a particularly good way to make reforms in something as complicated as Medicare, and I could not agree with you more. This is fast-track legislation, which means--for those who are not familiar with the terminology--that this is supposed to zip through this place. This was not part of the consensus agreement we labored over for months in order to strike a budget agreement that could pass muster and would be a consensus bill. This now is recommended by the Finance Committee in terms of their reconciliation on expenditures. 
I have been a loyal trooper in defending the consensus agreement. But this, in my view, is certainly outside the pale. I am not any happier than the Senator is.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support removing the provision on the increase in Medicare eligibility. I would like to see that removed. This provision, as we all know, calls for increasing the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 67. 
Throughout our negotiations on the bipartisan budget agreement, there was no serious discussion--none--of increasing the eligibility age for Medicare. And, if there was, even the most casual discussion didn't wind up in the bill. So it wasn't believed in the contentious review that it would be appropriate. Nor has this issue been the subject of hearings or serious debate in the 105th Congress. There is nothing in the budget resolution that calls for dealing with the issue, as I said. 
Nevertheless, the bill before us would increase the eligibility age for Medicare and would do so without protecting the seniors aged 65 and 66 to make sure that they will have access to affordable health insurance as they age. Typically corporations now have men aged 65 to offer retirement in many cases, and that is the vulnerable age. If there is an illness that befalls someone or they run into economic differences during that period of time, that is a very harmful experience. I think it would be a serious mistake to do that without making certain that the those aged 65 and 66 are protected. 
Before going further, I want to acknowledge that the Senators who are responsible for this proposal are trying in good faith to confront the long-term problems facing the Medicare Program. They deserve real credit for that. I, too, would like to have a comprehensive review on Medicare. 
I think we have made a good first step back when we finally had the policy behind the development. That was to add years of solvency to the Medicare Program while we engaged in a comprehensive review. So this is not the time, frankly, nor the place on our agenda to do that. So I disagree with their approach. 
My concern is that if we simply exclude 65- and 66-year-olds from Medicare, what do these folks do? At that age private health insurance can be prohibitively expensive, if it is available at all. Without Medicare, these people may have nowhere else to turn. 
Mr. President, I point out that more and more businesses are dropping health insurance coverage for their retirees. The trend has been accelerating in recent years, and it may well continue into the future. 
I know lots of people who face retirement who want to engage in a business or continue to work productively. But in almost no case can they be assured that they are going to get private health insurance to take them over if they wanted to go beyond Medicare protection. So private insurance doesn't look like it is a real course for those in that 65-66 category. 
It is a frightening prospect. I have never heard so many conversations from people about their concerns about health insurance. It is a continuing subject. Notice that in job opportunities very often the health insurance discussion is no longer one that is available. Lots of small companies can't afford to provide it, and they don't. 
So people are worried about the prospect of bankruptcies as a result of a catastrophic illness, about being put out on a limb and not getting the coverage that they need. We know that hospital services in this area are expensive. We also know that there has been a major change in the psychology of our society; that is, people in their sixties no longer expect to be put out to pasture. They can do lots of good things. Take it from an expert here, they can do lots of good things. And they want to know that their health is protected. 
So it is a scenario that could face millions of Americans if we are not careful. 
If the Congress decides, Mr. President, that the Medicare eligibility age should be changed, there are ways to protect senior citizens in the process. Some have suggested allowing uncovered seniors to pay a reasonable premium in return for Medicare coverage. Others have suggested subsidizing private insurance or other options. 
I am not advocating any single program at this point. My focus is that we should not pull the rug out from millions of Americans without ensuring that they have at least a basic safety net. 
I also believe that a fast-track reconciliation bill is the wrong vehicle to be considering a fundamental change like this. For those who are not familiar with our terminology, `fast track' means get it done, try to zip it through the place--not undercover but to try to get it done. The reconciliation bill is one that kind of commands an enforcement mechanism for achieving the objectives that we set out for ourselves--in this case the balanced budget by the year 2002, to try to extend the solvency of Medicare, take care of legal immigrants who are 
here, to provide insurance coverage for children that are not ensured. 
Those are the missions that we encompass in this bill. They were negotiated over a long period of time--several months. They were very difficult negotiations--difficult not because we were at each other's throat but because we tried to deal with reason and thought and arrived at a consensus that would take care of most of the needs that we provide for our citizens, including a massive infusion into our education programs to provide young people with opportunities for the future, and again to protect senior citizens who are perhaps impoverished and can't afford increased premiums. Suddenly this is a new factor introduced from the Finance Committee which is an amendment to the basic bill. 
In addition to the limit on amendments to the reconciliation, it would be very difficult even for Senators to consider fully various options. 
The proponents of rating the eligibility age in this bill argue that we must act now to give Americans adequate notice about a change that is coming in the future. However, I would note that this bill includes a commission to look at the long-term issues involving the Medicare Program. The commission is required to report within 1 year of this bill's enactment. If the commission determines that a delay in the eligibility age is required, Americans will have plenty of notice about that possibility to be able to respond with their community and with their organizations. They will be able to send in considered opinions. I think we must do that. 
So I hope that my colleagues will support the effort to remove this provision from the reconciliation bill. It would be wrong to leave older Americans without health care coverage. We certainly shouldn't do so on something that is going to move as rapidly as this is without an opportunity for having adequate public input and a full debate. 
So, Mr. President, again I salute the effort of those who are offering the change because they think that it is essential for the solvency and for the long-term survival of Medicare. But, on the other hand, if it is that important and that crucial, then we ought to make sure that we allow enough time and allow enough review to make certain that the step we are going to choose is the correct one. 
Mr. President, I see nothing is going on at this moment. I therefore, note the absence of a quorum, and I ask that it be charged to both sides.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. I want to say, Mr. President, this is my first year as ranking member on the Budget Committee to process the budget resolution, and it has been an interesting experience. It is a fairly complicated process. I had a lot of learning to do. I still feel that I am playing catchup in some areas, but it was largely through the good work of Senator Domenici that the process moved fairly expeditiously. We work well together. The relationship, on a personal basis, is excellent. We disagreed without being disagreeable, and we completed this arduous task. It has gone on for several months and I think probably will be a milestone mark in the way a budget is developed because of the target that it has, a balanced budget in the year 2002, 5 years hence. There will be enormous change as we go along. 
Mr. President, I have to point out that this comes at a time when things are pretty good. Since President Clinton has been in office, we have seen dramatic changes in our fiscal condition. For instance, the annual deficit came down from $290 billion, in round terms, in 1992, to an expected $70 billion level for the year 1997. 
So we have had dramatic declines in the deficits. Our unemployment is at a low point in decades. America is very competitive. We are sending out the kind of high-valued products that we like to see being shipped to other countries, in terms of international commerce. We have the lowest deficit to GDP among all countries of the world, running around 1.5 percent, the envy of almost every nation on this globe. Our ratio of taxes to GDP is the lowest of any nation on the globe. We are talking about large societies, advanced societies. 
We just saw completion of the gathering of the heads of government in Denver, eight countries, including ours, in which I guess America boasted a little bit because we have been leading the way. Countries that were so envied for so many years, like Germany and Japan, are trying to figure out how we did it and with a tax base that enables people certainly to succeed, acquire, in some cases, incredible fortunes, fortunes far larger than we ever dreamed possible. 
There used to be a time in America when if someone was a billionaire, that was a stand-out person. It is not all inflation, but today they are counting billionaires and multibillionaires. There is success after success of people going into the corporate world, from whence I came, and work a few years with a company and walk out with $20 million, $50 million, some people being paid $25 million a year on a regular routine. 
It is quite incredible and quite different, by the way, than the guy who works hard every day and tries to support his family and thinks about where he is, whether his kids are going to be able to get an education so they can move up the economic ladder. He worries about his old age, `Will my pension be there when I am ready to retire?' `Will I be able to give a hand to my mother if she falls sick beyond the capacity of the system as it is presently designed to take care of her?' `Will I be able to continue to live on a little plot of land and maintain my home, our home?' Or, `Will my wife and I have to work shifts so that she can be home when I am not, and vice versa, to take care of our kids?" 
That is the picture we see in America today, with all the good results. People at the top are doing very, very well, and people at the bottom are doing slightly better but still very worried. The price of a college education, the opportunity for the kind of jobs that can sustain a family--it is quite different in the levels of income. 
So, Mr. President, when we look at a bill like this which we will be considering very soon, the tax consequences of our deliberation--and we will be running into some difficult discussions here, because I know a lot of my colleagues are worried about tax breaks for those who don't need them and tax opportunities for those who do. 
Today, we are talking about the first of the two reconciliation bills, this one called the spending reconciliation bill. Senator Domenici went through some explanatory statements to let people understand what it is about this arcane system of ours--frankly, it is a mystery to most and to many even inside this place--about the budget resolution, the reconciliation, enforcement, and all of the terminology that becomes routine when you are working with it every day, and talking about germaneness and relevance. Around here, relevance, to steal a phrase, when they talk about beauty in the eyes of the beholder, relevance here is in the eyes of the bellower. That is where often debate comes about--relevance. 
But we have a process by which we determine whether or not something is relevant. So that will be considered as we go along. 
So, Mr. President, I want to just say once again that I commend the chairman of the Budget Committee for his hard work and cooperative attitude over the past many months. We have spent long days in tight quarters working on this--by the way, no longer smoke-filled; that's out, as we see now with the tobacco legislation in front of us. 
Senator Domenici is one of the most competent, serious, hard-working Senators in this body. I enjoyed, as I said earlier, working with him over these past few months. The reconciliation bill before us includes provisions that have been, as the chairman noted, reviewed and developed by eight different authorizing committees. Our colleagues on those committees deserve real credit for moving fairly quickly to put these pieces together. I commend them for their hard work. 
When I look at the final product, there is much in this legislation to be pleased with. It makes some improvements in Medicare solvency and extending the trust fund. It restores some important benefits to legal immigrants. It includes $3 billion to move people from welfare to work. We want that to happen. And it softens the law that denies food stamps to those who try but are unable to find work. 
Despite these positive elements, Mr. President, I have serious concerns about this legislation in its current form. It is blatantly inconsistent in parts with the bipartisan budget agreement. Once again, I have to say that we labored long and hard and honestly, I believe, in trying to establish agreements. They did not always go down easy. Some of these were bitter pills to swallow. But we inched our way at first to get there, and finally it evolved into a consensus that we felt we could live with. 
The bipartisan budget agreement had some problematic provisions that now we are seeing--frankly, I would have to use the word `attacked'--in some ways. I want to touch on a few examples. 
First, I think this bill does challenge or violate the provision in the budget agreement that protects senior citizens with modest incomes from increases in Medicare premiums. The bipartisan negotiators set aside $1.5 billion specifically for this purpose. But the Finance Committee has refused to allocate this money. Now, this must be fixed. I understand they are considering it even as we speak. 
Second, the bill violates the provision in the budget agreement that protects those who have come into our country legally, paid taxes, played by the rules, who suffer at a future time from a disability, accident, sickness, or otherwise. The budget agreement clearly requires that these innocent victims be protected. However, the Finance Committee has refused to include that in their agreement and included only a temporary restoration of benefits. This, too, must be fixed. 
Third, the bill fails to provide Medicaid coverage for the 30,000 children who are losing SSI benefits under last year's welfare bill. This runs counter to the goal of ensuring that America's children have health care coverage. It is another blatant violation of the bipartisan budget agreement. 
Mr. President, it is up to the congressional leadership, not the leadership of the committees, to correct these problems and to bring the reconciliation bill back into compliance with the budget agreement. Senators Lott and Daschle have agreed in writing to do this through bipartisan leadership amendments. I am confident that this commitment is going to be fulfilled. But as I mentioned earlier, Mr. President, I am concerned about other provisions as well in this reconciliation bill that go beyond the bipartisan budget agreement. I want to outline some of these. 
First, the bill changes the age for eligibility in Medicare from 65 to 67. Mr. President, that may be a worthwhile subject, but not here, not in this bill. There is no legislation to protect the seniors who will be aged 65 and 66 as they wait for eligibility going from one place to another. For many companies, for many situations, the retirement period is age 65. It is common. I do not think it is right to be in here. The issue was never discussed during the negotiations on the budget agreement. So while there may be an argument for considering related proposals as part of a broad review of health care and entitlements, this is not something that we ought to be doing now on a fast-track reconciliation bill. Our senior citizens deserve more than that, or one day to be senior citizens. 
Nor, Mr. President, should we be considering a fundamental change in the universal nature of the Medicare Program as part of a fast-track bill? This legislation would introduce means testing to Medicare. Again, I realize that there are Senators here who support this proposal. But the long-term implications for this move are enormous. They deserve much more thorough debate than is possible in this legislation. 
Mr. President, the bill before us also includes several other provisions that go beyond the bipartisan budget agreement that are of concern. 
The bill would increase the financial burdens on some of our most vulnerable senior citizens, poor people, people impoverished by establishing a new copayment for home health visits. 
It would authorize medical savings accounts, a new approach to Medicare that could, in my view, harm its long-term viability, harm the viability of the whole Medicare Program, because it would give people choices outside the system and perhaps would pull out those who are in good health and leave the rest to those who are not quite up to snuff. It would make excessive burdens for them. It cuts the Medicaid payments. The hospitals also would be curtailed, and they serve a disproportionate share of poor and uninsured patients. 
So, Mr. President, these and other problematic provisions should not be in a reconciliation bill--again, I remind you, fast track; this will be done sometime tomorrow--that is designed to implement a bipartisan budget agreement. I hope that many of these things can be eliminated before the Senate has to vote on final passage of the legislation. 
I want, Mr. President, to caution my colleagues that they are to get here with their amendments because the time continues to pass. As Senator Domenici has said, at some point the 20 hours that is allocated for the debate will be consumed by just wasting time. If that is the case, those who have amendments that they care about will be here in the final moments of the time that we have allocated to this debate and they will not be able to bring them up. They may be able to introduce them and get a vote on them, but they are not going to be able to discuss them, they are not going to be able to argue the merits. I think that is something that people ought to pay a lot of attention to if they are serious about the amendments that they are proposing. 
So, I plead with our colleagues, get over here, get your amendments in. The fact that there will be no votes today does not have anything to do with the time schedule. If these issues are going to be voted upon, these amendments, that can be done tomorrow, but the debate will have to be held before we run out of time. 
So I conclude, Mr. President, by saying this to my friend and colleague, the chairman of the Budget Committee, that despite the various controversies that have pitted our two parties against each other, we have managed to maintain a spirit of bipartisanship in our efforts to balance the budget in the proper way. I believe that we will maintain that cooperative approach. But if we are going to do it, many of these problems will have to be addressed before this legislation is sent to President Clinton. I look forward to working with Senator Domenici and with the leadership on both sides of the aisle to make it happen. 
Let us get a bill that we can live with, a consensus bill, much in the manner that we shook hands on; maybe with a grimace or two across the table, but we did it. We arrived at a consensus. I need not go to such elementary teachings to say a consensus really reflects a give-up by all parties to a discussion. A consensus is not I win, you lose; it is we both win a little and we both lose a little. That is what we did to get to where we are. Therefore, I express some disappointment in the changes that have been made in the process of reconciliation and hope that we will be able to change the changes and get on with this bipartisan budget agreement that we concluded here on the floor not too long ago. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first let me say to the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the ranking member that I commend them for a job well done. I am very much aware of the complications that one has in the defense authorization bill. It is a large sum of money, a very complicated piece of legislation. It has research funds and it has operational money. It is quite a job, and I commend the both of them for moving this rapidly and getting this bill to the floor. 
Mr. President, I have an amendment that would strike a section, section 3138 of this bill because this section prevents the Department of Energy from recovering any cleanup costs at sites under DOE's Formerly Utilized Site Remedial Action Project program other than the costs already covered in a written, legally binding agreement with the party involved in the site. 
To put it more simply, this section would strike the Department of Energy's ability to recover costs already covered in a previous agreement with a party involved in the site. 
As a practical matter, Mr. President, it would absolve W.R. Grace Company of millions of dollars of responsibility for toxic pollution costs by their actions. The effect of this provision from the analysis that we have conducted so far is to grant a special exemption from Superfund law to one company. The Superfund law, a law which I am proud to have helped author, embodies the principle that polluters should pay for the damage they do, and in this case W.R. Grace should pay for the cleanup of the mess that it created. 
The deal was an unacceptable slap in the face to American taxpayers and the residents of Wayne, NJ, my home State. As a matter of fact, I lived in this community for some time. The residents of Wayne Township have been living with this problem for such a long period of time, and why this amendment is so outrageous is something that I want to explain. 
A pile of approximately 15,000 cubic yards of potentially radioactive material has already been removed by the Department of Energy, and the Department of Energy says that there are still about 70,000 cubic yards more still buried at the Wayne site, and it is still deciding how to clean up the part that is on the surface and below. The Department of Energy estimates the entire cleanup may cost $120 million. The major contaminant in this soil is a contaminant called thorium, highly radioactive material. It is known to cause cancer and has a half life, Mr. President, that is far longer than perhaps this Earth can endure. It is 14 billion years. In other words, this stuff stays hot for that long a period of time. 
This deadly waste was the result of industrial activity going on since 1948, almost 50 years ago. The contamination may affect the drinking water of 51,000 New Jersey residents resulting in untold harmful health consequences. The W.R. Grace company owned the property and contributed to this huge pile of waste. The Grace company signed an agreement with the Federal Government in which it promised to contribute to the cleanup, and then they went on to pay a tiny fraction of the ultimate cleanup cost for this site when they deeded over the property to the Government. They paid $800,000 as a down payment on $120 million. That does not sound like a very serious downpayment to me. But the agreement also said that the Federal Government maintained the right to come after W.R. Grace under other laws to remedy the threats caused by their pollution despite again the agreement they had signed. But nothing happened for many years. 
In 1995, I urged in a letter to the Department of Energy to expedite the cleanup by negotiating with W.R. Grace, the responsible party, the polluter, to pay its share. Those negotiations began shortly thereafter. Over the last year, I have been assured a number of times by the Energy and Justice Departments that progress was being made. And for over 1 year now W.R. Grace has been engaged in a discussion with the Department of 
Justice, which I believe was in good faith, to determine what share Grace would pay for contributing so much to this mess. 
Now I read the language in this bill and find that it effectively wipes out all of the progress that has been made, wipes out all of the obligation that W.R. Grace would have. This language takes away the Department of Energy's legal rights under the Superfund polluter pays liability system. It abrogates a legal commitment signed by Grace. 
Mr. President, this puts the burden squarely on the American taxpayer instead of the polluters. Further, it will delay the cleanup and could poison the drinking water of the people of Wayne and the State of New Jersey. The Department of Energy, Mr. President, has limited cleanup dollars and numerous sites across the country under a program that is called FUSRAP, the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. These are the sites of industrial activity that may have contributed at one point to our Nation's defense. That does not mean they have a license to pollute thereafter. They have a responsibility. 
Without an infusion of cleanup funds from the parties responsible for the mess in Wayne, there will be years of delay in this cleanup, years when the radioactive waste will continue to blight a community, years for that plume to migrate, to reach the drinking water source for that town. 
Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, and I worked together on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and together we are trying to rewrite the Superfund law which is soon to expire. We worked together in good faith, and I believe we have narrowed the differences on many issues affecting Superfund. I hope that we are going to be able to produce a bill later this year with both our names as cosponsors of that legislation. 
However, as far as the provision in this bill that deals with the Department of Energy cleanup at the site in Wayne, I oppose it strenuously. As the Senator from New Hampshire expressed to me, he had no scheme in mind to mitigate the obligation that W.R. Grace has to do the cleanup. That was an effect apparently unintended by the Senator from New Hampshire, but we have to deal in reality not the intent. W.R. Grace must stand up to their obligation. 
The reality is that the provision in this bill would not only slow down the Wayne cleanup program, but it would also transfer its costs from the responsible party to the taxpayer. We are not going to stand for that, Mr. President. 
So I urge the adoption of my amendment and urge my colleagues to support it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I just want to respond to my colleague. I do not object to the Senator's second degree amendment. If it is passed into law, DOE is going to have to report to Congress next year on the number of sites of this category, the FUSRAP program, on the cost of cleanup, the numbers of sites where private parties are involved, and on the progress DOE has made in pursuing them for a cleanup costs. 
We want to do these sort of things. This reporting requirement is certainly a step in the right direction. DOE at last will be required to step up its efforts to make the private sector pay for the pollution it caused. It's only fair. The private sector profited enormously from participating in DOE's efforts to build the Nation's nuclear arsenal. The company, however, should not escape liability for the mess they created as they did that. 
These former DOE sites, Department of Energy sites, contain some of the Nation's most dangerous and pernicious pollution problems. Their radioactive legacy--it is incredible--will endure for thousands if not millions of years. This stuff, 
unfortunately, creates the energy supply as well as the hazard for this period of time. DOE has been shamefully slow and their reluctance to bring W.R. Grace into the cleanup efforts is inexplicable. In fact, DOE did not begin to go after Grace as a responsible party until I started urging them to do so, now over 2 years ago. 
Sadly enough, Wayne is not the only New Jersey site being managed by the Department of Energy under the FUSRAP program. New Jersey has five of these sites, including another thorium site which threatens residents of Maywood, Rochelle Park and Lodi. Like the Wayne citizens, these residents, too, have been waiting patiently for lots of years to see that their particular site is cleaned up. 
This report should prove helpful in encouraging faster cleanup at these sites. I support the amendment and I note the presence of my colleague from New Jersey on the floor, who has worked closely with me on matters affecting the communities, these communities that have these radioactive sites. 
I am pleased to see him and to note that we worked together on these things. I assume the Senator from New Jersey wants to make some comments. I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express my objection to a provision in the defense authorization bill that is expected to shortly come before the full Senate. 
The reason that I take this time now to bring this to the Senate is that it is a matter of great urgency. This is the kind of thing that I think citizens throughout the country will automatically rebel against. This is kind of a shock treatment that every now and then happens here that ought to come to the attention of the American public because it is such a flagrant example of the abuse of power, and the power belonging to a corporation with a good friend inside this body. 
The provision I am objecting to is one of the most flagrant examples of special interest corporate subsidy that I have ever witnessed in my roughly 15 years in the U.S. Senate. This provision is section 3138 of the defense bill, will have the effect of exempting a company called W.R. Grace--a company that has contributed to a hazardous wastesite in my State of New Jersey--from any further liability at this site. 
Mr. President, this provision was written to get W.R. Grace off the hook--out of any responsibility for pollution that they created, out of the obligation to pay for it, thus passing the buck to the American public. This company contributed to this hazardous wastesite in the State of New Jersey, and now the bill includes this reference that excuses them from any further liability for pollution that they created at this site. 
The provision effectively grants a special exemption for this company from a law known as the Superfund law, the law which embodies the concepts that the polluter should pay for the pollution and contamination that they created. It is fundamental. The Superfund law, which I am proud to have helped write, provides the Government with the tools to go after the polluters who are found to be responsible for the waste. 
Mr. President, this provision was inserted in the dark of night without any consultation with this Senator who has worked for so many years to get this site cleaned up; and who has been chairman of the subcommittee on Superfund in the Environment and Public Works Committee and is now the ranking member. Though I am not involved directly with the Armed Services Committee, the fact of the matter is that everyone who is here knows that I have been very much involved in helping to create the Superfund law and making sure that we clean up contamination in our country. But here, even the professional staff, the Democratic staff of the committee, was unaware of this section's insertion and were not given any opportunity to review the provision. 
This provision is a sneak attack on the environment, on the taxpayers, and on the legal process. This provision says to the taxpayer, `Too bad for you, taxpayer. We will let a corporate polluter off the hook because this polluter has some special friends in the U.S. Senate. Oh, and by the way, taxpayer, this 
dump has to be cleaned up. Somebody has to pay for it. So I guess it is going to be you. The most it can cost you, taxpayers, is $120 million. But it saves Grace that money. 
So that should make us all feel good, I guess. 
I want to explain a little bit about the Wayne Superfund site. 
From 1948 to 1971, thorium, a highly radioactive material, and other materials, were extracted at the site that was later owned by W.R. Grace & Co. in Wayne, NJ. The process of mining thorium resulted in contamination with radioactivity of numerous buildings. When the contamination was discovered these buildings were torn down. The resulting waste material was placed in an enormous dump site in Wayne Township, NJ. The Environmental Protection Agency placed this dump site on the Superfund National Priority List in 1984. They said it was one of the worst contaminated sites in the country because this site would potentially threaten the drinking water supply for 51,000 New Jersey residents. The Department of Energy, which oversees the cleanup of this fund under a program that they call FUSRAP, the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program, has spent over $50 million so far cleaning up this site. The Department of Energy says that the ultimate cleanup may cost as much as $120 million. 
In 1984, W.R. Grace turned over the property and $800,000 to the Federal Government. That year, W.R. Grace signed a legally binding agreement with the Federal Government which provided explicit assurances that the Government could still pursue the company under any law, including the Superfund law. So when the Federal Government put down the $800,000 deposit, that didn't permit them to escape any further liability. W.R. Grace signed the agreement to confirm that. 
As the Department of Energy began to clean up the site and to further study the extent of contamination, it soon realized that the cleanup costs were far beyond what they originally believed. In 1996, the Justice Department, acting on behalf of the Department of Energy, began serious discussions with W.R. Grace to determine the extent to which the company might be willing to contribute additional costs to pay for this massive cleanup. 
I was assured that these discussions were proceeding in good faith and that progress was being made. But then I found out about this outrageous breach of the legal process to which I believe the company would be seriously committed either by negotiations or tested in the courts of our country. 
Mr. President, the residents of Wayne Township are outraged. They feel betrayed by the democratic process, and I share their outrage and disappointment. I am going to be introducing an amendment to remove this provision from the bill and to defend the concept embodied in our law that says that you create the mess, you clean it up; you can't walk away, or, in this case, sneak away from your responsibilities.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is a strange anomaly that the name of this company, W.R. Grace, is the name of--I am not sure whether it was the founder--but the name of someone who helped build this big company. It is also the name of someone who wrote a report that was officially called `The Report of the Grace Commission' in which they talked about how you reduce Government inefficiency, reduce costs, and cut down the size of Government and get those bureaucrats off our backs--all of those words. But now this company said there is one way to resolve problems, and that is to hide behind a good friend's efforts, whoever that friend may be, and get it off the hook for possibly--$120 million. 
We can't find enough money around here at times to take care of essential programs. We are cutting back Government as much as we can. We are trying to arrive at a balanced budget in the year 2002. And we struggled here not too long ago to try to get disaster relief money into the hands of people whose homes were torn apart, whose families' histories wiped out, with many left penniless and nowhere to turn. We had a heck of a time getting those funds to those people. 
Here we have $120 million that this Government is liable to have to spend to clean up this site. And what do we do? We let the company duck its responsibilities. 
Well, Mr. President, I don't intend to threaten at all. But I will say this: If this section stays in the bill and lets W.R. Grace off the hook, and maybe some other companies, we will have to study it a little more thoroughly. I will stand here, and I will talk. I will read, I will lecture, and I will do anything I can to keep this from becoming law because it is an outright misuse of taxpayers' funds. I am not going to let that happen, Mr. President--not this Senator. And I am sure other Senators will agree with me. 
With that, I yield the floor. I thank you. I note the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the Gun Shop Safety Act of 1997, to require the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to issue minimum safety and security standards for federally licensed firearms dealers. 
Mr. President, incredible as it may seem, there are no Federal minimum standards for security of premises and merchandise at gun shops. In fact, a gun dealer must meet only minimal qualifications to obtain a gun dealers' license. An applicant need only be 21 years of age, not be prohibited by law from possessing or transporting firearms, and maintain a business premises in compliance with any State law. Once a dealer gets a license, the only Federal requirements are that dealers keep accurate records of purchases and sales, and have the books available for yearly inspection by the ATF. Basically, that is it. No safety or security requirements, no safety inspections. 
This is simply not good enough. Guns are being stolen from licensed gun dealers at an alarming rate. These guns pose an increasingly significant public safety problem. Clearly, by definition stolen guns are available to criminals. In fact, studies have found that between 10 and 32 percent of guns used in the commission of a crime are obtained as a direct result of theft, while an approximately equal number of guns used during a criminal act were stolen before being used in a crime. 
Mr. President, stolen guns from gun shops are a significant source of guns used in violent street crimes. For example, everywhere we see the growing problem of the so-called `smash and grab' burglaries from retail gun outlets, where thieves either drive through or otherwise smash the windows of gun shops and steal large quantities of firearms in a matter of minutes. 
During the 1992 Los Angeles riots, 19 gun stores were looted and robbed of about 4,000 guns. One pawnshop lost 970 guns, while another outlet was robbed of 1,150 guns. An ATF report reveals that these guns continue to be recovered on the street. 
Mr. President, guns are not stolen from licensed gun dealers only during a riot. Recently, it has been reported that thieves stole 75 firearms from a store in Washington State after killing the owner, and then sold about 40 of the stolen guns on the streets of Seattle that night. 
In my own State of New Jersey, we also recently witnessed a sickening murder committed with a gun stolen from a gun shop. This past April, 24-year-old Jeremy Giordano and 24-year-old Georgio Gallara of Sussex County, NJ were shot down in cold blood by two young thugs. No robbery was involved, no motive discovered, just murder for the sake of murder. And these killings were only possible because the murderers were able to steal two high-powered handguns from a local shop. They simply smashed the store's front window and smashed the locked glass display case where the guns were stored overnight. The theft was over in a few brief minutes, the criminals long gone by the time the police arrived at the gun shop. 
Mr. President, there must be a better way. It is time that our laws recognize that guns are not ordinary merchandise--they are deadly weapons. It is just common sense that criminals should be denied easy access to an arsenal of weapons. 
Mr. President, this country is already awash in a sea of gun violence. Every 2 minutes, someone in the United States is shot. Every 14 minutes, someone dies from a gunshot wound. In 1994 alone, over 15,000 people in our country were killed by handguns. Compare that to countries like Canada, where 90 people were killed by handguns that year, or Great Britain, which had 68 handgun fatalities. 
Mr. President, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that by the year 2003, gunfire will have surpassed auto accidents as the leading cause of injury-related deaths in the United States. In fact, this is already the case in seven States. 
Mr. President, given the severity of our Nation's gun violence problem, we need to find new ways to reduce the number of guns on our streets. Although we cannot totally end gun theft, there is much we can and should do. We can prevent predators from getting guns so freely and frequently through theft. 
So, Mr. President, this bill will require the ATF to use its expertise to craft reasonable and needed regulations to ensure that gun shops better secure the weapons and ammunition they sell from theft. 
I hope this proposal will receive strong, bipartisan support, even from those hostile to any gun-related legislation. This bill will help keep guns out of the hands of criminals. This is a goal I believe all of us share. And this legislation is the least we can do.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an amendment I am submitting today to the product liability bill to protect the Nation's public health from the dangers of tobacco. I am joined in this effort by my colleagues Senator Durbin, Senator Harkin and Senator Wyden. 
Without this amendment, the product liability bill provides the tobacco industry with a backdoor escape hatch from the settlement negotiations in which they are currently engaged. Without this amendment, the tobacco industry will not have to make concessions to the public health community that could save millions of American lives. 
Mr. President, 36 States have now gone to court to recover the millions of dollars in Medicaid and other health care costs that were a direct result of the tobacco industry's deceitful and deadly practices. Thousands of Americans who have been grievously injured by tobacco products, and the loved ones of those who have been killed by tobacco, are seeking compensation from the tobacco industry for their lethal and addictive products. Currently, a bipartisan group of State attorneys' general are involved in sensitive negotiations with the tobacco industry concerning compensation for the illness and death caused by its products. Whether one supports the concept of a settlement or not, the fact that the tobacco industry has come to the table is an amazing development. 
They have come to the table because they realize that this President and enough of us in Congress will not allow them to continue seducing and poisoning our children without an appropriate response. They also know that they will be subject to increasing civil liability in the court system. I applaud the attorneys' general for bringing such strong cases against them, that they realized it was time to sit down and possibly release our Nation's children from their stranglehold. 
Mr. President, right now, one of the major sticking points in the talks between the attorneys' general and the Big Tobacco is the issue of restrictions on product liability suits that will be brought against the tobacco industry in the future. The industry has asked for a cap on punitive damages, and it wants to eliminate joint and several liability in tobacco cases. The attorneys' general are currently trying to work this issue out with the tobacco companies.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if the product liability bill passes in its current form, the tobacco industry will get what it wants, and the American public will receive nothing in return. As reported out of the Commerce Committee, the product liability bill will cap punitive damages and eliminate joint and several liability in tobacco liability cases. This would be another sweetheart deal for big tobacco, and it would undercut the state attorneys' general. This is unacceptable. And what will America lose if we don't pass my amendment? Mr. President, I say perhaps millions of lives. 
The tobacco industry is on the verge of agreeing to stop marketing to American children, to stop lying and hiding the truth from the American public, to commit to actual target numbers for reduction of teen smoking, to subject themselves to appropriate regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and to back real reforms that will put teeth into laws that prohibit the sale of cigarettes to kids. Do we in Congress want to throw that away forever? Do we want to give big tobacco the green light to continue seducing and addicting our children? I certainly hope not. 
Mr. President, that is why it is critical that we pass my amendment, which would exempt tobacco products from the restrictions on liability covered by the product liability bill. Regardless of how any Senator feels about the overall goals of the product liability bill, exempting tobacco is the right thing to do. We should not sell out our Nation's public health to the tobacco lobby. Congress should not provide the tobacco industry with a back door deal through the product liability bill. To prevent this from happening, we must attach my amendment. 
Mr. President, some of my colleagues might ask: `Why should we give tobacco litigation a carve-out from the restrictions of this bill?' The answer is simple and rather straightforward: The tobacco industry is unlike any other American industry. No other industry in this country kills over 400,000 Americans each year. No other industry has conspired to deviously addict children to its product. No other industry has submitted such highly questionable testimony to Congress and the courts. Is this Congress prepared to undercut unprecedented public health programs and give the tobacco industry the sweetheart deal they have been dreaming of? Is Congress going to bail out the industry once again? The American people won't tolerate it. 
Mr. President, this Senator will do everything I can to prevent that from happening. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this effort to remove tobacco litigation from the restrictions of the product liability legislation. It is the right thing to do for the public health, for our State's highest law enforcement officials, and most important, for our kids.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express some concerns that I have about recent developments that are occurring in the House of Representatives related to the budget. It was just a few nights ago, a few evenings ago, that we got a conference report from the House that was passed by a substantial margin in the Senate that confirms that the work we did in the budget negotiations was satisfactory to both the Members of the other body and the Senate. We had been through it here once before, the conference report, to get the budget resolution confirmed. It passed 78 to 22. The vote was almost identical when we got the conference report back. That was Thursday evening. I was stunned to read in Friday morning's newspaper that there were challenges to the assumptions that were made, to the agreements that were made to try to get that budget done, to try to forge a consensus agreement. 
I must point out that this is not an agreement that I have heard people standing up and lauding and saying, `I love it. It is the perfect budget agreement. It is everything my constituents want it to be.' By no means. But there is in this budget agreement something I think both parties can salute. There is an investment in the middle class, there is an investment in education, there is some tax relief for the middle class. Once again, if we look at the extremes, we are all woefully short of things that I would have liked to have if I had an ideal opportunity to design it myself. But I do not, and we represent a consensus. Mr. President, 50 States are represented here by the two Senators from each State who are here to argue the case from their particular point of view. 
A bipartisan budget agreement was the product of extensive negotiations involving compromises by everyone involved, and many provisions were the subject of protracted discussion, with each word carefully considered and debated. In the end, we struck a delicate balance, and the resulting agreement, if implemented, will provide, I believe, great benefits to our Nation. It will give us the first balanced budget since 1969. It will provide tax relief, as I said earlier, to the middle class. It will protect Medicare, extend its solvency, and it will do something about cleaning up the environment, investments in education, and other significant national priorities. 
Unfortunately, since the handshake that took place here--it took place in the negotiating room between the chairman and the ranking members and the representatives of the President--two House committees are now moving to alter the bipartisan budget agreement when the ink is barely dry. It is a matter of great concern to me and it ought to be a matter of great concern to everybody here who thought we had accomplished something significant when we passed that budget agreement. Although the steps have been taken in the other body, I want to raise my concerns here before Senate committees begin the process of marking up their own reconciliation packages. 
For instance, one important provision of the bipartisan budget agreement would protect immigrants, legal immigrants who have come to this country, who paid their taxes, played by the rules, and who then suffer from a disability--perhaps from an automobile accident or an illness that robs them of their ability to function as they used to--eyesight or other physical ailments that affect their capacity to walk or to work. The budget agreement says these people should be protected. 
It states on page 22 of the agreement of the budget resolution that Congress will: 
. . . restore SSI and Medicaid eligibility for all disabled legal immigrants who are or who become disabled and who entered the United States prior to August 23, 1996. 
That was a compromise date, I point out. Unfortunately, last week in the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, they reported a bill that fails to do this and suggests reducing the numbers of people and reducing the availability of these services, these programs for these disabled people. It directly violates this portion of the agreement, the compromise that they are proposing. The compromise was already done. The subcommittee's action is not an innocent mistake. It is not based on differences in interpreting the agreement. This is a blatant, intentional violation of the bipartisan budget accord which should not be tolerated. Certainly it should not be begun unilaterally so soon after the agreement is done. 
If we had things that we wanted to talk about, they ought to be talked about cautiously and not entered into the news media immediately as something they want to change.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today the House Commerce Committee, the Subcommittee on Health and Environment, will consider legislation introduced by the chairman of that subcommittee that also breaks the bipartisan budget agreement. The budget agreement calls for $1.5 billion to ease the impact of increasing Medicare premiums on low-income beneficiaries. This provision was included because the budget agreement calls for phasing in increases in Medicare premiums to accommodate the shift of home health care expenditures from part A to part B. We were worried because there is going to have to be, in order to provide the solvency that we found for Medicare to continue, or the Medicaid programs, we had proposed expanding Medicaid premium coverage for Medicare recipients who had incomes of 120 to 150 percent of poverty. That is pretty modest going. 
The final agreement threw out the specifics of the premium proposal. However, it did call for spending the $1.5 billion on whatever policy Congress chose to enact. But that was not the understanding. Regretfully, the House committee with jurisdiction of Medicaid will only include $300 to $400 million for this provision, one we labored long and hard over. It is another clear violation of the budget agreement, and it is very troubling. 
I am also concerned about the tax bill that the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee outlined yesterday. The chairman's bill would only provide $30.8 billion--not an insignificant amount--in tax incentives for higher education. But that was fought for very stoutly; that it was to get $35 billion. And only about $22 billion of the proposal of this type is for the benefits that were advocated by the President, understood to be something we could agree on, falling far short of, and I quote here, the `roughly $35 billion.' That language was struggled over, `roughly $35 billion.' I tell you this, no one can buy a house for `roughly $35,000,' or a car for `roughly $15,000.' How much is it? Well, that is what it ought to be. That language was compromise language, because we knew the intent or believed the intent of both Speaker Gingrich and/or the distinguished leader here, Senator Lott, was their commitment to the program. Although the word `roughly' was there, it should be interpreted broadly, and I think this, frankly, goes too far, when they start making the cuts in the House committee that are inconsistent with the agreement. 
Mr. President, the bipartisan budget agreement calls on the House and Senate leadership to take remedial efforts to ensure that this document is implemented in the legislative process. Leadership action is critical if the agreement is to be implemented properly. And, therefore, I hope that Speaker Gingrich will intervene promptly and require that in all cases I have mentioned the relevant committees make the changes necessary to be consistent with the agreement that we have. 
If the congressional leadership fails to enforce the agreement, it will not be worth the paper it is written on and in the process of reconciliation we could be looking at very serious problems getting this program into place. 
Mr. President, I also want to take a moment to talk about the disaster supplemental. I am pleased to note that yesterday the President vetoed the bill because it contains the so-called automatic CR. The automatic CR also violates the bipartisan budget agreement for two reasons. 
First, it would lower the amount of discretionary spending available for fiscal 1998. The budget agreement calls for $527 
billion in discretionary spending for fiscal year 1998, which is $17 million over last year's level. If the automatic continuing resolution is enacted, the majority could refuse to pass the 13 appropriations bills, thereby cutting the $17 billion in discretionary spending. That would absolutely violate one of the basic Democratic accomplishments in the budget agreement and, again, the consensus. 
The automatic CR would make deep cuts in programs that are protected in the budget agreement. The bipartisan negotiators agreed to provide large increases in 13 major discretionary programs. Examples of these programs include elementary and secondary education, Pell grants, child literacy, Head Start, national parks, job training, Clean Water Act, Superfund, and the COPS Program. Some of the programs are preferred by Democrats, some preferred by Republicans, but the fact is we arrived at a consensus. Both parties wanted this done. An automatic CR would freeze these programs at last year's level, and they would not get the increases promised in the budget agreement, at least without further congressional action. 
So, I hope the leadership will comply with the budget agreement, put the plight of disaster victims above politics, strip the automatic CR from the bill and send the President a clean version of the disaster relief bill that he can sign. 
Mr. President, I conclude and I thank you for your indulgence with this simple message: A promise is a promise. A deal is a deal. The Republican leadership made a promise to the Democrats in the Congress and to the President. What I am asking here today is that they make sure that promise is kept by their committee chairs, subcommittee chairs, and those who would violate the agreement after all of that labor and what I think was a smashing success. 
I yield the floor.  
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I reluctantly rise to oppose this conference report. Regrettably, the majority has decided to play politics with the lives of disaster victims. This is a tragedy. 
Mr. President, I don't have a particular dog in this fight. My State has been fortunate to be free of disasters recently. But it pains me to look at television footage of homeless people in the Dakotas and Minnesota and know that they are not getting all needed assistance because of two unrelated political riders to this legislation. 
Mr. President, I oppose this conference report because it includes the so-called automatic CR. I want to be clear with my colleagues--this provision violates the bipartisan budget agreement. Let me repeat this, the automatic CR violates the bipartisan budget agreement. 
It violates the budget agreement for two reasons: 
First, it would lower the total amount of discretionary spending available for fiscal year 1998. The budget agreement calls for $527 billion in discretionary spending for fiscal year 1998, which is a $17 billion increase over last year's level. If the automatic CR is enacted, the majority could refuse to pass the 13 appropriations bills and they would succeed in a $17 billion cut in discretionary spending. This would violate one of the basic Democratic accomplishments in the budget agreement. 
Second, the automatic CR would make deep cuts in programs that are protected in the bipartisan budget agreement. The bipartisan negotiators agreed to provide large increases in 13 major discretionary programs. 
Examples of these programs include: Elementary and secondary education improvement, Pell grants, child literacy, Head Start, national parks, job training, the Clean Water Act, Superfund, and the COPS Program. 
Mr. President, the automatic CR would freeze these programs at last year's levels. Therefore, these programs would not get the increases promised in the bipartisan 
budget agreement if Congress did not pass certain appropriations bills. 
Mr. President, as ranking member of the Budget Committee, I am concerned that the majority is violating the bipartisan budget agreement before the ink is dry. 
First, they include this automatic CR that cuts overall discretionary spending and specific programs that were protected by the bipartisan budget agreement. Second, a House Ways and Means Subcommittee has approved welfare provisions that are in direct violation of the terms of the bipartisan budget agreement. 
This is a disturbing trend. If we are to maintain bipartisan cooperation in the coming weeks, the majority will need to drop their efforts to move legislation that directly violates the bipartisan budget agreement, like the automatic CR. 
Mr. President, I also oppose the census provision in the supplemental bill. This is not a provision based upon statistical science, it is a provision based upon politics. It is the latest attempt by the Republican National Committee to try to increase its political fortunes in the next century. 
My Republican colleagues, at the request of the RNC, have proposed to throw hundreds of millions more at the 2000 census. This additional money, we have been told by the National Academy of Sciences, will not make the census any more accurate, just more expensive. The Census Bureau estimates that spending up to $800 million more than planned would reduce the undercount only marginally. 
This provision does not belong in a disaster relief bill and it should be stripped out and sent back to the Government Affairs Committee for further consideration. 
Mr. President, I hope that the President will immediately veto this bill and that the majority will then pass a clean disaster relief bill so that people suffering all over this country will be able to begin the process of rebuilding their lives and communities. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to join the manager of the Budget Committee in supporting the conference report on the budget resolution. Perhaps it is unnecessary to recall what constitutes this agreement, a consensus agreement. Consensus is a fairly simple word with very dramatic meaning. It is the majority view--not the unanimous view but the majority view--of the participants in an agreement in a debate. 
And I want to just take a moment to remind everybody about the fact that this is a consensus agreement. Those who are looking for total victory are not going to find it here and those who are looking for total defeat are not going to find it here. A consensus view, the majority view is what we strove for. I am unhappy with some things, and I am sure my colleague on the other side of the aisle is also unhappy with some of these things. But we struck an agreement in good faith. We worked very hard. We worked hard to get it through the conference and we thought that we had a continuation of the understanding that was arrived at when we shook hands a few weeks ago and presented the Senate side of the budget understanding, the budget resolution. 
As I said in my first remarks, I fully support this agreement. That doesn't mean I support it enthusiastically, but it means that it has my commitment because we worked so hard and we got so many good things in this budget resolution. What I am concerned about--if there seems to be evident a note of reluctance or wariness in my comments, it is true. It is true because what I have heard already, and I have read in the papers, as it is said, is that there are those who want to reinterpret what it is that we agreed upon when we concluded this Senate budget resolution, what we agreed upon when we had the conference concluded; those who are saying, well, not this many immigrants are going to be taken care of; or not this proposal on containing the tax cut, $250 billion over the 10-year period; or not making certain that the investments in the principal passenger railroad in this country are going to be made, as it was understood by me and others sitting there. 
So I want to throw out that word of caution. This is, as I think everyone knows, nonamendable. It is a budget conference report. There is no room for amendment. There is no opportunity for amendment. The conference report before us is very similar to the budget resolution that the Senate approved on May 23, by a vote of 78 to 22. It provides a framework to get our fiscal house in order while protecting critical national priorities. Last fall, the American people spoke at polling booths. They elected a Democratic President and a majority of the Republicans in both Houses. Yet, despite this divided Government, they have been clear about what they want. They want the gridlock to end. They want the bickering to end. They want us to get to work. They want us to do the best we possibly can to get this house in fiscal order and get on with the business of our country. 
At the same time, Americans asked that Washington focus on the issues that matter most to us: Education, Medicare, children's health, environment, fighting crime, and other Government responsibilities that make a difference in the way people live. I believe the conference report before us keeps our trust with the people. It is not, as I earlier said, a perfect agreement. It is not exactly as I would have written it. But I consider it an enormous step forward. It will, as we see it now, relieve future generations of having to continue to pay for borrowing that we have done or that we are doing now. But it is going to stop in 2002--that's my belief and that's the belief of those who negotiated in good faith to get this agreement done. It calls for the largest investment in education and training since the Johnson administration. It is phenomenal. It says we are going to put money into our children. We are going to prepare for the future. We are agreed on that. And with that, it combines tough fiscal discipline with a strong commitment to Medicare, environment, transportation, and other national priorities. 
Throughout this process, President Clinton has insisted and I have agreed that an agreement that imposes real 
fiscal discipline, that builds on President Clinton's tremendous successes in reducing the deficit, and balances the budget in a real, credible way, is the way we have to go. The President has insisted and I have insisted that we make education the priority that it is. 
I strongly supported some amendments that were dropped in the process of discussion, like the Dodd amendment. I commend the distinguished Senator from Connecticut for his leadership. His was the amendment that said that we would not go beyond $250 billion worth of tax cuts over the 10 years. A point of order could have been raised against any of the tax cuts in the bill and that point of order could have been waived only with the votes of 60 Senators. But it was dropped in the conference. 
Instead, there is a commitment that says that $250 billion over the next 10 years, $85 billion in the first 5 years and $165 billion in the second 5, is the most that can be had by way of tax cuts. There are letters supporting it. There are letters from the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the House, there is a letter from the chairman of the Finance Committee in the Senate, there are letters from the Speaker of the House, and there is a letter from the distinguished majority leader here, that confirms the position that we took. So, while there is some disappointment that the language that we originally anticipated would be in there is not part of the record, but it is indirectly recognized. It is there.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I note also that this resolution does include the sense of the Congress resolution that again reaffirms that $250 billion 10-year tax limit on tax cuts is clarified, in a way. I just want to remind everybody what it says here: 
The 10-year cost of the tax reconciliation bill resulting from this resolution shall not exceed $250 billion and any revenue loss shall be certified by the Joint Committee on Taxation in consultation and cooperation with the Office of the Tax Analysis of the Department of the Treasury. 
To make the point by continuing to emphasize it, I don't think anyone should have any doubts that the tax cuts in the reconciliation will be limited. We are not going to suffer a repeat of exploding deficits that flowed from the disastrous policies of the Reagan era. We will not go down that road again. 
So as we wrap up our work on this budget resolution, I congratulate the President for his leadership in this effort. We are here today on a bipartisan basis, only because the President decided to lead the effort to make it happen. He deserves enormous credit for it. When we look back at the results of the legislation that the President wanted to put forward some years ago, in 1993, and we see the incredible results, we see reports by a publication like Fortune magazine saying this is one of the greatest economies that this country has ever had, you can sense the strength of the economy, you can sense the confidence that the people have in their ability to take care of their families and to provide, hopefully, with the programs that we are outlining here today, education for their children in the future, security for the aged, to make sure that these investments will produce job opportunities and a better quality of life for all our people. That is what we want to see. 
So, I yield the floor and I say to my colleagues, even if there is some disagreement, even if there is some question, I hope we will get the fullest support that we can obtain for this agreement. It does, once again, put the fiscal house in order. It maintains the important priorities that we all, I think it is fair to say, would like to see. 
I am sure if I talk to my colleague to my right here, if we talk about education for our children, he will say we want to invest in education for our children.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to clarify for the record, a procedural point in the budget resolution. The budget resolution conference report currently before the Senate includes language which would permit the chairman of the Budget Committee, with the concurrence of the ranking member, to revise the reconciliation instructions to the Finance Committee and to adjust other budget resolution levels in amounts which are intended to reflect the children's health initiative. In this regard, I would direct the attention of our colleagues to the children's health section of the bipartisan budget agreement, which provides that the $16 billion in funding `could be used for one or both of Medicaid (provisions) * * * and a program of capped mandatory grants to States.' The agreement further provides that other possibilities for implementation of the child health initiative may be considered if mutually agreeable. Would the chairman of the committee agree that the budget agreement therefore requires the concurrence of all parties to the agreement--the majority and minority in Congress and the President--before other policy options may be considered?

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my dear friend and former colleague, Howard Metzenbaum, on the occasion of his 80th birthday. In his honor, I am introducing a bill that would designate the Federal Building Courthouse in Cleveland, OH, as the `Howard M. Metzenbaum United States Courthouse.' I am joined by Ohio's two Senators, Senator Glenn and Senator DeWine. 
Mr. President, I propose naming a courthouse after Howard because a courthouse is a symbol of justice where all people can come and be treated equally under the law. Howard Metzenbaum deserves this honor because he was a dedicated public servant, who served his home State of Ohio for 18 years in the U.S. Senate. Howard's sense of fairness and equality for all Americans led one of his former colleagues to suggest that Howard would have made an exceptional U.S. Supreme Court Justice when he retired from the Senate in 1994. 
Mr. President, naming a courthouse after Howard is only a small gesture in attempting to remember a man so committed to justice and fairness. Howard's contributions to the Senate are extraordinary, so we should commemorate his unique contribution by celebrating his 80th year, his 18 years in the United States Senate, and also the special character he brought to our body. 
I pay tribute today to a man who always stood up for what he believed was right, fighting hard to preserve opportunity for those yet to come. As a Senator, Howard had a broad range of interests and he pursued them with dogged perseverance, sincerity, and clarity. 
Howard and I worked on many issues together during our time in the Senate. Individual rights and environmental preservation were major concerns. He poured his energy into clean air protection, nuclear regulation, cleaning up superfund sites, and recycling. Howard provided strong leadership on antitrust issues as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Monopolies and Business Rights on the Judiciary Committee. 
He was a persistent gun control advocate, taking the lead on many antigun initiatives in the Senate. He was one of the lead sponsors of the Brady bill handgun purchase waiting period, as well as the bans on assault weapons and plastic explosives. 
But Howard's true passions lay with America's underprivileged and needy communities, which never had a bolder champion. His work on behalf of the poor, the disabled, and the elderly reflect his remarkable compassion for those members of society who face challenges that many of us cannot fully appreciate. He tirelessly defended their interests and fought for their protection. He was dedicated to eradicating discrimination, ensuring adequate health care to those in need, and boosting public education. It has been said many times, but for good reason, that Howard brought not only his conscience to the Senate, but also the courage to act on his convictions. 
Howard remains a good friend to me, but he was also a mentor and a teacher during his years in the Senate. He gave me good advice and plenty of it. And, I might add, he continues to do so today, which I welcome. But more than that, his dedication to the office of United States Senator is an example by which to live. He stood tall for the little people. 
Some will affectionately remember Howard as determined, argumentative, and even `irascible.' I cannot deny that those words come to my mind every now and then, when describing Howard. He was always at his best then, and for good reason. I heard it said by one Senator, and not a good friend: `If there wasn't a Metzenbaum here, we'd have to invent one to keep us alert.' 
I have missed working with Howard Metzenbaum in this great institution, a place that has been truly enhanced by his presence. I salute him on celebrating his 80th year. 
I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill appear at the appropriate place in the Record.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is not often during the course of our busy days here in the Senate that we take time to recognize one of our colleagues for their individual accomplishments. Today, however, we are doing so on the occasion of Strom Thurmond's history making event of having served longer in the U.S. Senate than anyone since the founding of our country. I join with my colleagues in paying special tribute to Senator Thurmond, the Senior Senator from South Carolina, on this noteworthy day. 
On May 25, Senator Thurmond became the longest serving Member ever in the Senate's 208-year history by serving more than the 41 years and 10 months Senator Carl Hayden served between 1927 and 1969. Senator Thurmond's longevity in Senate service is truly remarkable because, in addition to length of service, he has been deeply commited to providing leadership in the Armed Services Committee and as the President pro tempore. 
Senator Thurmond has worn many hats during his distinguished career in public service, which began well before he was first elected to the Senate in 1954. As a school teacher, State senator, judge, World War II veteran, D-day fighter, and Governor, Senator Thurmond's service to our country is very likely unparalleled. In the Senate, Strom has been an indefatigable fighter on behalf of his State of South Carolina and has demonstrated enormous tenacity in championing our national defense and veterans causes. His enthusiasm in all that he does is truly unmatched. 
Mr. President, although Senator Thurmond and I may not always see eye to eye, I respect his integrity, his consideration of others, his love of country, and his deep sense of responsibility to public service. His service will have a lasting impact on this institution's history because of the policies he promoted, the high standards he set for us, and the lessons he taught so many of us about the will to carry on no matter the obstacle. He fought against the most painful of tragedies by trying to make sure others were spared the grief he endured. I look forward to continuing working alongside him for many years to come and hope to witness his service at his personal century mark.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I introduce the Smoke-Free Environment Act of 1997. This bill will help decrease the death rates from a toxic pollutant that exists in the air of our Nation's factories, office buildings, retail stores, and Government facilities. I am speaking of secondhand smoke from cigarettes and other tobacco products, which kills tens of thousands of Americans each year. 
A recent study put an end to the tobacco industry's distortions and misinformation on this issue. A Harvard University study which tracked 32,000 nonsmoking women for 10 years found that regular exposure at home or at work to secondhand smoke nearly doubled their risk of heart disease. 
Mr. President, we have been aware of the risk of lung cancer from secondhand smoke for several years now, but this study confirms what many have suspected about the link between secondhand smoke and heart disease. The results of this study means that approximately 50,000 fatal heart attacks each year are caused by exposure to tobacco smoke. 
My bill would require that every building--both Government and private--protect Americans from exposure to secondhand smoke. It can be accomplished in one of two ways. The building could either ban smoking altogether or set up smoking rooms that are separately ventilated from the rest of the building. 
Mr. President, the bill also would finish a job I started with Senator Durbin 10 years ago. In 1987, we banned smoking on domestic airline flights of 2 hours or less. In 1989, we extended that ban to flights of 6 hours or less. 
The smoking ban has been a tremendous success. Passengers have been so pleased by a smokefree environment in the air that many airlines have voluntarily extended the ban to all domestic flights and international flights. However, some airlines have not, and many passengers and flight attendants are still subjected to dangerous secondhand smoke on airplanes. 
Mr. President, the Smoke-Free Environment Act will also ban smoking on any flight that originates in the United States, and lands in a foreign country. Americans should be able to travel abroad with the peace of mind that they will not be locked into a poisonous cabin for 10 or 15 hours, and flight attendants will not have to worry that they will increase their risk of heart disease almost twofold by simply performing their job. 
Mr. President, yesterday, a trial opened in Miami, in which flight attendants sued the tobacco industry over health injuries caused by exposure to secondhand smoke before the passage of my law banning smoking on domestic flights. These flight attendants have a legitimate case, and it is time to prevent similar litigation in the future by cleaning all the air in the skies, in Government offices, in stores, and in all of our places of work. 
Mr. President, nonsmokers never choose to be exposed to tobacco smoke. The smoke of a cigarette is not only harming the smoker, but also severely injuring others with secondhand smoke. 
Multiple studies have shown that regular exposure to secondhand smoke results in the following for nonsmokers: Damage to the arteries, reduction of oxygen supply in the body, and increases in the tendency of blood platelet to stick together and clot. 
Mr. President, how can we speak about the importance of children's health while our kids are being exposed to this deadly smoke. It is time for Congress to get serious about the health crisis caused by secondhand smoke, and pass the Smoke-Free Environment Act. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be inserted into the Record. I also ask unanimous consent that a New York Times article on the Harvard study be inserted into the Record.

It says that if the current balance results in better than expected economic growth that we ought to go back to the lopsided approach advocated by the majority. I, frankly, think it is illogical. Tax cuts and deficit reductions are not the only policies that can benefit the Nation. And unexpected tax revenue may well be put to good use funding essential Government programs. I don't think that we ought to get locked in at this juncture to insist that any excess revenues would go to tax cuts or deficit reduction. I think we ought to make our judgment at the time that these things occur.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with Senator Domenici regarding the investment in transportation that is included in this budget agreement. 
Mr. President, as most of my colleagues know, I am a strong believer in increasing investment in transportation, whether for roads, bridges, rail systems, aviation, or mass transit. All modes of transportation are important, and all need to be supported. 
We have been working hard in the negotiations to increase total investment in transportation, and we have had some success. We have increased total transportation outlays over the President's request by more than $8 billion over the next 5 years. That is not as much as I would like, but it is a start. 
I would like to clarify one element of the budget agreement as it relates to spending the estimated revenues of the highway trust fund over the next 5 years. That is a goal with which I agree. In an ideal world, I would support even higher spending levels from the highway trust fund. 
However, it is important to clarify that, while this agreement includes an assumption that we will spend from the highway trust fund the amounts equivalent to receipts currently estimated to come into the trust fund, the possibility that receipts will grow beyond the levels currently estimated could endanger our ability to comply with other equally important assumptions in this agreement including increased spending for mass transit and Amtrak. 
In the end, the Appropriations Committee will have to set ceilings for individual subcommittees and funding levels for specific transportation programs, and I want to clarify that increases in highway trust fund spending will not negatively impact other modes of transportation, especially mass transit and Amtrak. 
I therefore would ask my good friend, the chairman of the Budget Committee, do you agree that nothing in this agreement, nor in the budget resolution, requires the Senate to spend all gas tax revenues without regard for the potentially negative impact on other modes of transportation?

Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I may, Mr. President, I too, want to say that my work with Pete Domenici was illuminating, a learning experience at times. 
His smile sometimes was beguiling, but the steel nerves always showed through. It was a good experience. 
I noted with one of our colleagues over there, Senator Nickles--and I am sure that he does not mind my quoting him here--he said that this markup in the budget was the least acrimonious that he had seen in his 17 years on the Budget Committee. I, too, in the 14 years I have been on the Budget Committee. 
We had plenty of differences. Do not let anybody think it was smooth going all the way. But there was a determination to get the job done. It was largely Pete's leadership and our willingness to just put aside some differences. 
My leader, Tom Daschle, was always there to encourage me and the team. 
Senator Lott, too, you know how to push at times and how to pull at other times. You still got us going in the same direction. I don't get it. But it was a pleasure working with the majority leader. 
My team, John Cahill, Bruce King, Sander Lurie, Marty Morris, Sue Nelson, Mitch Warren, and the others whom I was fortunate enough to inherit from the experienced days of Senator Exon and Senator Sasser, Amy Abraham, Matt Greenwald, Phil Karsting, Jim Klumpner, Nell Mays, and Jon Rosenwasser, everybody helped enormously. I want to say Bill Hoagland and the majority leader's team were cooperative. They tried to always make sure we understood exactly what was going to be in there. There was no attempt to deceive or fool. 
Thus, we have an agreement that we can all be proud of. The American people should be proud of it. They saw us cooperating, as the majority leader said. And here we saw a vote of 78 to 22. That is pretty darn good. 
Thank you very much. I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to create stronger incentives for the parties to the Dayton Peace Agreement to arrest indicted war criminals and transfer them to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia [ICTY]. I am pleased that Senators Leahy, Lugar, Feinstein, Mikulski, Murray, Lieberman, D'Amato, and Moynihan are original cosponsors of this bill, which we believe will foster reconciliation in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the long run. 
As a result of the horrifying extent of war crimes committed before and during the war in Bosnia, the U.N. Security Council, in May 1993, created the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia [ICTY]. One of only four international war crimes tribunals ever established, its mandate is to prosecute `genocide, crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, and violations of the laws and customs of war' committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia from January 1, 1991, until `a date to be determined after restoration of peace.' 
When the parties to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia signed the Dayton Peace Agreement, they recognized that reconciliation could not occur unless war criminals were brought to justice. As such, they agreed to cooperate fully with `the investigation and prosecution of war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law.' All members of the international community are required by the tribunal statute to cooperate in `the identification and location of persons,' `the arrest or detention of persons,' and `the surrender or the transfer of the accused' to the tribunal. 
With the exception of the Bosnian Muslims, however, the parties to the Dayton Peace Agreement have failed to arrest and transfer to the tribunal the vast majority of indicted war criminals in territory within their control. Though 74 persons have been indicted by the 4-year-old tribunal, 66 of them remain at large. Let me repeat that. Of the 74 persons indicted for the most heinous crimes against humanity on European soil since World War II, 66 remain at large. Among these are the notorious Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Bosnian Serb Army commander Ratko Mladic, both accused of genocide and crimes against humanity. 
Where are these and other war criminals finding sanctuary? 
Many of the indicted war criminals have been sighted living openly and freely in Croatia, the Croat-controlled areas of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republika Srpska, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia-Montenegro). 
Last fall, one nongovernmental organization, the Coalition for International Justice, compiled a list of all public sightings of war criminals. For example, according to the coalition's research, Dario Kordic, one of the most widely recognized war criminals in the former 
Yugoslavia for his role in killings in Lasva Valley, was seen visiting his parents' apartment in Zagreb, Croatia. About the same time, Ivica Rajic, another highly sought after war criminal, was reportedly seen in a hotel in Split, Croatia. 
The list of public sightings of indicted war criminals goes on and on. Associated Press correspondent Liam McDowall reportedly located six Bosnian Croats indicted for war crimes living and working in the Bosnian Croat town of Vitez. And in perhaps the most egregious case to date, Boston Globe reporter Elizabeth Neuffer reportedly found Zeljko Mejakic--indicted for crimes committed as commander of Omarska camp where some 4,000 people were tortured to death and women were brutally raped--working as the deputy commander of the Prijedor police station in Republika Srpska.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I rise to submit a resolution establishing July 2 of this year and the next as National Literacy Day. 
Mr. President, the ability to read is something most of us often take for granted. For most of us, it is difficult to imagine not being able to read a menu, street sign, magazine or phone book. But for many of our citizens, these seemingly simple activities are impossible. This is so because they are illiterate. I am submitting this resolution to draw attention to the issue of illiteracy by establishing July 2, 1997 and the following year as National Literacy Day. I hope my colleagues will cosponsor this resolution. 
All of us should be more aware of the problem of illiteracy. A recent study found that over 44 million adults cannot read. An additional 35 million read below the level needed to function successfully in society. These numbers alone are alarming and warrant our special attention. But even more disturbing are the personal hardships people must face each day due to their inability to read. The embarrassment parents face when they cannot read to their children. The discouragement able workers feel when they cannot fill out a basic job application. The disappointment we all endure as the ranks of the illiterate grow annually by over 2 million adults. 
Mr. President, the 18th Century writer, Joseph Addison, once wrote `Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.' I could not agree more. Reading enriches our lives in countless ways. But there are far too many of our citizens who cannot read the instructions on a doctor's prescription bottle, let alone share the experience of reading one of Addison's great poems. This needs to change. 
Therefore, we must focus our attention on the problem of illiteracy. All of us should make sure we do our part to ensure that citizens who need help know where services are available. We need to recognize the detrimental effects illiteracy has on our society. Most important, more of us need to enlist in the battle to close the book on illiteracy. 
Mr. President, for these reasons, I am submitting a resolution to designate July 2, 1997 and July, 2, 1998 as National Literacy Day. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I agree, Senator Domenici, that we have to start constraining time because the list is long and unless we get after it we will not have a chance for everybody to be heard on the amendments that they care about. 
I suggest, however, we give 5 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey and after that, 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois, who has requested time, as well, and we will try to button it up. I know the sponsor of the amendment has a few minutes that she will complete.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am not going to take that much time, Mr. President. I think the chairman of the Budget Committee has fairly directly and succinctly made the arguments. The fact of the matter is that none of us are happy with the level of funding that we have for our investments in highways and our transportation needs. We are more deficient, in many ways, than countries down the Third World list. I think we rank about 55th in per capita spending for infrastructure. 
So, one would not disagree with the distinguished Senator from Virginia or the distinguished Senator from Montana in terms 
of the need, the need to correct the situation. But unfortunately, and it is unfortunate for me because I have long been an advocate of more spending on transportation in this country. I think it is common knowledge that the Senator from New Jersey has been an advocate of mass transit, of rail transportation, improving our highway system, of fixing our deficient bridges, which number in the thousands. But we have a proposal in hand that takes a priority, unfortunately, for the moment. That is, to complete the work we started on a balanced budget. We are committed to it. 
Believe me, this is not a place I enjoy being, because I do not agree with everything that is in the budget resolution. But I agree with it enough to say that there is a consensus that we fulfilled an obligation that we talked about to children, children's health, to the senior citizens, to try to make Medicare solvent, to try to not further burden the impoverished in terms of Medicare, to try to take care of those who are in this country legally and become disabled. We fulfilled those obligations. 
The economy is moving along at a very good rate and we are still running the risk, in my view, with some of the tax cuts that have been proposed, of taking us away from the direction that we are moving in, which is to continue to reduce the budget deficit until the year 2002, when there will be none. 
So we have an imperfect, but pretty good, solution in front us. And, now what we are discussing, in terms of transportation--and this is like me talking against motherhood--but the transportation funds that are there are inadequate because of the structure of our budgeting structure, the budgeting arrangement that we have in our Government. The fact is that we have unified budgets. If one wants to start, as has been claimed here several times, establishing truth in budgeting, under that nomenclature I think one would have to start with Social Security. 
Are we prepared today to say we are going to add $70 billion to our deficit each year? We certainly are not. Yet I think, when you talk about a trust fund, there is no more sanctified trust fund than Social Security, something people paid in, they are relying on for their future, for their ability to get along. But we nevertheless still have the unified budget. That problem, I assure you, is going to get intense scrutiny over the next several years. 
Senator Roberts said something--I don't know whether you were here, Senator Domenici, when he said: Everybody, in order to have the budget fully understood, every Senator should be sentenced to 6 months on the Budget Committee. I thought immediately, there is a constitutional prohibition against cruel and inhuman punishment, so we could not do that, even if we wanted to. I am on the Budget Committee by a quirk of circumstance. When I came here, a fellow I had known who was a Senator said that he would do me a favor and that he would vacate his seat on the Budget Committee for me. And I will get even. 
The fact of the matter is, we complain and we gripe, but the money is where the policy is, the money is where the direction is. We take this assignment with a degree of relish, because we want to do the right thing. None of us want to throw the taxpayers' money away. But we are where we are. 
It is with reluctance that I am opposing this amendment because both Senators, Senator Warner and Senator Baucus, have 
been very actively involved in highway funding and highway legislation as a result of our mutual service on the Environment and Public Works Committee. But we are spending more than we did last year. We are spending more than the budget resolution of just 2 years ago. 
I was able, with a lot of hard work and with the support of the chairman of the committee, to get an $8.7 billion increase over the President's budget request for transportation. I had asked that transportation be included as one of the top priorities in the budget. Unfortunately it is not there. But there is a plan, that we expect to be fulfilled, to have a reserve fund that would allow significantly more funding for some of the transportation needs. 
But I want to point out one thing about the trust fund. That is, there is a slow payout in highway projects. I think everybody is aware of that--5, 7 years on many of these things. If we shut down the revenue source now, interest alone would not carry the obligations that are already out there. The obligation ceiling as contrasted with the contract authority are quite different things. We have these obligations that have to be fulfilled, they are there and one day must be met. The balances in the fund, I think, will start coming down with the adjustments that are expected to occur in ISTEA. We have the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee on the floor. That will be opportunity to make some of the changes that are being contemplated here. 
I just think it is a terrible time to say we ought to burden the budget deficit by $12 billion, roughly, right now, when everybody has worked so hard, and this budget has been scrubbed, reviewed, rewashed, rehashed--you name it. We are where we are, in a fairly delicate balance, I point out to my colleagues. There are very delicate opportunities that will, I think, upset the balance that has been achieved. So, again, I repeat myself when I say with reluctance I am going to vote against it.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in response to the question, before the speech, I would say this--yes, I sponsored that legislation. 
My heart is in more funding for transportation, and no one here can say differently. The problem is that we are in a different point in time, and if you want to take it out of highways and say forget the children's health care bill, if you want to take it out of highways and forget the pledge we made to the senior citizens, or take it out of this bill and forget the pledge that we made to those who might be disabled, let's do it, let's talk about that. Let's talk about balancing the budget, because I know the distinguished Senator from Virginia has been a proponent of a balanced budget almost from the day the words were invented around here. 
So now we have a different occasion. We are not talking about transportation; we all agree that transportation is definitely underfunded. What we are talking about is at what price do we make this change, and the price is at, again, children's health or otherwise, because we are committed to balancing this budget. And this is strange talk for a fellow like me.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield myself 2 minutes off the resolution. 
Mr. President, I don't like being put in the position that appears to be developing here, that I am against investment in infrastructure. I stand on my record of having fought as hard as anyone in this body to invest more money in highways, in mass transit, in rail and aviation, whatever was called for. I never met a transportation project I didn't like if it was a well-founded and well-thought-out project. But the insinuation by our distinguished friend from Virginia to caution us and to lay down the scare that we will be counted upon or we will be looked upon by the Record and by the voters, I want to say this: The Senator from Virginia took the liberty yesterday of voting against the funds for crumbling schools, against schools that are tattered and falling apart, where children can't possibly learn. That was OK to vote against. And the appeal wasn't made, and there was no threat that if you vote against this, you are committing those kids to an even more difficult assignment to try and lift themselves up. 
I have defended investments in transportation as chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation of the Appropriations Committee. Without fail, I have defended investing more. But the onerous comparison is that we neglected our responsibility. It is almost as if you are unpatriotic. 
I don't really like everything in this budget resolution. But I am committed by my constitutional responsibilities. If I take the assignment, I have to work on it. We negotiated in good faith, and I don't like some of the tax concessions we have in there. But I think middle-class people in this country are entitled to some tax relief. I think those who want to send their kids to college are entitled to some help to get them the first step up on the economic ladder. 
No, I don't like it all. But I have my duty to do, and I did it. It wasn't pleasant. It wasn't pleasant when I went into the Army in World War II, either, but I did it. And the insinuation that somehow or other I have deserted my responsibility is one that really offends me. 
We did what we thought was best, each one of us, whatever the vote was. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, far be it for me to seek an argument with our distinguished colleague from Arkansas. I cannot argue the other side very effectively. 
Tax cuts at this point in time, I do not think, are the best idea. What I think are some good ideas are the facts that we will, by virtue of this tax cut, we will be saving the middle-class families, those in more modest income circumstance. This will help pay for the insurance of your children. If they choose not to go to a 4-year college there is a program in here that will give them $1,500 worth of tax relief if their child wants to go to a 2-year college or a vocational school. 
I find it hard to disagree totally with my friend from Arkansas. I do want to say this, and this may not be the appropriate defense, but I have to look at it as a member of the Budget Committee and also as a member of the Appropriations Committee as an advance toward something that we want to do. We would like to be able to pay down our deficit, and I think that one day in the not-too-distant future, half a dozen years, which is not much in the lifetime of a country, that we will be able to start paying down our debt, starting to relieve ourselves of the biggest costs we will soon have in the budget which is the interest on the debt. That will happen and it happens because there is a compromise that has been fashioned, and as usual, the compromise is a consensus of minds but not a consensus of hearts. 
I do not really like everything that I am supporting here but there are things that I really love that I am supporting. I love the fact we will take care of 5 million children's health needs, and I love the fact we are not saying to those that are here legally if some accident or sickness befalls you that renders you disabled you will not be kicked off the rolls, which was an intent here for some time. 
There is going to be some relief for the impoverished, up to 150 percent, approximately, of the poverty level for any increases in the part B premium necessary as a result of the switch from part A to part B of home health care. That will help make that part A more solvent. I think that is a worthwhile objective. 
Meanwhile, we see that the economy is boiling, as you suggested, and that there is some hope that it will continue, and the economic assumptions, I think, are relatively conservative. So there is room to achieve the objectives that we want to without simply saying that the tax cuts are the thing that are driving this. That is not the case. The tax cuts are part of it. I do not approve of the tax cuts, either, but I voted for this bill because I think it is an essential part of getting our books in balance and working our way out of debt and not leaving our children with ever larger debts to pay off. 
So while I agree with the Senator in principle, the fact of the matter is that I think we have a job to do here that robs us of some of the things we would like to see. I voted against investments in transportation. That was really painful for me. I voted against expanding programs for children. That was painful to me. I do not like doing those things, but I like doing the job here as conscientiously as I can, which is to say at some point we want to reduce our debt, we want to reduce our deficits, we want to invest in our society, but we do not want to continue to pay the incredible interest rates that we are forced to pay, something around $250 billion a year. 
It is an outrageous thing for us to have to be subjected to. But we are trying to fix it. That is what this is about. 
I hope that the Senator will try at another opportunity to make the adjustments that he is talking about.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Once again, Mr. President, I find myself on the opposite side of an amendment that, frankly, I would not mind supporting. I do not think we do enough to combat the diseases that plague our society, things that we could ultimately save, I think, a fortune with if we could develop some of the programs that are now kind of just showing up with a light at the end of the tunnel. 
I met with a group of drug executives last week in New Jersey, and when they laid out the programs that are near completion--some of those are in testing now in FDA--and the prospect of saving costs for long-term diseases, whether it is Alzheimer's or osteoporosis and so many other things, it is a great advantage for us, both financially and functionally, as a society. 
Because we are in this bind where the funds would come from functions like education, environment, crimefighting, frankly, I am going to have to oppose it. It is one of the tasks we inherit when we take on an assignment like budget, which was declared earlier in this Chamber to be one of the least popular assignments in the place. As a matter of fact, one Senator suggested that every Senator ought to have a sentence of 6 months on the Budget Committee to understand what it is like. Budget committees are fun when there is lots of money. When there is not much money, to put it mildly, it is a drag. 
Mr. President, I yield back any time remaining.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. 
As we examine the amendment sent up by the Senator from Missouri, it kind of recalls some other debates that we have had here, and he so aptly reminded us, that included the balanced budget debates and the subsequent vote that took place. And it therefore seems to me to be out of range to attempt to do that on this budget resolution. 
Frankly, in discussions that we have been having informally, it is my understanding that this amendment not only is opposed by me on behalf of the Democrats but also is opposed by the Republican management, and I certainly hope so because this is outside certainly the structure of this budget resolution. 
We are, Mr. President, working with a set of estimates. That is the best that can be done. One cannot put this into concrete and say that absolutely at the end of your fiscal year 1998 or even at the end of the fiscal year 1997, which is relatively imminent, we are going to be able to precisely gauge exactly what the outcome is going to be. 
It cannot happen. So we are working with estimates. 
But there is something else we are working with, and that is the good faith of the institution. I have heard it said on this floor in recent moments that the implication is that we in this body can't be trusted. And the words that were uttered came from a Member or Members of the institution. 
I don't know who it is that can't be trusted. Is it everybody else except the speaker? Is it everybody on this side of the aisle? Is it everybody on that side of the aisle? The one thing I must tell you I find difficult to comprehend--now, my background is business and I spent 30 years doing that. We didn't find everybody always meeting their word. But typically, if someone had a position of responsibility, you gave them the benefit of trust. And if there was, sometimes, a misunderstanding on an agreement, why, we chalked it up to a misunderstanding, we chalked it up to a misinterpretation. But to suggest that there is no trust in the U.S. Senate, sent here, 100 of us, by 260 million people--what fools those people are to send us here. We can't be trusted. You hear it coming from those who work here, those who have been sent here: Oh, no, we can't be trusted. 
I will tell you this. I don't know anybody here--anybody here, on either side of the aisle, who can't be trusted. I may disagree with their point of view. I may disagree with their judgment. I wouldn't say--I am trying to think of the instances where, perhaps, in my 15 years here, that I have run into someone who you just can't trust. There are rumors about a person here or there. But to suggest that the body is not trustworthy and therefore we need special shackles, special handcuffs, special rules, special procedures? 
It is not enough to say, look, I was sent here by, I don't know, 2 million people in the voting booths, or that I represent a State with 8 million people, or this one represents a State with almost 50 million people, or that one represents a State with 18 million, or that one represents a State with 350,000 people--to say those people are either naive, stupid, don't know what is going on? They made a choice that suits their intellect and suits their view of what life is about, what they need to carry on their responsibilities. I don't think we need these constraints. 
I want to look at the record. I look at a record and if we get partisan about this, I look at a record of two parties, one Republican, one Democrat. The Republicans came into power in full force in 1980. President Reagan was a popular President, among the most popular in the history of the country. He came in, made decisions about tax cuts, $2.8 trillion worth of tax cuts--$2.8 trillion. By the way, in this budget, we have $250 billion, and there is a fair amount of debate. I didn't hear a lot of people say, don't trust him. It was voted, it was part of the law, and we succeeded in creating skyrocketing deficits, year after year, growing more each year than the year before, until we were almost at our wit's end. 
In 1992, a Democrat was elected President, a Democrat from the tax-and-spend party. That Democrat brought the budget deficit down from $290 billion to what is anticipated this year to be below $70 billion, 1992-97, 5 years' worth. We have been doing pretty good. That, to me, looks like we kept our word, all of us, because we have legislated. We have been lucky, too. We have had a very good economy to bolster the revenue side of things. 
But Government is smaller than it was by a significant measure, over a couple of hundred thousand people. We have tightened up in lots of ways that needed tightening up, and the results are pretty good. We have close to 12 million new jobs, unemployment is at its lowest point in 24 years, inflation at a steady rate, very low. There is not too much concern--a little worry, but it's not like it used to be. It's not like it was when it finally worked its way up to 21-or-so percent some years ago. It has been modest. Things have been happening. 
Our tax-to-GDP ratio is the lowest among the industrialized nations. Our ratio of deficit to GDP, very low. Signs are pretty good. Is this going to last forever? I don't know. Neither does anybody else here. Is it going to get worse immediately? No one knows that here, either. 
We look at the statistics. They look pretty good: PPI down, CPI down, everything in the right direction. That, again, does not mean it is going to last, but it does mean this is a heck of a time to, after struggling, struggling to get a balanced budget amendment on the books--and we are this close, Mr. President, this close to a balanced budget. It can be done in this body within hours from now, within hours, 4 or 5 hours; pass a balanced budget amendment--a balanced budget. I am sorry. A balanced budget. That was a slip of the tongue. Not one I meant to make, I can tell you. Within 4 hours, we can have a balanced budget, bipartisan--their side, my side. 
I don't know that we are walking arm in arm, but as I said for the newspaper the other day, at least we are not looking nose to nose, we are looking shoulder to shoulder, which I think is a better way to do it, and feeling pretty good about a lot of 
hard work. 
I don't get paid overtime. I don't want to get paid overtime. I did it because I took the job I wanted to have. I am so privileged to serve in this body. So many times I go over to my desk and I lift the top drawer--this is for the Senator from Missouri. I lift the top of my desk. It is right back there. Underneath that top, it says, `Truman, Missouri.' There is only one Truman I know, who was the President of the United States. I think his name was Harry--`Truman, Missouri.' The man who stood for don't pass the buck: `The buck stops here.' The distinguished Senator from Missouri had served as Governor of that State. He is someone highly thought of. But I could not disagree with him more on this resolution. 
When I see things going as they are, and we have an opportunity for us to work in a bipartisan fashion, 6 weeks, roughly, of long days, long nights of sitting across the table from one another--no growling, no grousing, no anger, no fits or bursts of temperament, walk out of the room--none of that stuff. We disagreed. We discussed it. But nobody tried to put anything over on the other person. And we had the President's people in the room with us, three parties to the agreement. 
And I tell you, talking for myself and for my colleagues over here, there are things in here that we just don't like. I can be sure that there are things over there that they just don't like. But in a consensus arrangement--I have heard that even occurs sometimes in marriage. Two people get along, have nice kids and all that. Sometimes they disagree. Hard to believe? 
In any event, here we are. We have worked together and we walked out of that room, that day, feeling pretty good, even though we had the disagreements that followed on. We have worked, now, for these couple of days to try to get this agreement in place so it could go over to the House, have a conference on it, get the President to sign it and say to the American people--I hold my head high when I do it, in conscience. And my conscience--my name means a lot to me. It means a lot to me because whenever I am in here, I always remember that my parents were brought here as children by their parents from Europe--poor, hard-working people. They always said to me, `Frank, get an education. That's the way up. That's the way you get out of this. That's the way you get out of the store,' with my mother waiting on the tables, cleaning them off all day and all night. 
So, my name means a lot to me. When I lent my support to this agreement, I did it feeling full well that I had done it with all the knowledge that I had available to me, that I did it in good conscience and that we were going to be able to get this agreement passed, out of the way and passed, and that we would be working hard to make sure that we met the objectives that are in here. 
The budget amendment says--and I perhaps paraphrase here because I am not reading from the amendment but I am reading from a summary. It requires a three-fifths vote of the Members of each House to provide for specific excess of outlays over receipts or to provide for such an increase in the level of the public debt. 
That is pretty significant. Normally, we operate with a majority, except in some special cases--veto override or supermajority that are required, sometimes, in budget affairs. But typically it is 51 votes takes it all. 
Here we say that, no, even though it is now in order, even though it is on paper, even though these are estimates, I once again say, and even though it was done with the best judgment that people could exercise, no, we are now going to go back to the debate on the balanced budget amendment. That is essentially what this is. Because we saw it defeated when it was presented here. It needed 67 votes. It got 66, as I remember. And one of the Senators on the floor before said that we would have had a balanced budget amendment if a couple of people hadn't changed their minds. We would have had it in place. It would have been attached to the Constitution. 
Far be it. It took a lot of States. They had to make a lot of votes; 50 of them had to vote to approve it before it got into place--not all 50 of them, but three-quarters of them. 
So it would not be in place. To now be doing a balanced budget amendment when we have a balanced budget 5 years in duration, 10-year projections, we don't expect--we could be wrong, but that's judgment. That is why we were sent here. Use your judgment, make sure your conscience is clear in things that you do. We could be wrong, but it looks in the 10 years, in the next 5-year cycle, that there will not be an explosion of growth in tax cuts, there won't be an explosion in the annual deficit, that we will be able to muster a surplus so we can start paying down some of that debt and get rid of some of the interest we have to pay every year. We have to pay more than a quarter of a trillion dollars in interest every year that every citizen in this country pays for in one way or the other, that children, future generations, will be called upon to pay your debt. They didn't sign any papers to acquire that debt. But we are on the way to solving some of those problems. 
Now, when I look at this amendment, it says, further, that it waives these provisions for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect, certainly, or the United States is engaged in a military conflict which causes an imminent and serious threat to national security. Are there threats to our society other than war? Is instability within our society a threat to this society? Is violence in the street a threat to our society? Is constant tension and hostility between parts of our society, one with the other, classes in our society? I think that is a real threat to national security. But there are no provisions if we are all wrong and a recession starts; if, worse, a depression occurs. If we had the same rules in place today in the early 1930's, then the Depression--everyone who knows anything about business or economics, who studied the problem, will tell you the Depression would have been considerably ameliorated if we had unemployment insurance, if we had other protections for people during that period of time. 
I think, frankly, as we look at this amendment, demanding now a 60 person vote in order to change things, to try and anticipate all the problems you have, is a terrible mistake. I think it violates the structure of the budget resolution. It will blow this agreement out of the water absolutely, because I know that there are not enough people who would vote to sustain a point of order if that is called upon. I expect to do just that. 
So, Mr. President, I hope that we will leave well enough alone in this case, get on with the business at hand, pass the balanced budget resolution, and let us start solving our problems and not create new ones. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from Missouri if he would permit the exchange that we expected to have--the chairman of the Budget Committee is here--and that was that we would switch side to side. Now, we have had an amendment from Senator Gramm, from the Senator from Pennsylvania, one amendment from the Senator from Missouri. Meanwhile, a commitment was made to the Senator from Minnesota, who has been waiting virtually all day. We have not had a chance to deal with it and I think----

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Very briefly, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for remembering that I might disagree that we have a 60-person vote required after the year 2002. I understand that the Senator wants to make sure that if we do achieve the objectives that we set out for ourselves, that we can continue to do so. I believe the same thing. However, I do disagree that we require a supermajority. 
The fact of the matter is, to project that far in advance--again, I said it earlier in a discussion, that we are working with estimates. We are looking at a particular point in time, the condition of our economy, the condition of the revenue stream that we get from, really, an ebullient marketplace and high tax collection. That has given us revenues that make the balanced budget a reality, to permit the tax cuts that have been established. Again, we each take a little bit of time for editorial comment to say--with which I disagree. I do agree with the portion that is devoted to the middle class and devoted to education. But it cannot be only my way. I regret that, but that is life and the reality. 
Mr. President, I hope we will be able to defeat this amendment. I think it does violate the agreement as we understand it. If we get to 2002--we have deliberately had the projections extend for 10 years, so we had some idea that we were not going to face a cataclysmic explosion with deficits or with tax cuts, frankly, in that period of time. I hope we will be able to defeat it. I do not see my colleague, the chairman of the Budget Committee here, but I assume he will agree with me and that he will discuss it at an appropriate moment, if we have time. 
Has the Senator yielded back all the time?

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment would require a supermajority, three-fifths of the Members in each House, to provide for specific excess of outlays of receipts or to provide for such increase in the level of public debt. 
What we are doing here is we will be reviewing the balanced budget amendment and voting for it here again. It does not fit in the scope of things. 
I have raised a point of order on this relative to germaneness. We should defeat this. I think this is a very dangerous precedent, for us to get involved with this kind of legislation in this budget resolution. 
I hope we will defeat it.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment talks to the years 2000-plus. We heard it from the Senator from Oklahoma. We are not balancing the budget for 10 years. We are balancing it for the first 5 years to 2002. We project off into the years subsequent to that. 
We believe that we will have the mechanism in place to control it. If not, we ought to take it up at that time. And this budget amendment creates a supermajority. So we are back to 60 votes in case you want to make a change at that time. 
I do not think we ought to be strapping ourselves now for something that is going to happen after 2002. I hope that we will defeat this amendment. I think that it is important that we do.

<TEXT>
Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I listened with interest to the discussion that was going on regarding the amendment that we are now considering. It is a surprise. I shouldn't say that. It is not a surprise. But there is an anomalous difference between where we were when we were talking about Hatch-Kennedy and the response from those who were opposed when they were talking about how inconsistent it was with what we had. 
We had an agreement. I use the term `hammered out' because 
`hammered out' seems like it was really tough. And it was tough to get this agreement. It took a lot of giving, it took a lot of review, and a lot of hard thinking to get the consensus that we arrived at. 
It was said that it is `inconsistent.' How can you do it after all the work that was done with the President and `we,' and Senator Domenici and `I,' and the people from the House, the chairman of the Budget Committee and the ranking member of the Budget Committee sitting there night after night for something like 6 weeks, long, long days? Finally we get this agreement. And there was shock almost, and people were horrified by the notion that Senators Hatch and Kennedy wanted to provide another $20 billion for children's health and tax tobacco and cigarettes to do it. The debate was I would say fairly long, fairly arduous at times, and fairly strong in terms of the exchange. 
But here we have now a proposal after we labored so hard to get nondefense discretionary up to a point that was acceptable. 
Once again I do not want to go through the whole litany of what the budget consensus constitutes--some give and take, and some got taken. But we are at this point now when suddenly we are talking about increasing the net tax cuts for the first 5 years from $85 billion to $161 billion by taking it out of nondefense discretionary. I hope that this wouldn't get a lot of consideration when it comes time to vote. 
I heard my good friend and distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee say that President Clinton isn't the kind of President under which you could do something like this, the thought or the inference being, `Well, this is too good. This is too positive.' 
Madam President, I am not an economist by profession, though my degree from Columbia is in economics. But I learned economics the hard way. I started one of America's great companies, modestly I say. And I started one of America's greatest industries, the computing industry. My name is in the hall of fame in Dallas, TX, for having been a member of information processing pioneers. So I learned it by doing it. I also learned it by reading. 
I remember the days of a very popular President, President Reagan. Under his leadership, about which people were so euphoric, the tax cut that was then introduced was in present terms something like $12.8 trillion. That was supposed to be evidence of how good the supply side would be and what eventually would trickle down into the economy which would stimulate things, and everybody would be kind of happy thereafter. 
But what we saw instead was the incredible growth in the debt in this society of ours with annual deficits just booming, and total debt skyrocketing. We are finally working our way out of it. And the reference is that this President wouldn't permit it. When this President took over the debt, the annual deficit was $290 billion. It is projected to be $67 billion, now the third projection by the Congressional Budget Office, that neutral body that is targeting their sights on what is accurate, and what is honest and what is fair. They have changed their mind three times in the last 6 or 7 months. 
People are working at more new jobs created than in almost any period I think--I will say almost in any period of history. Unemployment is at a historic low. Inflation is at a very stable rate. All signs are pretty darned good. 
We `hammer out' this agreement laboring all those hours, people getting angry at one another at times but finally agreeing. I shouldn't put the focus on `angry.' Once in a while tension would creep in. But essentially it was a debate or a negotiation conducted with the best of intentions. The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and I, it is fair to say, worked very well together, as did our colleagues from the House. We were determined to try to solve the problem and not get the temperature up too high. 
We are here now. After all of that, and after the discussion we had throughout the day today about the violation of the consistency of the budget agreement, and now we are looking at what I think is a gross violation--if one can term it a violation--about changing not only the nondefense discretionary but increasing the tax cutoff over which there was much labor. 
A lot of people on this side did not want to see a major tax cut. As a matter of fact, many of them didn't want to see any tax cut. But it was understood that in the context of an agreement you sometimes do things that you wouldn't otherwise do. If you are working alone you can do anything you want. If you own the company you can do anything you want. If you are the CEO you can do almost anything you want. But when you get here we have to depend on the good will and the good judgment of others in order to arrive at agreement. Thus, we are faced with what I think is a difficult but nevertheless honorable consensus that was arrived at. 
The notion that we might change it at this late hour, change it by taking away nondefense discretionary, which I frankly think is underfed in some ways. Defense discretionary in my view is overfed in some ways. I just hope that our colleagues when it is time to vote--and I hope that will be soon--will reflect on the inconsistency factor that was considered so delicate and so essential before to maintain consistency that we will maintain consistency here, and that this amendment will be defeated.

And I appreciate the misunderstanding of the Senator from Texas because there was some confusion. He was gracious about accepting these UC's, and I absolutely agree with that. 
I thought we were in the process of alternating sides. But I would ask the indulgence of the Senator from Illinois. 
Would the Senator from Illinois agree to having a vote on the Gramm amendment that is presently pending, and give us a chance to review the other one and consider it for 10 minutes, if that is OK. Then I would propound a unanimous-consent agreement to do just that, or do we just have an understanding to proceed that way?

<TEXT>
Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I find myself in a very difficult position. 
First, I commend the Senator from Illinois for her interest not only in school construction, the infrastructure for schools, but her view about investments in children, about what it is going to take to help our society stabilize, about what it is going to take to avoid criminality and violence that we see so freely around our country. She has been a leader on those issues for children. She is always discussing what it is that we have to do to make certain that children will grow up as contributing adults with a prospect for their own successes. 
It is consistent with her views on what we ought to be doing for the children in our country to be concerned about the schoolhouses they attend. 
Senator Moseley-Braun has made too many speeches, written so much about what the alternative to incarceration and prosecution is, and it is investment in our kids. If there is not a particularly identifying view of what we ought to be doing for our children than a bunch of broken down schoolhouses, then I would tell you there is nothing else. 
I am a member of the Budget Committee, the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee, and as I said, this is a painful point at which I find myself. We have a consensus budget resolution. It took a lot of work. I was surprised, I must say, when I saw the agreement in its final form because I was expecting that there would be some funds reserved for improvement of the school facilities around the country. I did not think at the time that the original $5 billion request was held, but I thought it might be somewhere in the vicinity of $3 billion, certainly not enough to make a dent when we consider that the GAO estimate, as the Senator from Illinois mentioned, is that there is $112 billion needed to bring our schools up to date. 
Now, I happen to come from a highly urbanized State, a State in which we have more than a fair share of poverty. 
Our cities, and we have many of them, are among the poorest in the country--Newark, Camden, Paterson, my birthplace, I think is the fifth poorest city in America. I visit my old hometown, if I can call it that, on a fairly regular basis. It is often said here that we do these things, but I happen to go to the same barbershop that I have been going to since I was in college--and that was some years ago--and the barber is still cutting. Even if he misses a few hairs here and there, I don't care, but it takes me back to the city of my birth. 
I have a lot of sentiment attached to that city because they were hard-working people, people who were determined to have their children succeed and invest whatever they could in terms of personal involvement in the development of those kids. School was the No. 1 thing. That was always the concern of the parents. 
I can tell you, I don't like to admit this publicly, but I was a truant one day, and it was just my luck my father found out. I was never truant again. I visited that school just last week because I was helping them establish the connections they needed to get ultimately into the Internet, the schools being wired. My old company paid for the wiring of the schools in Paterson where our company started because my partners, like I, came from poor working-class families. I remember what it was like living that way, not particularly enjoying anything but the memory of good family life. So we helped to get the schools wired in the city. 
When I was there, I was struck by the horrific condition of not that schoolhouse, not that school building in particular, but others in the city, with signs of almost war-type devastation, with broken windows and things of that nature. 
I am also, since I was very active on the environment committee, conscious about the hazards to the health of the children. Forget about the disruptions to learning, for the moment--asbestos, lead paint, things that you would not permit your children to be near, to fiddle with if you had any way around it. 
So when I think of the amendment proposed by the Senator from Illinois, I say, yes, it is difficult for me. I am going to support the amendment that the Senator is offering in hopes that we can find some way to finance it. The amendment, I understand, includes a source for the funding coming from where, may I ask, reduction of tax cuts?

Mr. LAUTENBERG. They are firetraps. They are insecure at a time when security is high in the consciousness list. So I hope a source can be found that doesn't violate the basic construction we put into this budget resolution. 
I commend the Senator from Illinois for her dedication, for her determination to bring this problem foursquare in front of us and try and solve it. 
The statistics are so terrible that if you look at them, they 
begin to lose their significance: 30 percent of the children not having adequate heating and ventilating; 24 percent--other schools without adequate plumbing. The list goes on. That is just the physical eyesore that is out there that you would expect to be something resembling a decaying factory and not a facility that is being used by youngsters who are trying, with the help of often inadequate supervision, to try and find some life for themselves that they can follow and get through. If you walk into a place that is a dump, it is not going to lift your spirits to start your day. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and just remind everybody that we now have other amendments in order and that this amendment will be voted upon. As I understand it, there is a UC that allots the remaining time for use in the morning.

Both of us and our staffs have worked cooperatively together to get this done, and we now arrive at the point before giving our formal statements where we are about to begin the debate that counts the most, going beyond the discussions we have had within the committee. 
I have had several requests for people who would like to make opening statements. I think I probably need 20 to 25 minutes on my own. I do not know how long the distinguished chairman of the committee is going to take for his statement, but I would think that an hour might be on the short side of things. 
So, Mr. President, I hope that we could give enough of our colleagues a chance to air their views. It is my fervent hope we will be able to conclude our business before the full 50 hours are used. I also hope that we can get this budget agreement passed. We have a historic opportunity to work together on something that I think the American people want to see, a bipartisan effort to reduce our annual deficit to zero. I think we accomplished that, and I hope the amendments will be those we can discuss honestly, having votes where required and move on with the business of the country.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first, I start by issuing the plea also that Senator Domenici, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, started with; that is, to our fellow Senators, get your amendments down here. Do not cause a jam up at the end when you may not be able to get the floor. You may not be able to have a full explanation of that which you are interested in. 
We want to move the process. This is no longer a time for delay and bickering among ourselves. We are obliged to move it because it is the right thing for America. 
First, let me say that I am pleased to join my colleague, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, in urging support for this budget resolution. 
For the past several weeks, Senator Domenici and I, along with representatives of the administration and the House Budget Committee, have been working long hours and arduously to reach a budget agreement. It has been a long, difficult and occasionally a painful process. But in the end I am pleased to say that we succeeded in our mission. 
Today, for the first time in many, many years, we will be considering a budget resolution that is truly bipartisan. This resolution, Mr. President, is historic. It will lead to the first balanced budget since 1969. It calls for the largest investment in education and training since the Johnson administration. It combines tough fiscal discipline with a strong commitment to Medicare, the environment, transportation, and other national priorities. 
Beyond its substance, Mr. President, I am hopeful that this agreement represents a turning point in contemporary American politics. For many years, Congress has been dominated by partisanship and immobilized by gridlock. This constant infighting has undermined our standing around the country. It has made it more difficult to solve our Nation's problems. And we all hope that a sense of comity that now seems to be here during these budget discussions will prevail here in Washington. This agreement marks a major step in that direction. 
The agreement shows Democrats and Republicans are ready to put aside partisan differences, rise above petty bickering, and make the hard decisions that our people across the country want us to do. That is what we are delivering. 
Mr. President, this agreement comes before us at a time when our economy is remarkably strong. Over the past 2 1/2 years the stock market has skyrocketed by more than 80 percent; unemployment is at its lowest point in 24 years; inflation is at the slowest pace in 31 years; new investment has soared at a 9 percent annual rate over the last 4 years, a welcome change from the performance over the preceding 8 years; and real wages have started to rise again after years of stagnation. 
The tremendous strength of our economy is a tribute to President Clinton and the Democratic Party. When President Clinton came into office, the budget deficit was $290 billion and it was expected to explode to more than $500 billion by 2002. Since then, just the contrary has happened. The deficit has been cut by 63 percent, falling 4 years in a row to $107 billion in 1996. This year, the deficit is estimated to be falling to $67 billion. 
This, Mr. President, is remarkable progress. We want to continue that progress, and this budget agreement will get it done. 
People tend to think of budgeting as a zero sum game in which one person's win is another's loss. But this budget agreement is a win-win-win all around. It is a win for our economy. It is a win for ordinary Americans who are working hard to raise their families and keep their heads above water. It is a win for the future of our country. 
Mr. President, both parties should be pleased with this bipartisan achievement. But I want to take a few minutes to explain why I think Democrats deserve to be especially proud. 
Throughout this process, we Democrats have insisted on an agreement that imposes real fiscal discipline that builds on President Clinton's tremendous success in reducing the deficit, and that balances the budget in a real, credible way. And the American people have won. 
Democrats have insisted that we make education a top national priority. We have demanded that middle-class families 
get tax relief to help pay for college, and that all Americans get assistance in affording further education and job training. And the American people have won. 
Democrats have insisted that Medicare be protected. We have demanded that the solvency of the Medicare trust fund be extended, that senior citizens not be asked to bear unfair burdens, that the quality of their health care not be put at risk, and that new preventative benefits be added. And the American people have won. 
Democrats have insisted on targeting tax relief to the middle class. We have demanded that when Congress cuts taxes, much of the relief must go to struggling families who need help the most. And the American people have won. 
Democrats have insisted that uninsured children be provided with health insurance. We have demanded that millions of kids get the health care they need and deserve. And the American people have won. 
Democrats have insisted on fairness for people who come into this country legally, who have obeyed the law, and paid their taxes and who then suffer from a disability. We have demanded the elimination of extreme laws that punish people because they get hit by a bus or lose their eyesight. And the American people have won. 
Democrats have insisted on maintaining our commitment to environmental protection. We have demanded more funding to clean up hazardous waste sites while resisting schemes to gut the Environmental Protection Agency. And the American people have won. 
Democrats have also insisted on investing in transportation. We have demanded that transportation be made a priority and that funding be increased substantially over the levels originally proposed earlier this year. And the American people have won. 
Mr. President, my point is not that Democrats are the sole winners here. That of course is not true. This is a fair and balanced agreement. The Republicans have won on many of their most cherished priorities. Some of those wins have been bitter pills for me and for many Democrats, but I say to my friends on this side of the aisle, the fact is that we do not control either Houses of the Congress. And we have to respect the will of the American people. So there is no way to solve our Nation's problems without compromise. 
It is the only way, and painful though it may be for some, it is the right thing to do. 
Mr. President, let me turn to some of the specifics in the budget agreement, some of which have been mentioned by the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, but I think are worthy of repetition. 
First, and perhaps most fundamentally, this agreement will balance the budget by the year 2002. Beginning next year, when the agreement first goes into effect, the deficit will decline every year until we reach balance. Balancing the budget will require real fiscal discipline. This agreement calls for $320 billion in savings over the next 5 years. More than half of those savings will come from entitlement programs and other mandatory spending. More than $75 billion will come out of the military budget. While important domestic priorities will be spared the meat cleaver, nondefense discretionary spending, which encompasses many of the programs that the people across the country are interested in, will be reduced in real terms by $61 billion, or about 4 percent. As I said, some pain comes. 
Will all of these savings really balance the budget? Mr. President, any budget projection must rely on economic assumptions. But the assumptions in this budget are on the conservative side. They are based on economic projections of the Congressional Budget Office which have proven to be far from reality for the past 4 years. They have missed the targets. They have overestimated some poor results. 
Consider that just a few months ago, CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, estimated this year's budget deficit would be $124 billion. That was only in January. In March, CBO, 2 months later, revised its estimate down to $115 billion from $124 billion. Now, in May, there are reports that the deficit could be as low as $67 billion. 
Think about that, Mr. President. We are talking about the current fiscal year which ends in less than 5 months, and in just that same length of time, the projected deficit has shrunk by 45 percent from $124 billion to $67 billion. 
At this rate, some have suggested the best way to balance the budget would be for Congress to sit down, keep quiet, and go home. Who knows, they may be right. If they are, this agreement will produce significant budget surpluses, a result unimaginable not long ago. 
My point, though, is simply that in using CBO's economic assumptions, we are using projections that have consistently proven to be too pessimistic. This budget does not rest on unrealistic rosy scenarios, as have past budget agreements, so it is very likely that we will actually reach balance or a surplus before the next 5 years is out if we can get this agreement enacted into law. 
Mr. President, this budget resolution establishes without question that both political parties are now firmly committed to fiscal discipline. For years, Republicans have run for office by accusing the Democrats of being tax-and-spend liberals, unconcerned about fiscal responsibility. This agreement puts these charges to rest once and for all. It is now clear that Democrats and Republicans are both committed to a balanced budget. We disagree only about the means to that end and how the burden of the deficit reduction will be distributed. 
Fortunately, this budget agreement is more than an accounting exercise. It will set our country on a firm course into the 21st century by empowering our people, by investing in them and ensuring they are ready to compete in the years and decades ahead. 
As I noted earlier, this agreement includes the largest investment in education and training since the administration of Lyndon Baines Johnson. The agreement moves us toward a day when every 8-year-old child can read, every 12-year-old child can log in on the Internet, and every 18-year-old can go to college. Those are the goals that President Clinton committed to when he addressed us earlier this year, and they are the right goals for America. 
Mr. President, I grew up the son of working-class immigrants, but was able, because of my service in World War II, to attend Columbia University, thanks to the GI bill. I want all Americans to have the same opportunities I had, because education is the key to prosperity and security and because, like I, not only will they learn important subjects, but maybe their horizons will be less limiting. My horizons were developed because I saw my parents standing behind the counter making sandwiches, washing dishes, working from 6 o'clock in the morning until 11 o'clock at night, typically, 7 days a week, just to grind out a living to take care of my sister and me. They could not give us much more than the comfort of interested parents, and goals to which they wanted us to aspire. That is the way it ought to be, Mr. President. 
The opportunity came along for me to have an education that never would have come my way. It changed my perspective totally, and enabled me, without being too immodest, to start a company that started an industry--the computing industry--that is today larger than the hardware industry. That is on the service side, software--everybody now is familiar with 
software--outsourcing services. The company has 29,000 employees. I am a member of something called the `Information Processing Hall of Fame,' all of that because I got a boost from my Government, from my fellow citizens, for something that I did. 
All Americans, no matter how rich or poor, should have access to that American dream. My parents never thought that I would have the opportunity to serve in the U.S. Senate, to be given the honor of serving the American people, but, again, it happened because a start was given to me at just the right time in my life. 
Toward that end, Mr. President, toward access to the American dream, this agreement includes the largest Pell grant increases in two decades. Four million students will receive a grant of up to $3,000 for higher education. These grants, we hope, will open the doors of opportunity and help lead our country in the next century. Our entire Nation will reap the reward. 
The agreement also will provide significant tax relief to those who want to attend college. It endorses the objectives of President Clinton's HOPE scholarship proposal, which would provide a $1,500 annual tax credit for higher education. This extra money would encourage millions of young people to go to college. 
The agreement also endorses the objectives of the President's proposal to give a $10,000 tax deduction to help cover education and job training costs for young people in the family. This proposal is critical to ensure that Americans are able to train and retrain themselves throughout their lives, not just upper level managers, but each and every American. 
There are several other education initiatives that are guaranteed by this agreement. For example, it guarantees funding for a child literacy initiative such as the President's America Reads proposal. This program would provide individualized after-school and summer help for more than 3 million children in kindergarten through the third grade. More than a million tutors would be involved. 
The budget agreement also will fund a technological literacy initiative. The President has proposed to connect every American classroom to the Internet and to ensure that all teachers are trained to work with this latest in technology. His proposal would help schools integrate the technology into their programs so that no American child is burdened with computer illiteracy. 
The budget agreement also calls for significant expansion of Head Start. This widely praised program has had tremendous success in preparing very young children for their education and for their futures. This agreement will help move us toward President Clinton's goal of increasing Head Start enrollments to 1 million children by the year 2002. 
Mr. President, the combination of increased Pell grants, the tuition tax credit, the education training deduction, the children literacy initiative, the technological literacy program, Head Start, and many other educational initiatives, make this agreement a truly historic commitment to education, and it is reason enough for Democrats and Republicans alike to support this agreement. 
I want to move on to some other important features of the budget resolution. It will ensure that up to 5 million uninsured children are provided with health coverage. The 
resolution includes $16 billion toward that end, and it will be up to the committees of responsibility to decide whether to use Medicaid expansion or a grant program to States or another approach, but the commitment and the resources are there to get the job done. In the end, that will mean that more children of working families will have health insurance. 
This budget agreement also will strengthen and modernize our Medicare Program. The agreement first would extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund for at least 10 years. Senator Domenici made mention of the fact that during that time we will have to look to the longer term problems often associated with Medicare while carrying on the wonderful, very positive benefits that have resulted. It makes positive structural reforms which will bring Medicare more into line with the private sector while preparing it for the baby-boom generation. 
The agreement extends the trust fund solvency in part by reforming payment systems for hospitals and doctors. In addition, it gives the seniors more choices. It increases the number of health plan options such as preferred provider organizations and provider-sponsored organizations. It also gives beneficiaries comparative information about their options such as now provided Federal employees of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. 
Additionally, the agreement provides funding for several very significant new preventive benefits. These include expanded mammography coverage, coverage for colorectal screening, coverage for diabetes self-examination, and vaccinations. Beyond investing in education and protecting and improving Medicare, this agreement will provide significant tax relief to millions of American families. 
In addition to the education tax cuts that I mentioned earlier, the agreement includes a $500-per-child tax credit. This will be of real assistance to many Americans who are working hard and struggling to make ends meet. The agreement also will allow the Finance Committee to cut capital gains and estate taxes, as well as expand IRA's and make other changes to the Tax Code. These changes will benefit many small businesses and farmers, goals which Republicans and Democrats strongly agree upon. 
However, there is real concern, Mr. President, among many Democrats that these tax breaks will go disproportionately to the wealthy and will explode the deficit in the long term. Frankly, I share those concerns. In a time of scarce resources, it seems wrong to be handing out huge tax breaks to people who do not need them. 
The bottom line is we would not have a budget agreement if Democrats were not willing to accept some of these tax breaks. This was the main win that the Republicans demanded. Though it is a bitter pill for some, in my view, it is a pill we have to swallow for the benefits of a balanced budget, education investment, health coverage for 5 million children, restoration of disability benefits for desperate legal immigrants, and other positive parts of this agreement. 
I do want to assure my colleagues, however, that the agreement includes significant constraints in the tax area that will help prevent a redo of the kind of economics that created the deficit problem in the first place. 
First, there are firm limits on the size of the tax cuts--the agreement states that the net tax cuts shall be $85 billion in the first 5 years, and no more than $250 billion through 2007. Second, Leader Lott and Speaker Gingrich have given their firm commitment--in writing--that tax cuts, and I quote `shall not cause costs to explode in the outyears.' 
For those who are not satisfied with that commitment, I would point out that President Clinton has made it clear that he will not tolerate a tax bill that imposes huge costs in the future. And while he has agreed to a significant capital gains and estate tax cut, he has not signed away his right to veto extreme legislation that violates our basic understanding. 
I also want to assure my colleagues that the size of the tax cuts in this agreement are very small compared to the enormous breaks that were approved in the early 1980's. The tax cut of 1981 cost $2.8 trillion over 10 years, in today's dollars. By contrast, this agreement would allow tax cuts of $250 billion--less than 10 percent of those that were proposed 17 years ago. 
Mr. President, Republicans may have won in their insistence on tax breaks for wealthier Americans, but they did abandon radical plans to completely gut domestic priorities, and undermine the basic functions of Government. Over the next 5 years, this agreement calls for $355 billion more in domestic discretionary spending than Newt Gingrich demanded in the infamous Contract With America. And it includes $189 billion more than in last year's Republican budget resolution. 
Mr. President, lest anyone has the impression that Government is going to be growing over the next 5 years because of these increases in some of the discretionary funds, it won't be. Nondefense discretionary spending will be cut from baseline by 4 percent overall, and by 10 percent in real terms in 2002. And when you consider that priority programs will be spared, the real cuts in other programs will be significant. 
Still, in nominal terms, available resources for basic Government functions will increase overall, if only modestly. And we will trim Government with a scalpel, not a meat axe cleaver. Under the circumstances, that's a major victory. 
Let me now move on to another part of the budget agreement, which deals with Medicaid. 
Mr. President, this agreement preserves the Medicaid Program in two major respects. First, it preserves the guarantee of health coverage for our Nation's most vulnerable citizens. Second, it rejects the administration's proposal to establish a per capita cap on Medicaid payments. I want to publicly thank my fellow negotiators for both of these decisions. 
I think it would have been a poor way to administer the Medicaid Program. We shouldn't be adopting a scheme that jeopardizes the quality of health care for millions of children, seniors, and other vulnerable Americans. 
At one point, I was in a distinct minority in the negotiating room in my opposition to the per capita cap, and I am very pleased that the proposal was rejected in the end. In my view, at a time when the growth in Medicaid spending has dropped dramatically, we should not be adopting risky schemes that could jeopardize the quality of health care for millions of children, seniors, and other vulnerable Americans. 
Mr. President, the agreement does include a cut in payments for hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of Medicaid and uninsured patients. I have real concerns about this. Clearly, some States have abused the program, and we should be able to find savings by reforming the program. But we must be very careful not to hurt children's hospitals and others who are very reliant on this funding. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Finance Committee to ensure that this does not happen. 
Mr. President, let me turn now to another important element of this agreement, the provisions that will roll back some of the more extreme provisions in last year's welfare reform bill. 
First, this agreement will restore Medicaid and disability benefits for many disabled legal immigrants. These are people who have come to this country legally, who have worked and paid their taxes, and who suffer from a serious disability. 
Mr. President, it is wrong to punish these people for getting hit by a bus, or losing their eyesight. Many of them are desperately poor to begin with. Now they may be confined to bed or a wheelchair, with nowhere to go and nobody to turn to. They can't work. And they need help to survive. Providing basic assistance is the right thing to do. 
This agreement also will provide relief to some individuals who would lose food stamps because they are unable to find work. This was another provision of the welfare reform bill that simply went too far. The agreement will permit States to exempt 15 percent of those who would lose benefits because of the law's very strict time limits, and would fund additional work slots for individuals subject to those limits. 
In addition, the agreement includes $3 billion to help people move from welfare to work, something that all of us want to see happen. 
Mr. President, let me now turn to an area of special interest to me, transportation. 
Mr. President, as most of my colleagues know, I believe strongly in the value of investing in transportation, because I'm convinced that it yields tremendous benefits for our people and our economy. For years, our Nation has underinvested in transportation. And we are paying the price for that--in deteriorating roads, in snarling traffic, and in crumbling bridges and deteriorating rail systems. 
Mr. President, when you compare transportation to other functions within the Government, this agreement treats transportation relatively well. I pushed hard in the negotiations for additional resources, and we were able to find over $8 billion more than the President's request over the next 5 years. That was a major increase from where we began. 
Is it enough? No, it's not. But the bottom line is that there just aren't enough resources to balance the budget while doing everything we'd like. Compared with most parts of the Government, transportation does very well in this budget. And I'm hopeful we can identify even more resources as the legislative process moves forward. 
Let me turn briefly to another area of particular interest to me, the environment. This budget agreement confirms that the environment is a priority. It commits the congressional leadership to fully fund environmental protection and natural resources. And it specifically protects the President's funding requests for operations of the EPA and the National Park Service's operation of the National Park System and the Everglades. In addition, the agreement reserves funds for cleaning up hazardous waste sites, assuming we can reach an agreement on policy issues concerning Superfund, which I expect will happen. Finally, the agreement provides an additional $700 million for priority land acqusitiions and exchanges. 
Mr. President, before I close, let me once again say how much a privilege it has been for me to work with the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici. We have spent many, many hours together over the past several weeks. And the more I have gotten to know him, the more I have come to respect and like him. He is an honorable man who genuinely cares about our country, even if we often disagree. And he is a strong negotiator. 
I also want to take this opportunity to publicly thank the other negotiators who have worked so hard to make this agreement a reality. First, Congressmen John Kasich and John Spratt, men of totally different styles who share a common commitment to hard work and serious policymaking. And Frank Raines, John Hilley, and Gene Sperling of the administration, all of whom did a tremendous job in pulling this agreement together. The President has put together a very impressive team. 
I also want to acknowledge the many contributions of Democratic Senators on the Budget Committee who have worked with us on this agreement. 
Senators Hollings, Conrad, Feingold and Johnson have all been vocal and effective advocates for truth in budgeting, and for a plan that makes real progress in addressing our long-term deficit problems. They have held our feet to the fire, and deserve real credit for that. 
Senator Sarbanes has taken the lead to ensure that the burdens of deficit reduction are distributed fairly. I know he still has some concerns about the resolution, but I want to thank him for his input as the process has moved forward. 
Senators Boxer and Murray have been outspoken advocates for our children. They have demanded that we do a better job of covering our uninsured young people, and that we not make dangerous changes in the Medicaid Program that could jeopardize health care for our Nation's most vulnerable citizens. Their efforts will touch the lives of millions of Americans. 
Senator Wyden has been unrelenting in his demand that we modernize Medicare, that we provide additional health care choices for senior citizens, and that we protect the long-term solvency of the Medicare trust fund. No Senator has been more devoted to the future of this critical program, or more determined to make it work. 
Last but not least, Senator Durbin has in many ways been the conscience of our efforts in recent weeks. He has demanded that ordinary Americans, especially those with modest incomes, be treated fairly as we reduce the deficit. And he has helped lead the fight to restore critically needed protections for legal immigrants and children. 
Mr. President, I know that many of my fellow Democrats have been frustrated with the process that led to this agreement. And I share that frustration. This was not the process that I wanted. But we have done our best under the circumstances to maximize consultation with committee members, and with all Senate Democrats. And I am optimistic that, in the end, most of my colleagues will be pleased with the end product. 
Finally, I want to congratulate President Clinton for his leadership in this effort. We are here today on a bipartisan basis only because the President decided to make it happen. He deserves enormous credit for that. And I think his commitment will be appreciated and acknowledged for many years to come. 
Mr. President, let me close this way. I don't think there's anyone who is entirely happy with this agreement. But while nobody sees it as perfect , everyone should see it as a good compromise. It's fair and it's balanced. And it will serve America well. 
It will balance the budget. It will invest in education and training. It will provide tax relief to the middle class. It will protect Medicare and Medicaid. It will provide health care coverage to millions of children. It will throw a life vest to disabled legal immigrants. It will invest in transportation, and in environmental protection. And it will make life better for millions of ordinary, working Americans. 
I close, Mr. President, with saying my thanks and appreciation to my staff who worked so hard on the Budget Committee--Bruce King, Sander Lurie, and Sue Nelson--and all of the members of the staff of the Budget Committee for their effort. We all did what we thought was right for America. I am proud to have been a part of it. 
I yield the floor.

I have also been a supporter of those programs that protect America's children to try to help them develop into functioning citizens. 
But we do have an agreement that was hammered out, if I can use the expression, in great pain with a great pain in many cases over many weeks of hard work. 
I just make the point that I commend the Senator for his interest, his continuing interest in the well-being of our children in the country, and that I again acknowledge regretfully that in my position here I am going to be opposing the amendment.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, now that that is resolved, this amendment would force a cut in discretionary programs, if I read the amendment correctly, if projected revenues fall. That means that we would be putting national security at risk as well, because we would be taking it from defense as well as from discretionary accounts. That hardly seems the way, in my view, that the country ought to be doing business. 
There may be circumstances that we cannot possibly imagine at this juncture, and apart from the basic rule of saying, look, this falls outside the understanding that, again, was negotiated at length, this means that if the economy falters, critical programs, in addition to defense, would be cut. It might be a time when, if things suddenly start turning tough, you might want to make other decisions. This would tie our hands and not enable us to consider these things as expected, and there are many other conditions that might be considered. 
Would the Senator from Colorado suggest, if revenues fall short, that taxes ought to be increased? I hardly think so. I will not bother the Senator for a response to that; I will answer for him, taking that liberty. I just want to make the point that an agreement has, again, been negotiated, considering all prospects--revenues, expenditures, firewalls, protection of defense, development of discretionary accounts--again, through long, arduous discussions. While I think there are probably a number of people who would like to change the agreement, the fact is this represents a consensus point of view, and we are going to oppose the Senator's amendment and hope that the manager will agree with us that the amendment is going to be opposed. I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I know that the manager, the chairman of the Budget Committee, wants to say something. I would like to make a quick comment, if I might. 
Few have the knowledge of the budget that the distinguished Senator from South Carolina has. He understands it thoroughly, and he has been a consistent purveyor of the alarm to be aware and to make sure that we do the right thing. 
It would be an ideal situation if we had the trust funds off budget, if we could deal with that in a quick moment like this. But the reality is that we just can't do it, Mr. President. We have hammered out a budget. I used the term before. `Hammer' suggests the arduous effort that the budget agreement took to get 5 million children covered under health care, to make sure that impoverished seniors aren't further burdened by additional premiums because we have moved the home health care from part A to part B. 
There are a whole series of things. There are tax cuts for the middle class. There are tax cuts for education. This bill was 
put together with a lot of work and a lot of giving by many people, people who do not like every part of this budget. I am one of them, I must tell you, but I am determined that we see that we pass this budget. 
I say to the Senator from South Carolina, a dear friend to many of us here, that we ought to take a couple of these issues and work on them. 
I agree with him on the trust funds on Social Security. I really do. I think we ought to take the time now--because we will be dealing with a more solvent situation in several of the trust funds--to deal with that. But it is not going to happen, I say here and now. 
I will, unfortunately, be forced to vote against what the distinguished Senator from South Carolina is proposing. I intend to do just that, to vote against it.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today the Environmental Protection Agency is making public its annual inventory of toxic chemical releases. This information is made available to the public under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act which I authored in 1986. 
EPA announced today a 45.6 percent decrease nationwide in the release of toxic chemicals since 1988, when these data were first collected. In my State of New Jersey, which has a large chemical industry, releases were reduced by a stunning 70 percent. 
Mr. President, the right-to-know law has been an enormous success. Shedding the light of day on toxic pollution has encouraged industries to find ways to reduce the threat of these cancer causing materials to our communities. We should build on that success. 
Today I am introducing with Senators Torricelli, Boxer, Kerry, Graham, Kennedy and Wellstone the Right-to-Know More and Pollution Prevention Act of 1997, which will significantly expand the public's right-to-know about toxic chemicals in their homes, workplaces, and communities. 
The landmark 1986 Right-to-Know Act requires companies to list the amount of certain chemicals that leave their facilities as pollution and enter our air, water, or soil. It has often been cited as one of the most effective environmental laws on the books. By shining a public spotlight on pollution, the public is better informed, and many companies have taken voluntary steps to reduce pollution. 
In fact, without using traditional `command and control requirements,' the publication of right-to-know data has led companies to voluntarily reduce their releases of toxic chemicals by almost 46 percent, or 1.6 billion pounds, between 1988 and 1994. 
The bill I am introducing today significantly expands the community right-to-know reporting requirements by tracking toxic materials as they move through a facility--to tell us what comes in, what is transformed into product or waste, and what leaves a facility as pollution. This tracking system, known as chemical use or materials accounting, can further decrease the use of toxic chemicals and their release into the environment. 
When my own State of New Jersey began collecting information on toxic chemicals used by industries, in addition to recording toxic chemical releases, the results were dramatic. Whereas the national decrease in toxic emissions reported is 45.6 percent since 1988, in New Jersey it has been 70 percent. The discrepancy between New Jersey and the rest of the country, I believe, is due to the State requirement for materials accounting. 
The reason that materials accounting data is so valuable is that it provides information to industry and incentives to prevent pollution. With this data, industrial facilities have the information necessary to develop pollution prevention plans. 
Pollution prevention is the highest priority in managing waste, and falls at the top of the ladder of steps industry can take to reduce pollution--starting with prevention, then recycling, and then treatment, with disposal or release into the environment the least desirable last step. This so-called hierarchy of waste management has been endorsed by the Environmental Protection Agency as well as many Fortune 500 companies and the armed services. 
Materials accounting makes pollution prevention planning possible. You can't reduce toxic use if you don't know the quantity of toxics used and how they're used. That's why materials accounting data is so important. The bill requires companies which collect materials accounting data to prepare pollution prevention plans to decrease their use of toxics to protect those who might be exposed to them and can help companies improve their bottom line. It represents a strong marriage between environmental concerns and economic efficiency. 
A recent New Jersey study found that for every dollar spent on additional reporting, companies actually saved between five and eight dollars in reduced costs. By reducing waste, companies reduce their cost of doing business. 
Mr. President, materials accounting provides a framework for identifying opportunities to reduce pollution at the source through changes in production, operation and raw materials use. A random survey of 42 New Jersey facilities showed that 62 percent of the companies questioned anticipated that pollution prevention initiatives, based on information gleaned from materials accounting data, could save them money. Business wins, the public wins, and the public health and environment wins. 
Mr. President, my bill directs the EPA to expand right-to-know reporting to include information on toxic chemicals being transported through communities and used by industries in their products and workplaces. 
It would fill reporting gaps in the existing law by requiring all companies that have more than the stipulated threshold amounts to file reports, regardless of the industrial classification in which they fall. EPA could exempt categories of industry groups if the benefits and paperwork requirements are disproportionate to any benefit. 
Finally, the bill requires businesses to prepare pollution prevention plans based on the materials accounting data they collect. 
Mr. President, EPA has proposed requiring materials accounting data under existing authorities of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Law [EPCRA] and other statutes. 
I believe the law gives them that authority. However, some industry groups have challenged literally every action by the office that implements the Right-to-Know Law. To avoid continuing court fights and avoid needless delays, this law would clarify congressional intent. 
Mr. President, this bill will help ensure a healthier environment for all of us, and can save industry money, making our economy and chemical industry more cost competitive. It makes good environmental sense and good business sense. And it's legislation that the public wants. I hope we will move to enact it in this Congress.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Arlen Specter, in supporting the Mass Transit Amendments Act of 1997. This bill is a bipartisan effort to support investment in our Nation's mass transit systems and industry. But more important, this bill will ensure that a critical part our Nation's transportation infrastructure--transit--will receive adequate investments into the 21st century. A healthy transit system will go a long way toward reducing congestion and increasing mobility even when vehicle miles traveled is increasing. 
Good public transit increases the efficiency of existing roadways, especially in congested regions where many people live. Transit is essential to rural, suburban, and urban residents, it is a cost-effective solution to healthcare access, a key to successful welfare reform, and an environmentally sensible way to meet the commuting needs. It is an increasingly important service for the elderly, for persons with disabilities, for students, and for those who cannot afford a car. 
Mr. President, anybody who questions the necessity for transit services only has to visit my home State of New Jersey. The most densely populated State in the Nation, it also has the most vehicle density on its roads. Located between two heavily populated metropolitan areas, New Jersey is known as the Corridor State. Over 60 billion vehicle miles are traveled on New Jersey's roads annually. The ability of trucks and cars to move freely on New Jersey's roads directly affects New Jersey's economy--congestion has dramatic effects on the economy. 
New Jersey is also a commuter State. Millions of New Jerseyans face serious commuter problems every day. In many areas in New Jersey, there is nowhere else to lay new roads. We simply cannot build ourselves out of congestion. That's why New Jersey is heavily reliant on mass transit. The Midtown Direct, an Urban core project, was inaugurated 1 year ago. Within weeks, the ridership doubled in its projections. Transit in New Jersey is well used and well supported. 
Nationally, transit has also proven to reduce congestion, and transit saves dollars. A 1996 report conducted by the Federal Transit Administration found that the annual economic loss to U.S. business caused by traffic congestion is $40 billion, and the additional annual economic loss if all U.S. transit commuters drove instead would be $15 billion. 
It's also good for the environment. According to the FTA, transit use saves 1.5 billion gallons of U.S. auto fuel consumption every year. Transit is energy efficient, and the less gasoline used, the less the United States is dependent on foreign oil. 
Mr. President, Americans also see direct public health benefits from transit use. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, up to 110 million Americans breathe air that is unhealthful. The American Lung Association estimates the national health care bill for air pollution-related illness is $40 billion a year. Transportation sources cause 40-60 percent of pollution that produces ozone, and 70-80 percent of carbon monoxide emissions. Nearly one-third of carbon dioxide--the most significant greenhouse gas--comes from transportation sources. The fastest growing source of carbon dioxide emissions is the transportation sector. 
Mr. President, transit produces real environmental benefits. On average, riding transit instead of driving cuts hydrocarbon emissions that produce smog by 90 percent and carbon monoxide by more than 75 percent. One person using mass transit for a year instead of driving to work saves our environment 9 pounds of hydrocarbons, 62 pounds of carbon monoxide and 5 pounds of nitrogen oxides. 
It doesn't stop there. Over the past 30 years, the U.S. transit industry and its riders have prevented the emission of 1.6 million tons of hydrocarbons, 10 million tons of carbon monoxide, and 275,000 tons of nitrogen oxides into the air; the importation of 20 billion gallons of gasoline; and the construction and maintenance of 20,000 lane-miles of freeways and arterial roads and 5 million parking spaces to meet demands, saving at least $220 billion. 
Transit is an important part of our Nation's transportation system, and we ought to ensure that it is afforded the same priority as other modes of transportation. 
Mr. President, this bill does just that. It increases the authorization level for transit programs to provide $34.4 billion over 5 years. It increases discretionary capital grants and formula capital grants. It preserves operating assistance within formula programs for all areas and it continues funding for transit planning and research. It also makes a number of technical changes in the program to ensure better flexibility and streamlining, allowing transit managers to administer the program more effectively. 
Mr. President, this bill does a few more things. It includes a provision which shifts the 4.3 cents of gas taxes per gallon currently allocated to deficit reduction, into transportation trust funds. One-half cent of the 4.3 cents is allocated into a new intercity passenger rail trust fund to fund Amtrak capital expenses; the rest--the 3.8 cents--is divided along the traditional 80 percent/20 percent split of highways/mass transit, respectively. Thus, 3.04 cents will go into the highway account of the highway trust fund, and 0.76 cents will go into the mass transit account of the highway trust fund. This is the fair, equitable way to divide any new trust fund revenue that would be allocated for transportation. 
However, Mr. President, until a mechanism is provided to actually permit the expenditure of that additional funding, we will not see the investment we seek. Instead, the trust fund balances will only grow. As party to the budget negotiations just completed, I know as well as any Senator how hard it will be to make the necessary investments as we move to a balanced budget by 2002. However, I think it is important to lay out this principle and do our best to work toward it. 
Mr. President, unfortunately, the balanced budget agreement reached last week will make it difficult to fund mass transit at the levels provided in this bill. As ranking Democratic member of the Budget Committee, I fought hard to ensure that we will be making an adequate investment within the context of the balanced budget agreement. I must say, it will be difficult to fund transportation at the levels I support over the next few years. However, as ranking Democratic member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I will work to ensure continued, adequate funding over these years. 
Mr. President, the Mass Transit Act Amendments of 1997 represent what I believe, and what transit advocates believe, is necessary to provide for transit's growing needs into the 21st century. As Congress considers funding for transportation, I look forward to discussing ways that transit, and other modes of transportation, can benefit. 
Mr. President, this bill also includes a Reverse Commute Pilot Program which intends to assist individuals in both urban and rural areas receive employment and job training. This annual $250 million discretionary program reflects the growing needs of the work force, particularly those in urban and rural areas who do not have access to suburban jobs. A 1996 report conducted by the Eno Transportation Foundation, `Commuting in America II,' found that `today, the dominant commuting flow pattern is suburban, with 50% of the Nation's commuters living in the suburbs and over 41% of all jobs located there, up from 37% in 1980.' Suburban areas are now the main destination of work trips. The report also found that there was a substantial increase in reverse commuting--the central city-to-suburb commuting rose from a 9-percent share of growth over the decade from 1970 to 1980, to 12 percent from 1980 to 1990. 
Mr. President, reinvesting in our cities is important. However, if jobs are in the suburbs, we should provide mechanisms for employers, local and State employment and transportation agencies to assist those potential employees to simply get to where the work is. 
For those of us who are concerned about the effects of the Welfare Reform Act signed into law last year, we need to do all we can to ensure that the unemployed can move from welfare to work quickly and easily. The Reverse Commute Pilot Program makes sense. 
Mr. President, we all know that the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act--ISTEA--will expire on September 30. That law was far-reaching and visionary. It recognized that good transportation policy does not mean simply pouring more concrete and asphalt. Instead, it focused on moving goods and people--in a way that makes the most sense for our Nation, our States, our communities, and our economy. Its very title acknowledged a simple, yet important, aspect of transportation which had been previously overlooked--intermodalism. During this year's debate over reauthorization of ISTEA, it is imperative that we continue this tradition of intermodalism. We must continue the strong investments in transit and the flexibility provided in the first ISTEA. 
Mr. President, this bill continues that tradition. I support it and I urge my colleagues to join me in doing so.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to honor Dr. Allan Strand, who is retiring after 18 years of distinguished service as headmaster of Newark Academy in New Jersey. 
During his tenure, Dr. Strand's scholarship and leadership set a magnificent example for his students, including two of my own children. Although all four of my children received an outstanding education at Newark Academy, my two youngest had the added good fortune of attending while Dr. Strand was headmaster. He was an educator, mentor, and friend. 
Mr. President, I know that my children benefited from Dr. Strand's vision, integrity, energy, and academic excellence. But more than that, the entire Newark Academy community benefited from his presence. His list of accomplishments while headmaster is impressive. 
During his tenure, the academy's educational mission was affirmed. The traditional college preparatory course was continued, but the program was enhanced by bold developments in computer science and the arts. Dr. Strand also worked to revitalize the board of trustees and to strengthen an already superb faculty. Committed to the principles of respect and integrity, he introduced the Honor Code and Honor Council. Even the physical plant was not neglected; it was so expanded that only the front foyer remains unchanged. The McGraw Arts Center was added to accommodate the burgeoning arts program, and the Morris Interactive Learning Center brought the latest in technology to the school's instructional program. 
But through all the changes, one thing remained unchanged, Dr. Strand's commitment to his students and their education. It has been said that the only lasting legacy that any of us can have is to make a difference in the life of a child. If that is true, than Dr. Strand's legacy is definitely assured. 
Mr. President, when Thomas Jefferson presented his credentials as United States minister to France, the French premier remarked, `I see that you have come to replace Benjamin Franklin.' Jefferson corrected him. `No one can replace Dr. Franklin. I am only succeeding him.' In much the same way, Allan Strand is also irreplaceable. Others may fill his position at Newark Academy, but no one will ever be able to fill his shoes.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to mark one of those rare discoveries which not only make history, but actually change history. On December 16, 1947, three Bell Laboratories scientists, Nobel Prize winners John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley, working in Murray Hill, NJ, successfully operated the world's first transistor. The transistor allows the flow of electrons through solid materials to be controlled without requiring any moving parts. 
Mr. President, I'm not a scientist, so I don't completely understand the technology that makes this tiny device work. But I do understand that, without it, an amazing array of products which have revolutionized our lives could simply not work. In fact, the transistor's impact on microelectronics, computers, telecommunications, and so much more reminds me of the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, `The creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn.' And the forests of products which have sprung from the transistor is indeed dazzling. 
Mr. President, not only is the transistor practically ubiquitous in our society, there is neither an individual nor an industry that has not benefited from this device. It has helped us advance the study of biology and medicine, permitting us to understand and heal the human body in ways that our ancestors could never even have imagined. It has altered our sense of community by permitting us to negate the effects of both time and distance through the development of worldwide communication networks. By doing so, the transistor changed the way we learn by instantly placing knowledge at our fingertips. And it has allowed us to explore the depths of the ocean, walk on the moon, and chart the solar system and the invisible domains of the universe. Obviously, the transistor not only revolutionized our lives, it has helped to lengthen our lives, enrich our lives, and provide our lives with greater meaning. 
Mr. President, the tradition and tenacity of Bell Laboratories lives on in its linear descendent, Lucent Technologies. The men and women of Lucent continue to make innovative communications products using solid state technologies that are an outgrowth of the transistor's development. I salute their work, and as the direct heirs of Bell Laboratories, I congratulate them on the 50th anniversary of the transistor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Warner amendment. While I have great respect for the author of the amendment, frankly, I find this amendment to be a rather stunning proposition. If this amendment passes, a majority of the States--yes, a majority of the States--will find that their highway formula funds have been cut below the 1996 levels, even though we have added $1.4 billion to the program over the 1996 level. 
Mr. President, as the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee and on the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I have heard lots of my colleagues call for increased infrastructure funding--increased funding for their States' highway needs to replace deficient bridges or to ease the choking congestion that plagues their cities. And I think when the Members ask that they know this Senator will support increases in infrastructure funding as he always has. 
So I was pleased to work with Senators Stevens and Shelby to provide more than $993 million in increased highway funding in this bill. These funds are sorely needed in every State of the Union. So I think it would be a terrible way to proceed for us to amend this bill in a way to require a majority of States to endure cuts below the 1996 level. 
Let me emphasize one basic fact. Under the underlying bill as approved by the Appropriations Committee, 27 States will see the exact same amount of Federal funds for highways this year that they received in 1996. The entire $1.4 billion increase provided between the regular Transportation Appropriations bill and this supplemental bill will go to 23 States. If we adopt the Warner amendment, these 27 States will endure cuts below the 1996 level while the other 23 States get even larger increases above the 1996 level. 
I want to talk about the basic premise that underlies these recommendations by our friend from Virginia.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would be happy to give the Senator a list when I am finished speaking. 
I would appreciate it if the Senator--I will provide the Senator with a list the moment I am finished speaking. 
This debate is very illustrative of what will be at stake later this year. Senators should be aware that when we guarantee a certain percentage return of gas tax receipts in the law, the need to honor these guarantees will come from other States. If there is one pot and it goes to a group of States, it means the others are left out. 
Mr. President, this formula for distribution of highway funds in this supplemental appropriations bill was not developed willy-nilly. Frankly, this is, I think, the preamble to what we are going to be talking about later in the session. And I would 
say this, that my State, which sends down so much money that we are 49th on the list of return of the Federal dollar, will not stand by idly while we debate those things that advantage some and disadvantage others. This formula for the supplemental was constructed as an attempt to honor the obligations that these States incur as a result of the incredible traffic that goes through them. 
No State has more highway mileage consumed--more highway congestion--than the State of New Jersey, not because all of us have cars and lots of room to drive--we do not--but we are a corridor State and the highways that take people north and south go through our State, and a lot of the highways that go east and west go through our State because they terminate in the New York or Northeast region. 
Mr. President, we get 63 cents back on the Federal tax dollar now, so while I understand the posture of donor States, I am not sympathetic. It would be as if I demanded that New Jersey get 90 percent of all agricultural funds disbursed or defense contractor funds disbursed or food stamps disbursed regardless of need. That is not what a national government is about. We are a nation, not a collection of States. 
I would like to take a minute to explain the three components of the make up the $933 million contained in this bill. First, the bill includes $318 million in funding requested by the President that will go solely to the donor States. This funding is not called for under ISTEA. This funding would be granted to only those States that lost funding last year when the DOT corrected an error in the calculation of gas tax receipts. Second, there is $139 million included in the bill that was championed by Senator Shelby. This funding will go only to 10 donor States. It is intended to grant these States the amount of funding they would have received in 1996 had the tax receipt error been corrected in that year. Finally, there is $475 million included in the bill--hold harmless money--for the purpose of ensuring that no State receives less highway funding in fiscal year 1997 than it received in fiscal year 1996. 
Mr. President, the Warner amendment strips the hold harmless funding in the bill and distributes it in a manner that will result in a majority of States actually experiencing a cut in their highway funding below the current year's levels. In combination with earlier appropriations, Senator Warner would provide a $1.8 billion increase to donor States in 1997. He would cut $400 million in funds from 29 States--almost three/fifths of the Nation--to do it. 
Now, Mr. President, I was dissatisfied with the distribution of funding in the committee bill, but at least there was an element of fairness to it. In developing this bill, it was important to me that highway funding increases were structured in a balanced way. But, I want to make sure all Senators from the 27 donee States understand that while the funds in this bill and regular appropriations add a total of $1.4 billion to the highway program this year, this entire increase goes to 23 States, while the 27 donee States are held harmless, so to speak. We are level funded. We do not see a penny in 1997 above what we got in 1996.

<TEXT>
Mr. LAUTENBERG. Now Senator Warner comes along and argues that is not enough. He not only wants the donor States to get the $457 million provided to them in this bill. He wants them to get an additional $400 million beyond that--taken away from the donee States. He wants to cut highway funds for 27 States below last year's level. 
Members might appropriately ask `how is it that the highway program is growing, but my State is getting cut?' The answer lies in a provision of the Highway bill that was established 6 years ago. That bill included many different formula calculations, but one of them--the so-called 90 percent of payments calculation--requires that donor states receive back at least 90 percent of the gas tax receipts they contribute to the highway trust fund. 
Mr. President, that kind of entitlement to donor States inevitably will mean a decrease to other States when gas tax receipts are increasing at a rapid rate. That is true because they will rise at a rate faster than highway spending. So, if donor States are guaranteed a 90 percent return on the gas tax dollar, they will be taking that money from the rest of us. It's a zero sum game. 
This is exactly what has happened this year. As a result, when the Appropriations Committee increased the highway program roughly half a billion dollars last year, the so-called donor States, not only absorbed every penny of that $500 million increase, they also took a billion dollars away from the other States in order to pay for it. In this fiscal year, that provision had the effect of siphoning off $1.5 billion in funding from 27 States and transferring it to 23 donee States. 
I hope Senators and their staff are listening to this debate, because I doubt very much that a majority of my colleagues--54 Senators from 27 States--are fully aware of the fact that funding for the Federal highway program is growing but that funding for their State are being cut. And I can tell all my colleagues, as a Senator who has carefully monitored the highway program for more than 14 years, it is unprecedented for us to have a situation where States, much less a majority of States, endure substantial cuts while overall highway spending is increasing. 
I can also tell my colleagues, as a very active conferee on the original ISTEA legislation, that no one envisioned a situation where States would take significant cuts in a given year, even while the appropriation increased. 
Mr. President, it is ridiculous to suggest that ISTEA envisioned a scenario whereby 23 States would absorb every additional penny added to this program in 1997. But it's even more outrageous to suggest, as the Warner amendment does, that a majority of States should have their transportation funding cut to increase spending for a minority of the States. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Stevens' forthcoming motion to table the Warner amendment and ask my colleagues to join us in defeating the amendment of the Senator from Virgina. 
This debate is very illustrative of what will be at stake later this year. Senators should be aware that when we guarantee a certain percentage return of gas tax receipts in the law, the funding needed to honor those guarantees will come from the rest of the States. Mr. President, in a way, the Warner amendment is a wakeup call for the majority of Senators. We should not adopt a highway bill that incorporates such guarantees in the law. 
No other Federal program works that way. My State of New Jersey receives the second lowest return on the Federal dollar of every other State but Connecticut. We get 63 cents back on the Federal tax dollar. So, while I understand the posture of donee States, I am not particularly sympathetic. It would be as if I demanded that New Jersey get 90 percent of all agricultural funds disbursed, or defense contractor funds disbursed or food stamps disbursed, regardless of need. 
Mr. President, that is not what a national government is about. We are a nation, not a collection of States. National programs are designed to meet national goals. That's how benefits go out under Medicaid, housing programs, for agricultural subsidies, and the like. As the second most affluent State in the country, which sends a huge surplus of tax dollars to Washington, New Jersey would be blessed indeed if we were guaranteed a 90 percent return on the Federal dollar. So, Mr. President, I can't agree with donor State Senators unless they are willing to step back and look at the picture across the board.   
I hope Members will think about what it means when it is proposed we guarantee each State a percentage of what it contributes to a national program. I have never come to the Senate Chamber and offered amendments to guarantee my State taxpayers 90 percent of what they contribute toward the Department of Defense. While the Department of Defense serves to protect us all, the Department of Defense has not chosen to have a very large presence in the State of New Jersey. 
I have not come to the floor and asked that my taxpayers in New Jersey be guaranteed 90 percent return on their contributions to agricultural price supports, or 90 percent return on what they contribute toward the maintenance of freshwater fisheries, or 90 percent return on what they contribute toward the maintenance of our national parks, or 90 percent return of what they contribute toward massive water projects in the West. 
All of these programs reflect national needs. They cannot be subjected to a formula based on tax contributions. 
As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I look forward to participating actively in the development of ISTEA 2, including its highway component. I know that my friend from Virginia, the sponsor of this amendment, and the chairman of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee, will be active in developing it as well. I want to work with Senator Warner to develop a bill that will meet our Nation's transportation needs and be equitable to all States. But, I must say to the Senator from Virginia that I will not be able to endorse an approach that dictates that a majority of States--including my own--will lose highway funding, even as appropriations increase, in order to increase funding for a minority of States, regardless of their needs. 
I believe that will be the position of the majority of Senators, whom I hope have been listening to this debate and will look closely at the table I have here at the podium before they cast their vote. I urge them to take a look at that table and then vote to table the Warner amendment. 
Mr. President, I will conclude by saying that if we are going to start examining formulas, we are going to revise all of the formulas that disburse money or send money back to States. 
I thank the Chair very much.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee for making sure we have a chance at a full debate on this issue. 
I am strongly opposed to this so-called automatic CR, and, if I may say, barring none others from competing, when it comes to understanding the rules and understanding the process, there is no better informed Senator than the senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, who is the ranking member of this Appropriations Committee, and his leadership tells us that we better look out, that we better know what we are talking about. 
I am deeply dismayed that we are debating this provision just a few days after we reached an agreement on the outlines of a 5-year balanced budget. Mr. President, I am the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee and, as such, have been relegated a relatively awesome task of trying to find a consensus that would enable us to get the Government going, to keep us from getting into these disputes year after year, 
but have an honest debate and a review, a determination of the importance of the issues. 
We worked very hard over the last few months to try and get the outlines of a balanced budget. We are not there yet, but I think we have all of the ingredients to finally say yes. We did agree last Friday that we have the makings of a budget resolution for the next 5 years. It would bring us to a zero deficit balance and take care of the programs, as best we could, that we care about. 
The automatic CR, on the other hand, could force deep cuts in education, environment, health, research, and crime fighting and contradict the agreement that we just arrived at. 
Mr. President, I consider it an abandonment of our constitutional responsibility. It is so nice to take your fingerprints off the deal that you may not like. It is so nice to back away and say, we are going to do it automatically. That is not why people sent us here, not to do it automatically but to put our reputations on the line, to put our thoughts on the line, and let us work out what we think is the proper direction for the funding in our Government. 
I worked with distinguished counterparts in this budget decision--Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee; Congressman Kasich, the chairman of the House Budget Committee; Congressman Spratt, the ranking Democrat in the Budget Committee; and the administration officials at length to negotiate a budget agreement. 
We had lots of policy differences. But we worked through them in good faith. And we worked through them without producing such a hostile environment that we could not talk to one another, because it was carefully thought out. It was balanced with everybody's views and concerns. But part of this agreement includes a level of discretionary spending for fiscal year 1998, and for the following 4 years. 
It is not easy to reach agreement on these matters, but we did despite all of the hard work to reach a compromise on discretionary spending. This automatic CR could change these levels only days after we made the agreement. With this type of development, I am afraid we will never finish implementing this agreement, this budget agreement. 
It is not surprising that the President said that he will veto this bill if the Republican leadership insists on retaining this amendment to the bill. We ought to strip out this amendment immediately and pass the supplemental appropriations bill. Just look at the critical funding that we are providing in this supplemental. 
We heard the distinguished Senator from North Dakota describe the conditions that people are forced to exist under. And it touched all of our hearts when we saw the pictures, when we understood what it must be like to lose a home, to lose your roots, to lose your pictures, to lose the memorabilia, to lose all the history that a family goes through, things that are so precious. And where do you go in the next phase? People do not know. 
They are saying to us, `Help us out, America. We are an integral part. We're there when you need us. We're there to pay our bills. And we're there to fight for the country. And let us have the resource to rebuild our lives a little bit.' We all want to do it. So why do we get entangled with this extraneous matter at this point? 
We are also talking about more support for our troops in Bosnia. That is a tough job. Who here wants to walk away from that responsibility? Who here wants to say, `Well, we have our troops there, but we're not going to give them their resources they need'? I doubt if anyone really wants to say that. 
If the Republican majority insists on pushing this legislation, we ought to consider it as a stand-alone bill. Let us debate it. Let us review what is in there, and not hold this supplemental appropriations bill hostage. 
Mr. President, if the automatic CR became law, the American people could pay a steep price. Compared to the President's budget, the budget ax could fall on many critical programs. Under the automatic CR, cuts are possible in the following programs: 
Do we want to risk programs like Pell grants, sending kids to college who otherwise cannot afford to go? 
Do we want to risk cutting NIH funding where research is so precious, so essential? 
Ryan White AIDS services. We are beginning to see some diminishment of the immediate death from AIDS. We are beginning to see life extended. 
Do we want to stop those programs? 
Who wants to put your family on an airplane if we have to cut back on FAA safety and security programs? Who wants to run that risk? 
We have EPA operations. They are able to respond to emergencies, oil spills, things of that nature. Do we want to run the risk of cutting back when we may need that kind of emergency assistance? 
Mr. President, the automatic CR is also, in my view, an abandonment of our constitutional responsibility. Our 
constituents sent us here to make decisions about our Nation's priorities. They expect us to consider and review carefully appropriations bills, spending bills, debate them, amend them and pass them in a way that meets the full blush of sunlight and meets their health, education, and other needs. This automatic CR would take a mindless meat ax--could take a mindless meat ax to 13 appropriations bills. It is not a very good way to decide our country's priorities. 
Mr. President, my Republican colleagues--and I respect them, but challenge their judgment on this one--argue if we do not pass the automatic CR we will have another Government shutdown. This is not the case. If we do our work we can pass most appropriations bills by October 1. And if we cannot pass them by that date we can pass a short-term continuing resolution that will allow us to finish all 13 bills. That is not the best way to do it. The best way to do it is get it done. We have done this numerous times in the past and have avoided any disruption of Government services. 
Mr. President, I strongly urge the Republican leadership to remove this onerous provision. This threatens the foundation of the entire 5-year budget agreement. If the majority does not budge soon on this issue, the whole budget deal could collapse, and we may never have a balanced budget, a children's health initiative, or any of the tax cuts that are also agreed upon though in some cases reluctantly. But it is a consensus. Is that where we want to go? I do not think so, Mr. President. I hope that my colleagues will stand up, analyze the situation carefully, and support Senator Byrd in his effort to strike this from the bill. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today Senators Boxer and Kerry and I are introducing legislation to ensure that millions of lethal American-manufactured military weapons will not be imported into this country. Representatives Patrick Kennedy and Maloney are introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives. 
The bill we are introducing repeals a loophole in the law that could allow U.S. military weapons that were provided to foreign countries to be sold back to gun dealers in this country. The loophole permits the import of so-called `curios or relics' --weapons considered to have historic value or which are more than 50 years old. About 2.5 million American-manufactured military weapons that the U.S. Government gave away, sold, or were taken as spoils of war by foreign governments are at issue. This includes 1.2 million M-1 carbines, which are easily converted to fully automatic weapons. Though these weapons are older, they are lethal. I don't want them flooding America's streets. And I don't want foreign governments making a windfall by selling them to commercial gun dealers. 
As some of my colleagues may know, the term `curios or relics' was originally used in the Gun Control Act of 1968 to make it easier for licensed collectors to buy curios or relics weapons from outside his or her State of residence. The Treasury Department came up with a definition and list of `curios or relics' for this purpose. At that time, importation of surplus military weapons--whether of United States or foreign origin--was prohibited, and the curios or relics list had nothing to do with importing weapons. 
Nearly 20 years later, in 1984, a law was passed that expanded the scope of the curios or relics list in ways never foreseen at the time the list was first created. The modified law said that guns that were on the curios or relics list could not just be sold interstate within this country, but could be imported as well. 
However, the Arms Export Control Act still prohibited the importation of U.S. military weapons that had been furnished to foreign governments. Although a 1987 amendment to that Act authorized the importation of U.S.-origin military weapons on the curios or relics list as well, only one import license has been granted under the curios or relics exception. Since that isolated incident, every administration--Reagan, Bush, and Clinton--has adopted a policy established by the Reagan administration and based on the Arms Export Control Act of denying these kinds of import licenses. 
Though the Clinton administration and the past two Republican administrations have opposed importing these lethal weapons, the NRA supports importing them and it has allies on the Hill. Last year, an effort was made in the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill to force the State Department to allow these weapons to be imported for any reason. That effort was killed as part of the negotiations on the catchall appropriations bill that was signed into law on September 30. 
The provision included in the Senate version of the C, J, S appropriations bill last year, section 621, would have prohibited any agency of the Government--notwithstanding any other provision of law--from using appropriated funds to deny an application for a permit to import previously exported United States-origin military firearms, parts, or ammunition that are considered to be curios or relics. The provision would have forced the State Department to allow large numbers of U.S. military firearms that are currently in the possession of foreign governments to enter the United States commercially. Because so many of those firearms can be easily converted to automatic weapons, it would have undermined efforts to reduce gun violence in this country. In addition, it could have provided a windfall for foreign governments at the 
expense of the taxpayer. 
Certainly the dangers posed by many guns on the curios or relics list--in particular the M-1 carbine, which is easily converted into an automatic weapon--are an important reason for preventing imports of those guns. It is the main reason I am proposing legislation to clarify the law to prevent imports in the future. But the provisions of the Arms Export Control Act that limit the imports are not merely technical. They support a principle, included in the Arms Export Control Act, that is basic to the integrity of our foreign military assistance program: No foreign government should be allowed to do anything with weapons we have given them that we ourselves would not do with them. For example, the Department of Defense does not transfer weapons to a country that is our enemy; no foreign government should be allowed to use U.S.-supplied weapons in that way. The Department of Defense does not sell its excess guns directly to commercial dealers in the United States, and foreign governments should not be able to do so either. 
As recently as 1994, the General Services Administration Federal weapons task force reviewed U.S. policy for the disposal of firearms and confirmed a longstanding Government policy against selling or transferring excess weapons out of Government channels. The Federal Government has made a decision that it should not be an arms merchant. The Federal regulations that emerged from that task force review are clear. They say surplus firearms may be sold only for scrap after total destruction by crushing, cutting, breaking, or deforming to be performed in a manner to ensure that the firearms are rendered completely inoperative and to preclude their being made operative. These are sound regulations. The Department of Defense does not sell its guns to private arms dealers. Under the Arms Export Control Act, we should not allow foreign governments to sell 2.5 million U.S. military weapons to private arms dealers either. 
Flooding the market with these curios and relics would only make it harder for law enforcement to do its job. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms has already seen an increase in M-1 carbines that have been converted to fully automatic machine guns due to the availability and relatively low cost of the weapons. The more military weapons there are in this country, the more likely they are to fall into criminal hands. Surplus military weapons are usually cheap, and, if a government sells its whole stockpile, plentiful. A sudden increase in supply of M-1 garands and carbines and M-1911 pistols would drive down the price, making them less attractive to the collector and more attractive to the criminal. 
In fact, the administration opposed last year's provision, in part, because of the increased availability of low-cost weapons for criminals that invariably would have resulted. According to the administration, `The criminal element thrives on low-cost firearms that are concealable, or capable of accepting large-capacity magazines, or capable of being easily converted to fully automatic fire. Thus, such weapons would be particularly enticing to the criminal element. In short, the net effect of the proposal would be to thwart the administration's efforts to deny criminals the availability of inexpensive, but highly-lethal, imported firearms.' 
We know that the M-1 carbine has already been used to kill at least 6 police officers. Another 3 were killed with M-1911 pistols. As recently as this January, two sheriff's deputies, James Lehmann, Jr. and Michael P. Haugen, were killed with an M-1 carbine while responding to a domestic violence call in Cabazon, CA. In October 1994, in Gilford, NH, Sgt. James Noyes of the State Police Special Weapons and Tactics Unit was killed in the line of duty with an M-1 carbine. In December 1992, two Richmond, CA police officers were killed with an M-1 carbine. In just one State, Pennsylvania, at least 10 people were 
killed using U.S.-origin military weapons during a recent 5-year period. To those who would argue that `curios and relics' are not used in crimes, I would say talk to the families of these victims. 
American-manufactured weapons were sold to foreign governments--often at a discount rate subsidized by the U.S. taxpayer--because we believed it was in our foreign policy interest to strengthen and assist our allies. We did not intend to enable foreign governments to make a profit by turning around and selling them back to commercial gun dealers in the U.S. We certainly did not help our allies so they could turn around and flood America's streets with lethal guns. 
We also did not provide weapons to foreign governments so they could reap a financial windfall at the expense of the taxpayer. Although the law could allow the United States Government to receive the net proceeds of any sales made by foreign governments of defense articles it received on a grant basis, the provision in the appropriations bill last year would have forced the administration--notwithstanding any other law --to approve the import license, even if a foreign government would not agree to provide proceeds of the sale. As such, it would undermine our government's ability to require foreign governments to return proceeds to the United States and could result in a windfall for foreign governments. 
Even more, some countries like Vietnam, which hold a significant quantity of spoils of war weapons, including `curios or relics,' could sell those `spoils of war' to U.S. importers at a financial gain. And, the Government of Iran, which received more than 25,000 M-1911 pistols from the United States Government in the early 1970's, could qualify to export weapons to the United States at a financial gain as well. 
Allowing more than 2 million U.S.-origin military weapons to enter the United States would profit a limited number of arms importers. But it is not in the interest of the American people. I don't believe private gun dealers should have the ability to import these weapons from foreign governments. These weapons are not designed for hunting or shooting competitions. They are designed for war. Our own Department of Defense does not sell these weapons on the commercial market for profit. Why should we allow foreign countries to do so? 
Mr. President, this bill would confirm the policy against importing these lethal weapons by removing the `curios or relics" exception from the Arms Export Control Act. Under this legislation, U.S. military weapons that the U.S. Government has provided to foreign countries could not be imported to the United States for sale in the United States by gun dealers. If a foreign government had no use for surplus American military weapons, those weapons could be returned to the Armed Forces of the United States or its allies, transferred to State or local law enforcement agencies in the United States, or destroyed. The legislation also asks the Treasury Department to provide a study on the importation of foreign-manufactured surplus military weapons.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the Concealed Weapons Prohibition Act of 1997, that would prohibit individuals from publicly carrying a handgun. 
The bill includes exceptions for certain people authorized to carry handguns under State law, such as law enforcement personnel and duly authorized security officers. States also could provide exemptions in individual cases, based on credible evidence of compelling circumstances warranting an exemption, such as a woman being stalked by someone who is threatening her. A simple claim of concern about generalized risks would not be sufficient to warrant an exemption; there would have to be a specified, credible threat. 
Mr. President, common sense tells us that there are more than enough dangerous weapons on America's streets. Yet, incredibly, some seem to think that there should be more. These people want to turn our States and cities into a modern version of the old wild west, where everyone carries a gun on his or her hip, taking the law into their own hands. This is a foolhardy and dangerous trend. 
Mr. President, this country is already drowning in a sea of gun violence. Every 2 minutes, someone in the United States is shot. Every 14 minutes, someone dies from a gunshot wound. In 1994 alone, over 15 thousand people in our country were killed by handguns. Compare that to countries like Canada, where 90 people were killed by handguns that year, or Great Britain, which had 68 handgun fatalities. 
Mr. President, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that by the year 2003, gunfire will have surpassed auto accidents as the leading cause of injury-related deaths in the United States. In fact, this is already the case in seven States. 
Mr. President, given the severity of our Nation's gun violence problem, we need to be looking for ways to reduce the number of guns on our streets. Yet, instead, many States recently have enacted laws to do the opposite, by making it easier for people to carry concealed weapons. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, concealed weapons make people less, not more, secure. In fact, there is near-unanimous agreement among law enforcement groups that concealed weapons laws are bad policy. These groups understand that when more people carry weapons on the streets, more routine conflicts escalate into deadly violence. 
Mr. President, every day people get into everything from traffic accidents to domestic disputes. Maybe these arguments lead to yelling, or even fisticuffs. But if people are carrying guns, those conflicts are much more likely to end in a shooting, and death. 
Concealed weapons laws also are likely to make criminals more violent. Think about it, Mr. President. If a criminal thinks that you might be carrying a concealed weapon, common sense tells you that he is much more likely to simply shoot first, and ask questions later. 
Mr. President, another dangerous side-effect of having private citizens carry concealed weapons is the impact these unseen guns will have on law enforcement officers. Police officers would become reluctant to conduct even routine traffic stops if they knew that large numbers of citizens could be carrying concealed weapons. 
You do not need to take my word for this, Mr. President. Just ask the men and women in law enforcement. In fact, the Police Executive Research Forum did just that. In their 1996 survey, they found that 92 percent of their membership opposed legislation 
allowing private citizens to carry concealed weapons. The most cited reason for this opposition was public safety. 
Mr. President, the police of this country understand that the public carrying of handguns increases the likelihood of gun violence. Also, concealed weapons increase the chances that incompetent or careless handgun users will accidently injure or kill innocent bystanders. Unfortunately, States increasingly are allowing individuals to carry concealed weapons with little or no training in the operation of firearms. This means that many incompetent people are putting the public at risk from stray bullets. 
Mr. President, although the regulation of concealed weapons has been left to States, it is time for Congress to step in to protect the public. All Americans have a right to be free from the dangers posed by the carrying of concealed handguns, regardless of their State of residence. And Americans should be able to travel across State lines for business, to visit their families, or for any other purpose, without having to worry about concealed weapons. 
Congress has the constitutional authority to provide this protection, Mr. President, and there is a strong Federal interest in ensuring the safety of our citizens. Beyond the human costs of gun violence, crimes committed with handguns impose a substantial burden on interstate commerce and lead to a reduction in productivity and profitability for businesses around the Nation whose workers, suppliers, and customers are adversely affected by gun violence. Moreover, to ensure its coverage under the Constitution's commerce clause, my bill applies only to handguns that have been transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or that have parts or components that have been transported in interstate or foreign commerce. This clearly distinguishes the legislation from the gun free school zone statute that was struck down in the Supreme Court's Lopez case. 
Mr. President, the bottom line is that more guns equals more death. This legislation will help in our struggle to reduce the number of guns on our streets, and help prevent our society from becoming even more violent and dangerous.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Deadly Driver and Matthew P. Hammell Memorial Act, which would establish national minimum penalties for alcohol-related motor vehicle violations. It is a companion to S. 412, the Safe and Sober Streets Act, which I introduced last month along with Senator Mike DeWine of Ohio, a bill intended to make .08 blood alcohol content the national standard for impaired driving. I am proud to sponsor this legislation and when it is adopted, many lives will be saved. 
However, Mr. President, we can also reduce fatalities and serious injury caused by drunk driving by having tougher penalties. Driving while intoxicated, or DWI, is one of the most prevalent crimes in this country. In 1992, more people were arrested for DWI--1.6 million--than for any other reported criminal activity including larceny or theft, or for drug abuse violations. By even reasonable standards this could be considered a kind of epidemic. And we need to start treating this epidemic. 
A shocking number of DWI convictions are repeat offenders. When the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration studied this issue, it found that about one-third of all drivers arrested or convicted of DWI each year are repeat DWI offenders. One study in California demonstrated the extent of this problem over the long term. It found that 44 percent of all drivers convicted of DWI in California in 1980 were convicted again of DWI within the next 10 years. 
In my State of New Jersey, the problem is exacerbated by the fact that DWI offenses are treated as traffic violations as opposed to crimes. Unfortunately, Mr. President, too many people share this view of drinking and driving, with the result being that those who are charged with DWI often drink and drive again. While in New Jersey new laws and programs have been implemented to address the drunk-driving problem, and DWI arrests and 
convictions have declined, the problem of repeat offenders persists. Between 1994 and 1995 the number of two-time offenders actually increased from 4,495 in 1994 to 4,731 in 1995. 
The danger of these repeat offenders is illustrated by the fact that drivers with prior DWI convictions are overrepresented in fatal crashes. These drivers have a 4.1 times greater risk of being in a fatal crash, as do intoxicated drivers without a prior DWI, and the risk of a particular driver being involved in a fatal crash increases with each DWI arrest. 
Mr. President, it is time that we take this problem of repeat offenders seriously. The first time a driver is convicted of DWI, he or she must understand the severity of the crime which has been committed. If a person continues to ignore the law, and continues to drink and drive, the courts need to treat that person with the full force of the law, both to punish that person, and to protect the public at large. 
That is why I am introducing the Deadly Driver Reduction and Matthew P. Hammell Memorial Act. This bill requires States to adopt mandatory minimum sentences for DWI offenders within 3 years or otherwise lose a portion of their Federal highway funding. The sentencing requirements are as follows: For a first-time conviction of a person operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, their license is revoked for 6 months. A second conviction requires a 1-year suspension, and a third conviction for the crime of driving while impaired by alcohol results in the permanent revocation of that person's license. 
If a State fails to adopt these minimum sentences by October 1, 2000, 5 percent of that State's Federal highway funds will be withheld. If a State fails to adopt these minimum sentences after another year, that State would then lose 10 percent of its allocated Federal highway funds. 
Mr. President, sanctions work. In too many States, and in too many courts in this country, drunk driving is not taken seriously enough. We want to make sure that those who disobey the law by drinking and driving both understand the severity of their offense and are 
prevented from driving if they continue to break the law. These mandatory minimum penalties will meet these challenges. 
When we talk about drunk driving, too often we talk about it in statistical terms. But there are real people attached to those statistics. In the spring of 1995, a young man, from Tuckerton, NJ, full of goodness and potential, was struck down by a drunk driver while he and his friend were in-line skating. Matthew Hammell was exceptional. All those who knew him talk about being touched by his kindness and caring. Like so many American boys, at one point he dreamed of being a baseball player, but as he matured he knew he wanted to be a missionary. His dream became living a life of helping others. But this dream, this young man, was taken away from all of us much too early when Robert Hyer, drunk and driving, struck Matthew with his car while passing another vehicle. Robert Hyer should not have been on the road. Not only was he drunk, but he had a history of driving drunk. Before this fateful incident, Hyer had been charged with DWI six times, though he was convicted only twice. Hyer lost his license in New Jersey in 1984, but somehow he obtained a North Carolina license just 2 years later. He was a habitual offender who kept bucking the system. A system which kept letting him go. A system which, in the end, was too late in responding. 
Mr. President, it may be too late for Matthew Hammell, and all of the other Matthew Hammells whose spirits are taken from us too early, but it is now that we must become serious about drinking and driving. So, in his honor, and in the memory of all of our loved ones who do not get to achieve their potential due to the actions of drunk drivers, we have named this bill the Deadly Driver Reduction and Matthew P. Hammell Memorial Act. While I will be the first to admit that this bill is not enough, at least it is a start. Let us work together now so that such memorial acts are unnecessary in the future.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that will help ensure that States live up to their responsibility to give full faith and credit to protective orders issued in other States. 
In the 1994 Crime Act, as part of the Violence Against Women Act, Congress passed a provision requiring states to enforce the protection orders issued in sister States. 
What this means, Mr. President, is that if a woman has secured a protective order against her husband in New Jersey, and then goes to Pennsylvania to stay with her parents and her husband follows her, Pennsylvania is obligated to enforce the New Jersey protective order. 
This is common sense, it will protect the lives and well-being of countless threatened women, and is the law. However, for some reason States have been disregarding their legal obligation to enforce these orders. 
Mr. President, it seems that the only way to get the States to live up to this obligation is to threaten some of their Federal funding. 
Accordingly, the bill I am introducing today allows the Attorney General to withhold 10 percent of all formula Byrne grant crime fighting funds given to a State if it is failing to enforce out-of-State protective orders. Although I believe that these funds are an important crime prevention and crime fighting tool, it has become clear that there must be some mechanism to ensure that States live up to their responsibilities to victims of domestic abuse. 
Mr. President, violence against women is one of our country's most heinous and pressing crimes. Every 12 seconds a woman is battered. About 10 times more women are victimized annually by domestic violence than are diagnosed with breast cancer. These figures reflect only reported crimes--the actual incidence rates are even higher. 
According to the FBI, domestic violence is the single most common source of injury among women ages 15 to 44, more common than auto accidents, muggings, and rape by a stranger combined. 
Protective orders are an important device in combating domestic violence, and protecting women who have already been battered from further harm. But they are only effective if they are enforced.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention is a historic arms control treaty which will significantly enhance America's security. The treaty prohibits the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, and transfer of chemical weapons by those countries that are signatories. It requires signatories to begin to destroy their chemical weapons within a year and to complete destruction of chemical weapons within ten years. Importantly, it prohibits the use of chemical weapons in combat, and it prohibits signatories from helping other countries to engage in any activity banned by the treaty. As such, the Chemical Weapons Convention is an important non-proliferation tool that will help slow the spread of dangerous chemical weapons and force the destruction of most of the world's chemical weapons stockpiles. 
President Reagan recognized the wisdom of working to ban chemical weapons worldwide. Under his administration, negotiations on the terms of a chemical weapons treaty began. Those negotiations continued under President Bush, who signed the treaty. Now, five years after completion, with the full support of President Clinton, the Chemical Weapons Treaty is before the Senate for ratification. 
There are many good reasons to support the Chemical Weapons Treaty. First, and foremost, this treaty will protect America's military from the threat of chemical weapons attack without requiring America to give up anything militarily. The United States has already decided to destroy its stockpile of chemical weapons and has vowed not to use chemical weapons in warfare. Because the Chemical Weapons Convention requires other nations to abandon chemical weapons as the United States has done, America gains from this treaty. We give up nothing, and our troops will be less likely to face poison gas in future conflicts. 
Civilians in America and worldwide will benefit from Senate ratification of this treaty as well. Last year's terrorist attack in Japan, in which chemical weapons were used against innocent civilians, reminds us that none of us is safe from the threat of chemical weapons. As long as chemical weapons are produced and stockpiled, the possibility remains real that they will end up in the hands of terrorists. Because the Chemical Weapons Convention requires all countries to enact laws making it a crime to develop or produce chemical weapons, the treaty will make it harder for terrorists to obtain chemical weapons, making America's cities, streets, and schools safer. 
Additionally, the Chemical Weapons Convention will help America and the intelligence community to better track and control the spread of chemical weapons and to punish violators. Through the verification regime established by the treaty, our country will have an easier time monitoring chemical weapons threats and establishing rigorous verification procedures to prevent cheating. 
Already seventy countries have ratified the treaty, and it will go into effect with or without the United States. But if the Senate does not ratify the treaty, America will be siding with rogue nations like Iraq and Libya. If the Senate does not ratify the treaty, American industry will be sanctioned and will lose roughly $600 million in trade, a point I addressed more fully in an earlier speech to the Senate. If the Senate does not ratify the treaty, America will not be able to participate in the body that will determine the rules for implementing the treaty. And if the Senate does not ratify the treaty, America's credibility as a proponent of nonproliferation and arms control will be jeopardized. 
Mr. President, there is no doubt in my mind that the United States should join a treaty we helped to shape and which enhances our security. With the Chemical Weapons Convention and our leadership, other nations will follow the lead America set years ago by giving up chemical weapons. Rogue nations and terrorist countries will have a harder time acquiring or making chemical weapons, and new tools will be available to prevent and punish them if they try. America is much better off with the Chemical Weapons Convention than without it, and I urge my colleagues to ratify it without delay.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I introduce the Clean Water Enforcement and Compliance Improvement Act of 1997. This important bill will put real teeth in the enforcement provisions of the Clean Water Act, and will help restore and preserve our Nation's already stressed lakes, rivers and coastal areas. I would like to commend my colleague from New Jersey, Congressman Pallone, for introducing similar legislation in the House of Representatives. Senator Torricelli has joined as a co-sponsor of our bill. 
Mr. President, when Congress first enacted the Clean Water Act in 1972, we established lofty goals-to make our Nation's waters fishable and swimmable. And we mandated strict enforcement and provided for penalties to assure compliance with the act's provisions. 
We were responding to strong public concern about pollution of our waterways. That concern is every bit as strong today because people understand that clean water is essential to human life. The American people want us to rid our waters of bacteria, toxins, and garbage. 
Yet, as we approach the 25th anniversary of the Clean Water Act, and after several substantial revisions since its enactment, the act has failed to meet all of our goals. While the Act has resulted in significant progress and water quality is improving, our waters are not clean. In 1988, over one-third of our rivers, lakes and estuaries surveyed throughout the country were either failing to achieve designated water quality levels or were threatened with failing to achieve those levels. In my State of New Jersey, a survey of roughly 10 percent of the State's rivers showed that only 15 percent were safe for swimming. 
One reason we haven't made more progress is that the Clean Water Act is not being adequately enforced. 
Mr. President, effective enforcement is essential to achieving the goals of the act. Not only does effective enforcement deter violations, but it also helps ensure that appropriate corrective actions are taken in a timely manner when violations do occur. The Clean Water Enforcement and Compliance Improvement Act will strengthen enforcement efforts. 
Mr. President, my bill will toughen penalties for polluters, improve enforcement by EPA and state water pollution agencies, and expand citizens' right-to-know about violations of the Clean Water Act. 
It establishes mandatory minimum penalties for serious violations of the Clean Water Act. 
It requires that civil penalties be no less than the economic benefit resulting from the violation. 
It requires more frequent reporting of water discharges to identify violations more quickly. 
And it requires EPA to publish annually a list of those facilities that are in significant noncompliance with the Clean Water Act.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, while the Senate debates one of the most important arms control treaties in our history, various issues come into play. It is obvious that the Chemical Weapons Convention will ban an entire class of weapons of mass destruction. It prohibits the full spectrum of activities associated with the offensive use of chemical weapons, including development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, and assistance to anyone engaging in these activities. It requires that the destruction of chemical weapons begin within 1 year and it be completed within 10 years. 
Mr. President, there is no doubt in my mind that the United States should join a treaty we helped to shape and which enhances our security. I am going to vote for it. Now, with the Chemical Weapons Convention and our leadership, other nations will follow the lead that we set years ago by giving up chemical weapons. 
Rogue nations and terrorist countries will have a harder time acquiring or making chemical weapons, and new tools will be available to prevent and punish them if they try. That is a noble goal. 
One of the arguments that we have heard against ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention is that it will force some industries 
--one in particular--to bear an unusual burden. I want to address this for a few minutes because I don't believe it is true. To the contrary, the chemical industry will bear an undue burden if the United States fails to ratify the CWC. I want to explain why. 
If the Chemical Weapons Convention goes into effect without the United States a party, strict trade restrictions designed to pressure rogue states to join the convention would spell disaster for the U.S. chemical industry. Reasonably enough, neither Presidents Reagan nor Bush ever foresaw that the U.S. Senate might decide to place the United States outside of the treaty, along with countries like Iraq, Libya, and other rogue nations. 
But the fact is that treaty provisions prohibiting members from trading with nonmembers in certain chemicals that have both commercial as well as military uses would put at risk as much as $600 million a year in two-way trade by American chemical companies, and many jobs. 
I will repeat that. Should the U.S. Senate fail to ratify the treaty, as much as $600 million a year in American export and import sales would be placed at risk as a result of sanctions against American companies. 
On April 15, Fred Webber, who is the president and CEO of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, testified in support of this treaty. He said:  
The industry I represent is America's largest export industry, with over 1 million American jobs * * * we know how this treaty affects our commercial interests. * * * We began with many of the same concerns about the treaty that have been voiced here. We worked hard to protect U.S. industrial interests, especially proprietary information. 
We helped develop the protocols guiding the treaty's inspection and recordkeeping requirements, and we put those protocols to live-fire tests over and over again. * * * In summary, we believe the treaty is not a threat to U.S. business. 
Not only does the CWC have the support of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, which represents 193 chemical manufacturing companies, accounting for more than 90 percent of the Nation's productive capacity for basic chemicals, it has the support of the Chemical Industry Council of New Jersey and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, with over 260 member companies. 
It also has the support of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and its 100 plus member companies, and the Biotechnology Industry Organization and its 650-plus member companies and affiliated organizations. It has the support of the Council for Chemical Research, the American Crop Protection Association, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, and the American Chemical Society. 
Mr. President, the point I am trying to make is simple--the Senate cannot refuse to ratify the CWC in the name of industry. American industry supports this treaty. It does not believe it places an unfair burden on companies in this country. 
In fact, U.S. companies view the convention as an asset because it offers a way to dissociate themselves from chemical weapons production and to be good corporate citizens by helping to eliminate these abhorrent weapons. 
American industry even participated in the treaty negotiations and helped write the rules covering inspections and confidential business information. Its top priority during the negotiations conducted by the Reagan and Bush administrations was ensuring that any burdens on business would be reasonable and that trade secrets would be protected. To ensure that the protections against unreasonable searches and seizures and industrial espionage would be strong, the chemical industry tested the treaty during seven full-fledged trial inspections at chemical facilities. It ensured that warrants would be required when a company would not consent to a search and that the treaty would protect sensitive equipment, information, or areas not related to chemical weapons during a challenge inspection. For most companies in this country--more than 90 percent of the 2,000 American companies that will be covered by the treaty--the treaty will require them to do little more than fill out a two-page form once a year. 
Only about 140 companies are likely to be subject to routine inspections. 
In addition to the protections negotiated by industry and already in the treaty, the Senate will be adding five additional protections. 
Under additional conditions that will be added by the Senate, if an employee of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons willfully discloses U.S. confidential business information that causes financial harm to a U.S. business, the President is required to withhold half of the U.S. contribution to the organization until that employee's immunity from prosecution is waived. This will serve as a deterrent to breaches of confidential information. 
To reduce the risk of industrial espionage, samples collected during inspections in the United States cannot be analyzed in a foreign laboratory. The President would be required to certify annually that the CWC is not significantly harming the legitimate commercial activities and interests of chemical, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical firms. 
The Senate would support the provision of assistance to U.S. business by the On-Site Inspection Agency. And, the Senate would be informed promptly of the proposed addition of a chemical to any of the CWC's schedules and the anticipated effect of such a proposal on U.S. industry. 
Mr. President, this treaty enhances America's security. It is the right thing to do, and I urge my colleagues to ratify it without delay. 
I hope that my colleagues will stand up and say this is good for America, that it is good for humanity, and that they will ratify this treaty without delay. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding scientist and visionary, Mr. Lyman Spitzer Jr., who recently died in Princeton, NJ at the age of 82. Mr. Spitzer was one of those rare individuals who not only made history, he actually changed history. 
Spitzer was a theoretician of astrophysics and plasma physics who inspired the Hubble Space telescope and a myriad of orbiting observatories. His scientific contributions began decades ago, when he played a leading role in the development of sonar during World War II. 
After World War II, Spitzer's attention turned to what would become his lifelong dream and his lifelong work, the Hubble telescope. The most complex undertaking in unmanned space study, the telescope can peer into the deepest reaches of space. And it was only Lyman Spitzer's vision, advocacy and tenacity which made this dream a reality. He shepherded the project from, as the New York Times noted, `a glimpse in his own eye in 1947,' to its liftoff in 1990. 
Mr. President, Mr. Spitzer's interests included all aspects of astronautics. He was the catalyst of the Copernicus Orbiting Astronomical Observatory, an ultraviolet predecessor of Hubble that NASA launched in 1972. He was also a pioneer of the effort to use nuclear fusion as a clean and limitless source of energy. And Spitzer was the founding director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, where he worked until the day he died. 
Lyman Spitzer enhanced our vision of the universe, increased our knowledge of the stars and expanded our own horizons. He is an outstanding example of the difference a single individual can make. Others may continue his work in Princeton, but no one will ever be able to replace him.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge, Masonic Architects of the Universe, Inc., Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, Electa Grand Chapter, Order of the Eastern Star of Newark, NJ, will be awarding scholarships to at least 16 deserving students at its second annual Scholarship Banquet on May 18. Young people from New York; Connecticut; Washington, DC; and Essex and Hudson counties in New Jersey will be recognized during the evening's ceremonies. I congratulate all the scholarship recipients, and I encourage them to always strive for academic excellence. In the words of poet Muriel Ruyskier, I urge them to `reach the limits of themselves, to reach beyond themselves.' 
Mr. President, education is the key that unlocks the door to the future. By the year 2000, 60 percent of all new jobs in America will require advanced technology skills. Anyone who does not have the required education will not be able to compete. Education isn't a luxury, it's a necessity. 
I know that the scholarships awarded by the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge will help the recipients face tomorrow's challenges. But I also hope that these awards will instill in the winners a love for education. In the 19th century Jewish ghettos of Eastern Europe, mothers used to pour a little honey on a book, in order to demonstrate to their children the sweetness of learning. And learning is sweet, because it enriches our lives; it opens our minds to new possibilities, and it allows us to fully enjoy the wonders of the universe. 
Mr. President, as we honor this year's scholarship winners, I also want to commend the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge for its outstanding community work, particularly in the area of education. Through its actions, the Grand Lodge demonstrates that not only does it take an entire village to raise a child, it takes an entire community to educate a child. 
I again congratulate all of the scholarship winners, and I wish them continued success as they continue on the path of knowledge and the path of life.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Salem County School District on a number of notable anniversaries. The year 1997 marks the 40th anniversary of the district, the 25th anniversary of the initiation of occupational, technical and vocational programs and services to secondary students and the 15th anniversary of the operation of the New Jersey Regional Day School at Mannington for the Department of Education. 
Mr. President, these anniversaries are especially significant because education is the key that will open the door to the future for our children. By the year 2000, 60 percent of all new jobs in America will require advanced technical skills. The industrial age has given way to the information age and, more than ever before, students need a quality education if they are going to be able to compete. 
But a quality education doesn't only benefit the individual, it also benefits our Nation. If our firms and factories are to find the educated workers they need, and if these same firms are to remain competitive in the global marketplace, then our students must receive the necessary training and skills. Our economic future depends on it. 
Mr. President, 300 years ago this year, the colony of Massachusetts passed the very first American education law. It required that every town of at least 50 people hire a teacher of reading and writing. Those first colonists, huddled in their tiny villages along the Atlantic coast, understood the importance of education for their children and for their communities. And ever since, making ourselves the best educated Nation on Earth has always been the very essence of our American dream. The work of the Salem County School District, and the Salem County Vocational Technical Schools, is helping to ensure that this particular American dream remains an American reality. 
To the students of Salem County, I say don't ever forget that there's always more to be learned, always more to be seen, always more to be explored. And to the Salem County Board of Education, the Salem County School District, and the Salem County Vocational Technical Schools, I say congratulations and continue your fine work.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, another season of baseball is underway, and all of us are enjoying the crack of a bat on a hard hit ball and the thrill of a stolen base. But while this season has brought us the familiar sights and sounds, it also recalls a very special anniversary. Nineteen ninety-seven marks the 50th anniverary of the breaking of major league baseball's color barrier. 
In April 1947, Jackie Robinson played his first game with the National League's Brooklyn Dodgers and ended segregation in our national pastime; simultaneously, he entered America's pantheon of heroes. 
Mr. President, while we rightfully honor Mr. Robinson, we cannot forget that heroes rarely fight their battles alone. Unfortunately, we have largely ignored those other African-American baseball players who broke that barrier with Robinson. 
Only 11 weeks after Jackie Robinson first graced a major league baseball diamond, Larry Doby, of Paterson, N.J., took the field with the Cleveland Indians, becoming the first African-American player in the American League. Once on the team, he brought an ability and a consistency to the game which few could match. He was the first African-American player to hit a home run in a World Series, and he was named to six straight American League All-Star teams. During his 13-year career, he attained a .283 lifetime batting average and hit 253 home runs. 
But Larry Doby was not only an exciting player, he was also a courageous individual. He ignored the vile epithets hurled at him by both fans in the stands and opposing players on the field. After a road game, his teammates would go back to their hotel and make plans for the evening. Thanks to specter of Jim Crow, Mr. Doby would have to go, alone, to his own dingy hotel room in the black part of town. 
Because of the manner in which he handled such adversity, many other African-American players followed him to the major leagues, and we all learned that, in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, we must judge a person on the content of his character and not the color of his skin. In a recent New York Times article, Mr. Doby himself observed, `If Jack and I had a legacy, it is to show that teamwork, the ability to associate and communicate, makes all of us stronger.' And by their example, Mr. President, we definitely are a stronger nation. 
Mr. President, Larry Doby is rightfully called a legend for his consistency on the field and a hero for his character off the field. But I have the privilege of also calling him a friend. We grew up together on the working class streets of Paterson, N.J. As working class kids, we shared a simple philosophy--if you do what you love, and you do it well, that's its own reward. And that reminds me of one of my favorite anecdotes about Larry. 
After his first game in July 1947, the owner of the Cleveland Indians, the renowned Bill Veeck, told Larry, `You are going to make history.' Doby recalls that he thought to himself, `History? I just want to play baseball.' 
In 1975, Larry became the manager of the Chicago White Sox. Today, at the age of 72, he is still involved with the game, working for major league baseball in its Manhattan offices. But at one time, he was an American who just wanted to play baseball. And, given the opportunity, he played with skill and grace--and he made history. 
When it comes to Larry, others may have filled his uniform, but no one will ever be able to fill his shoes. Larry Doby proves that good and great can exist in the same individual.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Patrick Moynihan, Senator Joseph Lieberman, and 32 other Senators to introduce the ISTEA Reauthorization Act of 1997. This bill recognizes the success of the 1991 law, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, by reauthorizing it with no major changes. 
Mr. President, 17 Governors endorsed a statement of principles for the next surface transportation law that strongly affirmed ISTEA's goals and effectiveness in ensuring a sound national transportation infrastructure. Included in those goals were these statements: Maintain the course set by ISTEA; reauthorize ISTEA with simplification and refinement but without significant changes; allocate funds to states primarily based on needs; retain the Federal Government's role as a key transportation partner to help fund highway, bridge, and transit projects and to assure that a national focus remains on mobility, connectivity, uniformity, integrity, safety, and research. Their message was, plain and simple, ISTEA works. 
Over the past few months, many others, from coast to coast, have sounded that message. Some are in the transportation business, others, such as mayors, county officials, and environmentalists are not. The drumbeat has sounded, that ISTEA works. 
I strongly support that message. ISTEA was bold and innovative, and changed the way we think and make decisions about transportation. It brought the public into the process. It requires sound planning. It promotes energy efficient transportation, research and development. It strengthens safety. 
It recognizes that the goal of a transportation system is how best to move goods and people, efficiently and effectively. 
Mr. President, ISTEA has worked across this Nation, as witnessed by the 32 cosponsors from 17 States. ISTEA has also worked for my home State of New Jersey. ISTEA could not have had a better laboratory than New Jersey. New Jersey is a corridor State, linking commerce and travel to the Northeast and the rest of the country. New Jersey has the highest vehicle density of any State in the United States. Thousands of heavy duty trucks, only half of which are not registered in New Jersey, use New Jersey's roads. 
It is a commuter State, heavily reliant on mass transit. New Jersey's transportation infrastructure is heavily used and is significantly older than many other State's. We as a State have had to be creative in finding ways to maintain the condition of the infrastructure, while improving mobility and promoting sound planning. 
Improving mobility reduces congestion, which in turn, improves air quality and makes our highways safer. This means that our time is not spent in long commutes to work or stuck in traffic. We need to remember why sensible transportation funding and planning is important. It's not to satisfy some special interest. It's to remember that sound transportation systems help cope with growing communities--our neighborhoods. Sound transportation systems help to improve mobility to transport freight and promote domestic and international commerce, making our economy more efficient and creating jobs--our businesses. Sound transportation systems help to improve air quality and protect the environment--our personal health. In short, transportation can, and should, help develop liveable communities and create a better way of life. 
Mr. President, ISTEA was the first step toward this goal. The ISTEA Reauthorization Act of 1997 is the next logical step to launch our Nation's transportation system into the 21st century. 
The bill we are introducing today recognizes that current levels of transportation 
investment fall short of needs, so it increases authorized transportation funding over 6 years and continues the emphasis on preservation and maintenance of transportation systems. 
The bill continues to support the scientifically proven link between transportation and air quality by bolstering the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program. 
The bill supports allocating transportation funds based on need, by continuing the bridge program without any changes. 
The bill increases flexibility by making Amtrak eligible for certain highway funds, and maintains the flexibility for transit. 
And, the bill recognizes special needs of States with both low and high density populations, by providing additional funding. 
Mr. President, I would also like to comment on the effort to revise our national highway program to ensure that each State receives allocations based on a certain percentage of its gas tax contributions to the highway trust fund--the donor-donee issue. This is the wrong way to think about transportation funding. It is in the national interest to have a Federal transportation policy with national goals. That's how we promote interstate and international commerce, further economic productivity, protect the environment, and ensure safety. That's why decisions to allocate Federal transportation funding should be based on need, not on a State's contribution to the highway trust fund. We do not allocate airport improvement program funds based on the amount of ticket tax that is collected in each State. No Federal programs work that way. 
However, if we choose to approach the issue in that context, then we must first recognize each State's return on the Federal dollar for all Federal programs. New Jersey receives only 68 cents of return on the Federal dollar--second to last, just ahead of Connecticut. New Jerseyans collectively contribute $15 billion more in Federal payments than they receive--that's more than $1,800 per resident. 
Mr. President, if we were to adopt an across-the-board rule to require 95 percent return on Federal dollars, consider what would happen if we apply that test to other programs. New Jersey would then receive $169 million more for agriculture subsidies, $2.1 billion more of defense spending, and about $55 million more for child and family health services funding. 
Mr. President, national transportation funding should continue to be allocated based on national goals and State needs like other Federal programs. 
Mr. President, ISTEA has worked for our cities, our counties, our environment, and for economic development. Let us build on the success of the past and not turn the clock back on transportation progress.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today is the day known as Kick Butts Day. It is a day when kids all over the country will express their opposition to cigarette addiction and the dangers that it poses to health. They are resisting tobacco company efforts to target them as consumers and ensnare them in a lifetime of addiction. 
That is why I want to spend a few minutes today to discuss the subject of the possible legislative settlement of claims against the tobacco industry. It has been suggested that perhaps the example set by Liggett & Myers, the company that agreed to reveal its innermost documents to tell the public at large everything that went on in the secret meetings of their company and other companies with whom they were working, has apparently been an inducement for other companies that think perhaps now that the pressure is on the tobacco industry maybe they can affect a settlement. Well, this is no time for that kind of thing. 
On Tuesday of this week, I introduced the Tobacco Disclosure and Warning Act, which would require the tobacco companies to disclose the ingredients and the carcinogens in their products and place larger and clearer warning labels on their packs. These new labels would send a more effective message to kids about the dangers of smoking. 
Yesterday, I spoke in the Chamber about the Joe Camel advertising campaign by R.J. Reynolds. 
This advertising campaign uses cartoons to market cigarettes to kids. Senators Durbin, Wellstone, Harkin, Kennedy, Murray, and Wyden have joined me in sending a letter to the chairman of the FTC asking him to bring an unfair advertising case against R.J. Reynolds for the Joe Camel ads. 
In a stunning development several weeks ago, this cloak of deception that shrouded the activities of the tobacco industry was removed when the Liggett group settled 22 State lawsuits because they admitted that smoking causes cancer and other diseases, that nicotine is addictive, and that the tobacco industry targets underage smokers. It also agreed to a 25-year payment schedule to the States, to release internal documents providing evidence of the above claims, and to accept FDA regulation along with stark new warning labels on its cigarettes. This settlement that was worked out between Liggett and the State attorneys general is truly historic. It will open up the floodgates of information about tobacco. The truth is that smoking is addictive and it kills. 
The documents that will become public as a result of this settlement will help expose the conspiracy of deception and intimidation tobacco giants have engaged in for years. They have used this deception to thwart claims against them in court, to derail reasonable attempts at regulation, and to curb public education programs to protect the public health. 
It is rumored that the tobacco industry, or at least some firms, will now seek protection from Congress, asking for a `global settlement' of claims against them. I hope that every Senator will maintain a healthy skepticism about any proposed legislative settlement of legal claims against the tobacco companies. 
The bipartisan group of attorneys general pursuing these lawsuits have shown enormous courage and tenacity in the face of tobacco industry stonewalling. We should not undercut them. Nor should we intervene to help the companies in pending litigation brought by individual Americans who suffered harm as a result of the industry's deadly and deceptive practices. We should not hinder the ability of the States and the taxpayers that they represent, or individuals, to receive just and fair compensation for the harm or expense that they suffered. 
I hope Members of this body will be very analytical as they hear this appeal and resist efforts to bail out the tobacco industry in Congress. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced the Tobacco Disclosure and Warning Act. This bill will require tobacco companies to disclose the ingredients, including the carcinogens, that exist in cigarettes. Cigarettes are the only consumable product in America today, the only one, whose ingredients are not disclosed. All kinds of food products list all of the ingredients very specifically. I think it is wrong. The public should know what is in the cigarettes. We work hard and invest a lot of resources to stop our kids from doing things like eating lead-based paint or drinking water with lead. We should not let them smoke it. 
This bill would also require large, blunt and centrally placed health warnings on cigarette packs of the types used in other countries. I look at this one, which is done in Canada. Very clearly, on the black portion here, it says, `Smoking can kill you.' It is also printed in French to make sure that people understand the threat to their health when they take up smoking. 
I want to particularly focus on the issue, now, of tobacco advertising and direct it towards the industry's use of Joe Camel. As you know, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over the fairness and truthfulness of advertising. Today, I am sending a letter to the Chairman of the FTC, Robert Pitofsky, encouraging the Commission to bring a case against R.J. Reynolds for unfair advertising because of its portrayal of Joe Camel in its advertising campaign. I am joined by Senators Durbin, Kennedy, Harkin, Wellstone, Wyden and Murray.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the letter simply asks the Chairman of the FTC to revisit this case, because we believe that R.J. Reynolds is intentionally advertising a product to children which is illegal to sell to them. In 1994, the FTC voted 3 to 2 against bringing such a case against R.J. Reynolds. At that time, the Commission cited a lack of evidence. But since then, dramatic new evidence, new material has become public. Last year, 67 Members of the House wrote a letter asking the FTC to reopen the investigation. The FTC staff has recommended that the Chairman do just that, and he will be making a decision over the coming weeks. 
Mr. President, Joe Camel is a prime example of advertising that ought to be stopped. If Joe Camel were real and smoked as much as he does in his ads, he would be a dead camel. He would have bit the dust from emphysema, lung cancer, and heart disease.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to honor Lara Green Spector, the Tobacco-Free Kids East Regional Youth Advocate of the Year. Lara is a ninth grader from Montclair High School in New Jersey who truly exemplifies the old adage that one person can make a difference. 
Lara was the motivating force behind Montclair's recently passed ordinance banning cigarette vending machines and self-service displays. Who knows how many Montclair teenagers and children may not take up smoking because cigarettes are now more difficult to obtain. And local public officials, school advisers and residents all agree that this ordinance would never have become a reality without Lara's initiative, leadership and tenacity. 
Lara also organized a townwide program for the Great American Smokeout in November 1996. Her program included a poster contest in the local elementary schools and a quiz contest in the middle schools. She also created and distributed a fact sheet to every Montclair student. For years, tobacco companies have used youth oriented advertisements, like Joe Camel, to send a false message to young people that smoking is cool and glamorous. Education campaigns like Lara's help blow away their smoke screens and demonstrate that cigarettes are addictive and deadly. 
Mr. President, for years, I have led the crusade in this Chamber against teenage and youth smoking. I am certainly happy to have an exceptional foot soldier like Lara join me in the fight. 
By working to stop children and young people from smoking, Lara Green Spector is enhancing lives and saving lives. She is an outstanding student, activist, and citizen, and I have a feeling that we have not heard the last from her on Capitol Hill.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill we are calling the Tobacco Disclosure and Warning Act of 1997. Frankly, I hope we are going to be able to look back at this day and say this was a great day for America's children, that this was a great day for the future well-being of coming generations. 
I am joined by my Senate colleague from Illinois, Senator Dick Durbin, who worked with me in the past on establishing a ban on smoking in airplanes, he was a Member of the House before, and Senator Harkin from Iowa, and Senator Wellstone from Minnesota. They joined me this morning in declaring that we are interested this day in the health of our children. We want to warn them that a habit that they could be induced--if I may use the term more crudely, seduced--into, if they join in the tobacco addiction group, that they may be jeopardizing their health very seriously. 
Our bill will force tobacco companies to tell the truth, finally, to the American people. As witnessed by the Liggett & Myers' settlement, which wiped away the secrecy and deception perpetrated by the industry, truth is one of the few items in short supply in the tobacco industry. This bill will require tobacco manufacturers to disclose the ingredients of their product to the public. 
Actually, it is a modest step. Of the hundreds of products on sale in America that go into the human body, tobacco products are the only ones--the only ones--for which manufacturers do not have to disclose the ingredients. Take a company like Coca-Cola, one of the world's great companies. They have a proud tradition of keeping their formula secret. They have to list Coke's ingredients on every can. 
There is a major difference, of course, between Coca-Cola and cigarettes. Coca-Cola does not kill anybody and cigarettes kill 400,000 people a year--more than 400,000. That is one out of every three new users that the industry is trying to recruit. That is according to the Centers for Disease Control. 
Manufacturers of every food product and every over-the-counter drug disclose their contents. Cigarette manufacturers do not. Can we wonder why? Yet, of any consumable product for sale in the United States, it is by far among the most deadly. 
When you think about the materials that are in cigarettes, carcinogens--43. Should not America know that when you inhale you are going to get some arsenic, going to get some benzine, materials that are very dangerous to health? 
Lead, we fight all over the place to take lead out of gasoline, take lead out of paint. But we sell it to the kids. That is what the tobacco industry wants to do. Cadmium, nickel--you would not let your child go near these things, yet everyday this industry, these companies, get tax deductions to advertise their addictive, health-damaging product--maybe lethal. 
Our bill also is going to replace the warnings. We ask, A, they list the ingredients. B, we ask also that health warnings on the side of a cigarette package be significant, with larger warnings on the front and back that are simple and direct, saying: `Cigarettes kill. Smoking can kill you. Cigarettes are addictive. Cigarettes cause heart attacks and stroke.' 
It is pretty simple. But maybe, just maybe, then we will be able to stop the industry from targeting its recruits for the day. Mr. President, 3,000 children, young people, a day, are 
attracted and start smoking. And then they cannot quit. 
These kinds of warnings exist all around the world. Cigarettes kill one out of every three, again, I repeat, of its users. Over 400,000 Americans every year die from smoking and lots more get sick: Emphysema, heart attacks, cannot conduct their normal activity, cannot associate with their families, cannot show the kids how to hit a ball, run a base or go skating or skiing. We should disclose information on the ingredients of cigarettes to the public and provide it with realistic warnings about the health risks that cigarettes cause. It may seem that most smokers know a single cigarette may have hundreds of dangerous ingredients, but I doubt it. When a smoker lights a cigarette, some of these ingredients burn to create other chemicals, and some of these are carcinogenic.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, yesterday, the Budget Committee walked through an analysis of the President's budget prepared by the Republican committee staff. And in anticipation of that meeting, I asked the Democratic staff of the committee to prepare an analysis of the Republicans' budget, or at least what we know of the Republican budget. 
So far, we know that the Senate Republican leadership has proposed as their first two bills--S. 1 and S. 2--legislation that would provide $200 billion worth of tax breaks over the next five years. 
Some Republicans have raised the possibility that those tax breaks might be deferred until after an initial budget agreement. 
But Senator Lott, Speaker Gingrich, Senator Roth, Congressman Armey, and others all seem very committed to large tax breaks. 
And that means that sooner or later--perhaps as part of an initial agreement, or perhaps later--they would have to pay for those tax breaks. 
The analysis prepared by the Democratic staff of the Budget Committee simply explains in a very straightforward, objective way what that would mean. 
And, not surprisingly, it's devastating. 
In the year 2002, 300,000 children would be denied participation in Head Start; because of cutbacks at the Justice Department, 11,000 additional criminals would be left free on the streets; a college education would be less attainable for as many as half a million students; 3.5 million children could be denied reading and math assistance; 2.75 million households would find themselves without heating assistance; 50 of the most hazardous toxic waste sites wouldn't get cleaned up; 250 VA medical and counseling centers could close; and 2,400 border patrol agents could be laid off. 
The list goes on and on. And it really makes the case against large tax breaks for the rich. 
Now, let me be clear that I remain very hopeful that we can move toward a bipartisan agreement to balance the budget. 
But I hope that when the information included in this report becomes known, many of my Republican colleagues will rethink their tax breaks for the rich.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am submitting a concurrent resolution regarding Belarus. I am pleased that Senator D'Amato is an original cosponsor of this concurrent resolution. Representative Pallone has submitted a similar measure in the House of Representatives. 
I am deeply concerned about events in Belarus and the effort by President Lukashenka to expand his already considerable powers at the expense of basic democratic principles. I am deeply concerned by his proposal to unify Russia and Belarus. And, as the cochairman of the Helsinki Commission, I am dismayed by President Lukashenka's failure to abide by the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act and other OSCE agreements which guarantee respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
The resolution recognizes March 25, 1997, as the anniversary of the proclamation of Belarusan independence. It calls on President Lukashenka and the Government to abide by the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act and other agreements of the Organization for the Security and Cooperation of Europe; to guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of the press, assembly, and expression; and to guarantee separation of powers. The resolution states that it is the policy of the United States to support the people of Belarus in achieving independent statehood, promoting the rule of law, human rights, and fundamental freedoms, and assuring that Belarus has the opportunity to survive as an equal and full-fledged member-state among sovereign nations of the world. 
As we approach the anniversary of Belarus' 1918 declaration of independence, we are reminded that Belarus is a nation with a proud history and traditions. It is appropriate that we remember the brave struggle of Belarusan patriots in 1918. At the same time, we must recognize that the struggle for national sovereignty and democratic freedoms continues today and is greatly threatened by the actions of the Lukashenka regime. 
I urge my colleagues to approve this resolution.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to stop the growing gun violence and death associated with interstate gun trafficking. 
Recently, the scourge of gun violence invaded all of our homes, when a madman opened fire on innocent tourists atop the Empire State Building. When the shooting stopped, one person was dead, and six were injured. One of the victims was 27-year-old Matthew Gross of Montclair, NJ. Matthew Gross was shot in the head, and lingered in a coma, connected to a ventilator, for 8 agonizing days. Thankfully, this courageous young man has come out of the coma and is beginning the long and arduous task of recovery. 
Mr. President, this gun violence must stop. It is too easy to obtain a gun in America. This morning, I stood with Matthew's father and brother and we all committed ourselves to intensify the fight against gun violence. Because Matthew Gross wasn't only a victim of a disturbed gunman. He was a victim of the epidemic of gun violence. Reducing this violence must be a top national priority. 
Today, Mr. President, I am introducing the Anti-Gun Trafficking Act, to reduce interstate gun trafficking by prohibiting bulk purchases of handguns. The bill would prohibit the purchase of more than one handgun during any 30-day period. I am joined in this effort by Senators Kennedy, John Kerry, Feinstein, and Torricelli. 
Mr. President, no one needs more than one gun a month. In New Jersey, we have banned assault weapons, and we have established strict permitting requirements for handgun purchases. Yet the effectiveness of these restrictions is substantially diminished because the controls in other States are far less strict. 
Unfortunately, many gun traffickers make bulk purchases of handguns in States with weak firearm laws, and then transport them to other States with tougher laws for illegal sale on the streets. This has helped spread the plague of gun violence nationwide. And without Federal limits, there is little that any one State can do about it. 
A few years ago, Mr. President, the State of Virginia enacted legislation designed to prevent gunrunners from buying large quantities of handguns in Virginia for export to other States. Under that State law, as under my proposal, handgun purchases are limited to one per month. This Virginia statute has proven to be very effective in controlling gun trafficking from Virginia. 
Before the ban, Virginia had become the firearm supermarket of the East Coast. It supplied more than 40 percent of the guns used in crimes in New York City. But under the new legislation, the results were dramatic. The percentage of guns traced back to Virginia gun dealers fell by 61 percent for guns recovered in New York, 67 percent for guns recovered in Massachusetts, and 38 percent for guns recovered in New Jersey. 
Mr. President, Virginia's experience suggests that a ban on bulk purchases can substantially reduce gunrunning. However, to be truly effective, such a limit must be enacted nationwide. Otherwise, gunrunners will simply move their operations to other States. The only way to close down the `iron pipeline' is to plug it up at all ends. 
The Anti-Gun Trafficking Act will impose such a nationwide limit on bulk gun purchases. I do not claim this restriction would end all handgun violence. And, personally, I don't see why anyone needs even 12 guns a year. However, it is a reasonable and modest step in the right direction. 
Mr. President, a one-gun-a-month law would take a bite out of gunrunning without imposing any burden on hunters and other law-abiding gun users. After all, who but gang members, drug dealers, and other criminals needs more than 12 guns a year? Law abiding citizens are made safer by limiting the number of firearms available for purchase at one time. 
Mr. President, this is a sensible approach, and one which will help to make our families, our streets, our communities, and our country safer. I urge my colleagues to support restrictions on bulk purchases on handguns and to join in cosponsoring `One Gun a Month.'

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, one of the subjects that dominates the landscape these days, of course, is the budget. How we are going to function as a society, what are the priorities, how will we finance these priorities and at the same time reach an objective that all of us care about, and of course that is getting a balanced budget by the year 2002. 
Of course, that is getting a balanced budget by the year 2002. 
The President has presented a budget to achieve that objective. There are disputes about how we reach that objective, where do we cut further, what is the revenue stream. I, therefore, Madam President, use this opportunity to comment on what I see as the lack of a budget proposal from the Republican side, from the majority side. 
The President has put down a budget. We have talked about it in the Budget Committee. I am the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee. We have had numerous hearings as we explored various avenues, various parts of the equation with proponents and some opponents trying to dissuade us from proceeding with the President's budget. 
On the other hand, we have not seen anything yet from the Republican side, the majority side, I point out, Madam President. They have produced one piece of budget legislation this year, but it is not a balanced budget. It is the notion that we ought to be giving a big tax break, primarily devoted to the wealthy in our country. The Republican tax break will blow a huge hole in the deficit, even as we struggle to get down to a zero budget deficit by the year 2002. 
In the first 5 years, the Republican plan would cost $200 billion. In the next 5 years, these costs would increase 60 percent to $325 billion for a total of $526 billion over the 10-year period. This chart will help explain exactly where it is we are going. 
It causes a ballooning of the deficit. We see it from 1997, which is on the chart projected at $120 billion and expected to be less by the time we reach the end of the fiscal year, September 30. It continues to expand. In the year 2002, when we are striving to have a zero budget deficit, we are at $239 billion, unless some way is found to pay for these tax breaks. They are not free. If we adopt the Republican tax scheme, we would have to make deeper cuts someplace. I guess that would have to come from Medicare, Medicaid, education, transportation, crimefighting, and environmental protection. 
These tax breaks are also backloaded. Their costs explode, as we can see by the expansion of the deficit, after the year 2002. And, believe it or not, these tax breaks are bigger than those that were originally in the Contract With America, larger than the tax breaks that were proposed last year. 
This chart is from the Joint Committee on Taxation. It is now at $200 billion, expanded to $525 billion. These are the tax cuts as planned, to $525 billion. That would be a terrible consequence. That is in the year 2007. 
Finally, the Republican tax breaks are overwhelmingly tilted toward the very wealthy. According to one analysis, on average, the Republican tax scheme would give a tax break each year of $21,000 for those who make $645,000 a year, the top 1 percent of the income earners in our country. But if you are in the middle 20 percent of our wage earners and you make $27,000 a year, you would get $186 worth of tax relief, 50 cents a day--50 cents a day--for the average hard-working family. 
It borders on insulting to suggest that someone who makes $645,000 is entitled to a tax break of $21,000--I hardly think that those people need any help--and if you make $27,000, which is the per capita income of the middle 20 percent, $186 for the year. It is hard to comprehend how that is going to help our society or help hard-working families make ends meet, plan for their child's education, plan for a roof over their heads, plan for health care, plan for helping their parents, the elderly, achieve the tranquility and the peace that they need in their older age. Madam President, this is not a good way to do business. 
We have been down this road before. The Reagan administration gave us a tax break for the wealthy, and what was the result? The deficit exploded. It is time to get down to serious budgeting. It is time to balance the budget. 
I urge the Republican leadership, the good friends that I have on the Republican side of the aisle who are concerned about balancing a budget, to produce a budget that does the job. If the Republican leadership is committed to their tax scheme, they ought to put up a budget that reflects it. Show us how they would pay for it. But we can't continuously engage in this dialog without, at some point, having to put up a budget that reflects how they intend to get us to where they say they would like to be: Tax breaks for the wealthy, purportedly investments in our society to produce jobs, et cetera, while someone making $27,000 a year is going to get a $186 tax reduction. 
It is not fair, it is not just, it is not acceptable. The American people won't accept it, even though we could be bowled over by a majority vote. It is an outrageous scheme for doing things, the constant refusal to produce any kind of a response to a Democratic budget. We in the Democratic Party are not in charge. The Republicans are in charge, and if they are in charge, they ought to take the responsibilities of leadership. Produce a budget, show us exactly what you mean. Enough of this nonsense where they talk about a tax cut and no one willing to say where it is going to come from. If we have a $200 billion extra cost for our society, where are we going to get the money? 
People are worried about their future; they are anxious about their jobs. Yes, there has been good growth in our economy, but the anxiety factor has continued to expand because people do not believe that they have the security they need for the years ahead. 
So, Madam President, I hope that we will be able to soon get on with our business, have the budget produced by the Republican majority, and tell us how they are going to pay for it. 
Let us have an honest debate about it. Let the American people know what is going on here and not hide behind a smokescreen that says, well, we want to give this huge tax cut but we are not going to tell you how we are going to pay for it. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I reintroduce the Patent and Trademark Office Reform Act, a bill to establish the Patent and Trademark Office as a Government corporation and to provide needed reforms to its operations. The handful of changes I have made from the legislation I sponsored in the last Congress are designed to provide assurance to the Office's users that their fees will only be applied toward Patent and Trademark Office purposes and additional protections to the Office's employees. 
Our country's Patent and Trademark Office is one of the finest in the world. It has been and continues to be integral to America's competitiveness and economic growth. It is no exaggeration to state that tens of millions of jobs have been created as a result of the PTO's actions. I have seen first-hand the benefits of this Office in my home State of New Jersey, which although it is the ninth most populated State in the Union, receives the third largest number of patents per capita. Despite the comparative quality of work of the current PTO, laws and regulations outside of the control of the PTO's management have prevented it from being as efficient as it should be, and as its users deserve. And unless remedied by legislation, certain circumstances that I will detail below will cause PTO's performance to decrease dramatically. 
The Patent and Trademark Office is currently subject to the same procurement and personnel requirements, including personnel ceilings, as other Federal agencies. While these requirements make sense and, indeed, are essential for other Government entities, they hinder the effectiveness of the PTO and are not appropriate for a completely user fee-funded agency. By converting the PTO into a Government corporation, we would free the Office from most of these laws and regulations, but would keep its inherently governmental function within the Federal Government and its work would be continued by federal employees. 
Mr. President, the new PTO will be a wholly owned Government corporation run by a commissioner and two assistants. They will report to the Secretary of Commerce on patent and trademark policy matters only. Like my bill from the last Congress, I have inserted a firewall to prevent the Commerce Department from interfering with internal management decisions of the Office, as opposed to policy decisions. My legislation establishes an Office of the Under Secretary for Intellectual Property within the Commerce Department. The Under Secretary will ensure both attention to intellectual property issues at 
the Cabinet level and a coordinated Government approach to these matters. 
The new PTO will be able to procure equipment, supplies, even office space without the constraints of the Brooks Act, the Public Buildings Act, and the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act. These changes are in response to criticism of undue procurement delays that have resulted in lower quality products at higher costs to the Office. My legislation would also permit PTO to lease, buy, or build office space that is more practical for PTO's needs. Currently, PTO is spread throughout over a dozen buildings, which is not only inconvenient for its employees, it's inefficient. 
Much of the work performed at the PTO requires specialized skills. Those skills are the main reason that the PTO's employees are so highly sought by the private sector. Limited by the general schedule and an overly structured employee classification system, the Office has been hindered in its ability to retain a large number of its workers. My legislation will enable the new PTO to provide its employees with competitive pay so that it might keep and hire top talent. The Office will no longer be subject to personnel ceilings, including those established in the Federal WorkForce Restructuring Act of 1994. There will also be a one-year carry-over of all PTO employees during the transition from the current PTO to the PTO as a Government corporation. 
One of the more significant differences between the bill I am introducing today and the one I sponsored last Congress involves personnel issues. Although both bills give the new PTO the flexibility to competitively compensate its employees, S. 421 permits collective bargaining over pay and other important terms and conditions of employment. This increased employee participation will provide an essential balance to needed managerial flexibility. I have also established a floor on basic pay for current PTO employees so that they will be assured of receiving no less then they do now after PTO becomes a Government corporation. 
Mr. President, this bill would give the users, who have fully funded the Office's operations since 1991, an advisory role over such matters as PTO's performance, fees, and budget. This advisory board will review and recommend changes to promote the Office's patent and trademark operations. This board will be comprised of 12 persons selected by the President and Congress who will serve for 4-year terms and who will meet at least quarterly. The Commissioner is required to consult with the board prior to changing or proposing to change fees or regulations. The board will submit an annual report containing its review of the Office to the President, the Commissioner, and Congress. 
In addition to the oversight of the Office's operations provided by the advisory board, I have included safeguards to ensure the new PTO remains accountable to Congress and its users. The new Office will have its own inspector general, who will be appointed by the President, to investigate waste, fraud, and abuse. The Office's annual financial statements will be audited by either an independent CPA or the Comptroller General, and the results of such audits shall be provided to Congress. Furthermore, the new PTO is required to submit annual management reports to Congress and business-like budgets to the President. These reports and budgets must include statements on cash flows, operations, financial position, and internal accounting and administrative control systems. 
Congress will continue to set the user fees for the new Office, and thus, control, to a large extent, the PTO's revenue stream. This should provide comfort to my colleagues and the PTO's users concerned that, with its new-found freedom, the Office will move into plush offices or pay its employees unwarranted sums. I realize the decision to keep the fee-setting authority with Congress is counter to most government corporations. Hopefully we can revisit this issue in a few years after we see how well the new PTO is performing. 
Mr. President, there is one last difference between S. 421 and the bill I introduced 2 years ago that I would like to discuss today and that involves the patent surcharge fee. When Congress created the patent surcharge fee in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, it was done to make the Office completely user fee funded, and therefore, to reduce the budget deficit. Although the surcharge, which amounted to an almost 70 percent increase in fees, was intended to be applied only to Patent and Trademark Office uses, Congress has diverted approximately $140 million over the past 6 fiscal years for unrelated purposes. Until this year, the administration has not advocated, nor even supported, such action. In the President's proposed budget for fiscal year 1998, however, over $90 million of the patent surcharge account will be applied for deficit reduction. In following fiscal years, the administration has proposed diverting all of the patent surcharge fees through 2002. 
As the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, I understand the strain on the administration and on this body to balance the budget. This is a goal supported by colleagues on both sides of the aisle. While I share the administration's budget priorities and commend the President for putting forth a budget that balances in 2002, I regretfully disagree with this component of his budget. Should this proposed diversion be enacted, the PTO would be prevented from hiring over 500 patent examiners this year, and patent pendency rates would double from the current 21 months to an estimated 42 months by 2003. The PTO projects that this delay will reduce PTO's revenues by over 
$400 million in lost issue and maintenance fees on top of the lost $570 million in surcharge fees. Not only will PTO suffer from this diversion, our economy will as well. Doubling the pendency times will slow the development of new technologies, hurt our productivity, and put us at a competitive disadvantage in the world marketplace. 
Mr. President, the legislation I introduced in the last Congress would have ended the patent surcharge fee in October 1, 1998. However, I am now convinced that the PTO needs the fees it should receive from the surcharge to make necessary hires and improvements to the Office's operations. Therefore, S. 421 continues the surcharge but reclassifies it as an `offsetting collection' like all other PTO user fees rather than an `offsetting receipt.' This modification to the 1990 OBRA would ensure that these fees are only applied toward PTO uses. 
Mr. President, although I might disagree with the administration on the surcharge diversion issue, the President and the Vice-President, in particular, deserve commendation for their support of reinventing the Patent and Trademark Office. The Vice President has been a tireless advocate on reforming Government and making it more responsive to the public. It is my understanding that the administration will soon send its own PTO reform legislation to Capitol Hill. The legislation I am introducing today is merely the starting point for discussion and I look forward to working with the administration to advance the concepts I have described above. 
I would also like to acknowledge the efforts of my colleagues and former colleagues in both Houses for their contributions on this issue. Unbeknownst to many Members, we came very close to enacting PTO government corporation legislation in the last Congress, largely due to the work of Senator Hatch and former Representatives Moorhead and Schroeder. I am pleased to note that Representative Moorhead's successor, Representative Coble, has continued the momentum and his Judiciary subcommittee favorably reported out a patent bill last week that contained a PTO government corporation section as well as protection against patent surcharge fee diversion.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on March 10, 1997, I introduced S. 412, the Safe and Sober Streets Act of 1997. I now ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.

<TEXT>
 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I introduce a bill that, if enacted, will go a long way toward reducing the deadly combination of drinking and driving. I am proud to stand with Senator Mike DeWine of Ohio in introducing this bill. The Safe and Sober Streets Act of 1997 sets a national illegal blood alcohol content [BAC] limit of .08 percent for drivers over 21 years of age. The bill gives States that have a limit above .08 BAC, 3 years to adopt .08 laws. States that fail to enact this limit will have a percentage of their highway construction funds withheld. 
Mr. President, drunk driving continues to be a national scourge that imposes tremendous suffering on the victims of drunk driving accidents and their loved ones. In 1995, drunk driving increased for the first time in a decade. That year, 17,274 people were killed in alcohol-related crashes. Every one of those deaths could have been prevented, had the driver decided to call for a ride, handed the keys to a friend, or did anything other than taking the wheel. 
Every 30 minutes someone in America--a mother, husband, child, grandchild, brother, sister--dies in an alcohol-related crash. The numbers are increasing. Our highways are turning into death traps and our concrete clover leaves into killing fields. 
Mr. President, we have made progress over the past few decades in the fight against drunk driving. In 1982, 53 percent of motor vehicle fatalities involved alcohol; today, alcohol-involved motor vehicle crashes is 40.5 percent. In 1984, I authored the bill that President Ronald Reagan signed into law to increase the drinking age to 21. Since 1975, 21 drinking age laws have saved roughly 15,700 lives. And, 2 years ago, Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law a zero tolerance bill with sanctions, making it illegal for drivers under 21 years of age to drive with any amount of alcohol in their system. 
While that shows promise, we know we must do more--17,274 lives lost is 17,274 too many. Instituting a national standard for impaired driving at .08 BAC is the next logical step in the fight against drunk driving. 
There are those who ask why the standard for impaired driving should be .08 BAC. But I think the better question is: why should the standard be as high as .10? We know that any amount of alcohol affects motor skills and driving behavior to some degree. A 1991 study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety indicates that each .02 increase in the BAC of a driver with nonzero BAC, nearly doubles the risk of being in a fatal crash. This means that the risk a driver faces begins much earlier than when his or her blood alcohol content is at .10 or .08, after the first or second drink. In fact, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA] reports that in single vehicle crashes, the relative fatality risk of drivers with BAC's of .05 and .09 is over 11 times greater than for drivers with a BAC of zero. 
Mr. President, .08 BAC is not an insignificant level. A 170 lb. male must consume four and a half drinks in 1 hour on an empty stomach to reach .08 BAC. This is not social drinking. 
While most States have .10 BAC as their legal limit, it is actually at .08 BAC where driving skills are seriously compromised. At that level, the vast majority of drivers are impaired when it comes to critical driving tasks. Braking, steering, speed control, lane changing, and divided attention are all compromised at .08 BAC. 
Thirteen States have .08 BAC limits, and many industrialized countries have .08 BAC limits or lower. Canada, Great Britain, Austria, and Switzerland have .08 BAC limits. France and The Netherlands have a .05 BAC limit. They adopted these laws because they know that they work. They work for these reasons: 
First, .08 BAC laws have proven to reduce crashes and fatalities. Most States that have adopted the .08 BAC level have found a measurable drop in impaired driving crashes and fatalities. A study conducted by Ralph Hingson, ScD. and published in the American Journal of Public Health showed that those States that adopted .08 BAC laws experienced a 16-percent decline in the proportion of fatal crashes involving fatally injured drivers whose BAC were .08 or higher. And, those same States experienced an 18-percent decline in the proportion of fatal crashes involving drivers whose BAC was .15 or higher. That means that not only did the rates decrease for overall drinking and driving, but also for drivers who were extremely impaired. This same study concluded that if .08 BAC were adopted nationwide, 500 to 600 lives would be saved annually. That alone should be enough to convince all of us that this should be a national standard. 
Second, .08 BAC laws deter driving after drinking. Crash statistics show that even heavy drinkers, who account for a high percentage of DWI arrests, are less likely to drink and drive because of the general deterrent effect of the .08 BAC. 
All of these facts, Mr. President, show us that .08 BAC needs to be a national standard, not just an option. Different standards lead to different perceptions, and in this case these differences can be deadly. In regions with high interstate traffic, a driver should not be considered `impaired' in one State, and then is legally sober by simply crossing a border. Pedestrians, passengers, and safe drivers should be protected no matter in which part of our nation they are. 
Mr. President, we know that .08 BAC laws work. We know that .08 BAC saves lives. It is incumbent upon us to make sure that .08 BAC laws are adopted. That's why my bill gives States 3 years to adopt .08 BAC laws. If a State does not meet that deadline, the Secretary of Transportation will withhold 5 percent of a State's total Interstate Maintenance, National Highway System, and Surface Transportation Program funding combined in fiscal year 2001, and 10 percent for each year thereafter until that State adopts the .08 BAC limit. 
Mr. President, sanctions work. While incentive grant programs allow States to decide whether to pass laws on their own, they are notoriously underfunded and States pay little attention. Since the inclusion of the .08 BAC limit as an incentive criteria, only seven States have passed laws due to that incentive. The Federal Government has a role to play to ensure that our highways and roads are safe, and that drunk driving is decreased. The public is on our side. We must not back down. 
Mr. President, .08 BAC limits save lives. This bill, if enacted into law, will work. I urge all my colleagues to join in the fight to decrease drunk driving, to make our roadways safer, and most important, to provide comfort to those victims of drunk driving and their families that the Federal Government stands behind them in the memories of their loved ones.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to take some time to talk about the vote that is pending tomorrow and the subject of the balanced budget amendment. We are coming to the close of yet another marathon debate on this subject, and I hope that I can crystallize the perspective and detail some of the major concerns of those of us who oppose this amendment. 
Mr. President, it is tempting, as the debate goes on, to accept right being on our side; the other side claims right and the moral imperative that says we should pass this balanced budget amendment, put it into the Constitution, open it up, have the courage to step forward. 
The courage is to be in the minority and say, `No,' though the most popular view is to amend the Constitution because the folks we represent, each of us in our States, really have not been made aware of what the penalty is if we lock ourselves into an amendment to the Constitution. 
We will be saying to people that in the future, programs that you relied on to sustain your family, to take care of your health care, to take care of your child's education, to take care of your unemployment insurance, may not be available, and if this country starts to slide into a recession, we may go the whole route. 
So, as we listen to the debate, it is very hard not to get to feeling rather sanctimonious about the side that we are on. I simply point out, as we talk about bipartisanship, and note that the Democrats are all of the votes in opposition, the 34 contemplated votes in opposition to the balanced budget amendment. Not the majority. The majority says, `We can't manage our own behavior; we have to be controlled by other strictures, we have to be told that we are not allowed to do these things,' not that we were sent here, elected to this honorific body, one of 100 out of 260 million people, who say we have the guts to stand up and make the decisions or pay the consequences. 
We talk about courage. The courage is to say, `No; we will accept the voters' decision in the future when we run for election if we insist on maintaining the posture as it is.' Good news brought us to this point, to where the budget deficit has been reduced by over 60 percent in the last 4 years, where job growth is up to 11 million new jobs, as major company after major company shrinks down, closes its doors, sends its jobs overseas. The good news is inflation is under control, that our percentage of deficit to GDP is the smallest among the advanced nations of the world and the envy of all the other countries. 
So, Mr. President, I would like to discuss four points that go to the heart of the debate and hope that we will stay the course as it is and say no to a balanced budget amendment and say yes to the American people, that we have the backbone to stand up to this debate and we are obliged to carry on your wishes. 
First, the evidence is mounting and the public tide is turning against this amendment. Economist after economist, newspaper after newspaper, academic after academic believes this amendment is bad for the Nation, and for good reasons. 
Two, we will balance the budget without a balanced budget amendment. 
Third, the balanced budget amendment could wreak havoc with the economy and the economic security of millions of Americans. 
And four, it would be almost impossible to undo the damage of a balanced budget amendment once the harm is done. 
On the first point, the mounting opposition to the balanced budget amendment is not confined to one group of Senators or Members of the House. It is also not limited, when we consider both bodies, to a particular party or segment of the political spectrum. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, former CBO Director Rudy Penner, former Solicitors General Robert Bork and Charles Freid, not to mention our former and esteemed colleague, Senator Mark Hatfield, have all weighed in against the balanced budget amendment. Even last year's Vice Presidential candidate, Jack Kemp, appearing on `Meet the Press' called the amendment `a recipe for future disaster in this country.' 
In the November 25, 1996, edition of Newsweek, conservative columnist George Will wrote: 
The Constitution should not be amended, unless there is a compelling reason to do so. 
He goes on to say: 
Current conditions do not constitute a compelling reason. 
In its November 15, 1996, lead editorial entitled `An Amendment is Poor Substitute for Backbone,' USA Today said: 
Drafting a balanced budget amendment is a waste of parchment. The history of balanced-budget measures show that. 
The Wall Street Journal, not exactly a bastion of liberal thought, labeled the amendment a `constitutional boondoggle,' calling the amendment a `flake-out.' The Journal went on to say:  
The notion of amending the Constitution to outlaw budget deficits is silly on any number of counts. 
The Washington Post, too, had a scathing review of the balanced budget amendment. In its January 30, 1997, editorial, `No to a Bad Amendment,' the Post concluded: 
This is a fake show of strength and abuse of the Constitution whose effect would be to harm the system of government it purports to help. 
The New York Times called it `an idea that looked good in the abstract but is dangerous in the reality.' 
And one of my home State newspapers in New Jersey, the Bergen Record, tagged the balanced budget amendment as `a misguided measure' and a `bad idea.' 
On the economic policy front, Federal Reserve Chairman Dr. Alan Greenspan, who is known for choosing his words carefully, recently expressed his reservations about the balanced budget amendment. At a January 21 Budget Committee hearing, in response to a question that I asked on the balanced budget amendment, Dr. Greenspan said: 
I have not been sympathetic to the specific details of most balanced budget amendments largely because I think they are very difficult to enforce, and I am terribly much concerned about the issue of employing detailed economic policy within the Constitution itself. 
Mr. President, on January 30, along with some of my colleagues, I joined with a message from over 1,000--it was printed in the paper--leading economists, including 11 Nobel Prize winners in economics, in speaking out against this amendment. At the press conference releasing this statement, one of the participants asked a very good question. He said: `Where are all of the conservative economists in favor of the balanced budget amendment?' 
The answer is that most of them are keeping a safe distance from it, and with good reason. The balanced budget amendment is fatally flawed economic policy. 
Mr. President, my second point is that we do not need this amendment. 
During the 1980's and the early 1990's, those who supported the amendment could point to historic increases in our annual deficits and the persistent unbalanced budgets submitted by both Republican and Democratic Presidents. Their concerns were understandable. In 1979, the deficit was $41 billion. In 1979 --almost 20 years ago--it was $41 billion or 1.7 percent of GDP. When President Clinton took office, the deficit was $292 billion and was expected to crest at $347 billion in 1997. The deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product stood at a whopping 4.9 percent. 
This staggering rise in the deficit led many to conclude that only a constitutional amendment could force the Federal Government to be fiscally responsible. The proponents pointed to the tide of red ink flooding the Nation and argued for this stop-me-before-I-spend-any-more amendment. 
But that sense of hopelessness has been now proven wrong. 
Since President Clinton took office, the deficit has gone down consistently and dramatically. Last year, it fell to $107 billion and 1.4 percent of GDP. It is now the lowest deficit, as a percentage of GDP, of any major industrialized country. President Clinton has a plan to make it balance in the year 2002, and it will be a real balanced budget, not this raincheck of an amendment that may be--and it is a big `may be'--redeemed at a later date. 
We have proven that the Congress and the President can be fiscally responsible. I want to state in the strongest possible terms that we do not need an outdated and dangerous constitutional gimmick to do the job. We can do the job on our own, and we will. 
Mr. President, my third point is that the balanced budget amendment is a catastrophe waiting to happen. Perhaps most importantly, it would substantially aggravate economic downturn and it could turn a slowdown into a recession and a recession into a great depression. For example, during the Bush recession, real GDP fell 2 percent. If the balanced budget amendment had been in place, real GDP might have declined by 4 percent or more. 
Last year, the Treasury Department issued a very interesting report on how a balanced budget amendment would have worsened the Bush recession. I want to quote from it. They said: 
A balanced budget amendment would force the government to raise taxes and cut spending in recessions--at just the moment that raising taxes and cutting spending will do the most harm to the economy and aggravate the recession. 
That is what the Treasury Department said. 
During a recession, we need every tool at our disposal to deal with the economic downturn. The Government must be nimble and responsive, but the balanced budget amendment autopilot could send the economy into a tailspin. One President tried to balance the budget during a recession. His name was Herbert Hoover, and the recession quickly became the Great Depression. 
I am also very concerned that the balanced budget amendment could eliminate many of the automatic stabilizers, like unemployment insurance that protects people during a downturn and cushions some of the pain. Under current law, if unemployment goes up, so do unemployment insurance payments. That not only helps the workers and their families, but it moderates the impact of a recession on industry. 
Secretary Rubin estimates that without our automatic fiscal stabilizers, unemployment in 1992 may have crested at 9 percent, instead of 7.7 percent, which would have meant more than a million additional jobs could have been lost. 
It is possible that eventually we could have found the three-fifths supermajority needed to waive the provisions to the amendment. But Congress moved slowly even without a supermajority requirement, and most likely by the time we had reacted to the unfolding slowdown, the damage would have been done. 
Another major problem with this balanced budget amendment is that it increases the likelihood that the Government will default on its debt. The amendment includes language that requires a three-fifths majority vote in both Houses in order to raise the debt limit. This little-known provision is extremely dangerous, as 
one can imagine, to have a small minority denying the ability to raise the debt limit when it could very well be essential. 
Mr. President, the Nation was taken to the brink of default in 1995. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed in that feverish atmosphere, and we were able to raise the debt ceiling by a simple majority vote. But what would have happened in 1995 if the supermajority rule had been in place? A minority, as I said, in Congress could have caused a default on our financial obligations. 
A default would have disastrous consequences. The Treasury would be prevented, at least temporarily, from issuing checks for Social Security, Medicare, and veterans benefits. Our creditworthiness would be shot. The Nation would suffer a profound and long-lasting increase in interest rates, harming all those who borrow. Homeowners making payments on adjustable rate mortgages would be especially hard hit. And these higher interest rates would make it even harder to balance the budget thereafter as the Nation would have to devote an even larger share of the budget to interest on the national debt. 
Mr. President, my fourth and last point is that there is no fail-safe, sunset or automatic review built into this amendment. Congress has passed far lesser measures that contain at the very least a sunset, a time when this automatically stops for review. A case in point is the line-item veto that was enacted into law last year and contains a 9-year sunset. 
But this balanced budget amendment, that is by far one of the most sweeping and dangerous pieces of legislation ever to come before the Congress, has none. This is most troubling to this Senator, as it should be to all Americans. 
What would happen if the balanced budget amendment caused the type of problems that I just outlined? Remember, this is not a simple piece of legislation. This is a constitutional amendment. Imagine our Nation, wracked by recession or, even worse, depression. Millions are out of work. Factories are shuttered. Bankruptcy and foreclosures are rampant. Because a constitutional amendment is in force, Congress could not take the quick and responsive action that may be necessary, as we did during the Bush recession. The only legal course of action left to us would be yet another constitutional amendment to repeal this bad one and undo the damage. 
But hang on a minute. The last time that happened was in 1933, over 60 years ago, when the 21st amendment was ratified repealing the 18th amendment to the Constitution. The 18th amendment was prohibition. It, too, was supposed to save us from ourselves and legislate backbone. It took 14 years to repeal it. 
During a depression we could not wait that long. The American people, who depend on our sound judgment and rely on our fiscal stewardship, certainly cannot wait that long. And neither should we. We should vote against this amendment. 
Mr. President, let me again emphasize that I agree with the need to be fiscally responsible, and I am committed to working toward a balanced budget. The President of the United States proposed a budget that balances in the year 2002. We have a challenge. Let us examine it. As the ranking Democratic Member of the Budget Committee, I believe we can reach a balanced budget agreement this year. But we can do it without this flawed constitutional amendment. 
The former majority leader of the Senate, Mike Mansfield, said that he owed the people of his State more than an echo; he owed them his judgment. It is my best judgment, Mr. President, that this amendment is bad for the people of New Jersey, as it is bad for the people all across our Nation. I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and oppose this amendment. 
I yield the floor and see my colleague, who is the right stuff, from Ohio about to take the floor. We will listen with interest.  
Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.

 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today, the President's rules against teenage smoking will go into effect. I applaud President Clinton for these new rules and for his leadership in fighting youth smoking. It's critically important. 
Mr. President, it's time to stop beating around the bush about tobacco. Tobacco is a deadly addictive drug. And those who deal in this drug are dealers in death. They're responsible for snuffing out the lives of thousands each year. And they should be held accountable. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, these deadly dealers also have tremendous political power. We saw evidence of this earlier this week, when a spokesman for the attorney general of Virginia said that the State would refuse to enforce, or even respect the validity of, this Federal rule against teen tobacco use. It was an outrageous and shocking statement. And although he has since backed off of it, the incident highlights the importance of protecting our children from big tobacco, and their deadly drugs. 
Mr. President, just this week, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, our Nation's drug czar, recognized that cigarettes are a gateway drug, and that we will not be able to effectively fight cocaine, marijuana, and heroin use unless we work to prevent cigarette smoking by children. Children who smoke are eight times more likely to use illicit drugs than those who do not smoke. Of adults who use cocaine, 83 percent smoked cigarettes as gateway behavior. 
Mr. President, it's now clear that the front lines of the drug war are not only in Bogota or Mexico City. They're right here in this country--in the corporate headquarters of tobacco companies and at our neighborhood convenience stores. The rule that goes into effect today will prevent kids from engaging in addictive behavior--behavior that could lead to other dangerous and illegal habits. As General McCaffrey has explained, prevention of Teen tobacco addiction is key to our national drug control strategy. 
Mr. President, the tobacco companies have been peddling these drugs to our kids for far too long. Although the industry denies that they target children in cigarette marketing, that's obviously not true. Consider this. How many 6 year olds do you think can identify Joe Camel as a symbol for smoking? The answer, incredibly, is 91 percent; 91 percent of 6-year-olds link Joe Camel with smoking. That, Mr. President, is not an accident. 
Mr. President, tobacco industry marketing doesn't stop with advertising. They also give away products that they know will appeal to kids. Over half of adolescents that smoke own at least one tobacco promotional item, such as a Tee-shirt, cap, sporting good, or a lighter. 
Today, as the first part of the President's rules will go into effect, we will begin the process of protecting our Nation's children from an industry that kills 410,000 Americans each year. And we can't let the tobacco lobby undercut this effort. 
The rule that goes into effect today would bar the sale of cigarettes to persons under the age of 18. Additionally, in order to ensure that no children slip through the cracks, stores would be required to check the identification of any individual who appears to be 26 or younger. This Federal rule is necessary because recent studies have shown that kids are able to buy cigarettes over the counter 67 percent of the time. 
I have seen evidence of this problem firsthand. I went along on a sting operation in my home State in which I witnessed children purchase cigarettes with ease. It was very disturbing, but typical. 
Mr. President, the rule that goes into effect today is a historic first step toward eradicating the epidemic of children's smoking plaguing our Nation. David Kessler, the outgoing Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration has called this problem a pediatric disease and he is right. Of the 3,000 kids who start smoking every day, 1,000 will die of smoking-related illness. 
So, Mr. President, I again commend the administration for their battle against teen smoking. And I pledge here and now that if anyone tries to undermine that effort, I will fight it every step of the way. 
After all, we're talking about saving lives here. The lives of our children and grandchildren. And all of us have a responsibility to stand up to the tobacco lobby, and do the right thing.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, that is very generous of my colleague. I will not take 20. 
Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague, the junior Senator from our great State of New Jersey, and I salute him for his initiative. 
Mr. President, I want to make it clear that I strongly oppose the balanced budget amendment. But if we are going to pass it, the least we should do is include the Torricelli amendment. Without it, the underlying balanced budget amendment would forever preclude our Nation from adopting what I believe is the essential nature of budgeting and investing in America--capital budgeting. 
As many of my colleagues know, I have long advocated dividing the Federal budget into separate capital and operating budgets. 
This is not budget or fiscal heresy. Quite the contrary. Most States do it. Almost every business does it. It's sound government. It's sound business. It's common sense. 
The balanced budget requirement that many States have affects only their operating budgets with capital budgets and pension funds excluded. Capital budgeting is a fundamental accounting principle employed by every major corporation in America. Fortune 500 companies use their borrowing power and creditworthiness to brag about their financial stability. 
I must admit that I am somewhat perplexed by my colleagues who support a balanced budget amendment. On the one hand, they say that we should operate the Government like a business. 
But on the other hand, they reject outright one of the most fundamental principles of operating a business--separate capital and operating budgets. Mr. President, you can't have it both ways. 
I come to the Senate from the business world and that experience gives me an invaluable and unique perspective. The company I founded with two friends, Automatic Data Processing, is the largest computing services firm in the world, and it employs 29,000 people in a number of countries. 
But it wasn't always that way. We grew that company from scratch, and we didn't do it with the type of budgeting required of the Federal Government today. We borrowed money. We took out loans. We didn't make across-the-board cuts or ask someone else to take the responsibility for making cuts. 
When I was CEO, I would look over my various departments, and say, I need more in marketing or more in product development or more in production. 
Mr. President, we budgeted those investments the way any business does. We didn't have a unified budget like the Federal Government. We had separate capital and operating budgets. We balanced our books in terms of day-to-day operations, and cut waste wherever we found it. But we weren't afraid to take out a loan for the long term. And those investments paid off. That's how most successful businesses do it. 
This is nothing radical, and it's certainly not confined to the business world. Families take out loans to finance homes and cars. Students rely on student loans to help finance their college education. States with balanced budget requirements float bonds and take on debt for capital expenditures. There's no reason why the Federal Government shouldn't do so as well. 
So if Congress wants to run the Government like a business, it will pass the Torricelli amendment. 
To get on the right track--the investment track--we must distinguish between short-term consumption and long-term investment spending. 
So far we have failed to recognize, let alone embrace, this elementary business practice. And as Government continues to underinvest in the long term, all Americans pay a big price. 
Public investment is crucial because these are investments that the private sector will not make on their own. Only Government will. 
The economic benefits of a first-rate education system, or a well-functioning transportation system, are spread throughout the economy making life better for all of us. These are capital investments. 
At a recent Budget Committee hearing on education, I emphasized my belief that greater public investment in education is of critical importance to our Nation's economic future. 
While parents fear for their children's future, and business worries about the quality of the work force, the ratio of workers to retirees is predicted to shrink to less than 2 to 1. Improving the output of our education system is not only desirable; it has become an imperative if our future work force will be able to support the growing number of retirees. 
The same is true with transportation. When we invest in roads, bridges, and transit, we lessen congestion and improve the efficiency of the economy for many years. 
I believe that the solution to many of our long-term investment problems is to create a separate capital budget. I see no other way to do it. 
So if my colleagues are serious about running this Government like a business--if they are serious about investing in America--they will vote for this amendment. If they don't, we will never have the chance to even consider capital budgeting and that would shortchange our great Nation. 
Mr. President, I commend my new colleague from New Jersey for his work here thus far. I salute him for this initiative. I think it is a very wisely developed thesis that this Government ought to operate just like other entities across our country, like the largest of the businesses, like virtually all businesses. When we talk about a capital budget, it is done for a sensible business purpose--the Government recognizes it--the depreciation of the asset over its life, and it entitles companies to take the value of the asset each year, charge that off to its operating statement so that you get an accurate picture of what it is that is being done within the company. And so it ought to be here. 
What we are talking about, almost forgotten in the recent debate, is the balanced budget amendment. I think it is fairly clear around here that this Senator stands in opposition to that balanced budget amendment. I have done whatever I could to assure that we are not going to permit the balanced budget amendment to become part of the Constitution. I think it would be poor judgment. I think it would be a poor tactic to have the Constitution amended to provide for a balanced budget when, in fact, if we look at the record--and that is one of the things, frankly, that astounds me at times--the record of the last 4 years has been quite spectacular when we examine the results of the Clinton leadership. 
The reduction in annual budget deficit has been enormous, some 60 percent, down to $107 billion last year. The CBO, our auditing arm, said in May that they thought we would be some $50 billion higher. And then in February they had to change their estimate to something considerably lower in a period of 8 months, with no understanding of the fact there was a dynamic change taking place. The same thing was true in an earlier year when the misestimate was by such an enormous amount that had we had a balanced budget in place, we would have made all kinds of adjustments, and we probably could have, without meaning to, sent this country into recession. 
Mr. President, the principal discussion here is how do we tell the truth to the American public about what is going on here? If we had a capital budget, I think it would be quite clear. Right now, we talk about obscure things. We talk about adjustments in the CPI. We talk about taking Social Security and other trust funds off budget. 
The fact of the matter is that we would be hamstringing ourselves with a balanced budget amendment that prevented us from responding to our national needs at any given time. Whether on the brink of recession, whether on the brink of war, whether on the brink of other national catastrophes, we would be limiting our capacity to operate. And I do not understand why we insist on doing that when, in fact, the record is good. 
The President has presented a budget that will be in balance in the year 2002. As a matter of fact, it is proposed there would be a surplus of some $17 billion at that time. 
But to my colleague from New Jersey, my junior colleague from New Jersey--I am not quite used to the ranks--but I want to say that this is a very thoughtful amendment that you have developed. You have not said where, when, precisely how--do not lock us out of having a capital budget as part of our accounting process in the future. 
I come from the corporate world. I ran a fairly large company--today, with 29,000 employees. I never would have dreamed of agreeing to a board of directors directive that said: OK, you can run this company, but understand what the conditions are under which you can run this company, that at the end of each year you are not allowed to be borrowing, not allowed to be doing anything else unless you prevent this company from having any kind of a deficit using an operating accounting process all the way through; when, if we erected a building, if we bought computer equipment, no matter what it was, you could not write it off over the life of the assets. Some of these assets are 40-, 50-year assets. Some of the assets we acquire in the Federal Government have lifetimes going way beyond that. 
If they said to me, those are the conditions, I would say this job cannot be done. You cannot restrict yourself in advance to certain conditions at the end of a year over which you have no control. If we had to cut back on expenses, I never took a wholesale approach to it and said, OK, cut marketing, cut product development, cut production, cut facilities. You could not do it that way. Each of these things requires thought. 
Here we are, 100 U.S. Senators, sent by people who elect us to represent them, unable, we are saying, unable to do it by ourselves. We need the constriction of a balanced budget amendment so we will all be good boys and girls here, so that we will remove the intuition, the judgment that we bring here from any decision we make because we want to be free of that kind of restraint. I, frankly, think that it shows very poorly in the public domain. 
I think we ought to do it the old-fashioned way. I think what we ought to do, as proposed by my colleague from New Jersey, is amend it if we can to be a better product, to amend that balanced budget amendment in case it does pass. And I hope it does not. In case it does pass, we ought to have conditions in there that permit us to operate in as free a condition as we can possibly do it. 
So, Mr. President, I see it as a fairly simple thing. The first thing we should do, look at the record, see where we are. I started to say before, I am astonished by the unwillingness of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to recognize what has been accomplished since President Clinton took over, whether it is 
the reduction in the deficit, the growth in jobs, the icons of American industry, companies with whom you could tie your future, never worry about another thing as long as they do work--gone, shrunken, dissolved, in many cases. The President found a way to replace many of those jobs by encouraging small business investment. We have over 11 million new jobs in this period of time. We have the lowest portion of deficit to GDP of any country. We are the envy of all the developed nations in the world. 
I looked at the expectation for the future, as we look at the budget proposal. Mr. President, in the next 5 years our economy is expected to grow by $2 trillion--$2 trillion of GDP in the next 5 years, at the same time, expecting, based on the numbers developed thus far, that we will have a surplus in our operations for the year without a capital budget, which, again, we should have, without adjustments, in the CPI. 
I think that it is imperative that we vote on the Torricelli amendment, that we give it as much support as we can. 
Mr. President, I hope, perhaps contrary to the view of some very good friends here, that in the final analysis, that despite the fact that I want this amendment to pass, I hope we do not attempt to balance the budget with a constitutional amendment. 
I yield the floor, and I once again commend my colleague.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of Senators DeWine, Levin, Inouye, Coverdell, Abraham, and myself, to introduce legislation that would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins commemorating the 150th anniversary of Thomas Alva Edison's birth. The introduction of this legislation today, February 11, is significant because Thomas Edison was born 150 years ago. 
Mr. President, few Americans have had a greater impact on our Nation, and our world, than Thomas Edison. He produced more than 1,300 inventions, including the incandescent light bulb, the alkaline battery, the phonograph, and motion pictures. 
In 1928, the Congress saw fit to award to Mr. Edison a Congressional Gold Medal `for development and application of inventions that have revolutionized civilization in the last century.' The legislation I am introducing today would once again honor one of the world's greatest inventors by issuing both commemorative and circulating coins with Mr. Edison's likeness. 
These coins not only would honor the memory of Thomas Edison, they would also raise revenue to support organizations that preserve his legacy. The two New Jersey Edison sites, the `invention factory' in West Orange and the Edison Memorial Tower in Edison, are both in need of repair. Irreplaceable records and priceless memorabilia are in danger of being destroyed because of moisture damage and structural problems. Each year, 9,000 young students visit the West Orange site to learn about the great inventor. Our legislation, at no cost to the Government, would provide the funds necessary to protect these and five other historical sites so that generations of schoolchildren can continue to visit them. 
Let me emphasize that this legislation would have no net cost to the Government. In fact, because circulating coins are a source of Government revenue known as seigniorage, this bill would reduce Government borrowing requirements, thereby lowering the annual interest payments on the national debt. An Edison commemorative coin program also has strong support among America's numismatists, whose interest is crucial to the success of any coin program. 
Mr. President, I introduced similar legislation at the end of the 104th Congress. I introduce it again on the 150th birthday of this great American inventor with the anticipation that my colleagues will join me in honoring the memory of Thomas Alva Edison while providing sorely needed funds to important historical sites.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to offer my strong support for Rodney Slater to be the next Secretary of Transportation. 
Mr. President, as Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, Rodney Slater has demonstrated the leadership, intelligence, and vision that is required to lead the Department of Transportation. I am confident he will do an excellent job as Secretary. 
During the past 4 years, Administrator Slater has overseen a $20 billion U.S. Highway System and a nationwide work force of 3,500. In that capacity, he transformed FHWA policies and programs to better serve the people and industries who rely on our highway system. He has also been a strong advocate for the advancement of women and minorities. 
As Secretary, Mr. Slater will play a critical role in ensuring that our Nation makes much-needed investments in our transportation infrastructure. I know he shares my commitment to that goal. Transportation generates 20 percent of our GNP, and every $1 billion invested in our transportation system yields more than 25,000 construction-related jobs. 
Investment in transportation is also necessary to keep us internationally competitive. Americans spend more than 1.6 million hours a day stuck in traffic, at a cost to U.S. businesses of about $40 billion per year. That's a burden our economy simply cannot afford. 
By reducing congestion, improving air quality and enhancing safety, effective transportation systems also improve our overall quality of life. 
This year we are facing renewed debate on the importance of transportation as we discuss the authorization of ISTEA. And I am pleased that Rodney Slater will be taking the lead for the administration in the reauthorization effort. 
Mr. President, ISTEA is a bold and innovative law that is helping to increase mobility, ensure access to jobs and sustain our environment for future generations. It has improved planning and flexibility, emphasized local decision making and encouraged new technology. 
Mr. President, we need to extend ISTEA to meet the transportation and economic challenges of the 21st century. We need to build on the legislation's innovative intermodal system. We should continue to promote State and local flexibility. We should continue to use technology, or so-called Intelligent Transportation Systems, to increase our capacity and efficiency. And we must maintain ISTEA's commitment to promoting safety. 
I believe Rodney Slater shares my commitment to these goals, and I am looking forward to working closely with him throughout the debate on ISTEA. 
Mr. President, as we develop so-called ISTEA Two, all of us will need to remember that the choices we make will directly affect the lives of millions of ordinary Americans. Our decisions will affect where and how we live. Where we work. How we'll get there. And how long it will take. 
In many cases, our choices also will be a matter of life and death for thousands of Americans. And we shouldn't forget that. We will be deciding the safety of our roads, our rails, and our air travel. Unfortunately, over the past 2 years, safety often has taken a back seat to other considerations. We have lost our national speed limit. We have lost our motorcycle helmet and seatbelt laws. And, meanwhile, the problem of drunk driving has worsened. In my view, it's long past time that we made safety a top priority. 
Mr. President, I raised this issue with Administrator Slater during the informational hearing in front of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. He assured me that safety is, and will continue to be, his top priority as Secretary of Transportation. I commend him for that commitment. 
Administrator Slater also assured me that he is an advocate for healthy transportation funding this fiscal year and in the years ahead. In the coming months, Congress and the administration will be working together to balance the budget. As that process moves forward, all of us who care about transportation will have to work hard to ensure that transportation is given the priority it deserves. 
Mr. President, I am confident that Rodney Slater will be a Transportation Secretary who will work to maintain our infrastructure, to preserve ISTEA, to enhance safety, and to ensure adequate funding for our transportation needs. I look forward to working closely with him to ensure that all Americans can travel safely and efficiently as we move into the 21st century.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, just a few hours ago, President Clinton delivered his 5-year balanced budget to the Congress. For the first time in a long while, no one was singing a funeral dirge on budget day. The budget is alive and it is well and already has a sense of momentum and history to it. This is a budget that reflects mainstream America. It does not favor one special group at the expense of another. It does not pit generation against generation or rich against poor. 
The President's budget reflects the hopes and the desires of all of our citizens, whether it is one of our seniors on a fixed income worried about health care or a family concerned about the quality of education of their children or citizens fighting the pollution in the neighborhood in which they live. The budget moves ahead toward the future without leaving anyone behind. 
As the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee, I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle this is a credible budget. Do not just knock it. Look at it and see if you want to recommend adjustments or amendments to it. It will reach balance by the year 2002. There are safeguards built into this budget to ensure that promise. 
President Clinton deserves a lot of credit for presenting a real balanced budget that builds upon the deficit reduction of his first administration. Since the President first took office, that deficit has been reduced consistently and dramatically to last year's low of $107 billion. I can remember when President Clinton took office that no one dreamed, no one thought it possible that we could have a budget deficit at that low level. It is now the lowest deficit as a percentage of GDP of any major industrialized country. There are no dark clouds on the horizon. The economy continues to grow and surpass most expectations. The Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Dr. Alan Greenspan, recently testified before the Senate Budget Committee: `The economy has retained considerable vigor, with few signs of the imbalances and inflationary tensions that have disrupted past expansions.' And last week we had more good news. The GDP grew at a 4.7 percent rate in the fourth quarter of 1996. 
The President has presented a forward-looking budget that not only demonstrates fiscal stewardship but is oriented toward the 21st century and its challenges and opportunities, what America needs to regain its full-time leadership across the face of the globe. It looks forward to the future but does not leave anyone behind. 
This budget protects Medicare. For example, rather than trying to impose radical and untested structural changes to Medicare, the President's budget ensures solvency through the year 2006 while at the same time crafting pilot and demonstration projects that will expand health choices for seniors without jeopardizing the quality of care. 
This budget also makes critical investments in education, transportation, environmental cleanup, investments that are necessary if we are going to have long-term economic growth and an improved standard of living. 
We must make sure, however, that any new caps on discretionary spending will allow these investments to continue, because if we do not, we will be forced to make deep cuts during this 5-year period in programs like computers in schools, highway modernization, safe drinking water grants, and community policing. 
I hope, too, that as this budget evolves, we will take a closer look at cutting special-interest tax breaks and subsidies to help offset the costs of making sound investments. The President has proposed about $34 billion of savings in this area, and we should consider this number only a beginning. 
Since we will spend over $2.8 trillion for tax breaks over the next 5 years, I think we can identify even greater savings in this area. The President's budget also includes $98 billion of tax relief for middle-class Americans, and it is targeted toward child care, college tuition, and buying and owning a home. 
Mr. President, this budget is an excellent starting point, and I believe the Budget Committee markup is the appropriate venue for Republicans and Democrats alike to resolve their differences. The American people deserve to know and everybody within the sound of my voice deserves to know the changes that the Republicans would like to make to the President's budget. If they think they can do better, OK. Look at it and try to make some decision. But they have an obligation to the American people to show `how,' `where,' and `when' and not simply carp. 
Mr. President, Senate Majority Leader Lott has called for the so-called regular order to produce a budget through the normal legislative process. I second that call. Regular order would be for the Budget Committee to conclude its hearings in a timely manner and then write a budget in early to mid March. At that point, either the Republicans would use the President's budget, or Chairman Domenici will have a chance to put down a budget of his own. Congress would then stand a chance of meeting the April 15 statutory deadline for producing a budget and the bipartisan goal of a balanced budget. 
Mr. President, as we move toward the balanced budget, we must also remember that we are Senators, not simply accountants. We have to look at any budget proposal and evaluate its impact on the American people, their lives and the economy. A budget--as the distinguished occupant of the chair knows from his professional background as a physician tending to people's needs --a budget is far more than numbers. A budget is programs like Medicare, Medicaid, educational opportunity, cleaner environment. A budget has to be a reflection of the American people, their needs, their dreams, their hopes. That is what this budget, frankly, is. I hope we will get to work quickly on a review of the budget if any changes are going to be recommended. 
As I said earlier, let's hear them. But I am encouraged by what I have heard to this point--not just those who want to hang a black drape and say it doesn't work, it won't go, it can't go, it shouldn't go, but rather a more reasoned approach, I think. We all know that we are on different sides of the aisle in terms of the parties, but I am talking about a more reasoned approach that says maybe this budget is one that we can work from, or work to, and we can get ourselves a budget that reflects the interests of both of our parties, our country, and our people. 
It is time for a reasoned discussion. It is time for a deliberate discussion for a serious review. And I am optimistic about the possibilities of being able to say to the American people that we did just what they wanted us to do. We got over the bipartisan squabbling. We are not fighting anymore. What we are trying to do is to do what our constituents sent us here to do, and that is solve the problems, folks, don't just argue about them. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Alan Hantman of New Jersey, who will soon become the next Architect of the Capitol. 
Mr. President, Mr. Hantman is eminently qualified for this position, and has a long and successful track record. Most recently, he served as vice president of facilities planning and architecture at Rockefeller Center from 1986 until mid-July of last year. 
As Architect of the Capitol, Mr. Hantman will be responsible for the maintenance of a large and varied Capitol complex. I know he will do an outstanding job. Over the past 30 years, he has earned the respect of many in his profession, who know him to be a man of great competence and leadership. 
Mr. President, the Capitol is a very special place, not only for those of us fortunate enough to work here, but for all Americans. Indeed, the image of our Capitol dome is a symbol of freedom and liberty throughout our world. 
We are fortunate that this special symbol, and the great complex of which it is a part, will be in the hands of someone as competent as Alan Hantman. I wish him all the best in his new position.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, just so our new colleague from Wyoming understands, this was the order that was agreed to under unanimous consent, and therefore, since he is waiting, I want to explain that this was not just being discourteous; it had been set that way. The junior Senator from Wyoming will get used to some of those things off in the corner. He may not like it, but it works out.

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, while I am on the floor, I want to express some disappointment at the introduction today by my friend and colleague, Senator Chafee, of a comprehensive bill amending our Federal hazardous waste cleanup law, better known as Superfund. 
This bill was introduced without consultation with any of the Democrats or with the administration. My staff, and those of the ranking member on the Environment and Public Works Committee, did not see a copy of this bill until late this morning. If we are to make reforms to Superfund this year--and it was hoped we would do it last year and the year before--it is critical that we work together in a bipartisan manner. 
Today's bill introduction is not a positive first step toward that bipartisanship. Enacting any Superfund legislation this year is going to require Members of both parties in the House of Representatives and in the Senate to work together. It will also require all of us to work with the President and EPA Administrator Carol Browner. 
In addition, Madam President, it would require us to appreciate that times have changed since the debate over Superfund reauthorization began in the late 1980's. The administration has made wide-ranging administrative proposals that have made a real difference, and this is not the same Superfund program of years past. 
We have learned a lot. We have improved its processing. We have reduced the possibility of heavy litigation costs. I want to be clear, I support changes to Superfund that would speed cleanups, reduce litigation, increase equity, save money, and protect the health and environment of those who live near Superfund sites. But, Madam President, it is important to do this right. We should not be shifting costs from polluters to taxpayers, and the President has made it very clear that he will not abide by that either. 
So, Madam President, I hope that the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will closely examine the administrative reforms already undertaken before moving forward on changes to the Superfund program. I hold this up as an example of what is in here, introduced this morning without consultation. This is not a way to get ourselves a bipartisan kickoff to this very important reauthorization program. 
I look forward, as I have for many years, to working with our distinguished colleague, Senator Chafee, and Senator Bob Smith from New Hampshire and others, to find common ground. I want to reauthorize Superfund, but I would like to do it in a way that is fair to taxpayers and in a way that is going to work. 
I yield back the time on the Democrats' side reserved. How much time is left?

Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, today along with Senators Daschle, Baucus, Moynihan, Graham, Harry Reid, Boxer, Wyden, Levin, Torricelli, Sarbanes, and Breaux, I am introducing the Brownfields and Environmental Cleanup Act of 1997. This legislation is designed to foster the cleanup of potentially thousands of toxic waste sites across this country, and just as importantly this bill is about jobs, about revenue, and economic opportunity, because it will help turn abandoned industrial sites into engines of economic development. 
Madam President, I have been interested for a long time now in the issue of these abandoned, underutilized and contaminated industrial sites, commonly known as brownfields. Our Nation's great industrial tradition was the lifeblood of our Nation's economy. But this industrial tradition also entailed tremendous environmental costs. Sites were contaminated, and then when the manufacturers, the companies left, the legacy remained behind. Today, decaying industrial plants define the skyline and contaminate the land in many of our urban areas. Their rusting frames, like aging skyscrapers, are a silent reminder of those manufacturers that left, taking inner-city jobs and often inner-city hope with them. 
Yet, Madam President, in these foul fields may lie the seeds of urban revitalization, and I continue to feel as I did when I introduced similar legislation in 1993 and 1996, that a brownfields cleanup program can spur significant economic development and create jobs. This type of cleanup initiative makes good environmental sense and good business sense. To appreciate, one need only look at a few of the brownfields success stories from across the States. Now, these are sites again that do not qualify as a Superfund site because they are not toxic enough, but they lie there and they contaminate not only the aesthetics of the area but also the opportunity for jobs and for business investment. 
A pilot project in Cleveland resulted in $3.2 million in private investment, a $1 million increase on the local tax base, and more than 170 new jobs. In Elizabeth, NJ, a former municipal landfill will be turned by the fall of 1998 into a major mall with 5,000 employees. 
Madam President, the potential for job creation across the country is enormous, and every revitalized brownfields may represent for someone a field of dreams, especially to an unemployed urban worker. 
While fostering jobs, brownfield cleanup also means that dangerous contaminants are removed from our environment, and the scars of decades of neglected industrial waste which disfigure our cities and suburbs and even rural areas may be finally allowed to heal. The Superfund Program provides Federal authority to assist in cleaning up abandoned waste sites that pose the most serious threats. However, there are in this country of ours 100,000 of these brownfield sites that do not fall under Superfund because of lower levels of contamination. 
What do we do? We can't just watch them keep these communities from revitalizing themselves. The risks posed by many of these sites may be relatively low and others even nonexistent, because brownfields are abandoned or underutilized industrial or commercial sites where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or even perceived, not really factually established, environmental contamination. But their full economic use is being stymied because there is no ready mechanism for getting them evaluated or, if necessary, cleaned up, even when the owner of the property is ready, willing and eager to do so. 
In addition, prospective purchasers and developers are reluctant to get involved in transactions with these properties because of their concern, however minimal, they might potentially create enormous environmental liability. 
The challenge is to turn these abandoned properties into thriving businesses that can generate needed jobs and act as a catalyst for economic development. 
My legislation would provide financial assistance in the form of grants to local and State governments to inventory and evaluate brownfields sites. This would enable interested parties to know what would be required to clean the site and what reuse would best suit the property. 
My bill would also provide grants to State and local governments to establish and capitalize low-interest loan programs. These funds would be loaned to current owners, prospective purchasers and municipalities to facilitate voluntary cleanup actions where traditional lending mechanisms are just not available. The minimum seed money involved in the program would leverage substantial economic payoffs, as well as turning lands which may be of negative worth into assets for the future. 
The bill also would limit the potential liability of innocent buyers of these properties, and it would set a standard to gauge when parties couldn't have reasonably known that the property was contaminated. So there is no hidden liability in there. There is no sudden surprise for someone who conscientiously and innocently made an investment, and suddenly they find they are liable for far, far more than their initial investment. 
Madam President, cleaning up brownfields will mean a safer environment and more jobs for places that badly need them. It will also send a message to those who want to invest in our urban areas that they don't have to leave the inner city in search of open space. They can build right there in our downtowns, the places that already have the services, the infrastructure and the people to do the job. 
There has been bipartisan interest, Madam President, in addressing brownfields, both in the Senate and in the other body on the other side of the Capitol. I am hopeful we can move this legislation forward in a cooperative way with support of Members on both sides of the aisle.
