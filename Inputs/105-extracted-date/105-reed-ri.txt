 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I speak today about passage of the conference report on the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, S. 1260. Recently, the report was agreed to by both chambers of Congress and sent to the President for his signature. 
I supported the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as well as S. 1260. I did so because I recognize the national nature of our markets as well as the need to encourage capital investment. I am pleased that we have been able to further these goals through this legislation. However, I am concerned by the attempt of a few to lessen the obligations owed investors. 
Particularly troubling has been the incorrect use of legislative history to imply that a defrauded investor, now barred from discovery prior to the adjudication of a motion to dismiss, must include, in a pleading, evidence of conscious attempts to defraud by the defendant. First, no such implication was made by the 1995 bill. Second, no bill would have passed if such implications were included in the 1998 legislation. Thus, allegations of motive, opportunity, and recklessness, as well as conscious fraud, continue to satisfy the requirements of a 10b(5) pleading. This is the rigorous, but time-tested standard for pleading which has been applied in the Second Circuit. This is the standard that we adopted in 1995, and the national standard created by S. 1260. 
The legislative history most frequently cited incorrectly is the Presidential veto message which accompanied his rejection of the 1995 bill; a veto which was overridden. I cannot understand why any weight would be given to the President's interpretation of a bill he vetoed. The purpose of any veto message is to portray the bill as negatively as possible, to avoid a veto override. Accusations the President made about the pleading standard were not only overblown, they were specifically rejected during debate after the veto and prior to the veto override. 
Mr. President, as the Senate considered partially preempting state law, many Senators, including the primary sponsors of the bill, made clear that preemption would only occur if the federal standard insured investors protections from fraud. Most importantly this means a proper pleading standard and scienter requirement. This view was shared by Chairman Levitt of the Securities Exchange Commission. This is reflected in Chairman Levitt's testimony before Congress, in correspondence between the SEC and the Senate sponsors of the bill, as well as in statements by Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman D'Amato and the Ranking Member of the Securities Subcommittee, Senator Dodd. 
Recent events in foreign markets have made all too clear the havoc that results when investors are not fully apprized of substantial risks and rewards associated with investments. The Senate made clear that, in enacting partial preemption, it would not tolerate implementation of untested standards concerning the obligations owed investors. Nor, might I add, did industry proponents of the bill ask for a lessening of these standards.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I respectfully point out that the letter was sent during the Conference Committee negotiations on the bill and illustrates the fact that the Senate was unwilling to alter positions it established in Senate passage of S. 1260. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify the debate surrounding this issue. I commend Chairman D'Amato and Senator Dodd for their work on this bill. They have furthered the goal of capital formation while ensuring proper protections for consumers.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Senate's confirmation of Margaret Ellen Curran as U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island. I am proud to have been involved in the historic nomination of this outstanding career prosecutor. A native of Providence, Meg is the first woman to serve as Rhode Island's federal attorney. Her confirmation by the U.S. Senate today sends a clear message to career federal attorneys that their work and service is valued. 
Ms. Curran brings not only the necessary legal expertise and technical skill to this position, but she has also demonstrated the prosecutorial temperament necessary to carry out her significant responsibilities in a fair and judicious manner. I am confident that U.S. Attorney Curran will serve Rhode Island and its people extremely well. 
Ms. Curran graduated from Pilgrim High School in Warwick. She received a B.A. degree from the University of Pennsylvania, a Master of Science from Purdue University, and her law degree from the University of Connecticut School of Law, where she was Editor in Chief of the Law Review. After graduation, Meg served as a law clerk to the Honorable Bruce Selya, then a federal district judge in Rhode Island. She nexted served a clerkship for the Honorable Thomas Meskill on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. After her second clerkship, in 1985, Meg became an associate at the Providence law firm of Wistow & Barylick pursuing general litigation matters. 
Since 1986, when she joined the U.S. Attorney's Office in Rhode Island, Meg has distinguished herself as an outstanding prosecutor. As a trail prosecutor, Meg tried a range of cases involving white-collar criminals, organized crime, illegal weapons possession, and was responsible for obtaining the largest monetary penalty, at the time, for the illegal discharge of pollutants into Narragansett Bay. 
In 1990, Meg was appointed as the district's Principal Appellate Attorney and Appellate Chief. In that position she has had primary responsibility for all appeals. As Appellate Chief she has successfully pursued precedent setting cases involving both mandatory sentencing for career criminals as well as heightened penalties for dealers of dangerous drugs. 
Meg has proven herself an accomplished trial and appellate attorney, and, for this, she has been recognized. She has received the annual Special Achievement Awards for Sustained Superior Performance of Duty from the Department of Justice four times. In 1993, she was named the Federal Employee of the Year by the Federal Executive Council of Rhode Island. Today, the United States Senate has provided her with the ultimate recognition of a career prosecutor by confirming her as U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island. 
In addition to her professional service, Meg has also found time to serve her community. Since 1995, Meg has been an adjunct professor at Roger Williams University School of Law, teaching advanced criminal procedure. She is a member of the Rhode Island Bar Association and serves on the Federal Bench/Bar Committee. Meg also serves on the First Circuit Gender Bias Task Force and is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Rode Island Zoological Society. 
Mr. President, I am proud to have been involved in the nomination of U.S. Attorney Curran. I wish her, her husband Michael, and their daughter Margee the very best.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, it is a bittersweet task that brings us back to Washington for one last vote before the end of the 105th Congress. Today, we will complete our work on the fiscal year 1999 budget. 
To be sure, there is much that I like about the Conference Report before us, but there are some provisions that I strongly disagree with. On balance, however, it is a budget that is worthy of support. 
Like many of my colleagues, I must lament the process that has brought us to this point--20 days after the start of the fiscal year. The Conference Report that we are about to vote on is almost 4,000 pages long. We have been given only a few hours to examine it. None of us knows the complete contents of the legislation, and there has been no opportunity to debate or offer amendments. 
Fortunately, we have avoided a budgetary train-wreck similar to the one that closed down the government in 1995. But, Mr. President, this year the train is extremely late, and to hear the debate in this chamber, nobody wants to take responsibility for driving the engine. 
We have subverted the regular budgetary process, failing even to pass a Budget Resolution. The majority could not reconcile its own discordant priorities to pass this blueprint legislation, which is required by law. 
On this side of the aisle, we had a definitive agenda: preserve the budget surplus to save Social Security, invest in education, pass health care reform legislation, pass campaign finance reform, and pass legislation to prevent the tobacco industry from preying on our youngsters. 
The President made these goals clear in his State of the Union Address and later with his fiscal year 1999 budget proposal. Claims that the priorities on this side were hidden until the very end are false. We have been here all along, working toward goals that the American people recognize as important, and we have had some success in achieving these goals in this legislation. There are a few provisions of the Conference Report that I would like to highlight: 
This legislation preserves the surplus to help save Social Security. 
It includes $1.2 billion for efforts to reduce class-size, of which $5.6 million would be awarded to my home state of Rhode Island. The omnibus bill also allocates funding to improve teacher preparation and recruitment, a cause that I was actively involved with during the drafting of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998. 
The budget bill also includes funding for critical reading legislation--$260 million to help address the serious declines in literacy levels that have left 40% of America's fourth graders without basic literacy skills. The newly created GEAR UP program would receive $120 million under the bill. This ambitious new initiative will help encourage youngsters living in high poverty areas to pursue their higher education goals. 
Finally, this Conference Report contains $33 million for the construction of as many as five new Job Corps centers, including one in Rhode Island, which is one of only four states currently without a center. 
On the negative side, $800 million in subsidies for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was slipped into this legislation. Neither House of Congress included this level of funding in its version of the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. The omnibus package also retains a poorly constructed rider that prevents the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) from conducting inspections on small farms in response to fatal accidents involving minors. I am committed to addressing both of these issues next year. 
This Conference Report is also bad for what it does not contain. In particular, it lacks funding for school construction, which is required to help meet the $121 billion need for new and refurbished schools, nor does it include an important bipartisan initiative authored by Senators Jeffords and Kennedy to help individuals with disabilities join the workforce while maintaining their essential Medicare and Medicaid coverage. 
Finally, it fails to adequately fund the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership (LEAP), a federal-state program that is a major source of higher education grant aid. I worked hard with the other authors of the Higher Education Act Amendments to reauthorize and improve this program, and I believe the failure to sufficiently fund LEAP is short-sighted. 
Mr. President, there is much that could be done to improve this Conference Report, but we must pass it to keep the government open. It is unfortunate that we have been put in the position of having to vote up or down on this hefty omnibus package with no opportunity to offer amendments, no opportunity for a substantive debate, and little chance to review the measure itself. Fast-Track budgeting at the end of a Congress is no way to make up for time squandered at the beginning. I hope that this is the last time we follow this kind of eleventh-hour, gerry-rigged process.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I first want to thank Senator Kennedy for yielding me time and I add my commendation along with that of my colleagues to both Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for the remarkable work they have done. This has been a long process, but it has been one that has been very positive, collaborative, and collegial. Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy have been very supportive of efforts by all the members of the committee and Members of this Senate to incorporate, to improve, and to bring forth today legislation of which I think we can all be proud. 
This legislation does so much to improve the quality of educational opportunity in the United States. One of the keys to our country, not just its economic prowess but its social progress, is the ability of all of our citizens to go on to higher education. This bill will advance that goal significantly. I applaud all of those who participated in this process. 
As my colleagues have mentioned, there are many important aspects of this legislation that should be noted. First of all, there is an increase in the authorization of the Pell grant, which will allow, particularly many low-income students, further access to higher education. There is a reduction in the interest rates which students will pay on loans, which will help them bear the burden of the ever-increasing cost of college. There is loan forgiveness for teachers, a revamping of our early intervention efforts, and a strengthening of the TRIO Program, which is a very important program that targets low-income students who will be the first in their family to attend college. Without TRIO, these students may not have the guidance, the information, and the support to make it into and stay in college. Also, there has been some significant effort to begin to address cost issues with respect to college education. 
All of these are commendable, but there are two very important issues which I would like to stress. First, this Senate last year restored the State Student Incentive Grant Program, a very important program which takes limited Federal resources, matches them with State dollars, and provides grants to needy undergraduate and graduate students. The Conference Report contains legislation I introduced with Senator Collins to reform this program. It is now the LEAP Program, the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership Program. This revamped program will be a continuation and a strengthening of our commitment to ensure that all Americans have access to quality higher education. 
Also, there is a very, very strong teacher training title in this bill. Again, I thank both Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their efforts in this regard. We built on legislation I proposed, and we created a situation in which now there will be incentives for teacher colleges to have active partnerships with elementary and secondary schools. 
We are trying to move in a direction of more clinical training for teachers. One of the sad commentaries I have heard--and I am sure my colleagues have also--is that for so many teachers, on the first day of school, it is practically their first day in a classroom as a teacher. This should change. This approach of partnerships between higher education institutions and elementary and secondary schools, particularly one partnership model known as professional development schools, is a positive way to increase the professional development of our teachers, which could be the single most important factor in improving and reforming education in the United States today. 
This legislation is not perfect, but it is a remarkable achievement based upon cooperation and a collegial approach to this issue. 
I commend and thank my colleagues, particularly the chairman, Senator Jeffords, and the ranking member, Senator Kennedy, for all of their work. I look forward to the speedy acceptance of this conference report. 
I yield back my time to the Senator from Massachusetts.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Patients' Bill of Rights and join my colleagues, Senator Kennedy, Senator Graham, Senator Harkin, and many others in urging that this very important legislation be brought to this floor immediately, debated thoroughly, and passed. 
When I go back to my home State of Rhode Island, I encounter lots of issues. But there is no issue that is more important to my State and to this Nation than having a health care system that works for them, having a health care system that is governed by rules which require that people get what they pay for. There are thousands and thousands of individuals who are paying for managed care coverage, thousands and thousands and thousands of companies that are providing coverage. The shocking thing is that many times people discover they really do not have the coverage they need when they need it. With the Patients' Bill of Rights, we are going to provide a framework of sensible rules which will guarantee access to quality health care coverage for the vast majority of Americans. 
The Democratic bill, S. 1890, does that. In stark contrast to the Republican proposal, it will provide broad coverage to the American people. As illustrated by this chart, the only group of people covered by the Republican proposal are just those who are covered through a self-funded employer plan, only 48 million Americans. The Republican bill leaves out 113 million Americans. It leaves out people whose employer provides coverage through an insurance policy or an HMO directly. It leaves out State and local government workers and people buying individual health insurance policies. 
I hope that we can at least agree that if we are going to do something with respect to reforming managed care in the United States, we will do something that covers all people who are insured by HMOs throughout the United States. 
As my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, just pointed out, when you leave out State and local government workers, you are leaving out police officers, firefighters--those people who not only do we depend upon, but people who we hope will have access to high-quality care. That is just one example of groups of people who are denied protections under the Republican version but will be provided these protections under the Democratic bill, S. 1890. 
Throughout this debate, we have heard a lot about what we must do with respect to health care. Again, as my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, pointed out, the Democratic bill is supported by the broadest possible coalition of health care organizations. Here is a partial list of those organizations: The American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, the National Association of Children's Hospitals. Every major health care organization in the United States has recognized the need for protections with respect to managed care and has recognized the value of S. 1890, the Democratic bill, and is strongly supportive of this proposal. 
We have people throughout this country demanding that we take appropriate action. We have every major organization committed to the health and welfare of this country and its people--all of them--together asking us to act. And yet here we find inaction; we are not able to bring this bill to the floor for a thorough debate and for a vote. I think that is wrong, and I think we are not doing our job as representatives of the American people. Congress is not responding to one of the critical needs of every family in this country: Providing high quality health care for all families. 
My focus throughout the debate has been to ensure particularly that children are treated fairly by managed care health care plans. If a family has a problem with a managed care plan, it is serious. When it is an adult, a mother or father, it is serious. But it is particularly serious, and many times tragic, when it involves a child. 
Earlier this year, I introduced legislation that deals specifically with the issue of children in managed care. This legislation was prompted by my own observations and advice I received from the American Academy of Pediatrics, by the National Association of Childrens Hospitals, by many pediatric specialty organizations--all of these groups together pointed out to me that we just can't consider children as small adults. If a child has a particular condition, the expertise needed to deal with that pediatric condition is not something gained generally in medical education. Pediatric specialists are vital to our health care system because they can treat the unique needs of children. Children often need access to these specialists, and frequently they are denied that type of care. 
Earlier this year in the Labor Committee, we heard the story of Melissa Froelich. I have a picture of Melissa right here. She is 2 years old and has become the poster child for the American Red Cross. As this poster describes, `Melissa spent her first 18 months in a hospital clinging to life. Thanks to medical miracles and blood donors like you, she is finally home and doing well.' I would imagine her parents would hasten to add something along the lines of, `No thanks to the managed care plan' because her medical ordeal was matched by a bureaucratic ordeal waged by her parents, particularly her mother, on her behalf. 
Melissa was born with serious congenital heart defects. In the first 2 years of her life, she spent a great deal of time in and out of hospitals. Her mother, Staci Froelich, had to fight a battle every day, a relentless battle to get Melissa the kind of care she needed and deserved and that they had paid for. 
Staci Froelich is a registered nurse, a licensed nursing home administrator. She is someone very sophisticated in the way the system operates. I hesitate to speculate what would have happened if Melissa's mother hadn't had that kind of expertise--if she were, like so many Americans, not prepared to deal with all the bureaucratic red tape, all the hurdles that HMOs can throw up when they deny coverage and deny care. 
She persevered, and she did it day in and day out. In her words, this is what her struggle was like:  
My husband and I are responsible middle-class American citizens. We were both employed and had two healthy children. We took out the best health insurance policies our places of employment had to offer. We believed if there were ever a medical emergency, we would be covered. After all, we had done everything in our power to have the necessary coverage should that occur. We were in for a rude awakening. 
With the birth of Melissa, with her serious heart problems, they found out that literally that their HMO didn't provide much coverage at all when they needed it most. This HMO forced this family to jump through repeated hurdles. For example, after Melissa's first open heart surgery, the HMO wanted to transfer her to a nursing center for senior citizens. Can you imagine that, an infant being sent to a senior citizens nursing home facility where the only specialists are geriatricians, not pediatricians? That is what the HMO wanted to do to save some money. Of course, her mother had to fight tooth and nail to prevent that from happening. 
This example illustrates something else that underlies my concerns: The presumption by many HMOs that a child is no different from an adult, and if there is an open bed in a senior nursing center, send the child there. That is not the type of care that those parents expected to get for their child when they paid their premiums and when they sought out the best coverage they could. 
During the course of Melissa's illness, oftentimes the HMO would try to switch her specialist or try to suggest she didn't need pediatric specialists. All of this added up to an ordeal on top of the basic ordeal of a very sick child. In this country, we should not tolerate that situation. 
I am happy to say, as Melissa's picture demonstrates, she is a thriving, beautiful child of 2 years--the result of her family's efforts, the result of many people, but certainly not the result of a health care system that was out there to assist her and to provide for her family. 
Her story illustrates all too well what we hear constantly: every day consumers face difficulties to get the services that they need, they face delays, complex rules and regulations which an average lay person can't understand. We can change this situation if we act promptly and timely, and if we act immediately to bring this legislation to the floor. 
Managed care has provided great benefits to our country, particularly when it comes to preventive services. The emphasis on prevention is good. But all too often we hear stories like Melissa's story, and other stories, where the system is not working to the benefit of the public, and where people are not getting the health care services they've paid for. It is our responsibility to make sure that this situation does not continue. 
We also sometimes look at HMOs and think, `Well, maybe they've got some problems, but maybe the problems are not really being addressed here.' There was a study done at the University of California at San Francisco by Elizabeth Jameson at the University of California. She compared the pediatric care provided to children by private and public managed care plans. 
Frequently people consider Medicaid and say, `Well, that's not top-grade health care because that's a public health care program for low-income Americans and, you know, it is not good compared to some of the large employer programs, the blue chip HMOs.' Her study was very revealing though. It found that low-income children in California s Medicaid program received age-appropriate care that is consistent with recognized clinical guidelines, while those in private health care plans often did not. 
In effect, there was a better chance for a child in the California Medicaid system to have access to a pediatric specialist, to have the kind of focused specialized care that we assume would be found in the HMOs. Certainly, both the employer and the employee are paying a lot of money for those HMO premiums. I assume that he or she believes that all that money is buying care at least as good and probably better than what you would find in a public program. But the reality is, that is not the case. This is another indication that we should act to improve the quality of health care that is delivered by HMOs throughout this country. That is, we should pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
This study in California also found that some managed care plans impose restrictions on referrals to pediatric specialists. Jameson also found that complex pediatric diseases are being treated by providers without pediatric expertise when, in fact, a pediatric specialist would provide more appropriate care. All of this, again, suggests that we have to act promptly to pass this bill to ensure that the American public gets what it is paying for: Good quality care through managed care plans. 
Again, I am particularly pleased that the Democratic bill incorporates many of the provisions from my legislation that would deal particularly with the problems of children and managed care. The Democratic bill includes, for example, a guarantee of access to necessary pediatric services, and appeal rights that address the special needs of children, such as an expedited review if the child's life or development is in jeopardy. 
Again, here is another example where adults and children differ. Children have special needs, not just with their present health state like adults, but also with their development. And if our insurance plans are not keenly attuned to the developmental aspects of children, they are going to provide inferior care. So this legislation would require HMOs, in the context of appeals rights, to consider not just the present health status of the child as they do with adults, but also with the child s development. 
Also, the Democratic bill would require pediatric expertise in staff performing utilization review. Under our proposal, when the HMO is examining the use of services for a child, the HMO would have to ensure that reviewers had pediatric expertise. Too often today HMO plans' utilization review is solely in the context of adults. This practice overlooks our children, and overlooks the fact that children often have very different health care needs than adults. 
The bill would also require that HMOs give information to parents about quality and satisfaction related to the treatment of children. This information should be easily obtainable so that when a parent signs up for a health care plan, they will know upfront what to expect for their children. They will not have to wait until that child has a serious, serious illness. 
All of these provisions are incorporated in the legislation that we should be debating here in the Senate today. All of this is incorporated in the legislation that has been endorsed by over 18 organizations whose sole commitment is to the health care quality of the American people. 
The Patients Bill of Rights legislation, too, will cover the vast majority of Americans. It will cover all who are in private health care plans, unlike the Republican alternative. In the days ahead, we have to make critical choices. I can think of no more important issue to debate, to discuss, and to act upon than improving the quality of health care in the United States, passing the Patients' Bill of Rights, giving each American family an opportunity to know what they are getting, and ensure that they are getting the health care they are paying for. 
I hope we can do that. I hope that this debate will begin. I hope that we can go back to our states in a very few weeks and report to the American people that we have listened to their concerns, we have listened to what they feel is important and that we have acted in their best interests by passing the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. REED. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, my amendment is a very straightforward attempt to find additional resources to help neighborhoods that surround airports and are confronting the problem of airport noise. My State of Rhode Island is home to one of the fastest growing airports in the country, T.F. Green Airport. Indeed, over the past two years, T.F. Green has seen roughly an annual increase of 55 percent in passenger traffic. This is compared to a national average increase of 4 percent a year. So you can well appreciate that the impact of additional flights coming in has caused severe noise problems around the airport. 
This has been a source of great strength, the growth of T.F. Green, in terms of our economy; it has brought visitors; it has become a gateway to New England. It has created jobs. All of these are extremely positive. But it has also generated increased noise with increased numbers of flights. The Rhode Island Airport Corporation, the city of Warwick, and community groups are working together. We have been successful in securing grants from the FAA for noise abatement. But I think we have to do much more to ensure that all the homes that need soundproofing with all of the techniques that we can use to mitigate and minimize noise are effectively employed to assist the people of Rhode Island. 
I am very pleased with what has already been done in this legislation. Both Senator McCain and Senator Ford have taken a very strong, positive step to ensure that we are sensitive to the noise problem at airports. This legislation includes a set-aside for noise abatement of approximately 35 percent rather than the 31 percent in the bill that has been passed by the other body. This is a very, very positive development, but I think we can do more. I would also be very supportive of Senator McCain and Senator Ford's efforts to maintain that 35 percent set-aside. 
What my amendment does is simply lift the existing cap on the total amount of funds that the FAA may spend on noise abatement when the FAA distributes unexpended funds at the end of a fiscal year. This, we hope, would allow for additional resources to be devoted towards noise abatement. It would be consistent with and within the confines and framework of the existing appropriations bills. It is a modest, but I think very important step forward to help address the problem of noise around airports. 
I, indeed, am very pleased that Senator McCain and Senator Ford have taken such a strong step in this bill to protect airport neighborhoods from the increased level of noise. 
With this, I urge passage of the amendment.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue which affects many of our nation's air travelers. I am pleased to offer an amendment to the Senate's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill which requires the Secretary of Transportation to implement regulations that ensure airline passengers are more aware of the true corporate identity of the airline on which they are flying. 
I am pleased that the managers of the FAA reauthorization legislation have agreed to accept my amendment to their bill. I believe this amendment will go a long way to ensure that airline passengers are better informed. 
As you know, Mr. President, following the deregulation of the airline industry in the late 1970's, major airlines began to enter into cooperative agreements with smaller airlines to offer air transportation service to smaller, underserved areas. Common in such agreements is the practice of `code-sharing,' where the smaller independent airlines use the name and identification code of the larger airline. For example, for a two-leg `code-shared' flight, where a large air carrier operates one leg and a smaller commuter carrier operates the other, air service for both flight segments is listed under the same identification code. As such, consumers purchasing `code-shared' air service are frequently unaware of the actual corporate identity of the smaller commuter airline on which they are flying. 
Mr. President, this lack of disclosure can cause consumers to be completely unaware of the true identity of their transporting air carrier, and therefore, lessen a consumer's ability to make the most informed transportation decision. 
Mr. President, under current law, U.S. air carrier ticket agents are required to verbally indicate to consumers the corporate identity of the airline they are flying on, when a ticket is purchased. 
However, in practice, Mr. President, these verbal disclosure rules are difficult to enforce. Furthermore, the rules are not applied universally because they do not cover travel agents, who sell a majority of the airline tickets issued in the United States. 
As a result, Mr. President, consumers are often surprised to discover that a segment of their flight, although listed under the `code' or name of a large air carrier, could be serviced by a different airline. 
Now, Mr. President, I do not mean to suggest that smaller commuter airlines are not safe, nor, do I mean to diminish the valuable service `code-sharing' arrangements bring to many smaller and rural areas in the nation. Rather, I want to help ensure that consumers are aware of the true identity of the airline they are scheduled to fly on. 
For these reasons, I offered this amendment to require stronger airline ticketing disclosure rules, an issue the Department of Transportation recently considered. 
Indeed, in 1994, the Department of Transportation proposed a rule to require that at the time of sale, travel or airline ticket agents provide consumers with written notification of each airline's corporate name that participate in `code-sharing' agreements. The Department asserted such steps would help to ensure that a consumer had a complete understanding of the transportation they were purchasing. However, to date, the Department has not issued a final rule on this matter. 
Mr. President, the Department of Transportation was on the right track, and we need to encourage the DOT to follow through and implement better ticketing disclosure regulations to help better inform consumers. My amendment is simple and straightforward, and does just that. It requires the DOT to implement regulations 90 days after enactment of this bill requiring improved written and oral notification of the corporate name of `code-sharing' airlines. Such requirements would inform consumers of the identity of the air transportation carrier actually providing service, and thereby allow consumers to make more informed purchasing decisions. My amendment also grants the DOT flexibility in this process, and allows the Department to choose the method it deems most appropriate to achieve this goal. 
Mr. President, the basis for my amendment is also straightforward: Just four years ago, a constituent of mine, Ms. Pauline Josefson, of Warwick, Rhode Island died in a commuter airline crash. The airline she flew on was listed under a major carrier's identification code. 
Ms. Josefson had every reason to assume that the air service she had purchased was that of the major carrier, as her airline tickets indicated. However, she was flying on a plane piloted by an individual who had been repeatedly criticized by other airlines for poor performance and flying ability. If the little known airline's actual corporate name had been disclosed when the ticket was purchased, Ms. Josefson would have had an opportunity to make a fully informed travel decision.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I voted in favor of S. 1301, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1998, to address certain abuses regarding consumer bankruptcy laws, while providing bankruptcy protection to those who genuinely need it. Indeed, in recent years, there have been record increases in bankruptcy filings. In 1997 alone there were 1.3 million bankruptcy filings--an all-time high. While I think this increase is in part a result of the significant rise in outstanding consumer credit, I believe it is also attributable to the reduced stigma associated with filing for bankruptcy. As such, I believe that S. 1301 will be an important tool in curtailing irresponsible debtor practices. 
The version of S. 1301 passed by the Senate is the product of significant compromise by both Democrats and Republicans and is much-improved over the Judiciary Committee-passed bill. I am pleased that my amendments prohibiting certain credit card terminations, limiting consumer debit card liability, and providing greater disclosure for `high LTV' loans were adopted by the Senate. Nonetheless, I am concerned about the means-testing provisions in the bill and would be inclined to oppose the Conference Report if the means-testing provisions are made mandatory or if consumer credit protections are deleted.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. President, the underlying legislation that we are considering today will allow a creditor to request a bankruptcy judge to move a petition in bankruptcy from chapter 7 to chapter 13. As we all realize, in chapter 7, a debtor may fully discharge his debts, and in chapter 13, there is an obligation to partially pay one's debts. 
The focus of this legislation is on the debtor. There are two conditions which the creditor must show: The creditor must show either the individual debtor has at least enough assets to pay 30 percent of the debts or that the debtor has acted in bad faith in applying for chapter 7 liquidation. 
I believe this focus exclusively on the debtor misses half of the equation. The other important half of the equation is the behavior of the creditor. My amendment explicitly requires the bankruptcy judge to consider the behavior of the creditor, whether that creditor acted in good faith in the extension of credit. 
We all know there has been a significant increase in bankruptcy filings, but what we frequently overlook is the fact that there has been an extraordinary increase in credit extension. In 1986 through 1996, that 10-year period, filings increased by 122 percent, but revolving consumer credit increased 238 percent in that same period. As a result, we have had a situation where much of this credit extension has been done with very poor underwriting standards, a situation in which the companies themselves might very well anticipate that the debtor could not handle the debt. 
Those companies that act recklessly and unscrupulously should not have the option to request that a debtor be thrown into chapter 13 from chapter 7. As a result, I believe it is incumbent upon the bankruptcy judge to look explicitly at the issue of the good faith of the creditor. 
This is not just a question of the volume of credit that has been extended; this is the proliferation of solicitations. Each year, 2 billion credit solicitations are made in this country, many of them without any concern of the ability of the debtor ultimately to pay. We don't need a test to establish this fact. We just have to sit home on a Saturday and at about 10 o'clock, you get the first call from a credit card company. Then at 10:30, you get the second call. At 11, the mail comes and you get two or three solicitations, and it goes all the way through the evening. 
What I want to see, and what the amendment requires, is if there is a consideration to move a debtor from chapter 7 to chapter 13, the judge should be able to apply a good-faith standard when reviewing the activities of the creditor. This establishes balance, this establishes a strong presumption that both sides must be looked at in terms of this rather unique and novel approach to the bankruptcy code. 
It is well within the expertise of the banking judge to make this determination. 
I simply conclude by saying that this amendment has the strong support of the Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union. This is an opportunity to vote with consumers with regard to this legislation. 
I now retain the remainder of my time but also ask at this time for the yeas and nays.

Mr. REED. Thank you. 
I applaud all the consumer protections that the Senator from Utah has listed, but I would like to add one more. I would like to add, along with the Consumers Union and the Consumer Federation of America, the protection of looking at the good-faith operation of a creditor who is demanding that a debtor be placed from chapter 7 into chapter 13. 
With respect to the standard, my standard is as equally well defined as the bad-faith standard that exists today within the legislation, because good faith and bad faith are something that the banking judge should be able to determine, and it does not require an elaborate searching through of underwriting policies and looking through documentation and going around the 
country. 
What it does require is that that trier of fact, that bankruptcy judge, determine whether or not the creditor has abused the relationship, either by intimidation or deceit. All these things would rise to the level of a lack of good faith. I suggest very strongly the bankruptcy judge can do that, and should do that in this context. 
Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Illinois.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, my amendment to S. 1301 is designed to encourage responsible lending by the credit card industry just as the underlying motivation of the bill is to require responsible borrowing by the general population of the United States. 
Under the present legislation before us, a credit card company, or a creditor, may go into a bankruptcy court and request that the judge move a petition from chapter 7 to chapter 13 if the individual has the ability to pay at least 20 percent and is not acting in bad faith. My amendment will certainly look at the other side of the transaction and require that the creditor also act in good faith. 
As I have indicated before, section 707 of this legislation will, for the first time, give the power to creditors to request that a court convert a chapter 7 petition into a chapter 13 case. This is discretionary with the judge. It is not mandatory. But implicit in that, I believe, is already the standard of good faith that the judge will require through his or her analysis of the request of the change from chapter 7 to chapter 13. But I believe it is appropriate--indeed, necessary--to have an explicit standard of good faith on behalf of the creditor, as well as on behalf of the debtor. 
The bankruptcy judge, in considering this request, will first have to determine that the individual debtor has the ability to pay at least 20 percent of the claims against the debt, and, in addition, the judge will have to consider whether the debtor filed for chapter 7 in bad faith. 
Once again, my amendment would propose a complementary analysis of the creditor, whether that creditor has been offering credit in good faith. 
This is not only fair but is something that is necessary to maintain the balance and the appropriateness of this change to a longstanding rule in bankruptcy court which allowed the debtor to go in and file in chapter 7. 
Now, we understand the differences between these two provisions of the bankruptcy code. Chapter 7 allows the debtor to discharge all of their debts. Chapter 13 requires them to repay a portion of the debts based upon their ability to repay. 
The proponents of this legislation have suggested that by using this means test, by saying that if a debtor can pay at least 20 percent and requiring them, or at least giving the judge the option to put them into a provision of chapter 13 where they must repay a portion, this procedure will reduce the abuse of the bankruptcy system, the abuse that is cited in terms of people coming in with that but still declaring under chapter 7 they cannot pay and having all of their debts discharged. 
We know that part of the impetus behind this legislation is the increase in bankruptcy filings throughout the United States. The proponents of this legislation have pointed out that in 1997 alone there were a record 1.3 million bankruptcy filings, and over the past 10 years the bankruptcy filings have increased year after year after year. Unfortunately, these assertions are correct. 
In my State of Rhode Island, there has been a 500-percent increase in bankruptcy filings between 1984 and 1996. And so I think everyone is concerned and, indeed, everyone is interested in working out an arrangement which will prevent the abuse of the bankruptcy system, and that is a part of the underlying legislation. 
Just focusing alone, however, on the increase in bankruptcy filings misses the full story because it is just one side of the story. On the other side, there has been an explosion in the extension of credit by the credit industry of the United States. Many times their standards for underwriting have diminished substantially. Many times they are issuing credit--in fact, fostering credit upon people at exorbitant interest rates. This, too, must be factored into our analysis of the bankruptcy problem in the United States today. Between 1986 and 1996, total bankruptcy filings did increase by 122 percent, but outstanding revolving consumer credit increased by almost twice as much--238 percent. 
So when you look at both sides of the story, the analysis would lead me to believe, very strongly, that this is not solely the problem of individual debtors gaming the system and taking advantage of this system. This is also the problem of the credit card industry, and the credit industry in general, that is fostering and pushing credit on some people who they know are incapable of keeping up with their debts. And so when we look at these changes, we have to look at both sides of the question. 
Now, this whole trend in the explosion of credit is reflected graphically in the analysis of household debt and income data. Back in 1974, total household debt was 24 percent of aggregate household income. Today, that same ratio is 104 percent. That is graphic evidence of not only the increased access to credit but the unusually robust and forceful presentation of credit and availability of credit throughout the United States. 
We all know this in daily life. You just have to go to your mailbox every day and get a credit card solicitation. You just have to sit in your home from early morning to late at 
night 7 days a week and answer the telephone and hear a solicitation from a credit card company saying they want to give you credit. It is annoying, it is constant, and it reflects this incredible urge on the part of the industry to push credit as much as they can. 
Last year, for example, the credit card companies sent out over 2 billion credit card solicitations. By my calculation, that is roughly 10 for every American man, woman and child. A recent Wall Street Journal article about a California family demonstrated just the ubiquitous and constant effort to get people to sign up for these credit cards. In 1997 alone, this one family was offered almost $5 million in credit through mail solicitations. The wife, who was not working and without independent income, was offered more than $2.5 million in credit. Her husband, who was president of a nonprofit organization, earning a good salary, on the other hand, was offered only $592,000 in credit, suggesting that the industry is not so much interested in how much you make but really how much you potentially might spend. In that regard, the daughter in the household was offered another $1.4 million in credit--in 1 year. 
What does this say? This says that the industry is not looking carefully at where it is sending its solicitations. It is not looking at those people who can pay, and, in fact, in many cases it is burdening people already in debt with further debt, and now what they would like to do, when these individuals come before the bankruptcy court, is they would like to say, well, listen, you people who can't discharge your debts fully, you have to pay up. I think, again, that the appropriate balance, if we are to pursue this ability to move from chapter 13 to chapter 7, is to at least look at the good faith of the credit card industry. 
In view of these facts, Mr. President, it becomes clear that the increase in bankruptcy filings is not simply a result of more borrowers borrowing more money. It is also a factor of these credit card companies soliciting poorer and poorer credit risks, and doing it quite deliberately, quite knowingly. 
Data from the National Bankruptcy Review Commission supports this assertion. Indeed, this data suggests that the proportional incidence of bankruptcy filings has actually decreased slightly in the last 20 years. We have seen the numbers go up, up, up. But if you look at the ratio, if you look at the proportional incidence, given the outstanding credit, there has been a slight decrease. In 1977, there were 0.74 bankruptcies for every million dollars of consumer credit. In 1997, there are 0.73 bankruptcies for every million dollars in consumer credit. 
So when you, again, look at the situation, it is not simply a group of Americans who have suddenly decided that they no longer want to honor their obligations, that they want to abandon the tradition of responsible credit behavior that their fathers and mothers had; these statistics suggest that not much has changed except in the absolute numbers, and that has been driven by this constant extension of credit by the companies, in many cases to people who they know are very unlikely to be able to keep up with the debts at the time. 
The approach in the underlying bill overlooks, I think, this other side of the equation. They focus solely on the borrower. They take the `blame the debtor' approach. I do not think that is entirely correct. My amendment seeks to address that approach by striking a balance, by allowing--in fact requiring--the judge to look at the good faith of the individual company that is extending this credit. Most, indeed, the vast majority, of reputable creditors day in and day out take pains to ensure that they are doing the proper underwriting, that they are targeting people who have the ability to pay and they are not abusing their ability to market their products. But there are those operators who are not so scrupulous. These unscrupulous operators should not easily have the ability to force an individual from one chapter in the bankruptcy code to another. 
At the heart of what my amendment is suggesting is that we explicitly do what I believe is implicit within the existing legislation--that the judge makes a finding that the creditor, in fact, operated in good faith. Under the present language, he or she is required to make a judgment that the debtor has not acted in bad faith in their application for chapter 7. I think that the same approach, complimentary approach should be applied to creditors. 
My amendment adds this good-faith standard, and it is not the only place you will find a good-faith standard or its related bad-faith standard within this legislation and within the bankruptcy code. For example, section 202 of the bill protects the debtor's ability to discharge certain debts if in the language of the bill `the debtor makes a good-faith effort to negotiate a reasonable alternative repayment schedule.' 
The point is clear that throughout this legislation we have imposed good-faith standards at various junctures to give the bankruptcy judge guidance in assessing various petitions for various claims, so that this amendment is consistent with that good-faith theme throughout the legislation. 
My legislation does not prescribe specific factors to be considered on the good-faith standard. Instead, it gives the bankruptcy judge the discretion to make that judgment. Again, that is consistent with this legislation and also with the general practice in the bankruptcy code. Judges, bankruptcy judges particularly, are quite familiar with making these analyses of good-faith judgment, either on the part of the creditor or the part of the debtor. In fact, if you look through the bankruptcy code, there are about 79 annotations related to the court's interpretation of `good faith.' So it is a constant of the bankruptcy law and it is something that is not a novel injection into this particular legislation. I think, in fact I am convinced, that the judges can handle this analysis of `good faith' very clearly and very well. 
But one might ask, what are we talking about in terms of good faith? For example, if a judge had found that there was intimidation in the extension of credit, that is certainly not good faith, and I do not think any creditor should be able to claim this privilege under the bankruptcy code if it can be shown they intimidated the creditor. If they are taking advantage of creditors, if their marketing pattern is to market to vulnerable people in our population--seniors or low-income Americans who may not have the ability to get good counseling on their debts--all these things together which suggest bad faith, or the lack of good faith, if they are consistent, demonstrable, then that judge should not allow the ability for that claimant to demand that debtor be moved from one section of the bankruptcy code to another. 
All of these things together, I think, suggest very strongly that we have to look out for the exception, in terms of the creditor population, those unscrupulous creditors. There are examples already in the legislation where we have taken steps to guard against unscrupulous operations in the extension of credit. For example, the committee report comments that in section 202 they use `substantially justified' language to describe or to allow the award of attorney's fees in terms of allegations that a debt was obtained fraudulently. That is an attempt, as the committee report says, because they are `concerned that some unscrupulous creditors have alleged false misrepresentations with no proof of doing so.' Indeed, there are protections already in the bill. I think, in this particular section, 707(b), there should be further protection for the good faith standard that would protect that. 
I have mentioned also that there is a concern to have some sense of what might be operating out there presently that would fall under this ambit of bad faith, or lack of good faith. There is a practice that is evolving in the industry of offering, particularly to low-income populations, these loan checks, where essentially they will send a check unsolicited to the home and all you have to do is sign it to get the money. But once you do that, you now have a debt with a substantial interest rate in many cases. That is the type of behavior I think a judge reasonably can look at and say, `Is this good faith?' 
For all these reasons and many, many more, the standard of good faith should be obvious to the bankruptcy judge. And I believe the way we have designed this overall legislation and this particular amendment is that we give that individual not only the incentive but also the mission to look closely at the company applying for this transfer of the debtor from one chapter to another. 
I am pleased to say that this particular amendment has been endorsed by the Consumer Federation of America and that it represents an attempt to balance the standard within this particular legislation. I hope all my colleagues will support this amendment. It seems to me to do several things that are essential. 
First of all, it recognizes that the problem we face is not solely, exclusively as a result of the behavior of debtors; that, in fact, it is the result of the behavior of lenders who are lending more and who are doing it without the kind of tight underwriting standards that are necessary. In that context, to give them the opportunity to move a debtor from a chapter 7 to a chapter 13 without looking at their behavior, I think, is inappropriate. It is particularly inappropriate when the judge must consider the behavior of the debtor in filing a chapter 7 petition. 
This amendment, I believe, is a very important one. It will restore the balance in this particular section, section 707 of the underlying legislation, and it will, I think, provide not only a way to safeguard against abuse of the bankruptcy system by debtors, but also strike a balance so creditors understand they have the responsibility to act responsibly also. 
I urge support of this amendment. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Let me respond to the Senator from Iowa. First of all, he raised interesting arguments about the amendment I did not propose, which would be a more detailed review of the underwriting practices of credit card companies and those that extend credit. For the reasons he illustrated, I did not suggest that amendment, because requiring a bankruptcy judge to look at the myriad of different underwriting standards of companies throughout the United States would not be appropriate. 
What is appropriate, I believe, is to require that they look at the good faith of the person who extends the credit and is now requesting that the debtor be transferred from chapter 7 to chapter 13. It seems to me to be perfectly consistent with the notion that the judge would also look at the good faith of the debtor--whether that debtor, in fact, was trying to use chapter 7 as a dodge. That is already in the legislation. 
He also raised some very interesting questions about how this will apply in practice, but I think the answer--a compelling answer, in my view--is that this is exactly what a bankruptcy judge is authorized and empowered to do on a daily basis--make judgments about the good faith of the debtor and, I suggest, also the good faith of the creditor. He or she can make these judgments. That is why they are there. They have the facts. This is a standard that is persistent throughout the bankruptcy code. 
There are numerous places in which the judge is called upon to make good-faith determinations. It does not require the kind of searching, detailed analysis of all the credit policies of a particular credit card company or a bank that extends credit, but what it requires is a commonsense view of whether or not the individual who has extended the credit has abused their market power or has, in fact, somehow distorted the relationship which we think is appropriate between a borrower and a lender. 
The Senator from Iowa also makes reference to the CRA Act in terms of suggesting that my demonstration of the explosion of credit is in some way inconsistent with suggesting that the Community Reinvestment Act play as positive a role. 
I do not think we witnessed a 238-percent increase in consumer community lending over the last several years as we have witnessed an explosion of the extension of credit by credit card companies. I do not think that we have seen the kind of robust lending into distressed communities that many in this Chamber would think would be appropriate. 
So to make that analogy by pointing out that credit card companies are increasingly lax about their extension of credit is somehow inconsistent with supporting very thorough and very limited lending under the CRA, I do not think carries weight. 
What we have is a situation in which the credit card companies--and we know this. Again, you do not have to go ahead and commission a survey to find out and discover this fact; you just have to sit home some Saturday when at 9:30 in the morning the phone rings, and you think it is your cousin or your brother calling up, and it is a credit card company. You politely hang up the phone. At 10:30 you get another call, thinking again it is a family member, and it is another credit card company. You go out to your mailbox at 11 a.m. Guess what? There are two solicitations, a platinum card and a gold card; and at 2 o'clock, thinking it is a member of the staff, it is another credit card company. You know this because you go back to your States, as I do, and you learn this from your constituents. 
This industry is really promoting credit. Is it beneficial? Sure it is. Access to credit is something that moves this economy forward. But when this credit extension is not done in a wise way, when in fact there is tangible evidence that there has been, in fact, bad faith--and that is a fairly strong standard to meet--then I think that the judge should be able to say or should be required to say you cannot move a debtor from chapter 7 to chapter 13. 
I am also pleased to note that the increase in the standard is to 30 percent of the ability to pay. I think that is an improvement in the legislation, just like I think this would be an improvement in the legislation. 
Let me conclude by saying I, frankly, believe that the way this legislation is already structured, with the judge in a position, not required to but having discretion--and the language is `may' move a debtor from chapter 7 to chapter 13--there is implicitly already a good-faith standard that I think any bankruptcy judge worth his or her salt in seeing a company that was abusive, that is filing constant petitions to move someone from chapter 7 to chapter 13, that have a known record for shoddy behavior in the community, I would think that individual would take that into consideration and should take that into consideration. 
That is why I do not believe my amendment is a unique or extreme departure from what already should be the standard. I would hope that we could adopt this amendment. I think it will go a long way to ensure that there is a balanced test, that you look at the debtor, you determine whether that individual can pay a certain amount--30 percent--and you look to see if that debtor has been deploying bad faith to apply to chapter 7, but at the same time look over, not at any rigorous searching review of underwriting standards, but look at that very, very obvious standard of good faith, look at that creditor. That is what this amendment is supposed to do. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. REED. I do not know if this is the final word, but the Senator is doing a remarkably good job moving this legislation forward. I agree with him, it is quite important because of this increase in the number of bankruptcy filings. There has been a huge growth in my home State of Rhode Island, a 500-percent increase in just a few years. If we are going to do it, let's do it in a fair and balanced way. 
I also go back to the underlying legislation that we are trying to amend. It says essentially that a creditor may file a request to move the debtor from chapter 7 to chapter 13, and the judge will make a determination. It is not mandatory. As I read it, even if that judge determines that the debtor has 30 percent, the sufficient amount of money to repay, and that the debtor may have, in fact, been questionable in filing a chapter 7 petition, the judge is still not required to grant the request and move the petitioner from chapter 7 to chapter 13. 
So as I said before, I think, implicitly, we already have this good-faith standard, because that is what the judge is going to apply. He or she is going to look at the behavior of both parties and determine if this is appropriate--if the individual should have all his debts discharged or whether there should be some partial repayment. 
What I would like to do is make it clear that this good-faith standard does exist, and it does not require this searching analysis of the underwriting practices of any company. It just requires a judge looking at the facts before him or her and making a judgment, as they do every day, as to what is fair, who has acted with clean hands coming to the bar of justice. 
I also say, in conclusion, that this amendment has the strong support of the Consumers Union and the Consumers Federation of America. This legislation is designed to ensure there is responsible borrowing, that the American public is responsible, and that they recognize their debts and their obligations. 
I believe and I think there is underlying support of the Consumers Union and the Consumer Federation of America, that the credit industry should also be responsible and understand their obligations. This is just a small way of making explicit what I think is already within the law--to recognize that responsibility. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator Kennedy's and Senator Wellstone's proposal to raise the minimum wage. There, in my view, is a very compelling reason why we must do this and we must do it today. That reason, simply stated, is that if you are a full-time worker, a head of household, a single head of household and a family of three, you will make $10,700 a year. That is $2,900 below the poverty level. Today, the minimum wage law in the United States guarantees to so many people only one thing: that they will still be in poverty. We can do much better than that, and we should do much better than that. 
There have been discussions about the employment effects of raising the minimum wage. Studies have been presented; statistics have been presented. Let's look clearly at what has happened in the last two episodes in which we raised the minimum wage. 
Back in October of 1996, the minimum wage was increased to $4.75. And what happened to unemployment? It fell; it was in a cyclical pattern, but it fell. Again, in September of 1997, we raised the minimum wage to $5.15, and once again unemployment fell. 
This legislation is not a job killer. This legislation does not deny opportunities to work for anyone. What it does is it gives people more money in their paycheck, gives them more opportunities to provide for their families, gives them a bigger share in this country's economy. That is why we need to do it. 
There are others who argue, `Well, those are just general statistics.' The real problem with the minimum wage increase is it affects some discrete subgroups like teenagers. If you look at the record of teen unemployment, age 16 to 19, once again the same pattern emerges. The minimum wage was raised in October of 1996--it is a cyclical process--and unemployment declined. Again, in September of 1997, with some cyclical variation, a declining curve, unemployment in this category also falls. So the arguments against the minimum wage because it kills employment just do not hold water based upon the most recent experiences. 
Then there is the argument that small businesses will invariably and automatically react to an increase by cutting back on their employment. There has been a recent study by two researchers from the Jerome Levy Economic Institute at Bard College. And 90 percent of the small businesses they surveyed indicated that the 1996 minimum wage increase did not change their hiring decisions. Their hiring decisions were based upon the demands in their marketplace for their products, driven by a very strong economy. Moreover, 75 percent of these individuals surveyed said that a further increase to $6 would also not influence their decisions about hiring. 
So small business is not reacting to this proposed minimum wage increase by saying, `We are going to cut off employment.' What this does is give hard-working Americans a chance to put more money in their paycheck to provide more opportunities for their families. 
We have also heard arguments on the floor today that, `Well, the minimum wage is benefiting not just the poorest people, just teenagers who work, but maybe spouses who work and their husbands or wives are employed in more lucrative jobs.' 
First of all, the reality of the minimum wage is that 74 percent of the wage earners are over 20, so the vast majority are not teenagers. And 40 percent are the family's sole breadwinner. They have people who depend upon them, depend upon them bringing in a living wage. And 63 percent are women; and 50 percent of the minimum wage earners are in the lowest 40 percent of earners in the United States. This does, in fact, provide a very positive impact on the opportunities for low-income Americans. 
There is another argument here, too, that I think we have to present. Last Congress, many of us joined together to pass significant welfare reform, in fact, directing people off welfare into the workforce; and it is an irony, at best, moving people from welfare into poverty-level wages--indeed, below poverty-level wages. To make this experiment in welfare reform truly workable, we have to ensure that when people leave welfare they get adequate pay. And the minimum wage increase will help do that. 
Also, it seems to me illogical that in every other sphere of economic endeavor raising someone's pay is seen as a good thing, not a bad thing, that most of our activities in the workplace are designed to get increases in pay. In fact, very few people would think, `I'm not going to ask for an increase in pay. It might curtail my opportunities to work.' Because the reality, as demonstrated by my colleague, just to survive, to put food on the table, clothe children, to provide minimal care to their families, requires an increase in the minimum wage. 
I think there is another argument that has to be stressed. We are coming into some rocky economic times in the United States because of the turmoil throughout the world. Demand for American goods overseas is faltering. How do we keep our economy going? One way to do that is to give the American people more purchasing power. Increasing the minimum wage does that for the very lowest income Americans, those people who go into the Kmarts, go into the Wal-Marts, to buy products. In fact, they are typically the types of individual households that, because of the demands on them, are constantly buying products for their children, buying goods and services. This will also help, I think, in a broader economic sense. 
So for all these reasons--basic justice and fairness, to keep our economy moving, to recognize that there are so many good reasons to do this--it does not affect employment dramatically but what it does affect is the ability of working families, people who work very hard to provide for their families and maybe provide a little extra. That, to me, is why we are all here. 
I strongly support the efforts of Senator Kennedy, the efforts of Senator Wellstone, and their strong commitment to ensure that the benefits of this economy are shared not by just 
those who are affluent but are shared by the broadest segments of American society, particularly by those who struggle each and every day under circumstances, frankly, that few of us have had to endure, to be good citizens, to work hard, and to get something a little bit more for their families. 
I hope, in that spirit, and recognition of those facts, that we strongly support this amendment. 
I yield back my time.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, my amendment would prohibit credit card companies from terminating a customer's account or imposing a penalty solely because the customer pays his or her bill on time and in full each month. It seems amazing but there are actually some companies out there that will terminate credit because the borrower, the debtor, pays the full amount each and every month on time. 
This amendment is narrowly tailored and would not otherwise affect the ability of the credit card company to terminate accounts or charge any fees or do anything with respect to penalties, but it would restrict and, indeed, eliminate this practice of terminating the best creditors that they have simply because they are not making any money on finance charges. 
I am offering this amendment in response to this very troubling practice which finds many credit card companies discriminating against the most responsible borrowers, those who pay their balances on time each and every month. Specifically, several companies have started to terminate a customer's card or impose a penalty if the customer pays his or her credit card bill in full each month. 
For example, in my home State of Rhode Island, many consumers with a credit card issued by a popular national discount store were alarmed to receive letters which stated: 
Our records indicate this account has had no finance charges assessed in the last 12 months. Unfortunately, the expense incurred by our company to maintain and service your account has become prohibitive, and as a result, in accordance with the terms of your cardholder agreement, we are not reissuing your credit card. 
One couple who received this letter has been married for 49 years and had never been late on any mortgage payment or denied any loan or been late in any type of credit arrangement that they had. 
Yet, with this note, the company was informing them that they were effectively being denied credit solely because they were responsible borrowers. 
Now, the message from credit card companies in this case is if you are too good a risk we won't give you any credit. That is illogical and, I think, should not be the practice of these companies. In fact, this practice is contrary to the goals of S. 1301, which is to promote responsible borrowing practices and reward those who are responsible in their borrowing practices. By penalizing borrowers who pay off their bills each month, it seems that some credit card companies are, in fact, advocating the type of behavior which S. 1301 is designed to discourage. 
I am not moved by the claims of these companies that say they need to cancel accounts which do not incur financial charges because the cost of servicing these accounts is prohibitive. Industry data suggests it costs issuers about $25 annually to service an account. But issuers are able to offset this cost through an interchange fee of approximately 2 percent charged to merchants on each transaction. Each year, on average, $3,000 is charged to a credit card. This 2-percent interchange fee on these charges equals about $60 which would seem to more than cover the cost of these accounts. Moreover, with Americans holding over $450 billion in consumer debt and with an average interest rate on credit card balances at 17.7 percent, the overall profitability of credit card lending is obvious and apparent. 
This amendment is a narrowly crafted measure which is designed to prohibit credit card companies from discriminating against the most responsible borrowers. For this reason, the amendment would clearly advance the goals of S. 1301 to promote more responsible credit card practices. 
I see no reason why my colleagues would oppose it. I therefore ask my colleagues to support this amendment. At the appropriate time I will ask for the yeas and nays. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his comments and for his leadership, along with our colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin. I have a few comments in response to his very thoughtful commentary. 
First, the jurisdiction of the committee when it gets to the floor, it has been my limited experience, is somewhat fluid. In fact, in this bill we are amending the Truth in Lending Act, which has ramifications in both the Judiciary Committee and the Banking Committee. I think, to be very scrupulous about jurisdictional responsibilities here, we missed the opportunity to do something which most of our colleagues, I hope, would recognize is an appropriate thing to do--preventing the termination of credit to people who simply pay their bills on time. 
The second aspect of this debate, which I think is appropriate to have in this bill, is that the driving force for this legislation comes very powerfully from the credit card industry. They are concerned that many individual consumers seek bankruptcy because of their huge credit card debts, and they feel that they are currently disadvantaged with the present system. So, again, I don't think it is inappropriate as we look at this bankruptcy system and, in many respects, test the credit card industry and look at some of their practices. This practice is particularly disturbing--again, that somebody's credit would be terminated simply because they paid on time. 
Another aspect that the Senator from Iowa mentioned was the suggestion that this is, in some way, price controls. I think that is a very, very long stretch--to look at this amendment which says you can't terminate an individual because they pay on time--that is a far cry from imposing limits on how much could be charged in terms of fees, penalties; and, clearly, I make no attempt to do that. I would never suggest that we do that in this amendment. I point out that in fact there are existing situations, in State law certainly, usury statutes, which do impose fees and caps on what a credit card company can charge. That is not the intent nor the specificity of this amendment. 
This simply says that it should not be permissible for a company to terminate an individual who has paid promptly, solely for the fact that that individual has paid promptly. If the individual is in arrears, if the individual has done something else to violate the agreement, then that is grounds, but not prompt payment; that should not be grounds. 
Ultimately, let me get back to the initial point I made. At the heart of this legislation--and, again, the Senator from Iowa and his colleagues have done much to make sure this was at the core--was to try to reinstill a sense of responsibility among borrowers that we will not tolerate people who game the system, who use bankruptcy as a shield for their irresponsibility. To me, it is extremely ironic that we would be talking about a situation here where I am attempting to recognize and protect the continued extension of credit to the most responsible borrowers we have in the country, the ones who pay on time every month and don't use this system to be irresponsible. 
So I hope my colleagues can recognize the merits within this particular amendment and support it. 
On a final point, I note that today is the birthday of the Senator from Iowa. I thank you for working overtime on your birthday on this measure, Senator. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment is a very straightforward one. It would prohibit credit card companies from penalizing or terminating customers who pay their bills on time. 
The core principle of this bankruptcy legislation that we are debating today is responsible borrowing, and being responsible for your debts. Here, we have a population of the most responsible borrowers, those who pay their bills timely and full each and every month. But what is happening is that there is a growing movement among credit card companies to penalize these individuals or to terminate their credit arrangements. I think it is wrong and I think we should do something about it here today. 
The credit card industry claims it is too expensive to maintain these accounts. Frankly, if you look at the charges that they receive from merchants on each transaction, the very substantial interest rate that they charge for outstanding balances, and also the membership fees which now seem to be ubiquitous, those claims seem to be very hollow. Indeed, this should be an issue about not only responsibility but fairness, and also about whether we really do believe that if people conduct their lives appropriately, pay their bills on time, are responsible, that they should end up being penalized. 
If we are talking, today, in this legislation, about responsible borrowing, how can we allow the most responsible borrowers in our society, ones who pay their bills each and every month, to be punished by these credit card companies? 
I urge adoption of this amendment. I retain the remainder of my time.

Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. 
The credit card companies make a great deal of money even on those individuals who pay their bills on time. They have membership fees, fees from merchants when the transaction is processed, and they have additional ways to acquire fees. 
I do not think it is a question of forcing an enterprise to give money away. What it is is a situation in which the credit card companies have come to us and said, `There are all these irresponsible borrowers out there; we have to amend the bankruptcy laws so we are protected.' Yet, when we point out they are punishing responsible borrowers, they rise up and say, `That is an imposition on us.' 
If we believe in responsible borrowing, we should support this amendment. 
I yield back my time.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding woman in Rhode Island, Sister Mary Mercia Moran, R.S.M., who is celebrating her 50th year as a Religious Sister of Mercy. 
Originally from New York City, Sister Mary Mercia entered the Religious Sisters of Mercy in Providence on September 8, 1948. She made her Final Profession on August 15, 1954. Sister Mary Mercia has dedicated her life to educating the children of the Diocese of Providence. Since 1951, she has taught at several schools including: St. Patrick in Providence, St. Matthew in Cranston, St. Mary in Pawtucket and St. Brendan in East Providence. Since 1967, Sister Mary Mercia has been teaching Second Grade at Sacred Heart School in East Providence. 
I was fortunate enough to be her student at St. Matthew's School. She was, and is, an inspiring, demanding, and nurturing teacher. Generations of Rhode Island children have prospered because of her faithful dedication. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Sister Mary Mercia for her many contributions to the children of Rhode Island and selfless dedication to helping others.

Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I thank Senator Feingold for yielding the time, and I both thank and commend Senator Feingold and Senator McCain for their leadership on this very critical issue. They have been fighting a very lonely--at times lonely--but a very extraordinary battle for not only the reforming of our campaign system but, many suspect, the continued viability of our political system. 
We have a campaign finance system in place, but that system has literally collapsed. The exceptions, the loopholes, the ingenious ways around, have in fact devoured the rules and we no longer really have a system of campaign finance. What we have is an all-out race for dollars, constantly, incessantly, and then an all-out escalation of spending and political campaigns which has left our constituents amazed and at times disgusted. We have a responsibility and an obligation to change this system today, with the opportunity to vote for very modest reform which will begin to, once again, make elections about ideas and policies, and not auctions to the highest bidder. 
The McCain-Feingold compromise seeks to accomplish two basic goals: First, to ban the unlimited, unregulated gifts by corporations, wealthy individuals and labor unions to political organizations, the so-called soft money; second, to regulate the so-called issue advertisements which impact on campaigns and which are growing in frequency and in their emphasis impact on campaigns. By ending soft money contributions, we will do what we persistently have said we want to do, and that is to prevent corporations from participating directly in elections. 
This is not radical reform, this is commonsense consistent reform that we thought we accomplished back in 1973 and 1974 with the original campaign finance reform system. 
Second, this legislation would attempt to provide a modicum of control over the new phenomenon of the issue ads. They would require the disclosure of the contributions by these individuals and also indicate who is sponsoring these advertisements, or where they are getting their money. We have seen, over the last several years, an amazing phenomenon--candidates are in a race and they are discussing the issues and, suddenly, out of nowhere, comes a mysterious advertisement on television attacking one or praising another. And they both claim that they had nothing to do with it. It is no longer their campaign. They are, in a sense, bystanders on issue advertisements and issue campaigns of which they themselves, many times, disclaim having any knowledge. All of this takes out of the hands of the candidates and, ultimately, the hands of the electorate, what should be at the heart of every election--a vigorous debate between individual candidates about their vision of the future of this country. 
So we have to do these things. We have to ensure that our campaigns are not tainted by soft money and not overwhelmed by these issue advertisements. This is a problem that plagues both of our Houses. As Senator McCain pointed out, it is not just a situation with the Democrats or just with the Republicans; both sides are locked into this inexorable, it seems, race for dollars. In doing that, we have created a situation where the American people, in many cases, are increasingly disenchanted; they are voting less and less and are getting to the point of being contemptuous of the best political system the world has created to date. 
We have to do this modest reform today. Frankly, this is just modest reform. There are many things that we could and should do that we are not even talking about today on the floor of the Senate. The States--the so-called laboratories of reform--are doing things today that we should be at least contemplating. In my own State of Rhode Island, we implemented voluntary spending limits with limited public financing. The States of Maine and New Jersey have done the same thing. The State of Vermont has implemented strict limits on candidate spending--legislation which directly challenges the Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo, which I believe incorrectly equates money with speech. 
In fact, I have introduced similar legislation in this body which would legislatively put limits on and legislatively force the Court to reevaluate Buckley v. Valeo. These are very aggressive steps that we should take. These are things we should do to ensure that our system is entirely resistant to the ravages of money that is affecting it today. But at least today we can stand up with Senators McCain and Feingold and say that we must stop the influence of soft money. We must at least have the disclosure rule behind these issue advertisements. This is the first step toward long-term campaign finance reform that will not only make races about ideas, but will, in fact, I believe, restore the faith of the American people in their system of government and what we do for them. 
I yield back my time.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, today we have voted to move to consideration of the Bankruptcy Act. One of the sad but true causes of so many bankruptcies of families throughout this country is the fact that they are overwhelmed by medical bills. Now, this is obvious when it comes to those people without insurance, because for those people, getting sick in America not only means being ill, it also very often means going broke. 
But one of the other aspects that is startling to so many is that many families with insurance, particularly health maintenance organization insurance, find themselves in similar situations where the insurance they paid for, they thought they bargained for, evaporates when they actually have a health care crisis. 
That is why it is so very, very important to engage in a thorough debate and legislative action with respect to the Patients' Bill of Rights. I join all of my colleagues in issuing a challenge to the leadership of this body to bring up the Patients' Bill of Rights so we can debate it, we can consider it, and hopefully we can pass it. 
Indeed, we should be here tonight debating this worthy measure, or the minimum wage, as my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, has suggested, because that is truly the people's business. When I go back to Rhode Island, people are concerned about many things, but they are most concerned about the status of the health care and about whether or not working families in my State and across this country can provide for themselves. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights, the legislation that we should be debating tonight, is about applying fair rules of the game to health care. When it comes to health care, consumers should get the health care they pay for and they should get it when they need it. But sadly, this is not always the case. In many cases, it is the exception to the rule. It is time for this Congress to accept the President's challenge and pass legislation to enact guarantees for quality health care in this country and important consumer protections. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights introduced by Democratic leader Daschle, protects patients' rights, 
while the opposing version introduced by Senator Lott and Senator Nickles leaves too many loopholes and does not provide adequate protections for consumers. By addressing only self-funded, non-ERISA plans, the Lott-Nickles bill excludes 113 million Americans from the protections that are necessary, and, indeed, if you follow the logic of their bill, if a portion of Americans need protection in their health care plan, if a portion of Americans need these protections from insurance companies that are too much oriented toward the bottom line and not quality health care, why should all Americans in private health care plans not have these protections? 
That is what the Daschle bill does. It would provide coverage for all 161 million Americans who aren't privately insured. This bill submitted by Leader Daschle provides full protection to patients, including, for example, access to specialists, pediatric specialists for children, coverage for emergency services, an internal and an independent external appeals process, and allowing patients to hold health plans accountable in court. 
All of these protections are important to the health and well-being of all Americans. And all of these protections deserve full debate and consideration on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Now, an offer of a single vote on the bill with an extremely limited opportunity for amendments is not the full, vigorous debate that this issue requires--in fact, that this issue demands. The health care of the American people is too important to try to squeeze in between other issues here on the floor of the Senate. I think we should move today to bring up this legislation, debate it vigorously, pass it and send it forward. Our colleagues in the other body have done so. Now the challenge is with this body to move forward deliberately and purposefully to pass protections that will ensure quality health care and access to all Americans. 
There is a particular aspect of this debate that I am extremely interested in, which is ensuring that there are adequate protections in managed care plans for children. Too often, children are ignored in the preparation of these plans. Too often, pediatric illnesses are relegated to just another variation of adult illnesses. Too often, children are just seen through these lenses as smaller adults when, in fact, pediatric care is a very specialized part of the health care delivery system. And too often, parents discover that what they bargain for and what they thought they had in terms of protections evaporate when their child is ill. 
Earlier this year I introduced my own legislation that would ensure that children are not left out of this great debate about managed care, that children would, in fact, be the focal point of very specific procedures within managed care plans, that there would be access to pediatric specialists. A family could choose a pediatrician as a primary care provider, and pediatric specialists would evaluate outcomes relative to children. In working with the pediatric hospitals and with the American Academy of Pediatrics, I have come to understand the very specialized care that is necessary to deliver such care to children. Without such care, illnesses that may have been treated successfully and cheaply in children become traumatic and complicated illnesses that are more expensive and more threatening to the health of this child and later to that adult. 
My words are less compelling than the words of the people in my home State of Rhode Island who have dealt with this health 
care morass. A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to share a podium with Dr. Karen LaMorge. She detailed the problems she had in getting adequate health care for her father and the fact that the insurance company would not provide a second opinion, and they would not make easy referrals to specialists. One of the great ironies of her story is that Dr. LaMorge is a podiatrist and, in fact, a member of the professional panels of this particular HMO. Now, she, a skilled professional, a provider herself, cannot easily and quickly get adequate care for her father. 
What happens to the average citizen who confronts this morass of regulations and rules and consents and approvals and daily calls and tracking down people to give the right approval? It becomes a daunting experience. Many, many Americans simply get exhausted trying to get basic health care for their families and themselves. Some give up. Others press on, enduring huge costs in time, efforts and energy. That is not the way our health care system should operate. 
With the Patients' Bill of Rights, we will go a long way toward ensuring that it doesn't operate that way, that there is an opportunity for high-quality care that is accessible and, indeed, also affordable, because, frankly, there is a lot of money being spent by these health care plans on administrators and bureaucrats. Maybe more could be directed to health care and to the American citizens. 
There is a particular aspect of this which I find particularly compelling, and I mentioned it before; that is, the aspect of pediatric health care. A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit the Hassenfeld Children's Cancer Center at New York University Hospital in New York City. There I saw the care they are giving to dying children. I heard from the frontline professionals, the social workers, nurses, doctors, about the daily frustrations they face and endure in trying to get adequate care for these children from HMOs. The idea that they would spend days trying to get hospice care for a child who is dying, the idea that they would have to get daily approval and reapprovals for a course of treatment that is clear and obvious and has been prescribed is just an example of the state of this system, which is, in many respects, a crisis for so many families in this country. 
We can do better. We must do better. But we can only do that if we have the will. We must bring this legislation to the floor. We must bring this legislation to this floor promptly. There are few days left, but in those days it is our obligation to serve the interests of the American people. At the top of their list is a more rational, more appropriate health care system. We are within striking distance of that, if we just act. 
As I mentioned before, the other body has acted. It is our responsibility, our turn to step up to the plate and to get a greater hit than even Mark McGwire, because this hit will ensure that every family in America has good access to health care and will help that process to continue along. We should stay here tonight and every night and not simply make speeches with respect to this underlying bankruptcy bill, but actively debating and actively voting on, in a robust, wide-open debate, HMO protections for the people of America. As Senator Kennedy suggested, we should also take up the minimum wage because that, too, is a way to address the real problems that face America. 
I hope that our resolution tonight would be to take up these measures, debate them fairly and honestly, and to vote and give the American people what they so desperately want and deserve--a 
health care system that works for them, and for those low-income working Americans a decent wage which will lift them out of poverty. I hope we do that. Certainly I think I and my colleagues will continue to urge that action on this Senate, and hopefully these words will take heart and take hold. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to require permanent country of origin markings on most imported fashion or `costume' jewelry products. I am joined in this effort by Senator D'Amato, who founded the Senate Jewelry Task Force with me, as well as Senators Inouye, Kerry, Torricelli, and Dodd, who I would like to thank for their strong support of the 16,200 Americans employed by our nation's fashion jewelry manufacturers. 
Like many sectors of our nation's economy, domestic fashion jewelry manufacturers are all too familiar with the pressures of the new global economy. And, for many years, little attention was paid to the industry by our trade negotiators and other officials. Today, that is changing: The Commerce Department is working with our fashion jewelry makers and has undertaken a competitiveness study of the industry, and our trade negotiators now recognize the needs of America's jewelry manufacturers when they sit down with our trading partners. 
Yet, the industry still faces an uphill battle against low-wage importers, who do not have to abide by appropriate environmental standards and other important U.S. laws. For that reason, we are introducing this legislation to require a permanent country of origin label on imported fashion jewelry products so American consumers know where it was made. This is the same labeling requirement we see on thousands of imported products from televisions to tennis shoes. Unfortunately, the current marking requirement for jewelry imports is a hanging tag or sticker, which can be removed, fall-off, or be obscured by price tags. 
Consumers deserve better, and this legislation allows them to make an informed choice, in light of the $524 million worth of fashion jewelry imported in 1995 alone. Our bill is modeled on the current permanent marking requirement for imported Native American style jewelry products, and it is endorsed by the nation's largest jewelry trade organizations such as the Manufacturing Jewelers and Silversmiths of America and the Jewelers of America. 
Mr. President, imported jewelry is a fact of our international economy, but consumers have a right to know where a product is made and hard working American jewelry makers have a right to a level playing field. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation, and I look forward to its consideration by the Senate.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Conference Report on H.R. 1385, the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. 
In a world where economic activity knows no national boundaries, it is crucial we ensure that we have the most knowledgeable and best trained workers in the world. 
As a member of the Conference Committee on H.R. 1385, I am pleased that the Conference Agreement before us today will help us reach this goal by streamlining and reforming job training, adult education, and vocational rehabilitation programs, while enhancing federal support and investment in these critical areas. 
The Conference Agreement will help states implement a more coherent, performance-driven system to ensure that Americans receive the training and education they need throughout their lives. 
The Conference Agreement will streamline services by establishing a one-stop delivery system; enhance accountability by requiring states, local boards, and training providers to meet higher performance measures; provide more reliable information on local career opportunities and training programs and providers; empower individuals to use individual training accounts to choose their own training programs and providers; and increase flexibility to allow states and local areas to implement innovative job training programs. 
I am also particularly pleased that this Conference Agreement includes provisions which will benefit my home state of Rhode Island, such as preserving the state's successful service delivery area structure. 
In addition to job training reform, the Conference Agreement also improves the accessibility and quality of adult literacy and education programs. Indeed, more aggressive adult literacy programs are essential if we are to ensure that everyone in the workforce has an ability to read. 
Lastly, the Conference Agreement reauthorizes the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In doing so, it links vocational rehabilitation to the new workforce system, while maintaining a separate funding stream for vocational rehabilitation. This will provide improved training and employment services to individuals with disabilities. 
I want to thank Chairman Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, Senator DeWine, and Senator Wellstone, and their staffs, for their efforts on this important legislation and for working with me to address issues affecting Rhode Island. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Shelby amendment to create a small bank exception to the Community Reinvestment Act. 
Mr. President, the Community Reinvestment Act requires financial institutions to meet the credit needs of local communities--including low and moderate income areas--consistent with safe and sound lending practices. 
Unfortunately, many proponents of the Shelby amendment have argued that this obligation is tantamount to government mandated credit allocation. Nothing could be further from the truth. Neither the Act nor the regulations specify the number of loans, the type of loans, or the parties to CRA loans. To the contrary, CRA relies on market forces and private sector ingenuity to promote community development lending. This is evidenced by the tremendous flexibility that financial institutions have in satisfying CRA. For example, loans to nonprofits serving primarily low- and moderate-income housing needs; loans to financial intermediaries such as Community Development Financial Institutions; and loans to local, state, and tribal governments may qualify for CRA coverage. Moreover, loans to finance environmental clean-up or redevelop industrial sites in low- and moderate-income areas also qualify as CRA loans. 
In addition to lending, CRA is satisfied through investments by financial institutions in organizations engaged in affordable housing rehabilitation, and facilities that promote community development such as child care centers, homeless centers, and soup kitchens. These all qualify for CRA coverage. 
Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has weighed in on this issue, arguing: 
The essential purpose of the CRA is to try to encourage institutions who are not involved in areas where their own self-interest in involved, in doing so. If you are indicating to an institution that there is a foregone business opportunity in an area X or loan product Y, that is not credit allocation. That, indeed, is enhancing the market. 
As illustrated by these examples and Chairman Greenspan's comments, it is clear that CRA is a far cry from government mandated credit allocation. To be sure, CRA is predicated on two simple assumptions that should be shared by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: (1) that a public charter for a bank or savings institution conveys numerous benefits, including deposit insurance, and it is fair for the public to ask something in return, and (2) government cannot and should not provide more than a limited part of the capital required for local housing and economic development needs; financial institutions in our free economic system must play the leading role. 
In the words of former Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig, `CRA is in many respects a model statute. It requires no public subsidy, no private subsidy, and no massive Washington bureaucracy.' 
These simple concepts, which are the embodiment of CRA, are perhaps most responsible for the significant democratization of credit that we have seen over the last 20 years. Since its enactment in 1977, CRA has resulted in more than $397 billion in loan commitments for low- and moderate-income borrowers. In my state of Rhode Island, it has been estimated that CRA has resulted in over $61 million in commitments for community development lending since 1977. 
Mr. President, I fear that the Shelby amendment will significantly undermine these advances. This amendment will exempt 86 percent of all banks from CRA, thereby doing irreparable harm to our communities that are in dire need of investment and opportunity. The adverse impact on community lending will be particularly severe in states such as Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, and Oklahoma, where 95 percent of all banks are small and would be exempt from CRA. If communities in these states are not able to turn to their financial institutions for rural and community development lending, to whom will they turn? 
Mr. President, this amendment is unnecessary. In response to concerns about regulatory burdens voiced by small banks, CRA was revised in 1995 to provide regulatory relief. The new regulations provide a streamlined examination process for independent banks and thrifts with assets under $250 million. In addition, under the new regulations, the smallest banks have been exempted from all reporting requirements, and are no longer subject to process-based documentation requirements. Moreover, the actual time spent in the smallest banks on CRA examinations has dropped by 30 percent. 
Following promulgation of the revised CRA regulations, many small bankers were effusive in their praise of the reforms. For example, Richard Mount of the Independent Bankers Association of America, which represents small banks, indicated,  
We commend the regulators for instituting a meaningful, streamlined, tiered examination system that recognizes the differences between community banks and their large regional and multinational brethren. The new rules should eliminate the paperwork nightmare of CRA for community banks and allow them to concentrate on what they do best--reinvest in their communities. 
Finally, Mr. President, this amendment will significantly weaken one of our most important tools in preventing lending discrimination. Perhaps because of its success, many have forgotten the embarrassing state of lending in many urban communities prior to CRA's enactment. In a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 1977, a study of six banks was presented which showed that these banks, which held $144 million in deposits from low-income and minority communities, returned an embarrassing one-half cent on the dollar in home loans. Throughout hearings on CRA, witnesses from around the country recounted similar stories of lending discrimination. 
While certainly we have come a long way since 1977, lending discrimination, unfortunately, persists. In a study published earlier this year by the Fair Housing Council of Greater Washington, it was revealed that Washington area lenders discriminate against two out of five African American and Hispanic mortgage applicants. In one incident cited in the study, a Rockville lender advised a black tester that the lender did not make loans to first-time home buyers. The same lender later met with a white tester, also posing as a first-time home buyer, giving the tester an appointment and encouraging him to apply for a mortgage loan. Lending studies by other organizations reveal similar findings. These studies have shown that minority borrowers receive fewer bank loans even when their financial status is the same as or better than white borrowers. 
By encouraging lenders to extend credit to all communities, CRA has been an important weapon in fighting lending discrimination. Because the Shelby amendment would exempt 86 percent of all banks from its coverage, lenders could find it easier to discriminate in the provision of credit. 
Mr. President, I do not think we want to return to the dark days before CRA, where access to credit and investment in our urban and rural communities was limited for all the wrong reasons. Instead, with the movement of assets out of the banking system and with increasing industry consolidation, we should be seeking ways to expand community investment, not limit it. For this reason, I will strongly oppose the Shelby amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to do likewise.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my views on credit union commercial lending, as well as my support for the motion to table the Hagel amendment. 
Mr. President, I generally support the ability of credit unions to engage in commercial lending. Indeed, I am aware that for many members, credit union loans are the only available sources of capital for business investment. Also, when considering banking industry consolidation and the potentially adverse implications to small business lending, I believe that commercial lending by credit unions has an important role. 
However, Mr. President, commercial lending can significantly increase the risk profile of credit unions. This is evidenced by recent National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) data which illustrates that the delinquency rate on credit union business loans--3.1 percent--is more than three times the delinquency rate on credit unions' overall loan portfolio--0.97 percent. 
More importantly, in 1991, my home state of Rhode Island experienced a credit union crisis that resulted from the failure of a state-chartered private deposit insurance corporation. This crisis affected one in five citizens and was predicated in part on excessive and risky commercial lending by privately-insured credit unions. Indeed, 13 of the state's credit unions were permanently closed, and the state had to seek federal assistance to repay depositors. 
In view of these facts, I was pleased that the Banking Committee adopted an amendment to limit commercial lending by credit unions to 12.25 percent of outstanding loans. However, Mr. President, as reflected in my additional views to the Committee Report to H.R. 1151, I do not think this cap goes far enough. Specifically, I have argued that the cap is inadequate because it is significantly higher than the level of commercial lending that credit unions are currently engaged in--0.75 percent of outstanding loans. I have also argued that because loans under $50,000 are counted toward the 12.25 percent cap, credit unions could engage in commercial lending to a much greater extent than the limit imposed in the bill. 
In response to concerns over commercial lending, Senators Hagel and Bennett have introduced this amendment to limit commercial lending to seven percent of outstanding loans. In addition, the amendment would count loans under $50,000 toward the cap and codify NCUA requirements that loan officers have at least two years of commercial lending experience. I would like to commend Senators Hagel and Bennett for their recognition of this issue and their attempt to address commercial lending concerns. 
However, I believe the Hagel amendment goes too far. My specific concern is that it both significantly reduces the commercial lending cap, while also eliminating the $50,000 exemption. Taken together, these provisions could impose undue burdens on credit unions with outstanding commercial loans. 
Because loans under $50,000 are not considered `commercial" under current regulations, the NCUA does not keep data on these loans. As a result, we simply do not know what percentage of outstanding loans would be characterized as `commercial' under the Hagel amendment. Thus it is possible, and likely, that the percentage of commercial loans could increase dramatically if this amendment were passed, which could put many credit unions that would otherwise satisfy a seven percent cap in violation of the amendment, forcing them to withdraw from commercial lending. 
As I indicated in our Committee's report, I believe the cap should bear a reasonable relationship to the amount of commercial lending that credit unions are currently engaged in. To the extent that the Hagel amendment creates uncertainty regarding existing commercial lending, we must be careful not to establish an overly-restrictive cap. While I expressed concerns about the $50,000 exemption in my additional views, those concerns were tied to the higher lending cap of 12.25 percent. 
Mr. President, a preferred approach to the Hagel amendment would be to reduce the aggregate lending cap, while retaining the $50,000 exemption. This approach would eliminate the uncertainty associated with the Hagel amendment, while establishing a meaningful limit on the future expansion of commercial lending.  
Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleagues for including an extension of Temporary Protected Status for Liberians until September 30, 1999 in the Fiscal Year 1999 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill. 
The histories of Liberia and the United States have been intertwined since 1847 when our nation's founding fathers helped freed American slaves found the sovereign state of Liberia. The first Liberians adopted the U.S. Constitution as a model and named the capital of the new country Monrovia, after President James Madison. Diplomatic, military and trade relations flourished between the two countries until the late 1980's. 
Then, in December 1989, Liberia was engulfed by a civil war that would last for seven years and continue to boil below the surface. Over 150,000 people died and more than one-half of the population fled the country or was internally displaced. During the conflict, food production was halted and the country's infrastructure was destroyed. 
Several thousand Liberians who were forced from their homes because of the civil war sought refuge in the United States. In 1991, the Attorney General determined that Liberia was experiencing an ongoing armed conflict which prevented Liberian nationals from safely returning home. She granted Liberians who were present in the United States on March 27, 1991 temporary protected status (TPS), which provides temporary relief from deportation. Because the conflict in Liberia continued to rage, the Attorney General extended TPS each year for the next six years. Furthermore, conditions in Liberia deteriorated to such an extent in 1996, that the Attorney General `redesignated' TPS for Liberians who arrived after March 27, 1991 but were living in the United States on June 1, 1996. Never before in history had the Attorney General been compelled to redesignate a state for TPS. 
Recently, however, the Attorney General declared that TPS would end for all Liberians on September 28, 1998. It is true that on July 19, 1997, Liberians elected former warlord Charles Taylor president and 300 international observers deemed the election free and fair. It is also true that this new government has pledged to rebuild the economy and reconcile the ethnic factions. 
However, there are signs which indicate that Liberia is not as safe and stable as many would like to believe. In early December 1997, a prominent opposition leader was assassinated. Furthermore, a newspaper and two radio stations were temporarily shut down by the government. 
A pastor of a church in my home state of Rhode Island had a conversation just yesterday with an individual who just returned from Liberia who stated that people in Liberia are afraid to criticize the government in any way. The secret police sweep neighborhoods at night, people disappear and bodies mingle with garbage under a bridge in Monrovia. 
I would also like to relay the comments of Bishop Arthur Kulah to my colleagues who may wish to know why TPS is still needed. Bishop Kulah is a United Methodist leader who lost his parents and two brothers in the civil war. He recently spoke with Liberians living in Rhode Island and when they asked if it would be safe to return when TPS was terminated, he replied, `People who have been fighting for ten years will not suddenly change. It may be quiet and then flare up overnight. The disarmament was not complete. People still have guns.' 
This weekend the Liberian community in Rhode Island will celebrate the 151st anniversary of Liberia's independence. They will celebrate the history and culture of their country and look forward to the day when they can safely go home. But that time is not now, Mr. President. They came to this country seeking peace and security. We have an obligation to offer them refuge until it is truly safe to go back.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak briefly on the nomination of Mr. James Hormel to be the United States Ambassador to Luxembourg. 
Mr. Hormel has a distinguished record as a businessperson, as a lawyer, as a former dean of the University of Chicago Law School, and as a philanthropist. His family owns one of the largest agriculture companies in our country. 
He has, throughout his distinguished career, been a contributor and supporter of many worthy organizations. His philanthropy is well known throughout the United States. He has contributed significantly to the Catholic Youth Organization, to the United Negro College Fund, Swarthmore College, Breast Cancer Action, and to many, many other associations. He has also served as the alternate representative to the United Nations General Assembly on behalf of our country, the United States of America. 
Mr. Hormel's nomination was favorably reported out by the Committee on Foreign Relations and is widely supported here in the U.S. Senate. 
Indeed, hundreds of distinguished Americans have favorably commented on his nomination, and they have stated that Mr. Hormel has the ability and skills to successfully represent the United States in Luxembourg. 
Now, there are many who are watching this proceeding who would ask, given all these qualifications, why would Mr. Hormel be denied a vote on his nomination to be Ambassador to Luxembourg? The simple answer comes down to the fact of Mr. Hormel's sexual orientation. 
There are many--the vast majority of Americans and the vast majority of Senators--who feel that this is irrelevant to the duties that he will perform as Ambassador to Luxembourg, and we should look not to his sexual orientation, but to his record of achievement and to his ability and to his responsibilities throughout his career in terms of advancing not his personal agenda, but in fact serving well both the institutions he represented, such as the University of Chicago, and many, many philanthropic activities which he has been involved in. 
But there are some in this Chamber who I fear would rather not have an Ambassador, but would rather have a political issue. My preference is to have an Ambassador serving the United States with distinction in Luxembourg. And I believe Mr. Hormel will do that. 
Mr. President, the Providence Journal newspaper in my home State of Rhode Island put it best when they headlined the editorial by simply saying `Vote on Hormel.' 
Mr. Hormel does not want this ambassadorship as a pulpit to advance any agenda. What he wants to do is represent our country with distinction and great diligence. I believe he will do that. 
In his own words, in a letter to Senator Gordon Smith, our colleague, he said:  
I will not use, nor do I think it appropriate to use, the office of ambassador to advocate any personal views I may hold on any issue. . . . I assure you that my public positions will be those of the U.S. Government. 
I believe that however one feels about Mr. Hormel's qualifications, this institution deserves to give him a vote, to give him an opportunity to have his case decided openly here on the floor of this Chamber, allowing individual Senators to make whatever point they may choose to make about his qualifications, about his potential to serve. But to deny him his vote, I think, is to deny not only one individual but this country the opportunity to make a decision about his qualifications to serve. 
I hope that we can quickly bring his nomination to the floor for a vote and then let the will of the majority prevail. I believe it is wrong and unfortunate that we retain this nomination and not allow it to come to the floor for the vote. I hope in the days ahead we will vote on Mr. Hormel and we will vote favorably. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Japan-America Society of Rhode Island for its efforts in organizing this weekend's 15th annual Black Ships Festival of Rhode Island. 
The Black Ships Festival takes its name from the Japanese word Kurofune (Black Ships) which the residents of Shimoda, Japan used to describe the tar covered American ships which sailed into Shimoda harbor under the command of Rhode Island native Commodore Matthew Perry in 1854. As you know, Commodore Perry and officials in the Edo Period Shogunate negotiated the Treaty of Kanagawa, the first treaty between United States and Japan, which opened Japan to trade with the West and marked the beginning of the relationship between our two great countries. 
Each summer, Newport, Rhode Island and Shimoda, her sister city, hold Black Ships Festivals to celebrate the friendship which began in 1854. Since its inception 15 years ago, the Black Ships Festival of Rhode Island has grown bigger and better every year, becoming a fixture on Newport's summer schedule and an event that the entire state eagerly awaits. 
The Festival truly is one of Rhode Island's treasures. It provides residents and visitors to the Ocean State a unique and inexpensive opportunity to learn about and celebrate Japan's traditions and culture. As a result, I can honestly say that our state has gained a better awareness than most of Japanese culture. 
The success of the Black Ships Festival of Rhode Island is now recognized far beyond the borders of the Ocean State. On July 1, the Japan-America Society of Rhode Island was selected to receive the prestigious Japanese `Minister of Foreign Affairs' Citation', which recognizes individuals and organizations that have contributed to friendship and understanding between Japan and other countries. Of the 9 organizations receiving this award in 1998, the Japan-America Society is the only one that is not Japanese. 
Mr. President, as the Co-Chair of this year's Black Ships Festival of Rhode Island, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Japan America Society of Rhode Island for its tremendous efforts in organizing the Festival and strengthening the bond friendship between the United States and Japan.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator Harkin's amendment. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this amendment. 
As the Senator indicated, last year this Senate strongly supported a virtually identical measure which would increase the enforcement ability of the Food and Drug Administration dramatically. We all know that in every State in this country it is illegal for children to buy cigarettes, but we also know it is very easy for children to buy cigarettes from vending machines and retail outlets. And last year, there were a staggering total of 256 million packs of cigarettes sold to children under the age of 18. That is an enormous amount of cigarettes, as Senator Harkin indicated, roughly $500 million, a huge market, a very lucrative market. And we all know if we don't take effective steps to provide for the enforcement of existing State laws and education of children and, just as importantly, the retail salespeople, this staggering total will go on and on and on, with dreadful consequences to the health of our children. 
Our effort today is to provide the resources to ensure that illegal tobacco sales to children are stopped if at all possible. Our amendment would fully fund the FDA's youth in our tobacco efforts by raising an additional $100 million by imposing a user fee on tobacco companies based on their market share. The pending bill, the bill that we are considering today, provides only $34 million, which is roughly one-quarter of the request submitted by the administration, to fully and effectively enforce the tobacco laws in the United States against sales of tobacco products to children. 
Let's put this total in perspective, that we are asking for, this $100 million. It has already been eclipsed by the amount of money spent by the tobacco industry in advertising against comprehensive tobacco legislation this year in the U.S. Senate. Just, in fact, a few moments ago in the cloakroom, I saw another advertisement being run by the big tobacco companies. They have already spent much more than that in trying to prevent effective legislation that will curtail teen smoking in the United States. 
Another aspect we should consider: This $100 million is just roughly 2 percent of the $5 billion that the industry spends each year in advertising its products, and, as we well know and has been well documented, too much of this advertising is directed at children. 
We have to in some way, some small way, counteract this constant fusillade of advertising aimed at children, and one way we can do it today--far short of the comprehensive debate that we had weeks ago--one way we can do it is ensuring FDA has the resources to adequately support State efforts to suppress childhood access to tobacco products. 
In terms of the money we are requesting, a total of over $100 million, it is also small compared to the health consequences of tobacco smoking in the United States. It has been estimated that over $50 billion a year is drained from our health care system because of tobacco and its effect on children. As Senator Harkin so well indicated, this is a pediatric disease; it begins with young people. Mr. President, 90 percent or more of individuals who begin to smoke do so before they are 18 years of age. Smoking begins around 12 or 13 year old. Regular smokers are regular smokers by the time they are 14. It is a pediatric disease. It is costing us billions of dollars a year, and we have to take effective steps to stop it. This is one way that we can do it, one way I hope we can do it. 
We know, too, enforcement of these laws is a significant way of curtailing access to tobacco products for children and, we hope, curtailing their exposure to tobacco and nicotine. One of the significant aspects of this amendment is, it will allow the FDA to put more resources into State efforts to curtail access to tobacco products by young people. 
We all were lobbied heavily by different groups--industry groups and public health groups--about the comprehensive legislation. There is not one group that came into my office, be they public health advocates or industry representatives, that did not emphatically and unhesitatingly say, `We are in favor of strong enforcement of existing laws that curtail teen smoking. We want this. We will do this.' Now we have an opportunity to fulfill their desire by giving resources to the FDA to ensure that these laws are strictly and effectively and efficiently enforced. 
We are talking about a situation in which we can provide resources to bolster the laws that are already on the books. As I indicated, as my colleague indicated, every State in this country curtails teen smoking. Every quarter of this country speaks out against underage smoking. It is not just public health advocates, it is the industry. Everyone says this is wrong. Yet, unfortunately, we are seeing a tremendous rise in smoking among teenagers. It is rising dramatically. It has increased by over a third since 1991. It is one of the unfortunate health statistics related to children in America today. Again, unless we take effective steps, it will continue to rise. 
We know that most young people buy their cigarettes themselves. This is not some great conspiracy where adults are out supplying kids. These are young people walking into these stores or getting access to a vending machine and buying it themselves. We know we can cut down this abuse, we know we can cut down this access, if we have stronger, better laws. More enforcement, though, of the existing laws, is certainly the first place to start. 
FDA evidence indicates, if we thoroughly enforce the compliance laws of the United States, we can significantly reduce teenage smoking. We can do it without entering into some of the more extensive proposals that were entertained just weeks ago here. We can do it by providing the resources of the FDA to support the States so they can both educate their salespeople in retail categories and also to ensure that we are checking on what they are doing. 
This is a terribly lucrative product. Talking to convenience store owners, many of them indicated this is the most lucrative product they have in their stores in terms of the margin on the sales they make. There is tremendous incentive to backslide, to ignore the regulations, to do anything you can to make these sales, to do anything you can to avoid the laws against selling tobacco products to minors. Unless we check them, unless we supervise them, unless we give real incentives to the States to do that, that is exactly what will happen, because that is exactly what is happening today. 
We have to, I think, find a way, not just each year coming to this floor and arguing for additional resources, but in the future I hope we can find a way to permanently fund sufficient resources to fully implement State laws and other provisions that will curtail the access to tobacco products by young people. But today we have the opportunity, the real opportunity, to provide more resources so we can do in deeds what we all say in words we want done: To stop young people from buying tobacco products, to give them a chance to grow up, to give them a chance later, if they wish, as adults, to make a decision about smoking. 
This is the moment for us to stand up and to literally put our money where our mouth is. I urge passage of the amendment, and I yield back my time.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment tonight not only on behalf of myself, but Mr. Abraham, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Wellstone, and Ms. Mikulski. My amendment would add a modest $10 million increase to the budget for the Office of Lead Hazard in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
I first want to commend and thank the chairman and ranking member for their assistance and their help. Both Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski have committed to finding more resources to prevent the exposure of young children to the lead hazard which is so prevalent in older housing throughout the United States. They have worked very closely with my staff and myself. I thank them for that. I am also very confident they will continue these efforts in conference so we can increase even more the funds that are allocated to this important endeavor. 
Over the last 20 years, the United States has made great strides in reducing lead exposure among our population, particularly among our children. Since the enactment of a ban on lead-based paint, since the elimination of lead solder in food cans and the deleading of gasoline, we have seen a significant decrease in blood level exposures of American citizens by about an order of 80 percent. However, it is still estimated that approximately 1 million children nationwide still have excessive levels of lead in their blood, making lead poisoning a leading childhood environmental disease and a disease that can be prevented. 
Today, the key culprit in this exposure is lead-based paint in housing. It is the major source of exposure and is responsible for most cases of childhood lead poisoning. It has been estimated that approximately half of America's housing stock, roughly 64 million homes, contain some lead-based paint. Twenty million of these homes contain lead-based paint in a hazardous condition, paint which is peeling, cracked or chipped, paint that can be ingested by children, taken into their bloodstream, causing them severe health problems. 
The problem of lead-based paint is particularly severe in my home State of Rhode Island. Forty-three percent of our housing stock was built before 1950, the time in which lead paint was universally used in painting homes. 
But the problem of lead-paint exposure and lead-paint poisoning in children is not related to Rhode Island; it is truly a national problem. One in 11 children nationwide have elevated blood levels, and if you refer to the chart on my left, you can see that, for example, in the city of Baltimore, 22 percent of children age 1 through 6 have dangerously high levels of blood--Chicago, 12 percent; Davenport, Iowa, 18 percent; Denver, CO, 16 percent; Milwaukee, 36 percent; St. Louis, MO, 23 percent; my home State, Providence, RI, 28 percent of children tested have higher than normal levels of lead in their bloodstream. This is a nationwide problem. It is a problem particularly severe in the older urban areas of the country, but not exclusively there. 
Again, one of the key factors is housing stock of the community. Housing built before 1950 typically have extensive lead paint still residing in these homes. If you look across the country, there are States everywhere that have significant totals of housing built before 1950. For example, in Illinois, 36 percent of the housing was built before 1950; in Michigan, 31 percent; in New York, 47 percent. 
All of this points to an extremely important public health problem. It is important because childhood lead poisoning has a profound health effect on children, a profound educational impact on children, their ability to learn and their ability to develop intellectually. Children with high blood levels can suffer from brain damage, behavior and learning problems, slow growth and hearing problems. 
Children with a history of lead poisoning frequently require special education to compensate for intellectual deficits and behavior problems. In my State of Rhode Island, officials believe special education services are 40 percent higher among children with significant lead exposure, and in 1990 dollars, it costs roughly an additional $10,000 to provide special education services to a child. 
By failing to eliminate the hazard of lead in homes, we are harming not only the children directly, but we are also incurring huge additional costs for education and health care. This is truly a problem that we must address, and we have to address it with the resources necessary to address this problem effectively. 
Mr. President, childhood lead poisoning is a significant health, educational and fiscal issue. We must do everything to eliminate this lead-based paint hazard to our children. By providing sufficient funding to the HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control, which has the primary responsibility for addressing this hazard in housing, and since 1992, the Office of Lead Hazard Control has been a highly effective component of the Federal Government's effort to address childhood lead poisoning. 
Through its grant program, this office has provided grants to State and local governments to reduce the exposure of young children to lead-based paint hazards in their homes. Specifically, they have given grants to privately owned homes, to low-income occupied, and rental housing, all in an attempt to help them eliminate the source of lead poisoning in children, the most common source, and that is lead paint within homes. 
Since 1993, $385 million has been awarded to 30 States and the District of Columbia. These grants have helped abate or mitigate lead-based paint hazards in 50,000 homes where young children reside. Regrettably, this is just, in effect, the tip of the iceberg, because there are so many homes that have these particular hazards to children. 
In addition to helping mitigate and abate lead exposure in homes, they have also supported programs to test children for lead-based paint exposure, and also to test the homes. All of these efforts together have helped in some small way to eliminate this problem, and I have had the opportunity in my own home State of Rhode Island to visit and look at the efforts that are undertaken to eliminate these exposures to children. They are important. 
What is most important is ensuring that we have the resources so that we can protect the health of all of these young children. As I stated before, this is a problem that is terribly frustrating. We know that children, if they ingest lead into their system, will suffer some type of health effect. This health effect will usually result in poor intellectual development and behavioral problems. We will be paying later through special education and through the lifetime of these children who then become adults. 
We can at this point take an effective step to ensure that these problems are addressed. It is preventable. It is a pediatric disease we can prevent if we simply get the lead out. My amendment this evening will increase the resources to the Office of Lead Hazard Mitigation so that we can, in fact, help local communities ensure that the housing these young children are living in is lead free. 
Oftentimes, the families of these children have no choice. They must go to homes that is the best available housing, but in providing a shelter for their child, in some cases unwittingly they are exposing their child to a hazard which will claim not only their health, but also their intellectual development. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment. I am prepared to yield to the chairman at this time.  
Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the conference report on the IRS reform legislation, but also to raise concerns about several provisions in the bill. 
Mr. President, I believe this legislation goes a long way in making a number of important organizational and management reforms at the IRS that will enable the agency to become more efficient and taxpayer-friendly. Such steps are welcome and should help to address the concerns of millions of taxpayers. In addition, the bill includes provisions to encourage electronic filing and promote the use of digital signatures--advances which will substantially improve tax administration for filers and the IRS. 
However, Mr. President, I am concerned about the long-term cost of provisions in the bill that will make it easier for the wealthiest Americans to convert traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs which allow tax-free withdrawals. Under last year's budget agreement, individuals with an annual adjusted gross income of less than $100,000 are permitted to convert traditional IRAs into Roth IRAs. Currently, individuals over the age of 70 1/2 must withdraw a minimum amount from an IRA each year and these withdrawals count toward the income threshold for conversion to a Roth IRA. Provisions in the conference report, however, would exclude required annual withdrawals when determining an individual's eligibility to convert a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. As a result, some of America's wealthiest will be able to rollover large IRA balances into Roth IRAs, thus exempting themselves and their heirs from future taxes. 
While the Roth IRA provisions will raise tax revenues initially because they will encourage taxable conversions, the long-term costs resulting from foregone revenue will be significant. In fact, in recognition of this issue, the conferees delayed implementation of the conversion provision until 2005, thereby putting the revenue losses outside of the 10-year budget scoring window. 
Mr. President, I am also concerned about provisions that reduce the holding period for investments from 18 months to 12 months to qualify for a lower capital gains rate. In the Taxpayer Relief Act passed in 1997, Congress reduced the capital gains tax rate, but lengthened the holding period necessary to take advantage of the new lower rate. It was thought that lengthening the holding period would discourage churning, and encourage long-term savings and investment. By reducing the holding period, we are abandoning one important condition of last year's capital gains reduction, and we may be encouraging short-term profit-taking at the expense of long-term investment. I believe such a provision is unwise and costly in view of the dismally low savings rate which currently exists in the U.S. 
Finally, I am concerned that the conferees knowingly failed to close a loophole accidentally created in the Taxpayer Relief Act which benefits several hundred of the wealthiest Americans. Specifically, the loophole benefits the heirs of individuals whose estates are worth more than $17 million, saving each estate approximately $200,000 in taxes. The cost of this loophole is $880 million over 10 years. In view of its significant cost and limited benefit, I believe the conferees should have used the IRS reform legislation as an opportunity to close this loophole, not affirm it. 
Again, Mr. President, on balance I believe this is a good bill. However, I would hope that my colleagues consider the concerns I have raised when the Senate debates tax legislation in the future.

Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I believe the Senator from Iowa has introduced a very worthy amendment that is consistent with the overall thrust of the legislation to provide more affordable access to college for hundreds of thousands of American students. I hope that his amendment will prevail. 
It also, I believe, compliments many other portions of this legislation which is particularly directed at providing more opportunities for Americans to go on to higher education. 
One aspect that I think it compliments is the existing State Student Incentive Grant Program. This is a program that has been operating for years to provide Federal resources to local communities, to States, which they match dollar for dollar, which provides grants and work-study programs for students. 
As you recall, last year this provision was threatened with extinction because of no appropriations. But we in the Senate were able to rally support by an overwhelming vote and restored this program. I am pleased to say that the legislation that we are debating today, the underlying bill, makes significant improvements in the State Student Incentive Grant Program. It strengthens it, provides more flexibility for the States. And I hope we will provide further support, not only here but in the other body, so that we can continue to fund this very worthy program. 
Once again, this program, like the Senator's amendment, is designed to provide particularly low-income American students access to higher education, to make higher education more affordable. 
Also, having this opportunity to speak briefly for a moment, I would like to point out another aspect of the underlying legislation which I think is very important, and that is the strengthened provisions for teacher education. 
I was very pleased to note that many provisions of legislation introduced to strengthen teacher education have been incorporated in the underlying legislation. In particular, I was very pleased to introduce legislation under S. 1169, the 
Teacher Excellence in America Challenge Act, or the TEACH Act. This legislation was based upon a national commission to report what matters most, teaching in America, which essentially pointed out that we have a long way to go to ensure that every child in this country has a high-quality teacher in the classroom. Yet, we can take steps to get us to that worthy objective. 
One step we can do is to force partnerships between schools of higher education and actually elementary and secondary schools and other participants, essentially incorporating a model of education much like medical education. We would never think about going to a physician that had no extensive clinical training, yet we send young teachers into the classroom that have barely weeks of actual classroom experience. 
So I hope building on this commission's report, building on the language of this particular legislation, that we can improve dramatically the quality of education and teachers in this country. 
Just as an aside, several weeks ago, Massachusetts conducted its first intensive testing of prospective teachers. They found, in a shocking way, that 59 percent of these teachers failed an examination which was designed to test a strong 10th grader, basically focusing on simple grammar, English, writing, and mathematics. This is a shocking indication of how far we have to go to improve teaching in America. And the underlying legislation has provisions which I have introduced separately which have been incorporated which will do that. 
By and large, this is an excellent piece of legislation. I, of course, commend Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their leadership, and Senator Coats and Senator Dodd, and all the members of the committee. And, once again, I hope that we will quickly not only adopt the amendment of the Senator from Iowa, but also the underlying legislation which is a strong bipartisan attempt to further increase and strengthen the access to college for American students. In doing so, I think we will go a long way in keeping faith with a very important part not only of our country, but making sure that the future of our country is strong. 
With that, I yield back my time. 
Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Health Care Consumer Assistance Act. This legislation creates a consumer assistance program that is key to patient protections in the health insurance market. 
President Clinton's Health Quality Commission stated in its recently released Bill of Rights that consumers have the right to receive accurate, easily understood information and get assistance in making informed decisions about health plans and providers. Today, only a loose patchwork of consumer assistance services exists. And, while a number of sources provide assistance, most programs are limited. Many consumer groups have advocated for the establishment of consumer assistance programs to support consumers' growing need of information. 
The legislation I am introducing today gives states grants to establish nonprofit, private consumer assistance program designed to help consumers understand and act on their health care choices, rights and responsibilities. Under my bill, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will make available funds for states to select an independent, nonprofit agency to provide the following services to consumers: provide information to consumers relating to their choices, rights and responsibilities within the plans they select; operate 1-800 telephone hotlines to respond to consumer information, advice and assistance requests; produce and disseminate educational materials about patients' rights; provide assistance and representation to people who wish to appeal the denial, termination, or reduction of health care services, or a refusal to pay for health services; and collect and disseminate data about inquiries, problems and grievances handled by the consumer assistance program. 
This program has been championed by Ron Pollack of Families USA, a member of the President's Commission on Quality, as well as numerous other consumer advocates. 
Mr. President, I have joined with many of my Democratic colleagues in sponsoring S.1890, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 1998. I am pleased that S.1890 would establish a consumer assistance program, similar to that established by my legislation. My purpose today is to emphasize the importance of such a consumer protection program. This legislation is not without controversy, but I believe that American consumers deserve protection and assistance as they attempt to navigate the often confusing and complex world of health insurance.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the extraordinary work of nine fifth graders and their teacher from the Oak Lawn Elementary School in Cranston, Rhode Island. On Friday, June 5, these students became the first civilians in the 223-year history of the U.S. Navy to name a naval ship. 
In February, the Navy challenged America's school children to name its newest oceanographic survey vessel. Out of 1,600 submissions, the Navy ultimately chose the name proposed by these young Oak Lawn students: the USNS Bruce C. Heezen. 
Bruce C. Heezen was a pioneer in oceanographic research. During his career, Heezen identified the rift at the center of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, discovered ocean turbidity currents and formulated theories about ocean crust formation. He dedicated his life to exploring the world's oceans, providing future oceanographers with an invaluable knowledge base upon which to build. Heezen died in 1977 while aboard the Navy's nuclear research submersible enroute to further study the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. 
These fifth graders dedicated tremendous time and energy to this project. Not only did they learn about oceanography, but they also shared their new knowledge with their fellow students at Oak Lawn Elementary. Now, with the naming of this new vessel, the USNS Bruce C. Heezen, the work of these outstanding young scholars will enlighten all those who look upon this great ship. I commend Amanda Baillargeon, James Coogan, Meagan Durigan, Stephen Fish, Patricia Gumbley, John Lucier, Sara Piccirilli, Dana Scott, Rebecca Webber. I also want to recognize their teacher, Ms. Marilyn Remick, who has been expanding the minds of students for 28 years. 
The USNS Bruce C. Heezen is a fine and fitting name for the Navy's newest oceanographic survey vessel. Rhode Islanders and all Americans should be proud that students like those at Oak Lawn Elementary are keeping Heezen's memory alive to inspire future oceanographers. I hope the fifth graders of Oak Lawn Elementary will inspire others in search for knowledge.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, before this body today is my amendment which would deny the deductibility of advertising expenses to the tobacco industry if they did not follow the FDA rules with respect to advertising. 
The FDA, after very careful rulemaking, promulgated a series of rules which would proscribe advertising directed at children. Among these rules are limiting tobacco billboards to a distance further than 1,000 feet from a school. It will require the publication of advertisements in youth-oriented magazines to be in black and white text only. It would dispense with some of the other staples of advertising that the industry is using. 
As the Senator from North Dakota has pointed out and as I pointed out in my remarks last Friday, there is clear, convincing, overwhelming evidence that for decades the tobacco industry has deliberately, relentlessly, and ruthlessly targeted children in their advertising. It is not an accident. It is not a coincidence. It is not the collateral effect of trying to reach the 21- to 25-year-old market. It is very purposeful, very deliberate, and, regrettably, very effective. 
In the course of the debate over the last several weeks we have taken diversions through many different areas. We are talking about tax policy. We are talking about child care policy. We are talking about how we spend these resources, whether this is an inappropriate tax. I think it is helpful to refocus why we are here. We are here because the tobacco industry, as I mentioned before, has, over decades, targeted young people for their advertising. They are attempting, and succeeding too well, to literally entice young people as young as 12 and 13 years old into smoking cigarettes and using other tobacco products. 
I think that is wrong. I think the vast majority of the Americans think that is wrong. I think the vast majority of my colleagues in the Senate feel it is wrong. We can do something about it. As we have discussed all of these different issues of tax policy, fiscal policy, regulatory policy, it sometimes helps to remind all of us what the industry is doing. 
I had a very graphic reminder sent to me by one of my constituents from Rhode Island. I mentioned this last week. This is a very slick, sophisticated, mailing piece, sent to his son, a 16-year-old junior in high school. I have blown it up here so the audience can see in larger detail what I am talking about. Again, this was sent to a 16-year-old. It was sent addressed to him, personally. It wasn't `occupant,' or `resident.' It was addressed to him. 
As a first point, I can recall as a youngster when I ever got mail it was a big occasion. To think that someone would actually want to send me a letter, particularly a big company like the Brown & Williamson Tobacco company was a big occasion. 
The first part of it grabs your attention: `We know you like it loud.' How do they know they like it loud? Because he essentially was contacted and solicited because this young man went to a rock concert which Brown & Williamson sponsored the preceding summer. This is not coincidence, either. Their decision to sponsor a rock concert that attracts, as the father said in the letter, a majority of the audience being 18 or younger, much younger in some cases, was very deliberate. 
It wasn't spur of the moment. They sat around a conference room on Wall Street and Madison Avenue saying, `How do we get our target population? How do we reach them and make contact with them? And, oh, by the way, how do we draw them into this addiction of smoking?' 
So he received this mailing at home. You open it up. It is three dimensional. I know in the course of some of my campaigns I have used them in mailings to my constituents. This is a very expensive, very professional, and very sophisticated mailing. It is a very targeted mailing. 
Then you read the narrative. `You like it loud'; and `very, very smooth.' `Kick back today and enjoy a bold treat. Refreshing menthol, and a coupon to save you some change. Relax with Kool, and slip into something smooth.' 
You are overwhelmed by this message. The message is not about the statistics, or the smoking, or the dangers of smoking, the information he or she would want as a rationale consumer if he or she were making a decision to smoke. You are being overwhelmed by I would argue misinformation. Oh, yes, there is the required Surgeon General warning here. `Warning: Smoking greatly increases serious risk to your health.' 
If you are 16 years old, do you really believe that, when everything else is talking about your favorite rock group, talking about how `we support' that rock group in the concert, how you are part of this `loud' generation, how you like it `smooth' personally directed to you? I don't think so. And the most ironic part of all of this is this message says `quitting smoking' will help your health. This message down here says, `We will give you a buck, kid, if you buy two packs of our cigarettes.' What a deal. 
This is what we are talking about in this tobacco bill. We are talking about an industry that has deliberately, repeatedly attempted to market the kid shamelessly; without shame. 
This took place 6 months ago at the same time they were talking about their arrangement with the attorneys general; at the same time they knew we were going to be debating tobacco legislation on the floor of the U.S. Senate. And yet they continued to try to sell their ware to kids. 
You know, people get addicted to cigarettes. I think the industry is addicted to children. They just can't leave them alone. They just have to keep selling to them, even when common sense would say let off while the smoke clears. No pun intended. They can't stop because their customer base is hooking these kids. You hook a 16-year-old child, and that is 10, 20, 30 years of customer for your brand. Of course, we know that one out of three of these children will die prematurely. We know that 5 million people under 18 years of age today will die prematurely because they are addicted to cigarettes and other tobacco. But they don't want you to know that. They want you to think this is cool, this is smooth, and there is the whole adult world opening up for you. `You can be as successful and as attractive and as desirable as any rock star. You just have to smoke our cigarettes.' That is wrong. 
This is just one example of what goes on. It is ubiquitous throughout. This is a promotion by Winston. Winston's, by the way, are the new health food of America. You see their ads. Smoking it is like eating health food; no additives; no anything; it is macrobiological; whatever. Again, they are taking an approach now with their campaign, which is making their product look like it is healthy for you; it is what you would buy if you were a research scientist trying to develop the best diet in the world. But they have sponsorship for NASCAR racing, which is a venerable tradition in this country. For the Winston Cup, they are sponsoring it. Not all; you could not argue that all of the people who attend these races are young people. But we also must recognize that this is a very attractive event for young people. There must be something here. 
I read a few weeks ago in the New York Times that Mattel, Inc., is thinking of creating a NASCAR Barbie doll, the most popular toy in the world, because they figured it out, too. There are lots of young girls who are attracted to this whole scene of NASCAR racing and a NASCAR Barbie is going to be a very popular toy. The same type of calculations that are going on at Mattel are going on in some cases up in the cigarette headquarters of the world. But one should say, of course, that the Barbie doll is a much more benign figure in American life than cigarettes. But this is ubiquitous. Our children are being subjected to this constantly. 
My amendment simply says, listen, the FDA, after rulemaking at length, has come up with very reasonable restraints on tobacco advertising. If you follow those restraints, you will receive your full deduction. But if you violate them, you will lose your deduction. I believe most of my constituents would say the same thing, that we should not be subsidizing the tobacco industry as they attempt to lure our children into smoking. The industry spends about $5.9 billion a year on advertising. We kick back, if you will, about $1.6 billion through the deduction. That is money that, I think, is poorly spent. But as long as the industry is willing to refrain from targeting children I don't think we can object because it is available to other industries. But if they persist in targeting children and not following FDA regulations, then I believe we should act very strongly, very vigorously, and deny them this deduction. 
By the way, too, independently, my amendment would not restrict speech whatsoever. Of course we have tobacco concerned any time the Government attempts to invoke any type of restriction on speech. But taken by itself, my amendment would simply say you can say anything you want. You can even promote your product using this. But don't charge the Government for your deduction. You can do it on your own money. 
My amendment has been criticized on a couple of points, which I would like to respond to. First, there are many of my colleagues who say we shouldn't really do anything unless it is voluntary, because, if we do, the tobacco industry will sue us and we will be tied up in court for 10 years. 
The reality is the tobacco industry is already suing the FDA, and not just the tobacco industry, but the advertising interests are all there, and it is absolutely their right. They feel strongly that not only commercial interests are at stake but also constitutional interests. But to deflect or defer from doing something today vigorously about tobacco access to children simply because we might be sued is absolutely, I think, an implausible and inappropriate comment. We will be sued perhaps, but we have to act to ensure that we do what is right for the children of America. 
The other approach is suggesting that the Supreme Court decisions place a much higher standard when you come to restricting commercial speech. Specifically, the case of 44 Liquormart, Inc. versus Rhode Island. I feel somewhat familiar with the case. It originated in my home State. Actually it originated and the legislation was passed in 1956 in Rhode Island. Although I served in the assembly in Rhode Island, I was not there in 1956. I was in grammar school in 1956. But this legislation that Rhode Island passed prevented the publication of price information with respect to liquor advertising. 
Stepping back a bit, I think the judges probably got the same sense that I did when I read the statute in this case and realized what might be afoot; that it is equally likely that this legislation was passed 40 years ago not so much to increase temperance in Rhode Island but simply to prevent discount liquor stores from encroaching on established liquor stores. So right away, there is a suspicion about the underlying statute in 44 Liquormart. 
But, first, let me say something about that case. The Supreme Court reaffirmed the doctrine associated with Central Hudson, which is the leading case on commercial speech, and they said essentially one may restrict commercial speech, first, if it is unlawful; or, it misrepresents significantly the product. Even if it doesn't do so, one may restrict it if there is a substantial governmental interest at stake. The legislation directly affects that interest. And the means are no more restrictive than necessary to accomplish the governmental interests. So the Central Hudson test is in place and remains. 
In 44 Liquormart, the Court found essentially that the State of Rhode Island made no showing that their proposed legislation materially and directly advanced the goal of decreasing the consumption of alcohol. In fact, there was no evidence submitted in the record to show that this would have any effect at all on alcohol consumption in the State of Rhode Island. Alternatively, the Court discussed the fact that there were other means possibly available that had not even been used. On those factual bases, together with the Central Hudson doctrine, they declared that the statute was impermissible encroachment on commercial speech. 
The case is much different here. The FDA has established a record that advertising decisively affects children's choices to begin to smoke cigarettes, and by maintaining appropriate restrictions on advertising, we can, in fact, directly affect the behavior of children with respect to cigarettes. This is not based upon whimsy. The FDA relied on at least two major studies: a study at the Institute of Medicine in 1994, and the Surgeon General's report in 1994. Both concluded that advertising was an important factor in young people's tobacco use. Moreover, these reports indicated that advertising restrictions must be a part of any meaningful approach to reduce underage smoking. 
So this is not a situation of trying something that has not been tested or has not been tried by other means. Their conclusion authoritatively is that these types of restrictions must be in place. 
I should also remind you that we have tried other ways to moderate the consumption of tobacco products in this country. In the early 1970s, we banned television advertising of tobacco products. 
But as Robert Pitofsky, the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, pointed out, what happened is the industry simply shifted to other forms of advertising. When I was a kid back in the 1950s and the 1960s, you would see TV advertising, but you would be very, very shocked if you could have a record of direct mail pieces sent to 16-year-olds, as happens today. And the sponsorship of NASCAR racing--all of these things are a direct result. In fact, cigarette advertising has exploded. From 1975 to 1995, 20 years, it has increased manyfold--going into not only these types of promotions, but also all the gadgets and all the other rigmarole that the industry is promoting. 
This is a Camel cash collectible. Now you can get Joe Camel T-shirts, and Joe Camel lighters, and Joe Camel dart boards, and Joe Camel posters, and Joe Camel everything--wristwatches, you name it. That, too, is part of the ubiquitous promotion of tobacco. And although it says very precisely, `Offer restricted to smokers 18 years of age or older,' I dare say I see more kids with Joe Camel T-shirts and bicycle caps and things like that than I do 40-year-olds, 30-year-olds, or even 20-year-olds. 
So what the intent is, we will let the consumer decide. 
Furthermore, when the FDA promulgated its regulations, they went on very clearly to state what was happening here.  
Collectively, the studies show that children and adolescents are widely exposed to, aware of, respond favorably to, and are influenced by cigarette advertising. One study found that 30 percent of 3-year-olds and 91 percent of 6-year-olds identified Joe Camel as a symbol of smoking. 
Thirty percent of 3-year-old toddlers knew that Joe Camel, that cuddly cartoon character, was associated with smoking. Ninety-one percent of 6-year-olds, in the first grade of school, might not know their ABCs, but they know that Joe Camel and smoking go together. 
That is not good. That is what we are talking about here, and that is why, unless we effectively and dramatically affect the advertising of tobacco products to children, we will never turn the table on this epidemic of smoking among young people. 
Mr. President, I have other comments I wish to make, but I notice that my colleague, the Senator from South Dakota, is here, and I yield the floor.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, first I thank the Senator from South Dakota for his fine words and support of this amendment and also for his effort in this legislative process. He has been there every step of the way, working very closely to ensure that we develop legislation that will work for the children of this country, their parents, and for all Americans. I thank him for that and for his kind words today. 
Again, continuing to respond to some of the issues that were raised today with respect to my amendment, there are suggestions that under the latest case, 44 Liquormart, there has to be a material showing that the regulation proposed, the proposed restriction on speech, will significantly and materially advance the underlying Government objective. Once again, in that particular case they do not find such significance. In this situation, the significance is obvious and compelling. The FDA, after its extensive rulemaking, concluded that limits on advertising will avert the addiction of anywhere between 25 percent and 50 percent of the children at risk. So, literally, we have within our power the ability to save 250,000 a year from the ravages of smoking. That is not hypothetical. That is not conjecture. That is based upon sound analysis by the FDA. And that is material and significant. 
Consequently, all the criticism directed to the amendment with respect to the first amendment, and particularly with respect to 44 Liquormart, failed, I believe, and we are left with legislation that is focused, that deals with a very substantial national interest--the reduction of teen smoking--that directly affects that interest, that will produce significant material beneficial results, and also one that is used now after several other attempts have failed--noticeably warning labels, noticeably banning certain types of advertising, television advertising. 
So I believe we are on sound constitutional grounds and very, very sound policy grounds, because intuitively I think we all grasp that this barrage of advertising images has an overwhelming and upsetting effect on children. If 90 percent of 6-year-olds recognize Joe Camel and smoking, then that is pretty compelling evidence that we have to do something to restrain the way cigarettes are advertised and marketed in this country. That is what this amendment proposes to do. 
Let me also suggest that within the FDA regulations there are provisions which are not particularly novel. All of these discussions about restricting speech, I think, fail to recognize the fact that many States already put significant restrictions on cigarette advertising. For example, in California the State prohibits advertising of tobacco products within 1,000 feet of any public or private school playground. The statute also allows local ordinances to be more restrictive. 
A second statute makes it clear that one cannot sell, lease, rent, provide any video game which will primarily be used by minors if the game contains any paid commercial advertisement for tobacco products. 
In Indiana, the State prevents non-point-of-sale advertisements for tobacco within 200 feet of a school. In Kentucky, the State has banned tobacco billboard advertising within 500 feet of a school. In Texas, the State prevents tobacco advertising within 1,000 feet of a school or church. In Utah, the State law bans all tobacco advertising on `any billboard, street car, sign, bus placard or any other object or place of display.' In fact, the Utah statute originates from 1929. 
All of these States have, by their State laws, imposed restrictions on tobacco advertising. The justification, of course, is that they are protecting children. They have been on the books, in some cases, as in the case of Utah, for 60-plus years. So we are not breaking new ground. What we are doing, finally, is assembling a coherent set of rational regulations based on extensive findings by the FDA which will, we hope, for the first time ensure that children are not the objects of tobacco advertising. 
The other aspect or complaint that has been made about the amendment is that it might not work out well, it is using the Tax Code to enforce a public policy. 
Lately, this body has been preoccupied with using the Tax Code to enforce public policy positions of the various parties, so that is not a novel idea. But one aspect of this legislation which I think is very commendable is that essentially what will happen is that the industry itself will have to police itself. Today, the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, could come in and take any one of these ads and say, `This is false and misleading. You have no evidence to say it's smooth. This is just totally misleading.' They can do that. 
It will take 2 years of administrative procedures to work through the administrative law judge level. And at the end of those 2 years, if the company is distressed with the outcome, they will simply sue and go to the court of appeals, claiming that the ALJ's decision was arbitrary, capricious, et cetera, and that appeal will be stretched out. 
In the world of advertising, the product life of an advertising campaign is measured probably in a month, maybe a year; there are perennials that last a long time. But that particular advertising will be old hat in a matter of months, so there is every incentive, when there is a question about whether they are pushing across the line or not, to go ahead and advertise, because, remember, if you hook that 16-year-old, you have a faithful customer for 30 years maybe. 
In this situation, they are going to have to look very carefully, because the consequence of violating this amendment is that they lose their tax deduction, it goes right to the bottom line, and it is something that if they choose to litigate for years or months and, at the end, they are found liable, not only do they pay the taxes owed, but also interest and penalties. They are very much concerned, as they should be. 
This is an effective enforcement device. I believe we need effective enforcement devices. We have tried other approaches--the advertising ban on television, the warning labels, even FTC jurisdiction to ferret out individual ads--but still we are seeing our young people deluged by these advertisements and, again, remarkably, 90 percent of 6-year-olds being able to recognize Joe Camel as a symbol for cigarette smoking in the United States. So I believe we need this amendment very, very much. 
Let me suggest also there has been another general argument against the amendment, and that argument has essentially been: Well, the sky's falling, the slippery slope; if you do this, you will enforce every Federal regulatory policy with the Tax Code, and that will be a terrible thing. Again, I think that is more alarmism than rational. 
The reason I am here today is that central to the business of tobacco is the business of promoting it through advertising. People smoke cigarettes like this not because they have, I think, some need to do it, but they have been subjected to this type of advertising over many, many years. Advertising and cigarette promotions have been hand in hand for as long as anyone can remember. 
If you go back far enough, the industry was much more aggressive in some respects, and blatant. They put in magazines pictures of doctors smoking away, suggesting that cigarette smoking was really good for them; they put in photographs, pictures, drawings of very attractive, sophisticated young women, suggesting that smoking was good to control weight--none of which, of course, was buttressed by the fact that smoking is an addiction that ultimately prematurely kills people. 
There is such a logical connection, an inextricable connection, between advertising, the way they do it, and the promotion of a tobacco product that it is logical to take this step. It is not logical to suggest that FDA regulations will be enforced by denying deductibility or any other type of regulatory policy. So the whole issue of, this is just the first step on a very slippery slope is, I think, refutable on its face. 
We have before us the opportunity to pass significant legislation which will materially, effectively improve the public health of this country. We have to recognize--I think so many of us do--that cigarettes probably are the No. 1 pediatric disease in the country. It affects kids adversely. It takes it a while to catch up with them, but it affects kids adversely. Ninety percent of smokers begin before they are 18 years old. This is a pediatric health crisis, and we are responding. 
The fear I have is, if we don't respond in this manner, that we really won't be able to effectively accomplish what we want to do. Even if we pass this legislation--and Senator McCain has done a remarkable thing moving this legislation through; his perseverance and strength, along with Senator Kerry and along with so many of my colleagues, has been remarkable--even if we pass legislation that has increases on the price of cigarettes, that has effective funding for a public health program, if we do that and yet we still have no real check on advertisements like this aimed at young people, I believe we will end up not doing what we are setting out to do: to restrict smoking among underage Americans. 
I think we should do it, I think we must do it, and I urge careful consideration and support for this amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, at 5 p.m. the Senate will vote on my amendment, which would deny advertising deductions to the tobacco industry if they do not follow the FDA rules and regulations with respect to advertising to children. 
We are here debating a large, comprehensive tobacco bill because our major goal, our overriding interest, is to prevent children from being enticed into smoking. We know from the industry's own records that they have relentlessly, over decades, deliberately mounted promotional advertising campaigns aimed at children as young as 12 or 13 years old. We know from the effects of this record that in a survey of 3-year-old children, 60 percent or so recognize Joe Camel as a symbol of smoking; 6-year-old children, first grade, 91 percent recognize Joe Camel as a symbol of smoking. 
Advertising and the promotion of cigarettes are inextricably linked. My amendment goes to the heart of that. The FDA has proposed narrowly based and narrowly focused regulations. The amendment would say if the tobacco industry does not want to abide by these regulations, they lose their tax deductions for advertising. Taken by itself, my amendment does not even preclude them from saying anything or doing anything. What it simply says is they will do it on their own nickel. 
Now, we have a great support from the public health community. The following organizations and individuals are supporting it: C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General, the American Lung Association, the Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, ENACT Coalition, and many others. Cosponsors of this legislation include my colleagues Senator Boxer, Senator Wyden, Senator Kennedy, Senator Daschle, Senator Durbin, Senator Wellstone, Senator Feinstein, Senator Bingaman, Senator Conrad, and Senator Johnson. 
This amendment is a logical way to strengthen and make effective the major goal of this legislation. It also is constitutionally permissible under the Central Hudson test, the Supreme Court case that outlined permissible limits on commercial speech. It meets that test. First of all, we are advancing a substantial national interest. According to the FDA documents and their research and the rulemaking, if we have effective controls on advertising to children, we can save approximately 250,000 children a year from becoming addicted to nicotine. 
It is also directly related to the substantial national interest. In fact, the industry itself is the best evidence of this. They spend $6 billion a year on advertising. We are subsidizing them to the tune of $1.6 billion, but they know and they have demonstrated that advertising is the way they entice young people to smoke. If we stop this linkage, we will do more than anything else to ensure that we protect the children of America. 
The final aspect of the Central Hudson test is that this legislation is narrowly constructed and focused. As I mentioned before, it does not absolutely forbid any ban on speech. What it does do, however, it essentially restricts their ability to put posters near schools and to do many other things. 
This legislation is both constitutionally sound and is a public policy which will support what we are here to do--to prevent children from smoking.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, again, the vote before us is a vote on my amendment which would restrict the deduction of advertising expenses for tobacco companies which do not choose to follow FDA rules and regulations. There are many reasons why this is appropriate. The most compelling reason is simply the record of tobacco itself. It is a record that has shown over many, many decades a consistent attempt to market to children. 
There have been some objectives with respect to the first amendment. Let me suggest, first, that commercial speech under the doctrine of the Supreme Court is not afforded the same level of protection as pure political speech. This is clearly a case of commercial speech. 
Second, the test of the leading case, Central Hudson, clearly states that if there is a substantial governmental interest, if the proposed legislation addresses directly that interest, and if it is done by means that are narrowly focused and no more than is necessary, that it would pass the test. I submit that this legislation does that. There can be no more compelling national interest than curbing teenage smoking. 
Under the record of the FDA, they have demonstrated that if we take effective advertising restrictions and put them in place, we could on an annual basis save 250,000 children from addiction to nicotine. That is a direct, material, significant correlation between the substantial national interest and this legislation. 
Finally, this legislation is narrowly focused. 
I also submit that this legislation does not spring up de nova. We have had a long record of trying to constrain access to tobacco products to children. In the 1970s and 1960s, we put warning labels on cigarettes. That has proven ineffective. In the early 1970s, we banned TV advertising on tobacco products. That has proved ineffective. We have reached an intellectual consensus that in order to get the job done--that is what we are here to do--in order to effectively prevent the children from the addiction of nicotine, we have to have reasonable constraints on advertising. This legislation does it. 
I should also point out that many States in the United States already impose certain restrictions on advertising to children. For example, the State of Utah precludes the placement of billboards or other types of visible advertising for cigarettes within that State. 
To point out that in many other jurisdictions--Texas, for example--there are limits on how close one can place a billboard within a school. All of these have been in effect for many, many years. They have been tested. They are constitutionally permissible. We can do it. And, indeed, we must do it. 
We have literally within our power the opportunity to save 250,000 children a year from the ravages of smoking. That is the conclusion of the FDA after their extensive, detailed rulemaking process. We can and we must insist on this type of regulatory authority. I think it will provide a device that will lead the companies to do what they have yet been unable to do; that is, stop marketing cigarette products to children. 
We see it in every manner in every form. I have been for the last several days pointing out an advertisement, a mail solicitation that a 16-year-old junior high school student received in Providence, RI. It was slick. It was sophisticated. It was based upon a rock concert that he attended several months before, a concert attended by many people under 18 years of age. It was not coincidental. It was a deliberate, calculated, focused attempt by the industry using the talents of advertising executives, focus group directors, people who understand psychology and the dynamics of youth addiction, to figure out how they could get the message right in the hands of a 16-year-old that smoking is good; not only good, it is socially desirable. 
We shouldn't stand for that. We don't have to stand for it. We know that for years and years and years the tobacco industry has been misleading the American public. That is objectionable. But when we discover, as we do from all of these documents and all of this litigation, that their target has been young children as young as 12 and 13 years old, that becomes unconscionable. And the conscious of this country and the conscious of this Senate will be tested today. Will we take effective steps to preclude access to tobacco products of children? 
This amendment is constitutionally sound. This amendment will, in fact, provide decisive and effective controls on tobacco access by young people in this country. We shouldn't shrink from this responsibility. We should pass this legislation to ensure that when we finish this great debate, and as we look ahead, we will be confident that we have taken effective, practical steps to prevent children from being addicted to nicotine and tobacco. If we don't do that, many, many young people--the estimate is 5 million young people under 18--will die prematurely. We can stop that if we vote today to support this amendment. 
I retain the remainder of my time. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I rise to continue my discussion of the amendment I offered last evening, an amendment which would deny the tax deduction for advertising expenses for those tobacco companies which disregard and violate the FDA rule with respect to advertising to children. 
This is an amendment that is being cosponsored by my colleagues: Senator Boxer, Senator Wyden, Senator Kennedy, Senator Daschle, Senator Durbin, Senator Wellstone, Senator Feinstein, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Conrad. 
In addition, it has received the widespread support of the public health community. In a recent editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. C. Everett Koop, David Kessler, and George Lundberg wrote about the history of the tobacco industry in the United States. In their words: 
For years, the tobacco industry has marketed products that it knew caused serious disease and death. Yet, it intentionally hid this truth from the public, carried out a deceitful campaign designed to undermine the public's appreciation of these risks, and marketed its addictive products to children. 
Numerous, numerous studies have implicated the tobacco industry's advertising and promotional activities as the cause of a continued increase in youth smoking in the United States. Research on smoking demonstrates that increases in youth smoking directly coincide with effective tobacco promotional campaigns. 
My amendment addresses this critical issue in this ongoing debate about how we can control teenage smoking in America. It targets the industry's ceaseless efforts to market to children. It is time for Congress to put a stop to the tobacco industry's practice of luring children into untimely disease and untimely death. 
This amendment is based on a bill that I introduced earlier this year, along with Senators Boxer, Chafee, and Conrad. I would also like to recognize the leadership of many of my colleagues in prior congresses. Senator Harkin, along with former Senator Bill Bradley, has made continuous efforts to try to eliminate in total the tax deduction for tobacco advertising. 
While I concur with Senator Harkin that this deduction is of questionable value, I would like to emphasize today that my amendment does not attempt to eliminate the entire deduction for tobacco manufacturers. Indeed, under my amendment, they maintain the deduction as long as they do not advertise to children. Eliminating the promotion of tobacco products to children is a necessary part of any comprehensive effort to prevent tobacco use by minors. My amendment offers a constitutionally sound way to enforce strong tobacco advertising restrictions. 
Under my amendment, if tobacco manufacturers do not comply with the advertising restrictions promulgated by the Food and Drug Administration, the manufacturers' ability to deduct the cost of advertising and promotional expenses will be disallowed in that particular year. The restrictions promulgated by the FDA are appropriately tailored to prevent advertising and marketing of tobacco products to minors. 
Key components of the FDA regulation include the banning of outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of a school; black and white text-only advertisements in youth publications--and those are publications which have a readership of more than 15 percent of young people under 18--banning the sale or giveaway of branded items--caps and trinkets, and all sorts of T-shirts--and the prohibition of sponsorship of sporting or entertainment events by brand name. 
The FDA has already promulgated these regulations. They are being contested as we speak in the fourth circuit. 
Today, my amendment offers an additional enforcement mechanism, an enforcement mechanism that I think will put real teeth into the restrictions. We will put on notice to the companies that they themselves have to carefully watch what they spend on advertising for young people. If they fail to adhere to the FDA rules, they will pay, and they will pay immediately because they will lose their advertising deduction. 
Support for this amendment is broad based in the public health community. It is supported by Dr. C. Everett Koop, former Surgeon General of the United States. It is supported by the American Lung Association, by the Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, and by the ENACT Coalition. This is a coalition comprised of leading public health groups, including the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, and many others. 
The importance of this issue is enormous. The facts speak for themselves. Today, some 50 million Americans are addicted to tobacco. One of every three of these long-term users of tobacco will die prematurely from diseases related to their tobacco use. Tobacco is also clearly a problem that begins with children. Almost 90 percent of those people who smoke today started before they were 18 years old. The average youth smoker in the United States starts at 13 and is a regular smoker by the age of 14 1/2 . 
This is the greatest pediatric health care problem in the United States today. We have not only the opportunity but the obligation to stop it. A key component in that campaign to give children a chance to avoid smoking is effectively controlling advertising aimed at children. Each year, 1 million children become regular smokers and one-third of these children will die prematurely of long cancer, emphysema, and similar tobacco-caused diseases. Unless current trends are reversed, 5 million children today under the age of 18 will die prematurely from tobacco-related diseases. 
More and more, we are learning that children are being enticed into smoking because of industry advertising and promotional efforts. A recent study by John Pierce and others found evidence that the tobacco industry's advertising and promotional activities actively influenced children who have never smoked to start smoking. Among the findings, tobacco industry promotional activities in the mid-1990s will influence almost 20 percent of those who turn 17 and try smoking. At least 34 percent of youthful experimentation with cigarettes is attributed to advertising and promotional activities. 
This is an industry which has a sordid record when it comes to dealing with the children of America. We have to learn from their past record to adopt appropriate means of controlling their future conduct. They have made money ruthlessly by marketing to children. They have shown no concern for the children of America. They have only shown concern for the bottom line. And they will continue to target children unless it affects their bottom line. 
The culture of big tobacco is one that has yielded incredible revenue by capitalizing on the vulnerabilities of our children. The story of tobacco and their promotional activities is a story of our century and beyond. In the 1920s, the cigarette industry, knowledgeable, of course, that their products were not safe, had the temerity to enlist physicians--or people dressed up like physicians--to be models in their advertising, to suggest that smoking was not only harmless, it was in some way beneficial. Lucky Strikes advertised `20,679 
Physicians Say Luckies are Less Irritating' and `For Digestion's sake, smoke Camels,' another advertising jingle of the 1920s and 1930s. In 1950, the Federal Trade Commission found that Camel advertising was deceitful, that they were suggesting that their products weren't harmful, and they, in fact, took action against them for false and deceptive advertising. 
So for more than 50 years--indeed, for as long as you can recall the history of the tobacco industry--there has been a constant attempt to deceive the American public about what they are selling. That record is one that has to be countered by our legislation in this Congress. 
Today, we have Winston ads that are trying to suggest that tobacco products are like health foods, proclaiming `no additives.' We have a new Camel campaign, `Live Out Loud,' which is a not-so-subtle stand in for the `cool' Joe Camel target of so much criticism. 
We know from the documents released by the industry itself they consciously, deliberately, and consistently targeted children. In 1973, a memorandum written by a Claude Teague of RJR said, `if our Company is to survive and prosper, over the long-term we must get our share of the youth market.' Another memorandum from a vice president of marketing at RJR, in 1974, C.A. Tucker, concluded, `this young adult market, the 14-24 age group * * * represent(s) tomorrow's cigarette business.' What responsible group of people would describe 14- and 15-year-olds as `young adults'? This is what has been going on for years now with respect to the tobacco industry and their conscious, deliberate attempts to entice children to smoke. 
In 1982, the then-chairman and chief executive officer of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Edward Horrigan, testified before the Commerce Committee and tried to dismiss suggestions that they were going after children by simply saying, `No'--in his words --`[p]eer pressure and not our advertising provides the impetus for smoking among young people.' 
Yet, just a few years later, in 1986, a R.J. Reynolds' Joe Camel advertising memo said this:  
Camel advertising will be directed toward using peer acceptance/influence to provide the motivation [to] target smokers to select Camel. Specifically, advertising will be developed with the objective of convincing target smokers that by selecting Camel as their usual brand they will project an image that will enhance their acceptance among their peers. 
What could be more cynical, what could be more hypocritical, than an industry objective trying to dismiss their advertising, saying it has no effect at this time--it is peer pressure--and internally, in their boardrooms, consciously plotting to use that peer pressure tied into their advertising to force children to smoke. 
That is the record of this industry. That is why we are here today to enact comprehensive tobacco control legislation. I argue that without appropriate restrictions on advertising, it will not be successful. 
The documents that we have seen from all of these different litigations around the country reveal, time and time again reveal they have consciously targeted the young adult smoking market. A 1987 document discussed the `Project LF (Camel Wides), and it states: `Project LF is a wider circumference non-menthol cigarette targeted at younger adult male smokers (primarily 13-24 year old male Marlboro smokers.)' Executives were sitting around in the boardrooms, concocting schemes, so that 13-year-olds will begin to smoke. That is what the record of the industry is. 
I am deeply skeptical that this tobacco industry is willing, even today in the glare of publicity with adverse court rulings, to change their behavior unless we act appropriately and with great vigor to ensure that they do what is right and not try to addict children in this country. 
Every year the industry spends billions and billions of dollars to find new ways to hook kids into smoking. Examples of what they do are endless. We know from the research and we know from our own experience that pivotal in the decision of a young person to smoke is the advertising they are seeing constantly. Eighty-six percent of underage smokers prefer one of the three most heavily advertised brands--Marlboro, Newport and Camel. That is not a coincidence. That is the effect of a repeated, unending assault on their minds and bodies by tobacco advertising, aimed at getting them to smoke. 
One of the advertising campaigns most criticized is the Joe Camel campaign by R.J. Reynolds. When they introduced this campaign, their market share among underage smokers leaped from 3 percent to 13 percent in 3 years--a huge increase. Once you have someone hooked on a brand at 13 or 14 years old, they will probably be your smokers for life, representing to them billions of dollars in profit. They did it deliberately. They did it consciously. They were prepared to accept the criticism because they knew they were hooking these kids, they were hooking them for life, and it was going right into their bottom line. 
And although the Congress banned television advertising in 1970, tobacco companies routinely circumvent this restriction through the sponsorship of events that give their products television exposure. You can see that their advertising expenditures have been exploding over the last several years. As this chart indicates, from 1975 until today, their advertising expenses have increased tenfold. In 1975, the industry was spending about $491 million a year on advertising. 
In 1995 alone, tobacco manufacturers spent $4.9 billion on advertising and promotional expenses, and we are subsidizing these expenses through the tax deduction. In 1995, American taxpayers subsidized $1.6 billion of these expenses that are used in a concerted, conscious effort to hook our kids. We are helping to write the check for that.

Mr. REED. In effect, we are subsidizing their advertising costs. In 1995, the amount of our subsidy, the $1.6 billion, paid for all of their efforts to send coupons, to have multipack promotions, to have retail value-added items such as key chains, hats, T-shirts--all the things the kids really like to wear. I don't see many adults running around with them, but I see lots of kids with Joe Camel T-shirts, and key chains, and all the cool things they get. In effect, we paid for that through this subsidy. 
You can see the record on this chart of their expenditures and our support of those expenditures through this deduction. As I said, they are spending a huge amount of money trying to get kids to smoke. In ironic contrast, we spend a pittance trying to help people who are afflicted with the diseases caused by smoking. In 1995, that $4.9 billion was double the amount of money we spent for the National Cancer Institute. It was four times the amount of money we spent for the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. It represents 40 times what was spent at the National Institutes of Health on lung cancer research. 
Those are the proportions. That is the huge amount of advertising expenditures that are being bombarded on the American public, but particularly on the children of this country. We know the cost to our society is significant: $100 billion a year in health costs and lost productivity is estimated. In 1993, health care expenditures directly caused by smoking totaled about $50 billion; 43 percent of those costs were paid for by Medicare and Medicaid. 
We are paying both ways. We are helping them sell their products, and then we are taking care of the people who are ill because of their products. We have to do much more. We have to go ahead and ensure that the advertising ban that has been enacted by the Food and Drug Administration is supported with real force and real effect. That is the purpose of my amendment. 
Of course, any time you talk about a situation where you are attempting to affect the commercial speech of anyone in this country, you have to reckon with the first amendment to the Constitution, and I do recognize that. 
Let me again remind you that the story of the tobacco industry in America is a story inextricably linked to advertising. For decades, the tobacco industry ingeniously promoted its products and has done so with total disregard for the health of its customers. The industry relied upon image rather than information to sell its product. The tobacco industry has taken an addiction that prematurely kills and dressed it up as a glamorous symbol of success in all manner of endeavor. All of this is unsettling, but with the revelation that the industry has deliberately and ruthlessly targeted children, it becomes unconscionable, and we should not and need not accept it. 
Now, as I said, we do and must and should recognize that any time you attempt to suggest restraints on commercial speech, you have to reckon with the first amendment. But the amendment I am proposing today combines the narrowly drafted and focused restraints of the FDA rule to prevent marketing to children with the recognized and broad-based authority of Congress over the Tax Code to create a provision that conforms to the first amendment. 
First, let's be clear that the Constitution affords a much lesser degree of protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally guaranteed expression. In 1975, the leading Supreme Court case on the subject of commercial speech essentially said that the Constitution imposed no restraint on Government with regard to `purely commercial speech.' Today, commercial speech may be banned in advertising an illegal product or service, and, unlike fully protected speech, pure speech, it may be banned if it is unfair or deceptive. Even when it advertises a legal product and is not unfair or deceptive, the Government may regulate commercial speech more than fully protected speech. 
The record of the tobacco industry clearly demonstrates that this industry, over decades, has deliberately carried out a scheme to violate the laws of every State in the Union. All 50 States bar the sale of tobacco products to minors. But as I have shown in these documents, those laws were carelessly and 
callously disregarded by the industry in their attempt to, as they say, `get the young adult market'--13-, 14-, 15-, 16-, and 17-year-olds. 
Since this advertising campaign consciously sought to illegally market their products to children, there should be no protection. The first amendment does not give them the right to engage in illegal marketing schemes. Thus, the most basic reason that this amendment will pass constitutional muster is the fact that it is designed to prevent tobacco companies from promoting illegal transactions. 
Even if one were to invoke the constitutional test applied to the legal sale of commercial products, this would still pass muster. In the Central Hudson case, the Supreme Court established the standards for evaluating a purported restraint on commercial speech. As a preliminary point, the Court drew a distinction between legal activities and unlawful activities or misleading speech. 
As I have already indicated, if the commercial speech in question involves unlawful activities or it is misleading, then the Government may restrict it. Or, as the Supreme Court indicated in Central Hudson, there can be no constitutional objection to the suppression of commercial messages that do not accurately inform the public about lawful activity. 
Now, assuming for the sake of argument, despite the rapidly accumulating evidence to the contrary, that tobacco advertising would be treated as routine commercial speech and the Court would ignore the inherent illegality of their plans to market to children, the proposed restriction still meets the standards of Central Hudson. First, there is a substantial governmental interest in restricting advertising aimed at minors. Second, the proposed restraints directly advance this governmental interest. Finally, the proposed legislation is no more extensive than necessary to serve this substantial governmental interest. 
Now, what could be of greater interest to the American people than the prevention of 3,000 children a day from becoming addicted to cigarettes? I daresay that every Member of this Senate would concur that this is not only a valid governmental interest, it is a compelling one--1 million children a year become addicted to cigarettes, and one-third of these children will die prematurely as a result. The FDA has concluded in extensive rule-making that limits on advertising will avert the addiction of anywhere between 25 percent and 50 percent of these children at risk. Literally, we have it within our power to save 250,000 children a year from the ravages of smoking. Prevention of childhood smoking is clearly and unequivocally a substantial governmental interest. 
The second prong of the Central Hudson test requires a showing that the proposed restraints directly advance this substantial public interest. Perhaps the most compelling evidence to establish this point is the behavior of the tobacco industry itself. They certainly feel that advertising and marketing is an important part of their strategy to addict children. The industry, overall, spends $5 billion a year on advertising; that is $13 million a day. 
We know from the internal documents I have shared with you that much of this effort is directed at ensnaring children. I can remind you of the numerous documents I have cited. They indicate a deliberate and calculated attempt to addict children. Unless we restrain advertising directed at children, we will never effectively prevent the use of tobacco products by children. 
All of this evidence is substantiated by the research underlying the FDA rule. In its rule-making, FDA relied on two major studies summarizing the effects of advertising on youthful tobacco use--the study of the Institute of Medicine in 1994 and the Surgeon General's Report in 1994 
concluded that advertising was an important factor in young people's tobacco use. Moreover, these reports indicated that advertising restrictions must be part of any meaningful approach to reduce underage smoking. In promulgating its rule, the FDA declared:  
Collectively, the studies show that children and adolescents are widely exposed to, aware of, respond favorably to, and are influenced by cigarette advertising. One study found that 30 percent of 3-year-olds and 91 percent of 6-year-olds identified Joe Camel as a symbol of smoking. Other studies have shown that young people's exposure to cigarette advertising is positively related to smoking behavior and their intention to smoke. 
All of this shows that the FDA rules and my amendment are directly related to achieving the substantial government interest. 
And the final issue that has to be addressed with respect to the Central Hudson test is to ensure that the proposed restrictions are no more extensive than necessary to accomplish the governmental objective. In the realm of commercial speech, the court requires there be a `reasonable' correlation between the proposed restraint and the policy outcome sought. 
Now, it is important to note that the proposed restrictions under the FDA rule do not absolutely prohibit the advertising of tobacco products. They have been carefully tailored to allow continued promotion of cigarettes to adults. Their objective is to prevent marketing to children. The FDA regulations retain the informational value that such advertising has for adults, but affects in a positive way access to these images by children. 
It is also important to note that we have, over several decades, tried other means short of advertising restrictions to stem the epidemic of underage smoking. Warning labels have not worked. They are ignored by children in the clutter of the `live out loud,' rock-and-roll imagery, or the Joe Camel character, all of those things. 
In fact, ironically, the only one the warning labels seem to have helped at least for a while is the industry itself, because they use them in their defense to say that smokers assumed the risk when they picked up a pack of cigarettes because of that label. We tried to ban advertising on television. That has not worked either. 
As Chairman Robert Pitofsky of the Federal Trade Commission pointed out in his testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee: 
After cigarette manufacturers were prohibited from advertising on television and radio in 1969 (a prohibition that was intended, in part, to protect children), they put tens of millions of dollars in print advertising to sell their products. In more recent years, the cigarette manufacturers have shifted an increasing amount of money away from traditional advertising and into sponsorships and so-called `trinkets and trash'--T-shirts, caps, and other logo-adorned merchandise--that some believe are very attractive to young people. 
We simply cannot rely on the good faith of this industry to do what is right. Today, as we debate this legislation, they continue to target children. Just a few weeks ago I received a letter from a constituent in Rhode Island. He wrote me and said: 
As you consider legislation regarding tobacco company advertising aimed at children, I thought you might like to see a mailing piece that my oldest son, Mark, a junior in high school, recently received. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company evidently got his name because he attended a concert last summer in which the group featured in the advertisement performed. I suspect that the great majority of the audience was under 18 years of age. 
And this is the flier that a high school junior, a 16-year-old child received in Providence, RI. 
Here it is: This is the first piece, and this is a very sophisticated piece of direct mail. This was individually addressed to the child, not to occupant, not to parent. This was individually addressed to him. It is his own mail. And we all know, when you are a youngster and you get your own mail, that is a big deal to think that you are so special that a big company like Brown & Williamson would write to you directly. 
Here is what it said: `We Know You Like It Loud,' the rock concert motive which they might well have sponsored. Again, as Pitofsky pointed out, they have shifted a huge amount of money away from the traditional advertising to go into rock concerts and trinkets and direct mail, and everything else. 
And this is the bulk of the advertising: `You like it loud, and very, very smooth, Kool Milds, Kool Filters. Kick back today and enjoy bold taste, refreshing menthol.' 
And a coupon: `Relax with Kool and slip into something smooth.' 
`Slip into something smooth,' a lifetime addiction to tobacco. That is what they want. It is happening today, directly targeted at children. That is what we are about in the 
Chamber. It is not about taxes. It is not about lawyer's fees. It is about an industry that continues to go after our kids without any letup, ruthlessly, relentlessly, and they are doing it today, and they will continue to do it today unless we make them understand. And the only way we do it is through the bottom line, that they can't keep doing this again and again. 
We have been debating on this floor the last few weeks whether we are going to increase the price of cigarettes $1.10 or $1.50. What do they do in their promotions? They are cutting a buck. Here is one dollar off the two-pack package. Any style of Kool you want, young man. You are 16. You should be smoking. We will give you a break. 
That is what this is about. We want to raise the price per pack because we don't want kids to go out there and smoke cigarettes. They want to cut cigarette prices to addict children. It is happening today, shamelessly happening today. We can stop it. We must stop it. We have to go ahead and ensure that this type of activity doesn't take place. 
Now, this whole promotion--and I am not the expert on this. This is the whole rock-and-roll series of concerts that are directed at kids. Sure, there might be some college kids there, but this is what is hot in high school. They want to be grown up. They want to go to the rock concert. They are sponsoring the concerts. They are tracking the kids down afterwards. They are sending them promotional materials. They are giving them coupons. Absolutely shameless. We shouldn't accept it. We can't accept it. 
Now, the proposed FDA regulations have been carefully tailored to prevent this type of activity, to allow them to market to adults, to make conscience choices, that we can't stop, that we don't want to stop. But we have to, I think, ensure that they are not allowed to continue this type of behavior. My amendment will do that. 
Now, moving away from the issue of the constitutionality, and very quickly, with respect to the tax law consequences, the Supreme Court has held that Congress is not required to subsidize first amendment rights through a tax deduction, but a first amendment question would arise if Congress were to invidiously discriminate in its subsidies in order to suppress `dangerous ideas.' 
Now, the appropriateness of this denial of a deduction which touches upon first amendment issues rests fundamentally on the underlying propriety of the proposed restraint. And as I indicated, the proposed FDA regulations do not `invidiously discriminate.' They have been narrowly drafted to conform to the `commercial speech' doctrine of Central Hudson. They will, in fact, stand the test of a court. 
And in addition, denying of a deduction as I propose would not ban any speech. The standing bill itself, my amendment, would not require the companies to say anything or refrain from saying anything. But if they violate these rules, they will have to do it on `their own nickel.' It won't be subsidized to the tune of $1.6 billion a year by the taxpayers of the United States. 
Let me mention something else which I think is appropriate in this context. It is that we have to be realistic and understand that this industry has avoided any type of real regulation for as long as we all can remember. There are laws on the books of the FTC for misleading in advertising. And what happens, the FTC brings a case, it takes 2 years to go through the administrative appeals, they might get an adverse decision. They will appeal it to the courts, and by that time the advertising campaign is gone anyway. They are not going to run a campaign for 100 years. It is the game they are playing. This approach, my approach will make them each year look at what they have done because they have to file their taxes. It will put their auditors and their accountants and their tax attorneys on notice that they can't claim these deductions if they are violating these rules. No messy FDA bureaucracy. No FDA agents running around scouring the countryside measuring the distance between schools and billboards. They are going to have to do it. They should do it. This enforcement mechanism, I think, is another positive aspect of this legislation. 
Now, in another context this Senate has voted to deny tax benefits for those groups that engage in speech activities. The most prominent one is the fact that we have denied tax-exempt status to nonprofit groups if they engage in lobbying activities. 
Lobbying activities--political speech has the strictest scrutiny of the Supreme Court. It is pure speech, not commercial speech, yet we in our wisdom have said: Listen, if you are going to use your tax advantage to go ahead and engage in lobbying, you lose that tax advantage. If we do that to not-for-profit groups, where we do that to groups that are trying to affect positively the health of youth in this country, why should we be reluctant to go ahead and deny this group tax deductions if they are engaged in this type of shameless behavior? I think we should move aggressively to do that. 
Let me emphasize my proposal is very narrowly tasked. It is targeted very closely along the lines of the FDA regulations to prevent access of children to this type of tobacco advertising. 
Let me make another point about the context of the legislation and how it fits within the particular McCain bill. I commend the Senator from Arizona for his effort toward the goal of this legislation. Indeed, his perseverance, his strength, his endurance has carried us this far along, along with many other colleagues. But this legislation is designed to prevent children from smoking. It is not about taxes. It is not about big government. It is about making the companies stop soliciting kids to smoke. 
There are two ways in which the bill does it. First, it reaffirms the full authority of the FDA to promulgate these rules. In effect, it supports the FDA's advertising bans that are being tested now by the industry. A second part is a protocol, a contractual relationship between the industry and the government, which actually imposes further restrictions on what they can do. My amendment affects only the first part of the McCain legislation. It would deny tax deductibility if the industry violated the FDA rule. Again, it is narrowly tailored, it is consistent with the Constitution, and it is something that will effectively stop the industry from doing what they are doing. 
We have witnessed, for years and years and years, the industry's unrelenting attempts to addict children to nicotine. They are doing it today. They are doing it through rock concerts, through promotional giveaways, through T-shirts, through every other method of advertising. We know that. We can stop this assault on America's children. We can stop it by supporting the FDA rules and we can stop it, I think, much more decisively and definitively by adopting the amendment I propose, by telling the tobacco companies very straightforwardly: If you choose to advertise to children, you will lose your tax deduction. You will feel it in the bottom line. You will have to pay, as these kids and our society pay for their addiction. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment would disallow the deduction for advertising expenses for tobacco companies who violate the Food and Drug Administration rules with respect to advertising. It is a sensible and constitutionally sound way to reinforce the important provisions that are necessary to prevent easy access to smoking by teenagers. The record has shown very clearly that the history of the tobacco industry is a history of advertising that invites, entices, some would even say seduces youngsters into smoking. If we are serious about preventing teenage smoking, underage smoking, we must have effective ways to curtail the advertising to marketing that is directly targeted to youngsters in our society. The record from numerous documents released in the ongoing litigation suggest strongly, overwhelmingly that the tobacco industries have for years deliberately targeted youngsters as young as 12, 13 and 14 years old to get them to start smoking. 
If we are serious about our primary goal, which is to eliminate access to smoking by underage smoker, then we must pass this amendment. 
In anticipation of further debate tomorrow on this particular measure, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to submit an editorial on U.S. policy toward Cuba written by my esteemed predecessor, the Honorable Claiborne Pell. The editorial was printed in the May 5, 1998 edition of the Providence Journal Bulletin. 
Senator Pell served in the United States Senate for thirty-six years. While in the Senate, he served as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations for eight years. Senator Pell's remarkable career also included eight years of service as a State Department Official and Foreign Service Officer as well as the United States Representative to the 25th and 51st Sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. Senator Pell's positions have taken him to Cuba on three occasions, most recently in early May. Senator Pell's observations of American foreign policy toward Cuba have led him to the conclusion that continuing the 38 year embargo on Cuba will not destabilize the Castro regime and is hurting the Cuban people. 
In his editorial, Senator Pell makes a number of insightful points. I hope all my colleagues will take the opportunity to read this piece by an expert in foreign relations and seriously consider his observations regarding relations with our neighbor.

Mr. REED. I rise today to speak on the amendment proposed by Senators Durbin and DeWine which would, in fact, strengthen the look-back penalty with respect to the tobacco legislation which we are considering today on the floor. 
The key element to changing the tobacco legislation is providing for a very strong, very tough, and a very appropriate look-back provision which essentially would extract additional payments from the tobacco industry if they fail to meet the goals in reducing teenage smoking. This is at the heart and soul of the whole tobacco debate--preventing children from getting easy access to tobacco products, preventing them from engaging in an addiction which will lead to their premature death in too many cases. 
When the tobacco industry announced their initial agreement a year ago with the attorneys general, they indicated a sincere desire, we hoped, to change the culture of tobacco, to change the culture of the way they deal with this product. Unfortunately, for many, many years, perhaps the whole history of the tobacco industry, they have been targeting young people as a means to boost their sales, as a means to enlist and, indeed, addict a whole generation of young people to be their customers. This approach, this marketing approach over many, many, many years, has led to the premature deaths of thousands of Americans. We have the opportunity now to stop that, if we do, in fact, legislate strong protections like a good, solid look-back provision. 
The tobacco industry has, as I indicated, spent billions of dollars trying to ensure that children become addicted to tobacco. In many respects, sadly, the tobacco industry has become addicted to children. They just can't seem to thrive economically without them. We want to change that addiction. We want to change the addiction that affects children, and we would like to change the addiction that has affected the industry. We would like them, if they are to market their product, to do so to adults. 
At the core of ensuring this happens is the requirement of having stiff assessments against the industry if they fail to meet the goals we have set out. That is at the core of the amendment proposed by Senator Durbin and Senator DeWine. I commend them for this amendment. It would strengthen significantly the protections and strengthen significantly the look-back assessments that the industry would pay if they fail to meet the goals of reducing teenage smoking. 
We have seen, over the course of many, many years, the deliberate attempt on the part of the industry to attract young people, to attract teenagers, to get them smoking early, so that by the time they thought about it, they were already addicted to tobacco products. 
The most revealing source of information about the industry's tactics has been the industry itself. In various litigation proceedings around the country, documents have been discovered and released publicly that indicate the systematic and very deliberate attempts by the industry to addict children. Documents obtained through the Mangini litigation further document these efforts. A presentation from a C.A. Tucker, vice president of marketing for RJR Industries, concluded, `This young adult market, the 14 to 24 age group, represents tomorrow's business.' Only, I think, would the industry think of `young adults' as 14-year-old children. And it is quite clear and quite obvious they were targeting these young children. They have done it in so many different ways. 
They have also indicated in documents released by the Mangini litigation that they conducted extensive surveys of smoking habits of teenagers. They were trying to find out essentially what makes teenagers tick and how they can use those psychological forces to addict children to cigarette smoking. This hasn't changed and won't change this until we have a good, strong look-back provision. 
The improvements which Senator Durbin and Senator DeWine are suggesting are just the right approach to make this look-back assessment a positive and forceful one. For example, they will move away from the industry-wide assessment contained in the underlining McCain bill and have more company-specific assessment. This makes sense, because if a company thinks that they can act inappropriately, they can take chances, play loose with the rules, market to kids, and their competitors will help bail them out because the penalty is assessed across all the companies--the good and the bad equally--there will be no real incentive to change the behavior of individual companies, to change the marketing approaches, to change the advertising approaches, to assume and to ensure that what we have is a situation where children are no longer subject to this type of advertising. 
This company-specific approach is going to be, I think, the key. That is what is so critical about this amendment. If we don't have an industry-wide standard for the look-back assessment, we will never effectively change the behaviors of these companies. 
And, frankly, that is what we should be about. This legislation should not be about simply racking up huge payments from the industry. It should not be about how we spend those payments, necessarily. It should be quite a bit about changing behavior and the incentive of the industry so they stop trying to market tobacco products to children. 
Another important aspect of this amendment that is critical is that this amendment would increase the target the industry must reach in 10 years from 60 percent to 67 percent. In essence, this amendment would require a 67-percent reduction in teenage smoking in 10 years. That is comparable to what the industry itself agreed to when they settled with the attorneys general. These two provisions--the company-specific approach, together with increasing the target reduction rate for teen smoking--are absolutely essential to having comprehensive tobacco legislation that will work and actually produce results. They will save the lives of thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of young people today, who otherwise will continue to be the targets of tobacco advertising, will continue to be the targets of the industry and will, I fear, fall under the sway of this tobacco addiction prematurely, shortening their lives and impacting the public health of America. 
I urge my colleagues to do all they can to ensure that this amendment passes, and that we move from this amendment to consider other amendments that will also control the access of information that kids have about tobacco. I will propose an amendment that will condition the receipt of tax deductibility of advertising expenditures in compliance with the FDA rules for advertising. These amendments, together, are steps that we can and should take immediately to ensure that we succeed in changing the culture of the tobacco industry, that we succeed in ensuring that we take historic steps so that children in America will no longer be the victims of an industry that has preyed on them for too long. 
I urge my colleagues to join myself, Senator Durbin, Senator DeWine, and the other cosponsors, in passing this act. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to briefly discuss my support for the ISTEA conference report which I believe appropriately and rationally expands and improves our nation's transportation programs. 
Mr. President, this legislation is good news for Rhode Island, a state that unfortunately has some of the most significant infrastructure needs in our nation according to experts. Yet, many people might overlook the fact that this conference report also provides essential investments in our nation's mass transit programs. Indeed, I am pleased that the Banking Committee's transit title of the conference report contains $35 million for new capital transit programs in Rhode Island as well as $5.79 million for the purchase of urgently needed new buses by the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority. I want to personally thank Chairman D'Amato and Senator Sarbanes, particularly, for their assistance in addressing my state's transit priorities and their hard work in producing a very balanced transit program that will serve our country well. 
While there is much that is good in this bill, I am troubled by some of the budgetary offsets used to permit a higher level of transportation investment. Like many of my colleagues, I remain concerned that in order to accommodate essential infrastructure funding within the confines of strict budget caps, this legislation would endorse a plan to deny payments for veterans with service connected smoking-related illnesses. Indeed, earlier this year, I voted against this proposal, and I plan to work with like minded colleagues in the months ahead to see if we can reverse it. In addition, I am saddened that the ISTEA bill no longer contains a tougher national standard for driving under the influence of alcohol. All too often we hear of another senseless death due to drunk driving. A tougher standard for blood alcohol content or BAC would have been an excellent deterrent in the fight against drunk driving tragedies, and I regret that the Senate's strong support for this standard did not prevail in negotiations with the House of Representatives. 
Mr. President, like many pieces of legislation, this bill is not perfect. However, repairing my state's roads and bridges; ensuring that thousands of mass transit riders in Rhode Island continue to receive service; and improving safety on our roads; are worthwhile goals that I hope all my colleagues support.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am proud to join with my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, submitting this resolution which addresses the unfolding events in Indonesia. 
On Thursday, President Suharto resigned his position after leading Indonesia for thirty-two years. His action was a response to civil unrest and economic turmoil which reached a crescendo in the past few weeks. President Suharto is to be commended for heeding the call of the Indonesian people for change, for avoiding further bloodshed, and for permitting a change of leadership in accordance with the constitutional processes of Indonesia. 
Now, it is time for change. The people of Indonesia and the world have called for it. The United States should do everything in its power to encourage and support the new political leadership of Indonesia to implement reforms. 
Most importantly, we are on the threshold of the chance to resolve the question of East Timor. In 1975, Indonesia invaded East Timor. For over two decades that land has been wracked by fear, suppression, torture and death. Approximately one third of the population has been killed. The United Nations has called again and again for a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution in East Timor, but to no avail. 
Mr. President, we must seize this opportunity. The oppression of East Timor must end. The people of East Timor have a right to self-determination. They, and the people of Indonesia, deserve to live securely in economic, political and physical freedom. 
Against overwhelming odds, the people of Indonesia and East Timor have bravely fought for their rights and caused a powerful leader to resign. The United States if obligated to support them and encourage the new leadership of Indonesia to institute genuine democratic and economic reforms, promote and protect the human rights of the citizens, and respect the right of the people of East Timor to self-determination. I join Senator Feingold in urging the Senate to adopt this resolution.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Frank Caprio of Providence, Rhode Island, who will be honored at the 37th Annual Verrazzano Day Banquet this Saturday. 
A respected and admired Rhode Islander, Frank Caprio was born in Providence in 1936, the son of immigrants. His father peddled produce and delivered milk in the Federal Hill neighborhood, while his beloved mother cared for Frank, his two brothers, Antonio Jr. and Joseph, and dedicated herself to her Church and community. 
Frank Caprio epitomizes the American dream. From his humble beginnings, he is today a respected lawyer, successful businessman, and Chief Judge of the Providence Municipal Court. At Central High School he was an all-state wrestler who was encouraged to learn a trade, but he aspired to attain a college education. And he did. He worked his way through Providence College, earning his Bachelor of Arts. He later earned his education certificate from Rhode Island College. 
Frank taught American government by day and attended Suffolk Law School at night. Inspired by President Kennedy, he ran for Providence City Council in 1962 and served for eight years. He was a delegate to the Rhode Island Constitutional Convention in 1973, and he has been elected a delegate to the Democratic National Convention five times. 
Frank Caprio has practiced law for more than 30 years and has a remarkably diverse practice. He has served as special counsel to Cookson America, a fortune 500 corporation, and as legal counsel to the Providence Redevelopment Agency and the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. But perhaps Frank's most revered clients are neighbors and friends, many of humble means, who seek out Frank as their defender, advocate, and voice. They cherish his friendship and offer trust in return, which is a wonderful tribute to Frank and a testament to the way he has led his life. 
Through initiative, hard work and tireless energy, Frank has attained much success in business. He is a principal owner of the Coast Guard House, a historic waterfront restaurant in Narragansett and another popular restaurant, Casey's, in Wakefield. In addition to his success as a restaurateur, Frank is a principal owner of Cherry Hill Housing in Johnston. 
Despite all of his success in law, government, and business, Frank has always understood the importance of community and public service. He serves on the board of Federal Hill House and as a volunteer at Nickerson House. He is a fellow of the Rhode Island Community Food Bank, and is a member of both the Bishop's Council and the State Board of Governors for Higher Education. 
In honor of his own father, he established the Antonio `Tup' Caprio Scholarship at Suffolk University, and is the 1997-1998 Chairman of the Providence College Alumni Fund. He holds an Honorary Doctor of Law Degree from Suffolk and has been recognized by countless organizations for his spirit of community and his humanitarian efforts. 
Mr. President, I am pleased today to salute Frank Caprio on receiving the prestigious Annual Verrazzano Day award, and I extend best wishes to Frank, his wife, Joyce, and their wonderful family on this momentous occasion.

Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding me time. 
Yesterday, I had the privilege of attending a meeting, along with my colleagues, Senator Kennedy, Senator Conrad and Senator Lautenberg, with C. Everett Koop. And Dr. Koop had the right prescription for this aspect of the legislation. His prescription was quite simple: raise the price per pack by $1.50. As the preeminent public health official in this country, indeed in some respects America's family doctor, I believe his advice should be taken to heart by this body and we should move to support this amendment by Senator Kennedy. 
I am a very proud cosponsor of this amendment. Indeed, this is not a radical departure. Two committees of the Senate have already passed this amendment--the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate Budget Committee. They have done so on a bipartisan basis. 
So what is at stake here is reaffirming and confirming what has been done already, what has been advocated by public health officials; and that is to raise the price per pack by $1.50. 
Study after study has confirmed the fact that this will make an important impact on the rate of teenage smoking. But these studies are less dramatic than the words of people who probably know best the effect of price and consumption with respect to tobacco products--the wards of the industry itself. 
In 1981, a Philip Morris internal document stated, and I quote: 
In any event, and for whatever reason, it is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the smoking prevalence of teenagers, and that the goals of reducing teenage smoking and balancing the budget would both be served by increasing the Federal excise tax on cigarettes. 
That is not Dr. Koop. That is not the proponents of this amendment. That is the tobacco industry, coolly, carefully assessing what price does to teenage smoking. And it reduces it. 
In 1987, another Philip Morris internal document lamented a decline in youth smoking caused by price increases, their price increases. The document stated: 
We don't need to have that happen again. So if the industry understands what will be affected by a price increase, we should understand also. But as I have indicated, research findings from various sources confirm the fact that a price increase will affect dramatically, decisively, and positively the decline of teenage smoking. 
In listening to this debate, one is struck by the different approaches one could take to the goal of reducing teenage smoking. I think there are just two basic ways you can do that. First, if we are really sincere about reducing teenage smoking, we can create an elaborate regulatory bureaucratic structure with agents in every community who would monitor teen smoking, with reports that would go back and forth about teen smoking, with supervision of the distribution network, and all sorts of ways to do it. Or we could use the market--the most efficient device created by humanity to allocate goods and services--we could use the market. 
That is what this amendment proposes to do. It simply says, if we raise the price of cigarettes, we will cause a decline in teenage smoking--efficiently, dramatically, and effectively. 
So I argue, if anyone is a believer in the affect of the market on behavior, if anyone believes that price makes a difference--and I think that is the credo of both parties, but certainly the Republican Party--you would be in favor of a market-oriented approach like this to curtail teen smoking. 
The only other alternative is that we are really not talking about curtailing teen smoking on the floor today; we are talking about something else. But if you believe that we are here to reduce teenage smoking, and you believe that the market can work wonders in terms of allocated goods and services, you should be supporting this amendment. 
Now, as I indicated, the evidence is replete from many different sources of this effect. Reports from the Institute of Medicine's National Academy of Sciences, the National Cancer Institute, the Department of the Treasury, the Surgeon General--all these indicate the correlation between price increases and reduced teenage smoking.

I first want to recognize Senator Abraham's efforts on behalf of this legislation and to underscore that I understand the issue the Senator is attempting to address is the lack of suitable training in our country to provide the types of scientists and engineers which this legislation hopes to attract through immigration policies. But I would object to the importation of the SSIG Program into this legislation; to pull SSIG in is inappropriate. 
We all recognize we do have to educate and train more Americans to take up these high-tech jobs, but this immigration bill is not the right vehicle, and the SSIG Program is not the right approach to simply target high-tech training in the United States. 
I would like to briefly set the record straight with respect to SSIG, its status, and I hope its future. 
First, the State Student Incentive Grant Program is within the jurisdiction of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. We have been considering its reformation and improvement over the last several months, and we have made progress in that regard. We are on the verge, after deliberation in the committee, of bringing a bill to the floor which will make significant improvements to SSIG. 
I would like to also point out that the State Student Incentive Grant Program was initiated back in 1972 by Senator Jacob Javits of New York. It was created not as a way to bootstrap high-tech learning in the United States, but to meet a critical deficiency--the need to provide resources to low-income students to enable them to go to college in a vast array of programs, letting them make the decision of where their talent will carry them, but giving them the resources to go to college and stay in college. 
In its more than 20-year history, it has been a remarkably effective program. It takes Federal dollars and offers a one-for-one dollar match with the States to provide need-based grants to students. It has no federal overhead. It delivers money in the form of grants to low-income students that need these resources to go on to college. 
Now, if we are talking about providing more opportunities for Americans to be scientists, to be engineers, to do all the things that we want them to do and not have to rely upon foreign nationals coming into our country, SSIG is the wrong place to start. We should be starting in the elementary and secondary schools. We should be recognizing that in many of our schools, particularly low-income urban schools with high minority enrollments, 50 percent of those students are likely to have a science or math teacher who never concentrated on science or math in college. And that is one reason we are not developing, here in the United States, those skills necessary for this high-tech age. So, if we are really interested in having Americans qualify to take these jobs, bringing SSIG into this bill, hijacking it, Shanghaiing it into this bill is not going to do it. We have to start early and consistently to reach young people. 
I believe we have made progress in this regard. We have made progress, both in terms of identifying the need to improve elementary and secondary education, and, as I mentioned before, we have made progress working closely with my colleague, the Senator from Maine, Senator Collins, to improve SSIG. We have introduced, with 17 other Senators, a bipartisan proposal to reform SSIG. It is called the LEAP Act. This proposal will create a two-tiered proposal: Up to $35 million, there will continue to be a one-for-one match of Federal dollars to State dollars; but when we go beyond that amount, we will allow the States a great deal more flexibility, flexibility that they will have to recognize by matching $2 for every one Federal dollar. But within that more flexible regime of options, we have actually built in, at the request of Senator Abraham, the ability of States to develop scholarship programs that are targeted to mathematics and computer science and engineering. In effect, working very closely with the Senator, who is sincerely committed to improving the quality of education throughout this country, we have done in the LEAP Act in the Labor Committee what is purported to be done here in this legislation. 
Now, we are concerned--frankly, I am concerned--that if we act in this immigration bill, we might upset the progress we have made to date on the LEAP Act. We might, in fact, compromise its fundamental commitment not to one specific sector of study but to a broader social purpose--of giving low-income students the chance to go on to college. 
I hope we will not do that. I feel very strongly about SSIG. I felt very strongly last year--again, working with Senator Collins from Maine. We came to the floor, we literally saved this program from extinction with an overwhelming vote of 84 to 4 to maintain appropriations for SSIG. Having, in a sense, given renewed life to this legislation, I want the opportunity, with my colleagues, to ensure that we continue this program as a need-based program and not at this moment, for convenience, for an attempt to respond to a legitimate concern about training high-tech personnel, to distort the purpose, the goals, and the future of SSIG. 
I think, working together with my colleagues, we can maintain the integrity of SSIG and we can also, using the Higher Education Act, strengthen it, reform it, and make it adaptable and make it accessible to a new generation of American students. 
I have had the opportunity to work with Senator Abraham. We have, I think, mutual appreciation of the need for SSIG. I hope, working with him over the next several weeks as this measure goes forward, and given his commitment to work together on this whole topic of the State Student Incentive Grant Program--I am prepared at this moment to seek unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, as a supporter of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 I am pleased to support S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998. 
The bill will create a uniform standard for securities class action lawsuits against corporations listed on the three largest national exchanges. 
Class action suits are frequently the only financially feasible means for small investors to recover damages. 
Yet, such lawsuits have also been subject to abuse, draining resources from corporations while inadequately representing the interests of investor plaintiffs. 
Mr. President, in 1995, I voted to curtail such abusive litigation. It was obvious then that some class action suits were being filed after a precipitous drop in the value of a corporation's stock, without citing specific evidence of fraud. 
These lawsuits inflict substantial costs upon corporations, harming the business and its shareholders. Unfortunately, since passage of federal procedures protecting corporations from such suits there has been some attempt by class action plaintiffs to circumvent these safeguards by filing similar lawsuits in state courts. 
Mr. President, this Act will preempt this circumvention, creating a national standard for class action suits involving nationally traded securities. I favor this legislation because it recognizes the national nature of our securities markets, provides for more efficient capital formation, and protects investors. 
However, Mr. President, it is essential to recognize that preemption marks a significant change concerning the obligations of Congress. 
When federal legislation was enacted to combat securities fraud in 1933 and 1934, federal law augmented existing state statutes. States were free to provide greater protections from fraud to their citizens, and many have. 
The Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission has testified concerning the traditional system by which securities have been regulated: through both public and private lawsuits in both state and federal courts. 
Many of my colleagues voted for the 1995 legislation knowing that if federal standards failed to provide adequate investor protections, state suits would provide a necessary backup. 
With passage of this legislation, my colleagues and I have now accepted full and sole responsibility to ensure that fraud standards allow victimized investors to recoup lost funds. 
Only a meaningful right of action against those that defraud guarantees investor confidence in our national markets. 
A uniform national standard concerning fraud provides no benefit to markets if issuers can, with impunity, fail to ensure that consumers receive truthful, complete information on which to base investment decisions. 
Specifically, my support rests on the presumption that the liability standard was not altered by either the 1995 Act or this legislation. 
I strongly endorse the Report which accompanies this legislation, which states clearly that nothing in the 1995 legislation changed either the scienter standard or the previous pleading standards associated with the most stringent rules, those of the Second Circuit. 
The reason such standards were not changed in 1995 is that they are essential to providing adequate investor protection from fraud. 
I have been deeply troubled by the ruling of several federal district courts which, ignoring the clear legislative history of the 1995 Act, have either changed the requirements of scienter in a fraud case or have invalidated the proper pleading standard for a 10b-5 action. 
Mr. President, let me be clear: nothing in the act addressed the scienter standard: which has quite rightly been held by every Circuit to rule on the issue to include recklessness. 
With regard to proper pleadings: the PSLRA requires plaintiffs to plead specific facts `giving rise to a strong inference' that the defendants acted with the required state of mind. Prior to the 1995 legislation, some circuit courts allowed scienter to be averred generally. However, the PSLRA's heightened standard was specifically linked to the most stringent pleading standard at the time, that of the Second Circuit. That standard allows a plaintiff to establish a case by either pleading motive and opportunity or recklessness. 
Mr. President, I believe that SEC Chairman Levitt, who has a lifetime of experience as both an investor and regulator of markets, has been the most articulate concerning the need for a recklessness standard concerning the scienter requirement. 
In October 21, 1997 testimony before the Subcommittee on Finance and Hazardous Materials of the House's Committee on Commerce, Chairman Levitt said: 
In my judgment, eliminating recklessness from the securities anti-fraud laws would be tantamount to eliminating manslaughter from the criminal laws. It would be like saying you have to prove intentional murder or the defendants gets off scot free. . . . If we were to lose the reckless standard, in my judgement, we would leave substantial numbers of the investing public naked to attacks by fraudsters and schemers. 
In testimony before the Banking Subcommittee Chair by Senator Gramm, on October 29, 1997, Chairman Levitt further articulated his position regarding the impact a loss of recklessness would have. He said: 
A uniform federal standard that did not include recklessness as a basis for liability would jeopardize the integrity of the securities markets, and would deal a crippling blow to defrauded investors with meritorious claims. A higher scienter standard would lessen the incentives for corporations to conduct a full inquiry into potentially troublesome or embarrassing areas, and thus would threaten the disclosure process that has made our markets a model for nations around the world. 
I think the danger that a loss of recklessness posses to our citizens and our markets is clear. 
Mr. President, equally important is a pleading standard that allows victimized investors to recover their losses. The reason for allowing a plaintiff to establish scienter through a pleading of motive and opportunity or recklessness is clear. As one New York Federal District Court has stated, `a plaintiff realistically cannot be expected to plead a defendant's actual state of mind.' 
Since the 1995 Act allows for a stay of discovery pending a defendant's motion to dismiss, requiring a plaintiff to establish actual knowledge of fraud or an intent to defraud in a complaint raises the bar far higher than most legitimately defrauded investors can meet. 
The SEC has been clear on this point and it has been well recognized by the supporters of both the 1995 and 1998 Acts that neither changed the preexisting standards. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that the Chairman of the Committee and the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, a prime sponsor of this legislation, have today articulated their belief that including reckless behavior in the definition of fraud is essential to the protection of our markets. I join them in their pledge to sponsor legislation should such protections be threatened. 
As a result, the legislative history of both bills well establishes that the scienter standard, as well as the pleading standard of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, remains totally intact. Therefore, it is now clear that federal district court rulings that have held otherwise are clearly in error.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, as this legislation makes clear, those rulings that reject the reckless standard, or the Second Circuit's pleading standard are clearly wrong and a threat to the security of our markets. 
Mr. President, with assurances that proper protections for investors will remain in place, I am pleased to support the 1998 Act, thus moving toward an efficient, national uniform standard for securities class action lawsuits. 
I trust that higher courts will adhere to current principles of legislative history and case law to rule that the pleading and scienter standards continue to protect investors and that we will remain true to our commitment and fix any error. 
Additionally, as expressed in votes during the mark-up of this legislation, I am concerned that the definition of class action, as currently included in the bill, is too broad. 
Specifically, by defining a class as those whose claims have been consolidated by a state court judge, the bill infringes upon the rights of individual investors to bring suit; a situation sponsors have sought to avoid. I hope that this issue can be resolved today on the floor. 
Finally, I have appreciated the expert analysis that the Chair, Commissioners, and staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission have provided on this issue. I thank them for their assistance.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the Conference Report on S. 1150, the Agricultural, Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998. Certainly, there are a number of important issues addressed in this bill, but none more critical than the provisions that would restore food stamp benefits to many elderly, children, and disabled legal immigrants. 
While I am pleased that over 70 Senators joined the effort to bring this Conference Report to the floor, I am disappointed that action on such an important and bipartisan bill has been needlessly delayed. My colleagues have demonstrated overwhelming support for this Conference Report. 
Like many of my colleagues, I was deeply concerned about provisions of the 1996 welfare reform law which denied benefits to legal immigrants, particularly children, the disabled, and the elderly. The welfare reform law was necessary to help people move from dependency to work, but it was not perfect. That is why we worked to restore Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid to legal immigrants in last year's balanced budget agreement. 
With the Agricultural Research Conference Report, we take another important step to address the needs of our most vulnerable legal immigrants. Some states, including my home state of Rhode Island, have provided temporary benefits to fill the void created by the welfare reform law, but a permanent and uniform federal solution is needed for this group of immigrants. 
Under the Conference Report, food stamp benefits would be restored to those legal immigrants who were in the United States when the welfare reform law went into effect on August 22, 1996, if they met certain conditions such as: (1) they are or become disabled; (2) they are children; or (3) they were over 65 years old at the time the welfare reform law was enacted. In addition, the Conference Report restores food stamp eligibility to Hmong immigrants. While this Conference Report does not restore benefits to all legal immigrants, it is a positive and essential first step. 
Mr. President, our nation has prospered from the tremendous contributions of immigrants who have strengthened our economy and brought vitality to our communities. Today, we have the opportunity to restore benefits to children, elderly, and disabled legal immigrants--many of whom have worked and paid U.S. taxes. I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to recommit and support the Conference Report on S. 1150.

Mr. REED. I thank the Chair. 
I rise in strong support of S. 1618, the Consumer Anti-Slamming Act of 1998, and I particularly commend Chairman McCain and ranking member Hollings for the bipartisan and professional manner in which they have considered this legislation. I am pleased to have been part of this process, and I thank them very much for considering my suggestions to improve this legislation. 
Last July 24, again with the assistance of Senators McCain and Hollings, I offered a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which outlined the issue involving slamming and proposed several suggested solutions. That resolution passed unanimously. Today, I support S. 1681 because it goes forward from that resolution to incorporate very pragmatic resolutions to the problem of slamming that is confronting so many consumers across this country. 
I would also like to thank the National Association of Attorneys General as well as the National Association of Regulatory Utilities Commissioners for their assistance. These organizations and their members are fighting this epidemic of slamming at the State level. They are doing a remarkable job, and they were very helpful to me in preparing my legislation and helping me understand the scope of this problem. 
We have taken great strides in our economy by deregulating many of our formerly regulated utilities, particularly the telephone companies, but all of that deregulation is for naught if we cannot give consumers real valid choice. And the problem with slamming is it denies consumers real choice. In effect, it tricks them into making choices that are not beneficial to them or collectively to our society and our economy. We have to do something about it. 
I am very pleased that this legislation takes very pragmatic and effective steps to stop this curse of slamming, the illegal switching of telephone services. And this is an 
enormous problem throughout our economy. It threatens to rob many, many consumers of the benefits of deregulation and of a free market for services like telephone service. The Federal Communications Commission indicates that slamming is their No. 1 reported fraud. In my home State of Rhode Island, it is the top consumer issue in terms of telephone service and other consumer issues. 
Yet all of these very impressive statistics may be just the tip of the iceberg, because press reports indicate that many, many more people are victims of slamming, but they do not have either the knowledge or the inclination under present rules and regulations to report these cases of slamming. Indeed, one regional telephone carrier estimated that 1 in 20 changes of telephone service is a result of fraud. Slamming is a multimillion-dollar fraud problem, and today, under the leadership of Senator McCain and Senator Hollings, we are addressing this problem head on. 
One of the aspects of the issue is that there are numerous consumers who are unaware of the fact that they are victims. Forty-one percent of these individuals, of those who have been affected by slamming, do not report the incidents to regulatory authorities or anyone. When a complaint is logged, it is usually logged with a local telephone carrier; in my case, in upper Rhode Island, it is Bell Atlantic. Now, these local carriers do try to resolve the problem, but often they do not have the tools or the ability to do so, and as a result, the consumer is left a victim of the slammer. 
When consumers do report these problems and try to take action, under the present regime it is usually a long and frustrating process to get any relief, if you get any relief at all. 
Now, State attorneys general and public utility commissions throughout this country are annually receiving hundreds of thousands of complaints. More than half the State attorneys general have tried to take steps to go to court to bring to justice these slammers using the fraud laws of their State. Unfortunately, these legal actions are cumbersome, lengthy, and often do not really reach the heart of the matter and bring the culprits to justice. 
A smaller percentage of victims of slamming will seek relief not at the State level but they will go to the Federal Communications Commission. Last year, 44,000 individuals brought slamming complaints to the FCC. That is a 175 percent increase over complaints in 1996. You can see this is an epidemic that needs to be dealt with decisively, and I am pleased that we are doing that. 
Now, the FCC does investigate these complaints, but they are hampered by a lack of proof concerning slamming. They are hampered by not having the kind of record that is necessary to prove definitively that an individual has been a victim of slamming. This legislation goes a long way to ensure that all of our regulatory authorities at every level of Government have the tools to ensure that they can root out slamming in our economy. 
First, this legislation places a more stringent requirement on phone companies before they can switch a consumer's service. The bill requires verification that the consumer, first, understands service will be changed; second, the consumer affirms his or her intent to change service and also indicates that he or she is authorized to switch service. 
We have heard lots of evidence of phone companies--slammers, really--calling up, finding a 12- or 13-year-old child in the house, and talking to that child and using that as what they claim is appropriate authorization to switch service. Under this legislation, those types of practices will not be allowed. Also, the legislation requires that the entire verification process must be recorded and also provided to the consumer upon request, so that if it is a 12-year-old in the house that is giving the OK to switch, the parent can quickly determine that from the recorded record and make a correction. 
Now, the other protection that is provided here is that the bill requires that carriers inform a consumer in clear and unambiguous language within 15 days that a switch has been authorized. Many times, consumers do not realize their phone service has been switched until they get, 30 days later, a bill from a company that they have never heard of claiming that they are now their primary telephone carrier. 
Now, this whole verification process will go a very long way in preventing the abuses that we have seen. No longer can slammers use ambiguous or fraudulent verification scripts, essentially tricking consumers into agreeing. Additionally, slammers can't go ahead and conjure up and splice together different bits of pieces of an authorization or conversation to say, `That is the proof you agreed to switch your service.' Because of the requirement for a recorded record, that will not be possible. 
This bill clearly says and makes as a clear standard that without proper verification, without a record, the carrier is in violation of law if they switch services and there cannot be any more assertions by these carriers that, `Well, someone told us it was OK in the house, but we don't have the record. Someone authorized it, but we don't know who it was.' They are now in a position where they have to show clearly that they have the verification. 
Also, this legislation provides for avenues of redress for consumers. First, the consumer can take the issue up with the unauthorized carrier, and they are required to respond appropriately, within at least 4 months, in terms of justifying the switch or making some type of amends to the consumer. Second, a slamming victim can take their case to the Federal Communications Commission. Now, the FCC has additional authority to fine and to penalize slamming. Finally, a consumer who is frustrated can, once again, take his petition under State law to State commissions. Indeed, one aspect of the legislation that is very positive is, there is no preemption of State laws. We recognize that attorneys general and utility commissioners can and must have the ability to work hand and hand with the Federal Government to root out this problem of slamming. 
Altogether, this is very important legislation that provides the necessary consumer protections, that makes the goal and objective of deregulation in a market where consumers choose a reality, and puts up strong barriers against those who would trick consumers and rob them of the choice that deregulation offers, the choice of the best service for them, their free choice. 
Once again, let me commend Chairman McCain and ranking member Hollings for their work on this. I am hopeful that we can move expeditiously to passage and that this bill will shortly be law and we can protect the American consumer against slamming. 
I yield my time.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2676, the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. This bill is the product of an extensive examination of the IRS that began with the June 1997 release of a report by the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service, and ended with recent Finance Committee hearings on taxpayer abuse by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 
I am pleased that H.R. 2676 incorporates a number of key recommendations from the National Commission's report, such as IRS restructuring and the establishment of an Oversight Board. I believe restructuring the IRS will enable the agency to meet the particular needs of taxpayers such as individuals, small businesses, large businesses, and tax-exempt organizations, and be more responsive to each group's particular concerns. 
In addition to incorporating recommendations from the Commission report, the bill includes provisions to address taxpayer abuse and mismanagement practices by IRS that came to light during the Finance Committee's hearings. I was, along with most other Americans, very disturbed by the anecdotes of taxpayer abuse that were presented at the hearings. To the extent that H.R. 2676 will address these problems, I am very pleased to support the bill. 
Notwithstanding my strong support for many of this bill's provisions, I do have concerns about its projected cost of $19.3 billion over 10 years. Mr. President, this is triple the cost of the House-passed version of H.R. 2676. Although the bill includes offsets which purport to make the bill revenue-neutral, these offsets are a ticking time bomb that will explode beyond the 10 year budget window. For example, a provision modifying IRA rollover rules will raise $8 billion between 2003 and 2007. However, this provision will cost the Treasury a yet-to-be determined amount of revenue after 2007. I find it difficult to vote on a proposal that we know will be costly in the long-term, without having a definitive sense of its budgetary impact. 
When coupling the rollover provision with provisions included in the Taxpayer Relief Act that are phased-in through 2007, such as capital gains tax cuts, `back loaded' IRAs, and estate tax cuts, it becomes clear that there will be significant pressures on the federal budget after 2007. I believe that these provisions could seriously compromise maintenance of a balanced budget. In addition, these provisions could greatly complicate our efforts to address the long-term solvency issues associated with the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds. 
Finally, Mr. President, I have concerns that the bill could compromise the ability of the IRS to carry out its core mission--enforcement of the Internal Revenue Code. For example, the enhanced appeal provisions in the bill may unintentionally make it easier for noncompliant taxpayers to avoid paying the appropriate taxes. Similarly, I am concerned that shifting the burden of proof in certain circumstances will undermine enforcement efforts and have the unintended consequence of making audits more intrusive. 
Mr. President, while I am supportive of H.R. 2676, I am hopeful that we can work in Conference to address the concerns that I have raised, which are share by the Administration. Ultimately, I believe it is possible to pass a strong IRS restructuring bill that can address taxpayer concerns, without busting the budget or undermining the mission of the IRS.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, today we are engaged in a very important debate about the reform of the IRS, but there is another very crucial debate that we also must consider and recognize, and that is the debate about the future of our health care system in the United States--particularly the managed care health care system, which is becoming so prominent in America today. 
I am particularly concerned that children should also be part of this debate and that they deserve the same consumer protections that many have talked about in the context of adult health care plans. Managed care, as we all recognize, plays a very important and critical role in our health care delivery system and has provided many benefits. But we also hear repeatedly about instances in which patients--particularly children--are not served as well as they should be by managed care. 
I recall one child who was brought to my attention in Rhode Island. A young child, Morgan Smith, was born in Rhode Island November of 1993. Shortly after her fourth birthday, Morgan was diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma, a cancer that attacks any smooth muscle in the body, including blood vessels. They detected this cancer in Morgan's brain. She was indeed faced with a critical, life-threatening brain tumor. 
We are fortunate in Rhode Island because we have an excellent children's hospital, Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence, which is the hospital where Morgan was diagnosed. The pediatric oncologists there determined that the best treatment for Morgan would be to go to the New England Regional Medical Center in Boston for specialized chemotherapy. Now, her mother, obviously, was willing to do anything to treat her child and have the best benefits for her child. 
At that point, the insurance company denied her the ability to bring her child to Boston and requested that they get a second opinion. They got that second opinion; it was the same as the first opinion. However, the HMO still refused to authorize the treatment necessary for that 4-year-old child to receive life-saving therapy in Boston. 
Mrs. Smith literally had to wage war against the HMO to make her point. At the time, she was absolutely crushed by the prospect of her young child being stricken with a life-threatening brain tumor. She determined on her own to go to Boston regardless of the consequences, risking her financial future, risking all of the resources that she had, while also having to provide for her other children. Nevertheless, she was bound and determined to provide for Morgan. 
Fortunately, this story has a happy ending. About a month after pleading by Mrs. Smith, and by others, the insurance company relented and she was granted permission to have the treatment conducted in Boston. And the child is doing very well. 
That is merely one example of the stories we are hearing constantly about managed care and its inability at times to provide the kind of care that most parents think they should get when they pay good money, or their employer pays good money, for these managed care plans. 
There have been studies in parts of the country suggesting that the managed care plans are not best suited, in many cases, for children. A study in California by Elizabeth Jameson at the University of California compared managed care plans with the State's Medicaid plan for children. Medicaid plans are sometimes stereotyped as the low-cost and, by inference, low-quality health care. This study, however, found that in many respects children in California's Medicaid Program were getting better pediatric care than those enrolled in managed care plans in the State. 
The study found, for example, that some of the managed care plans imposed restrictions on referrals to pediatric specialists. They also found that many plan providers were attempting to deal with very complicated pediatric conditions with which they had little experience. 
As a result of the anecdotal evidence, as a result of the statistical studies and surveys that have been done in parts of the country, I have introduced S. 1808, the Children's Health Insurance Accountability Act. It is designed to provide an opportunity for children's health to be considered and focused on in a managed care plan. This act would provide common sense protections for children in managed care plans--protections, for example, that would ensure that a family has access to necessary pediatric services; that they would have appeal rights and special conditions with respect to children; that they would have quality programs that measure outcomes with respect to children and not just to adults; that there would be utilization review rules that be geared toward children and not just to adults; that there would be child-specific information in terms of the sale of these plans on care provided to children. 
There are so many parents who buy plans and think they have coverage for their kid, only to discover in a time of crisis that the coverage is not what they thought it was. My legislation would put that information up front. 
What I have done with respect to children is consistent with a much broader class of legislation that is attempting to reform managed care for the entire population of patients. The Health Care Bill of Rights, for example, introduced by my Democratic colleagues, is one such plan. My legislation is consistent with this overall thrust to ensure that managed care continues to operate for the benefit of patients, that operates by allowing physicians to provide advice, and not accountants, to control the diagnosis and the application of health care. 
With respect to children, again, the American people are strongly supportive of proposals to give better access through managed care for pediatric services. In a February 1998 poll by the firm of Lake, Sosin, Snell, Perry and Associates and the Tarrance Group--two pollsters, one Democrat and one Republican--it was found that 89 percent of adults surveyed favored having `Congress require HMOs and other insurance companies to allow parents to choose a pediatrician as their child's primary care physician.' And 90 percent favored having `Congress require HMOs and other insurance companies to allow parents of children with special care needs, like cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, or severe asthma, to choose a pediatric specialist to be their child's primary care physician.' 
There is overwhelming public support for these provisions that will allow parents to truly and wisely choose coverage for their children and have the ability to have pediatric specialists care for their children. 
Again, this is consistent with a theme, a message, and a responsibility that we all have; that is, to move in this time decisively, with determination, to ensure that we reform the managed care system, that we provide the benefits of managed care in terms of preventive services; in terms of access to physicians, that we do it in a way that physicians know they are providing the best care for their patients and that the consumers of health care know that they can have access to good-quality care. 
The time to act is now. I join many of my colleagues on an almost daily basis in urging that we take up this matter quickly and that we move forward decisively and pass comprehensive managed care for all of our citizens, but particularly for our children. 
I thank you, Mr. President. I yield my time.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, this morning I rise in support of the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. This bill was unanimously passed out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. It is good and sensible legislation, crafted in a bipartisan fashion. I commend Subcommittee Chairman DeWine and Senator Wellstone as well as Chairman Jeffords and Ranking Member Kennedy for their excellent leadership. There is one section in this legislation of particular importance to me; one that I believe merits special attention. If this body is successful in passing S. 1886, this program will benefit greatly. The section I am referring to is Job Corps. 
Job Corps is America's only national residential education and training program for at risk youths. I emphasize only, Mr. President, because my colleagues need to be aware that there is no other program that annually assists more than 65,000 of this country's most disadvantaged young men and women to become meaningful and productive members of society. Job Corps is the largest and most comprehensive program that offers a second chance to those who would otherwise be left behind. The young men and women who make a commitment to themselves and the Job Corps program deserve our support. This program ensures them access to educational and vocational training, fully preparing them to meet the needs of this country's employers. Indeed, a recent survey of small businesses indicated that a lack of trained employees is the largest current impediment to business growth. As a result, the Job Corps program provides invaluable assistance not only to disadvantaged youth, but also to employers and the host communities of Job Corps centers, which benefit from community service projects completed by students. 
This bill represents a comprehensive Congressional effort to enhance all components of the Job Corps program. Great pains have been taken to create a continuum from the day a Job Corps student is recruited into the program to the day that student starts his or her job, and beyond. 
Mr. President, let me take a minute to expand on these improvements. Job Corps has been and continues to be a model for other education and training programs. The placement rate of the program is phenomenal: this year over 80% of Job Corps graduates will be placed in good paying jobs, enter the military, or go onto post-secondary education. The performance measurement standards of Job Corps have long been praised for being thorough and rigorous. These demanding standards have stimulated the program's ongoing self-assessment and improvement over the years. Thanks to this legislation, Job Corps' performance standards can serve as a model for other programs. With enactment of this bill, all programs under WIPA will be challenged to increase their performance and accountability to achieve the results Job Corps does. 
Mr. President, support for this legislation will help Job Corps become even better. First, with this legislation, Job Corps will become a core partner with one-stop training centers, making sure that every young, disadvantaged person walking into a neighborhood one-stop site will learn about this program and know it is an option. If the young person is ready to commit to his or her future, pledging not to drink or take drugs, the program is ready to offer an intensive, self-paced, state of the art education and training. Second, every Job Corps campus will form partnerships with the private sector in order to develop training programs suitable for available, local employment; identify job opportunities for students; and help integrate the Job Corps campus and facilities into the fabric of a community. Third, a stringent process will be put in place to ensure that poor performing centers are quickly identified and offered help to improve their performance. Finally, every year, Congress will receive a report on the program's performance that will include how many students graduated from each center and from which trade, how many were employed, their wages when hired, and what these students are making a year later. This kind of information will be instrumental to make sure we improve upon the success that has been Job Corps' for more than 30 years. 
Mr. President, in the Administration's current budget President Clinton has followed the initiative taken by Congress last year to moderately expand the program. Support for such expansion was demonstrated overwhelmingly when forty-one of my colleagues joined me in a letter to Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Harkin in support of this budget increase. Job Corps gains this breadth of support in Congress because Members are aware of the positive impact it has on literally millions of lives. This legislation improves upon a program with a demonstrated record of success. Therefore, Members can be confident that the program will continue to serve more disadvantaged young people with as high a rate of success. It is my hope, Mr. President, that soon the Job Corps program will become truly national, with a center in every state of our nation. My home state of Rhode Island is currently involved in the application process for a center. Our Governor, local elected officials, employers, educational institutions, and civic organizations have all committed to developing a high-performance center in our state. I have been actively working on the federal level to assist them. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support this worthy legislation.

Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. 
For the last several days, this Senate has been considering the expansion of NATO, which is a complicated issue that has profound consequences for the world we live in and for the future and security of the United States. 
This decision which will shape the security structure of not just Europe, but the entire globe, for decades to come. It will also determine in large part whether new emerging democracies and free markets coming out of the shadow of totalitarianism will perish or flourish. It is not a decision that is without controversy, but it is a decision that I believe we must make in the affirmative, and I will support the expansion of NATO, the underlying legislation that we are debating today. 
NATO was originally created because unstable conditions in Europe threatened not only the peace of Europe but the security of the United States. In the late 1940s, Europe was still in shambles after World War II. Economies were crumbling, political systems had endured great pressure, and factions arose. There was a very real threat, in fact, that many countries would succumb to the blandishments of communism. 
The possibility of a Communist victory in Europe was all too real. Communiques between the Soviet Union and the West had broken down. Berlin had been blockaded. Tension was at an all-time high. Communists were battling for control in Greece, France, and Italy; a Communist coup had already taken place in Czechoslovakia. 
So when 12 countries came together to sign the North Atlantic Treaty Organization protocols, their goal was to protect the peace and stability of Europe and, indeed, the peace and stability of the world. The parties affirmed among themselves that their goal and their commitment was to ensure a peaceful and stable Europe, because within the context of that peace and stability they could begin to rebuild their economies and their democracies, and the strength of those democracies and those economies would truly preserve the peace. 
As the Foreign Relations Committee stated in its report to the Senate in 1949, NATO would, `free the minds of men in many nations from a haunting sense of insecurity, and enable them to work and plan with that confidence in the future which is essential to economic recovery and progress.' 
In the last 50 years, the signatories' handiwork has borne itself out nobly, effectively, and efficiently. This assurance of peace and security was--and it is important to note--not limited to the original signatories to this treaty. In fact, Article X of the treaty allows for the admittance of new members to NATO. And since it was signed in 1949, NATO has expanded to include Turkey, Greece, Germany, and Spain. 
In the 50 years since its inception, 50 years of progress and peace and stability in Europe, we have seen a remarkable revival in Western Europe. Their countries have been rebuilt. Their economies are thriving. Historical tensions between France and Germany have been channeled from hostility to cooperation. Although tensions still exist between some NATO partners, such as Greece and Turkey, NATO provides a forum and a place in which they can peacefully and amicably settle these disputes. It has been a resounding success. More importantly, NATO has stemmed the march of communism and contributed significantly to its collapse. 
Because the true goal of NATO is for European peace and security--because it was not narrowly focused as any specific set of countries to the exclusion of others at its inception--I think it is appropriate that we consider the applications of those countries who are emerging from the shadow of the Soviet Union. I think it is, in fact, appropriate that we consider the countries of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic because they, too, need that sense of confidence, that sense of stability, that sense of peace that will allow them to build their economies and, perhaps more importantly, build their democracies, so that they, too, can participate in the free assembly of nations in one of the proudest forums, NATO. NATO membership will also help these countries modernize their militaries and better defend themselves. 
Now, I think most people would concede that this is an appropriate step in terms of the benefits I have listed. However, there are those who question this expansion, question it in terms of NATO having been conceived at a particular moment in history when a particular threat confronted Europe, the threat of an expansionist Soviet Union. Today, that has changed. The Soviet Union has collapsed, and, rightfully, people ask, `Where is the threat that would motivate and suggest the enlargement of NATO?' 
Well, there are still threats to peace, still threats to Europe, still threats to the world community of free nations. In 1991, NATO recognized these changing conditions and authored a new strategic concept. This concept places more emphasis on crisis management, on peacekeeping, and peace enforcement. And it is appropriate and significant to know that these countries who seek admission today--Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary--are already participating with NATO in this new strategic approach. 
These countries have contributed approximately 1,500 soldiers to our peacekeeping operations in Bosnia through the Partnership for Peace program. The U.S. offices have been very impressed with the cooperation, the professionalism, and skill of the Hungarians in their operations at our base in Taszar, one of the major marshalling and staging points for our operations in Bosnia. All of these indicate that these countries are cooperating already, are seeking involvement, are seeking engagement, and I believe can benefit from association, integration, and participation in NATO. 
Also, the expansion of NATO would help to quell the tensions that exist, the historical rivalries that exist, among these new areas emerging from Communist domination. As Secretary Cohen stated, we would `dampen nationalism and ethnic tensions by bringing new member states into NATO's security framework. The re-nationalization of defense, with a country obtaining weapons of mass destruction, `arming itself against an enemy, real or perceived,' could be averted by enlargement.' 
This is an extremely valuable goal and objective. If we leave these countries to their own devices, they very well may feel threatened enough to re-arm themselves, to begin an arms race within that region, that sensitive region between the old NATO boundary line and the lines of the Commonwealth of Independent States. That, I think, would be a real mistake. 
There are signs already that the prospect of membership in NATO are beginning to provide very, very positive movements to resolve ancient and long-held tensions. For example, Hungary has entered into agreements with Slovakia and Romania, in 1995 and 1996 respectively, guaranteeing the rights of ethnic minorities. This is evidence that the prospect of NATO membership is already producing positive effects within these countries. 
Again, of great significance is the fact that NATO membership for these countries would, I hope and believe, eliminate the need for them to build up arms independently against perceived threats. If we don't act to accept these countries, they very well could start an arms race in the area that would be detrimental to the peace not only of Europe, but of the world, and add to the tensions in the areas that are sensitive, those areas around the borders of Russia. 
Having said all this, and having talked about the benefits 
 that are, I think, obtainable through expansion of NATO, it would be, I think, incomplete to suggest that there are not factors which weigh on the other side. There are possible consequences that must be carefully watched with respect to the management of the enlargement of NATO. 
There are, in fact, valid reservations that have been made with respect to this expansion. One of the major issues that has consistently been brought forward and presented to us is the possible adverse reaction of Russia. Russia is sensitive to the growth of NATO. They have seen for centuries the progress of military forces invading Russia through the plains of Poland. They are sensitive to this. Their sensitivity has been manifested in many different ways. 
For example, the chairman of the upper House of Russia's Duma has said that START II won't be approved if NATO expands. In October of 1996, the Duma, in fact, passed a resolution opposing enlargement by a vote of 307-0. 
Russian officials contend that the `Two plus Four' treaty which united Germany in 1991 prohibits the expansion of NATO. Although the treaty does not contain such language, there is suggestion by some of our diplomats that, in fact, there was a verbal commitment not to expand NATO. 
All of these things manifest an opposition to NATO, but there are other signs indicating that Russia is prepared to accept this expansion, they are prepared to accept the integration of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. For example, in May of 1997, in Paris, NATO allies and Russia signed a `Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security Between NATO and the Russian Federation.' This Founding Act outlines the nature of the military presence in Eastern Europe upon expansion of NATO, and it also establishes a Permanent Joint Council between NATO and Russia to undertake consultations on matters of mutual interest. 
Russia also continues to perform under the agreement, START I. In fact, they are taking out and dismantling their nuclear platforms ahead of schedule under START I. 
Although we must be concerned with the reaction of Russia, I believe with respect to these three countries, Russia is prepared to accept expansion will not undermine our cooperative efforts to disarm the world and also be a force for cooperative peace in the world between the West and Russia. 
Now, there are signposts ahead which we must be very careful of. The rapid integration, for example, of the Baltic States would send a profound sense of shock to Russia. Any further expansion beyond these three countries must be watched terribly carefully. I think we must be careful as we move forward not to rapidly and precipitously increase membership in NATO. To do so would, I think, undercut the benefits which we are obtaining through this limited expansion to these three countries. 
Now, there is another issue which has been raised and which is also vitally important, and that is the cost of this expansion. We understand that numbers sometimes are in the eye of the beholder, and the cost figures that have been suggested for NATO expansion range across a very broad spectrum, from $19 billion over 15 years to a mere $1.5 billion over 10 years. Now, the CBO estimates are the most pessimistic. Their numbers for expansion would see total costs over 15 years for all of NATO expansion as roughly $61 billion to $125 billion, with our share about $5 billion to $19 billion. 
The Rand Corporation has weighed in. They have estimated over 15 years a total cost of $14 billion to $110 billion. The administration's costs also show a wide variability. Again, NATO itself has projected probably the lowest cost, $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. 
All of this suggests that the issue of costs--and, more importantly, who pays for it--is vitally important to our considerations and is an issue we must continually watch and be very careful about. The bulk of these costs belong to those nations who are joining, but I think we have to question whether they have the economies to sustain such costs despite their best indications and willingness to do so. 
Our allies also must be a source of burden sharing as we go forward, but many of their comments suggest that they have an unwillingness to do more than what they are obligated to do. President Chirac has stated that, `France has no intention of increasing its contribution to cover NATO enlargement.' Even though all of the NATO countries accepted their NATO cost estimate, we recognize that estimate is most optimistic in terms of cost. 
We must be very concerned about this. But at this juncture, I think that will be a factor that, in and of itself, should not prevent the expansion from going forward. We have to assume that costs will be incurred. We have to vigorously, through our efforts, ensure that they are fairly borne by all parties. We have to also do that in the context of our own national defense priorities and an increasingly tight defense budget. But I believe we can work through these issues and we can, in fact, ensure that the costs are not excessive and, in fact, they are fairly borne. 
There is another set of issues that we face and that we should consider today, and that is the challenges of interoperability. The quality of NATO must be maintained. It is, today, the preeminent coalition force in the world. We have demonstrated that in Bosnia. But we are finding in these new entrants--Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary--armies that have aging Soviet equipment, armies that are heavy with high-ranking military officers without well-trained and, in many cases, noncommissioned officers. 
Another factor is that these countries' pilots will typically fly only 40 to 60 hours in a year, whereas NATO requires at least 180. Communications is an issue. The language of NATO is English, yet reports are that many countries have not yet provided the kind of training and upgrading that is necessary so that their officers can speak English fluently and can participate effectively in NATO. 
I think these obstacles can be overcome. NATO, in the past, has reached out and embraced new countries, many times embracing those countries that have equipment problems, that have different cultural and language bases than those in Western Europe. I think we can do it today. But, once again, we have to be very careful that we when do this, that we do it appropriately. 
Let me just, once again, emphasize a point that is very important. Today's expansion--the acceptance and integration of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic--I hope does not set off a rush to judgment with respect to other countries. These three countries have a history that is very closely related to Western Europe. These three countries have already shown their commitment to democracy, to free market economies. These three countries have much in common with the culture of Western Europe, which is at the core of the NATO experience. 
So I strongly suggest that whatever we do with respect to expansion today, we do not presume to rush into further expansion tomorrow. Quick entry of more members will compound all of the problems I talked about--problems of costs, interoperability, the north-south relationship within NATO. Today I will support the integration of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, but I would be very wary of the integration of other countries into NATO. 
In conclusion, I want to say that we have had a very thoughtful and principled debate on this issue. This is not an easy decision; it is a very important decision. Back in 1949, when the United States first joined NATO, it was also a momentous occasion, one that was noted in the biography of President Harry Truman by David McCullough. Back then, he wrote that joining NATO `marked a radical departure with tradition--the first peacetime military alliance since the signing of the Constitution--but had such an agreement existed in 1914 and 1939, Truman was convinced, the world would have been spared two terrible wars.' 
The past 50 years have proven President Truman right. NATO has allowed democracy and free markets to thrive, has allowed peace to be maintained within Europe, and that peace has inspired others within the former Soviet Union. Today we have another opportunity. I hope that the expansion of NATO, the entry of these three new countries into NATO, will provide the same stability, the same peace, well into the 21st century. 
Today, if we do in fact move forward and vote for the expansion, we take on a very solemn and important obligation, and that is to make this expansion work for peace and stability of the world, to ensure that we have not only the plan but the resources to ensure that NATO continues to be a force for peace in Europe and around the world. I believe we can do that. I believe we must do that. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 83rd anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. 
Old and young around the world today remember the Armenian holocaust. We remember that on this date in 1915, the Ottoman Empire and the successor Turkish nationalist regime began a brutal policy of deportation and murder. Over the next eight years, 1.5 million Armenians would be massacred at the hands of the Turks and another 500,000 would have their property confiscated and be driven from their homeland. 
Although it seems that the world stood silent while the Armenian population was devastated, a few witnesses did try to tell the terrible story. In 1919, Henry Morganthau, Sr., the American Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, published a memoir which extensively detailed what he had seen and heard in Turkey during the previous six years. Of the events of the genocide, Ambassador Morgenthau wrote, `I am confident that the whole history of the human race contains no such horrible episode as this. The great massacres and persecutions of the past seem almost insignificant when compared to the sufferings of the Armenian race in 1915.' 
Last August, I had the opportunity to visit Armenia and Nagorno Karabagh. I was able to see the treasures of that land firsthand and pay tribute to the indomitable spirit of the people of Armenia. One morning I toured the Genocide Monument and Museum in Yerevan and then stood by the eternal flame while a vocalist sang a haunting solo. It was the most moving moment of my visit. 
My trip to the Transcaucasus made it clear that despite having already undergone such terrible persecution and hardship, the people of the Armenian Republic still suffer today. The economy is struggling and the area has still not recovered from the 1988 earthquake. The Karabagh conflict remains unresolved and Turkey continues to blockade humanitarian aid to Armenia. 
However, the Armenian people remain resilient, hopeful, and an inspiration to others. In Armenia, they continue their quest for peace and democracy. Just last month, the residents of Armenia showed their commitment to democracy when they participated in the third presidential election since independence in 1991. In America, many communities, like those in my home state of Rhode Island, are enriched by the traditions of Armenians who have immigrated to our shores. 
Because Armenia is a part of our world and persons of Armenian descent are members of our community, we must remain committed to always remember the Armenian genocide. As Peter Balakian, author of the critically acclaimed `Black Dog of Fate', wrote: 
Commemoration is an essential process for the bereaved and for the inheritors of the legacy of genocide. It is a process of making meaning out of unthinkable horror and loss. The burden of bereavement can be alleviated if shared and witnessed by a larger community. Only then can redemption, hope and community be achieved.

Mr. REED. Thank you very much. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut. I think it illustrates two important points. 
First, the huge gap between what the Federal Government promised in terms of special education support to the States and what was delivered. Even though, as the Senator from Georgia pointed out, we are trying to do better, we can do much better. And using these resources rather than engaging in the private savings plan as the Senator from Georgia proposes, but using these resources to assist special education, I think, will be the best way to use these dollars. 
The second point I think the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut illustrates is the critical role that public education plays in our country, because these students--typically these disabled students--are all public education students. Private facilities don't take these individuals typically because they can't afford them and they think they are disruptive. That is the essence of private education. They can pick and choose. 
A public school cannot. We have committed ourselves in this Congress to ensure that every child in this country, regardless of ability or disability, has a free, excellent public education. But what that means in practice is that our public schools have to respond to large numbers of special education students, something to which private education does not respond. That is, I think, at the heart of this debate. 
If we are going to have a public school system that we expect to give education to all of our citizens, then we cannot siphon off resources to private education in the way that is proposed by these savings accounts. We have to match our orders and commands to the schools of America and to educate all of our citizens with resources. 
This amendment does that. It preserves a program that we have all stood up and said is vitally important to this country, both educationally and socially--and that is special education --and it does so by reinforcing public education. That is the way we should proceed. 
I commend the Senator from Connecticut for his efforts in regard to this amendment today.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to honor Brigadier General Joseph N. Waller on the occasion of his retirement from the Rhode Island Air National Guard. 
For the past thirty-one years, General Waller has dedicated himself to the citizens of our country and the Ocean state. He was first assigned to the 143rd Special Operations Squadron in July 1967 as a troop carrier pilot. The next year he was assigned as a tactical airlift pilot, a duty he performed for the next twenty-three years. During this time, he also served as a flight leader and instructor pilot. General Waller is a command pilot who has logged 4,500 flying hours. 
General Waller is noted not only for his piloting skills, but also for his leadership. In 1981, he was selected as commander of the 143rd Tactical Airlift Squadron. In December 1987, he was reassigned to Headquarters, Rhode Island National Guard and named Deputy Chief of Staff. Three years later he became Chief of Staff. The very next year he was elevated to the position of Assistant Adjutant General, the position he holds today. 
General Waller chairs the Eastern Region of the Air National Guard Long Range Planning Process and serves as the Air National Guard Assistant of Strategic Planning to the US Air Force Long Range Planning Office. He is well suited to these positions because during his thirty years in the Rhode Island National Guard, General Waller has witnessed and provided leadership through immense change. When General Waller first joined the Guard in the 1960s, the United States was immersed in turmoil both at home and abroad. The goals and role of the military in the states and overseas were confused and conflicted. During the next decade, the United States moved to an all volunteer force, fundamentally changing the nature of the Guard. Then in the 1980s, military goals and perspectives shifted again during an enormous buildup which peaked in 1985 with a record budget of $300 billion. 
Now, once again, the Guard is adjusting to new era of reduced force structure, budget constraints, and base closures. Members of the Guard no longer train one weekend a month and two weeks each summer. Instead, they participate 110-120 days a year and work side-by-side with their active duty colleagues on missions in countries around the world. General Waller has been through it all and has never wavered from the core values of the Guard: integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all that is done. 
General Waller is clearly an outstanding soldier. His military awards and decorations include the Legion of Merit; Meritorious Service Medal with two bronze oak leaf clusters; Air Force Commendation Medal; Air Force Achievement Medal; Outstanding Unit Award; Combat Readiness medal with three bronze oak leaf clusters; National Defense Service Medal with one star; Air Force Longevity Service Award Ribbon with one silver and three bronze oak leaf clusters; Armed Forces Reserve medal with gold hourglass; Small Arms Expert Markmanship Ribbon; Air Force Training Ribbon; Rhode Island Star with one oak leaf cluster; Rhode Island Defense Medal; and Rhode Island National Guard Service Medal with eagle and `V' device. 
General Waller is also an outstanding citizen. He is the devoted husband of Carol, the loving father of Wendy, Jay and Jill and the proud grandfather of three boys. Throughout the years he has also given to his community as a Boy Scout Master and a Sunday school teacher. 
General Waller rose from the enlisted ranks and has occupied and succeeded at virtually every level of command. He inspired and empowered those around him. He cares deeply for the Guard and the people in it. We are honored by the legacy he leaves behind and aspire to ensure that General Waller is always proud of the Guard in the future.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me continue by again commending the Senator from Illinois. It goes right to the heart of what we do materially to aid the States and localities in the United States in providing for excellent public education and excellent education overall. 
The statistics that we have seen about crumbling schools in the United States is staggering. Just recently, the American Society of Civil Engineers concluded that our schools are in the worst condition of any of America's infrastructure. We know that because we go back to our States and to our communities every weekend and we see these buildings. 
Just yesterday I was in the Providence Street Elementary School in West Warwick, RI. The reason I went there is because this is an excellent elementary school, one of two elementary schools in Rhode Island accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. I was talking to the principal and his staff. They do wonderful things. I asked them: What is the biggest problem in this school? They said, without hesitation, the facilities. The main building of the Providence Street School was built in 1914 onto a wooden structure. But in 1969 the school department acquired a parochial school across the street. The classes are operating in both of these schools. Schoolchildren--first graders, second graders, third graders, and fourth graders--have to cross a busy thoroughfare each and every day to change classes. There is no room in the old building, the 1914 building, to accommodate the new technology. The heating system does not work. Yet, this is a wonderful school. 
That is just an example of one school in my State. I could go on and on and on. In Woonsocket, the Harris School was built in 1876, the year that George Custer met his fate at Little Bighorn. It is still operating. The Thompson Middle School in Newport, RI, part of it was built in 1898. 
These schools need help. These communities need help. This is not just about improving the academic quality, which I think it could do dramatically; it is also assisting taxpayers. More and more of our constituents are coming up to us and telling us they cannot afford to support increased property taxes that support schools in their communities. 
If we want to do anything constructive, pragmatic, and useful to help not only the schools of America but the taxpayers of all the towns and cities of America, then we will support this legislation because it will directly assist them in their efforts. The proposal that Senator Moseley-Braun has submitted is an ingenious way to use Federal resources to promote public education at the local level. 
Once again, we require the initiative of the locality. They will have to decide what schools will be fixed up. They will have to go to their communities and ask for bond authority to do it. But we would by paying the interest to allow these communities to get the resources to make the investment to fix the schools, to provide the education which we know is at the heart not only of the individual progress of the next generation of Americans but the progress of our Nation, because without good schools, without schools that are at least sanitary, that at least have the ability to accept modern equipment, without this minimal level of adequacy, we cannot expect children to learn to be not only productive members of our economy in the 21st century but to be productive citizens of the 21st century. This is the way to proceed--not by disseminating Federal 
resources in tax plans to aid private schools but by allowing the local communities to use their initiative to issue bonds with Federal help to fund, repair, and renovate schools. 
This is what our constituents want. This is what we must do to improve public education in this country. 
I thank the Senator for her recommendation of this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
I yield my time.

Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I strongly support the amendment proposed by Senator Conrad, Senator Lautenberg, and my colleagues. The budget resolution before us today does not give us a fighting chance to do what we want to do, but more importantly, what the American people want us to do. That is to reduce teenage smoking in the United States. We know it is a curse. We know it is causing incalculable pain throughout this country in terms of health problems down the road. 
But this budget resolution does not give us the tools to grapple with the issue of teen smoking. It is illogical, too, as Senator Conrad pointed out so eloquently. All of the major legislative initiatives have specific provisions which require anti-youth-smoking efforts, increased research at the National Institutes of Health, FDA regulatory authority, State regulatory authority, and none of these can be funded from the budget resolution. 
But there is something that is even more illogical, in my view. I do not want to take a brief for the tobacco industry. But with every one of these major pieces of legislation for the tobacco industry, you must reduce teen smoking by 50 percent, 60 percent, or 70 percent in so many years. Yet, if we take all of 
 the proceeds from the increased tobacco taxes and all the other payments and we don't use them in some way to try to suppress teen smoking through counteradvertising campaigns, to try to get people who are addicted to nicotine over the addiction, there is no way that these goals can be met. We are setting up a test that is bound to fail. We have to recognize that if we are serious about mandating the reduction of teen smoking by significant percentages over the next several years, we have to provide the resources to do that job. This budget resolution does not make such a provision. It does not allow us to take the proceeds of whatever tobacco deal is ultimately reached and use those proceeds to invest in a healthier America, to invest in the health of our children. 
All of these provisions, which Senator Conrad has outlined, are so absolutely necessary in making any proposed agreement work, and also, fundamentally, to ensure that we reduce teen smoking, we have to adopt a very strong anti-youth-smoking effort. The principal means to do that is a counteradvertising campaign. Every year, the tobacco industry spends $5 billion on advertising, billboards, sporting events, teams, sponsorships, giveaways--hats, jackets, whatever, key chains--a powerful influence on the youth of America. In fact, all of us can think back through our sort of history, and, even if we do not smoke, we know we have been terribly influenced by tobacco advertising campaigns. 
I was on the floor a few weeks ago talking about the legislation which I had, and it came to me that if I asked anyone who is roughly my age--I will be kind, about 40--if I asked them what LSMFT meant, the light bulb would go right on. If I ask these young ladies and gentleman, they would say it is gibberish. I see the shake of the head. They do not know. LSMFT means `Lucky Strike Means Fine Tobacco.' Through literally millions of dollars of advertising over 20 or 30 years, a whole generation, or more, of Americans understood that. We have to reverse that. We have to convince a whole generation of Americans now and in the future that tobacco is dangerous, addictive, and will ultimately kill them. We can't do it just with good wishes here on the floor of the Senate; we have to do it with real resources. This budget resolution will not give us a chance to do that. 
We have to look seriously at NIH research, because there are opportunities perhaps to develop antidotes to nicotine, to the harmful effects of tobacco smoke. There are ways through science and research. We might have better ways to wean individuals off tobacco smoke. All of these things have to be done if we are going to meet our objective of using this historic opportunity, this historic agreement, to improve the public health of Americans. 
We also have to ensure that the FDA has the resources to do the job of enforcing on the tobacco industry. We know every year it is a battle here through the appropriations process to fund worthwhile programs for the FDA. We know at the end of the day that there are many worthwhile programs which just do not make the cut, not because they are bad but just because we run out of money long before the public health community runs out of problem. If we do not provide within this resolution for the use of the resources of the tobacco industry to invest in FDA, we are not going to be able to give them the tools to do the job to make sure that smoking is not contagious among young people. 
Add to that our responsibility to help the States provide 
an important part of this overall agreement. We expect--in fact, in most of the legislation it is clearly explicitly written--that the States will fund elaborate programs of access control to tobacco through licenses of clerks, thorough investigations and inspections of facilities that are selling tobacco products, ensuring that products don't mysteriously appear in the State without these controls. 
All of that takes money, and the States are going to look to us and say, `Listen. You are the folks that have all of the money. You are the ones that are getting the $500 billion over so many years from increased taxes and increased fees and penalty payments. We need this to ensure that we can control access to tobacco products.' 
One of the other aspects is thrown in our face constantly when we talk about this tobacco arrangement. That is the possibility, or the probability, the eventuality, of a black market in cigarettes because the price is going up. How are we going to counteract this black market if we do not have the resources at the State level and the FDA level and through other law enforcement means to actually counteract the potential growth of black markets? Once again, I don't see within this budget resolution those types of resources being available. 
We also have to fund smoking cessation programs. Mr. President, 70 percent of smokers today want to quit. But wanting to quit and being able to beat this addiction are two different things. They cannot do it without resources--without access to counsel, without access to nicotine patches, without access to those items which are going to ensure that they can avoid their present dilemma, which is smoking but wanting desperately to quit. 
Then, as Senator Conrad also pointed out, every one of these pieces of legislation includes substantial payments to farmers who are likely to lose their valuable crops because tobacco is going to be suppressed in this country--not prohibited, not outlawed--but certainly we hope the demand will begin to shrink for tobacco products as fewer people smoke, particularly fewer young people smoke. Every one of these bills has it. Both sides of this aisle are trumpeting their support for the farmer. They are not going to let these innocent victims of this industry be left adrift without any resources, cut off from a lucrative economic crop and left to their own devices. Yet, once again, within the confines or context of this resolution, there is no resource to do the job. 
We have to do something. Frankly, this amendment makes so much sense. It allows for the funding of all of these provisions. It allows for other important uses of the tobacco settlement, too. But at a minimum it allows us to do what we have to do, and I am supportive, not only of this effort but overall of developing strong and tough tobacco legislation. We have an opportunity, a historic opportunity, for the first time in many, many years, to put America on the path of sense and sanity when it comes to smoking policy. 
We can, we hope, empower a generation of young Americans with the knowledge and with the support to stop smoking. If we do that, we will reap a tremendous benefit in a healthier America and a healthier society. Yet, without these resources we cannot, in fact, go forward because this budget resolution does not give us the opportunity and the flexibility to go ahead and do, again, not only what I want to do, what I assume the vast majority of my colleagues want to do, but what our constituents demand that we do: Use these historic opportunities, when the industry has recognized its past mistakes, when the industry is attempting to change its culture, when we have for the first time the support not only of the American people but the cooperation, to a degree at least, of the industry, to ensure that we prevent young people from smoking. 
The fear is we will have debates on this floor about all of these legislative materials and all of the different aspects of the proposed agreements, but, ultimately, when it comes down to the bottom line, when we have to put our money where our words are, there will be no money because this resolution takes that option off the table for us. So I hope all of my colleagues will join us in supporting this amendment, will join us in the continued effort to ensure that we have good, tough tobacco legislation, but legislation that not only will say the right things but have the money and resources to do the right things. 
My colleague from New Jersey, I think, is going to speak in a moment. I think he is present. While he is coming forward, let me just say that we have before us a very challenging set of issues. This is a critical one, getting this budget resolution in a shape where it will support sound legislation on the floor. 
There are other issues, too, that will come up before us. 
Many aspects of this proposed settlement are controversial, not only between the two contesting parties, the tobacco industry and those who are trying to protect the public health, but also controversial by their nature. I talked a little bit about the need for adequate resources to fund smoking cessation advertisements that will actually go out and convince young people not to smoke. That will become particularly crucial if some provisions we have in the legislation are stricken down because of the first amendment. As you realize, most of these legislative initiatives contain language which essentially asks that the industry give up their first amendment rights to advertise in exchange for immunity protection. There is always the threat that someone--perhaps not even in the tobacco industry, perhaps a third party, like convenience stores--would come out and suggest that these restrictions are contrary to the first amendment. In this regard, we would really definitely, most definitively, need resources to keep up an effective counteradvertising campaign. 
So for these reasons and many others, we must, I think, support this amendment, and we must, in fact, ensure that we have the dollars as well as the legislative language to prevent teen smoking. If we do that, then we will achieve the historic conclusion to these debates.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I, too, commend the Democratic leader for his efforts to ensure that this debate reaches the full spectrum of issues that concern American education. 
I believe there is one thing we can all agree upon: The problems of American education are multiple, and to conduct a debate that would focus exclusively on one remedy and not allow other voices, other approaches, is, to me, relinquishing our responsibility to deal principally and responsibly with education policy in the United States. 
There are proposals by my colleagues with respect to class size. Again, we are seeing evidence from States like Tennessee, where it makes a real difference in performance in education. Yet, we are not allowed to talk about those issues in this debate. If we are going to approach this issue with the idea of helping American education rather than the idea of promoting one particular ideological version, we have to allow for open, robust debate that incorporates all of the amendments my colleagues are proposing. 
And the idea to carry on without the debate, to me, is not worthy of this body.

Mr. REED. Aren't we missing the point when we look at HCFA and try to blame them for the complicated issues that we have asked them to enforce? We are missing the point. Who is really suffering, if we do this, are the thousands of families in the country that won't have access to good health care. It is our responsibility to ensure that HCFA and the States provide real access to the hundreds of thousands of families that need good health care around the country. We just heard yesterday at a hearing about the struggles and travails of a young mother who was trying to get good care for her daughter in the context of Kennedy-Kassebaum, and without good enforcement she would not realize these benefits. I think you are absolutely right, Senator, in terms of the message we are sending. It is not, `HCFA, get your act together.' It is to thousands of families we are not going to enforce the right that we thought we gave 2 years ago.

Even within those States, they are not fully complying with the strictures of the Kennedy-Kassebaum Act. As a result, even in the States that did what we thought they would do, we still need Federal oversight. As a result of that, I hope we will elect to pass this measure.

Mr. REED. I understand that last week the Labor Committee had a hearing on this issue, and it came with great evidence that we need to do more to enforce effectively this bill. And it seems to me that, in the context of that hearing, this provision to strike out needed money is absolutely the wrong approach in terms of ensuring that American citizens have all the benefits of the bill that we all passed, which we all thought would be a major breakthrough in health care in the United States. I wonder if that is the case, and, in fact, did the Labor Committee indicate that these issues were necessary to be enforced?

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 177th Anniversary of the beginning of the revolution that won Greece's independence from the Ottoman Empire. I was proud to join with fifty-one of my colleagues in sponsoring Senate Resolution 171 which designates today `Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.' 
The strong ties between the United States and Greece extend back to the birth of this nation. Indeed, the Founding Fathers looked to the principles formulated by the Greek philosophers when composing the governing documents of the United States. As Thomas Jefferson stated, `to the ancient Greeks . . . we are all indebted for the light which led ourselves out of Gothic darkness.' America owes much to the Greeks for all they have given us, then and now. 
The Greeks have been members of my state's communities for over one hundred years. Over 6,000 residents of Rhode Island claimed Greek heritage in the last Census. When they first came to the state they worked in the factories and on the shores. Today, the descendants of these first immigrants continue to prosper and enrich the state and rest of the country through their contributions to banking, medicine, the tourism industry and the arts. 
Although today we commemorate the Greek victory over 400 years of domination by the Ottoman Empire, we must also remember that Greece is still not able to celebrate complete peace and freedom. Almost twenty-four years ago, Turkey invaded Cyprus and today 35,000 troops continue to occupy over 40% of the island and inflict human rights abuses on the 660,000 Cypriots. Recently, I was proud to sign on as a cosponsor of a concurrent resolution which calls for the U.S. to encourage the end of restrictions on the freedoms and human rights of the enclaved people in the occupied area of Cyprus. We must continue to work to resolve the Cyprus problem and reduce the tensions that exist between Greece and Turkey. 
But, for today, let us celebrate the anniversary of Greek Independence, the richness of the Greek heritage and the legacy of democracy that country gave to the world.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, ten years ago the Rams of the University of Rhode Island, shocked sports fans throughout the country when they beat the #3 seeded Orangemen of Syracuse and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA men's basketball tournament. 
It took a few years, but the giant slayers from little Rhody are back. Last weekend, the Rams shocked the basketball world again, defeating the indomitable, #1 seeded Jayhawks of Kansas. With a win tonight over Valparaiso, URI will advance to the Elite Eight. 
But, Mr. President, don't sell this team short. They may be smaller than their opponents. They readily admit that. But they know how to win, just ask anyone from Lawrence, Kansas. 
I should add, Mr. President, with regard to tonight's game, that beyond the match-ups on the floor, there will be a contest on the sidelines. As many have commented, URI Coach Jim Harrick will do battle with his son, Jim Jr., an assistant coach at Valparaiso. At stake will be family bragging rights that will last a very long time. In this game, however, I'd bet on the elder Coach Harrick. Indeed, Mr. President, I expect to be back on the Senate floor next week to talk about the Rams and the Final Four.

Mr. REED. Children should not be left out of the health care quality debate. I rise today to introduce legislation that provides common sense consumer protections for children in managed care. I am pleased that Senators Kennedy and Murray are cosponsors of this legislation. 
Not one of us can deny that managed care plays a valid role in our health care system. Managed care's emphasis on preventive care has benefits for young and old alike. And HMOs have resulted in lower co-payments for consumers and higher immunization rates for our children. But all too often these days we read a story in the paper about a child whose unique health care needs have not been met. 
While the problems are clear, it is difficult to say how big a problem we have on our hands. However, the anecdotal evidence is overwhelming. And when it comes to our children, we should not take risks. 
While there has not been a great deal of child-specific research in this area, one recent study by Elizabeth Jameson at the University of California compared the experiences of chronically ill children in California's Medicaid program to those in private managed care. There was an interesting irony in the study's findings--low income children in public programs receive age appropriate care that is consistent with recognized clinical guidelines, while those in private health plans often do not. 
The study also found that: some managed care plans impose restrictions on referrals to pediatric specialists and subspecialists for children with complex conditions; and, an increasing number of providers in managed care plans are attempting to treat complex pediatric conditions for which they have little experience. 
The bill I am introducing is an attempt to address these issues by providing common sense protections for children in managed care. It is this simple: if we don't have health plan standards, there's no guarantee that we are providing adequate care for our children. 
Our bill, The Children's Health Insurance Accountability Act, provides common sense protections for children in managed care plans--protections regarding access, appeals and accountability. These protections include: access to necessary pediatric services; appeal rights that address the special needs of children, such as an expedited review if the child's life or development is in jeopardy; quality programs that measure health outcomes unique to children; utilization review rules that are specific to children with evaluation from those with pediatric expertise; and child-specific information requirements that will help parents and employers choose health plans on the basis of care provided to children. 
Mr. President, there is overwhelming public support for the ideas embodied in this legislation. According to a February 1998 survey by Lake Sosin Snell Perry and Associates and the Tarrance Group, 89 percent of adults surveyed favor having `Congress require HMO's and other insurance companies to allow parents to choose a pediatrician as their child's primary care physician.' And 90 percent favor having `Congress require HMO's and other insurance companies to allow parents of children with special health care needs, like cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, or severe asthma, to choose a pediatric specialist to be their child's primary care physician.' The poll also shows that people are willing to pay additional premiums adequate protections for children. 
I am pleased that this legislation has the support of many groups, including the National Association of Childrens Hospitals, the American Academy of Pediatricians, the Childrens Defense Fund, Families USA, the National Organization of Rare Diseases, The Arc of the United States, Service Employees International Union, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, the National Mental Health Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American College of Emergency Room Physicians. 
Mr. President, the time is now for Congress to act. I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this bill, and to pass comprehensive managed care legislation that meets the needs of all of our citizens, including our children.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my legislation S. 1755, legislation that would amend the Internal Revenue Code to deny tobacco companies any tax deduction for their advertising and promotional expenses when those expenses are directed at the most impressionable group in our society, children. 
In a recent editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Doctors C. Everett Koop, David Kessler, and George Lundberg wrote, `For years the tobacco industry has marketed products that it knew caused serious disease and death. 
Yet, it intentionally hid this truth from the public, carried out a deceitful campaign designed to undermine the public's appreciation of these risks, and marketed its addictive products to children.' 
Numerous studies have implicated the tobacco industry, their advertising and promotional activities, as a major cause in the continued increase in youth smoking throughout the United States in recent years. Research on smoking demonstrates that increases in youth smoking directly coincide with effective tobacco promotional activities. 
My legislation, S. 1755, addresses this key element in an ongoing public debate about controlling youth smoking in the United States. My legislation could stand on its own, or it can easily be incorporated into comprehensive legislation, which is beginning to be considered here in the Senate. With or without congressional action on the Attorney General's proposal and suggested settlement which took place last summer, it is time for Congress to act now to stop the tobacco industry's practice of luring children into untimely disease and death. 
I am pleased to have join me as cosponsors Senator Boxer, Senator Chafee, and Senator Conrad. I also want to recognize the leadership over many years of my colleagues, Senator Tom Harkin, along with former Senator Bill Bradley, who have in the past called for the total elimination of tax deductions for tobacco advertisers. While I concur with Senator Harkin that the deduction is a questionable use of our tax dollars, I would also like to emphasize that my legislation does not go that far. 
My legislation is designed to eliminate this deduction if it is used deliberately, explicitly, and consciously to attract young people, children, to smoking. Limiting the access of children to smoking is a critical part of any comprehensive tobacco settlement. My approach is a constitutionally sound way to do this. We have had discussions about the first amendment and the fact that the industry and others claim that only voluntary controls would be permissible under the first amendment. But it is quite clear under the first amendment that Congress has the authority and ability to limit tax deductions. So my legislation not only gets at one of the major issues involved in the debate over tobacco, it does so in a way which is completely consistent with the Constitution. 
Now, the advertising restrictions I am talking about are generally those that were agreed to by the industry in their discussions with the Attorneys General. These restrictions have been incorporated in legislation which Senator Conrad introduced, and I joined as a cosponsor, along with 29 other Senators. S. 1638, provides for and codifies those restrictions that will go a long, long way in preventing youth access to smoking. 
Now, under my legislation, if the manufacturers do not comply with these restrictions, if they choose to conduct the kind of reckless advertising campaigns they have in the past, then they would forfeit the deductibility of these expenses. Now, these restrictions are appropriately tailored to prevent the advertising and marketing of tobacco directed at young people in our society. These restrictions are very similar to those proposed by the Food and Drug Administration. Indeed, they are very close to those agreed to by the industry in the June 20 proposed settlement. 
Key components of these restrictions are, first, a prohibition on point-of-sale advertising, except in adult-only stores and tobacco outlets; second, a ban on outdoor advertising; third, a prohibition on brand-name sponsorship of sporting or entertainment events; fourth, a prohibition on the use of human images, cartoon characters and cartoon-type characters in their advertising; fifth, no payments for `glamorizing' tobacco use in performances or in media that appeals to minors; sixth, requiring black and white text advertising and labeling so as not to heighten the appeal of cigarette products on the shelf; seventh, a prohibition on tobacco product identification on entries and teams in sporting events; 
finally, a prohibition on Internet advertising. These are very sensible, very thoughtful restrictions and, I must emphasize, should be essentially agreed to by the industry as their way of meeting the challenge of limiting access to cigarettes by young people in this society. 
On numerous occasions, the industry has said: Well, unless we get full immunity, we will not voluntarily give up our right to advertise to children. Well, today I am offering an alternative that I think would persuade them that they should stop this advertising to children. This enforcement mechanism does not rely on their voluntary compliance. It simply recognizes the bottom line of these companies and says: If you want to persist in advertising to minors, then you will forfeit the ability to deduct these expenses from your tax bill. 
Now, Mr. President, the importance of this issue is enormous. The facts speak for themselves. Today, some 50 million Americans are addicted to tobacco. One out of every three of these individuals will die prematurely because of their tobacco addiction. Three-fourths of present smokers today want to quit, but they can't because it is an addiction. Less than a quarter are able successfully to quit. 
Tobacco is costly in terms of lives lost and in terms of the amount of resources consumed every year in this society, which literally goes up in smoke. It is estimated that in the United States alone over $100 billion a year is expended in health care costs and lost productivity. 
Each pack of cigarettes sold generates about $3.90 in smoking-related costs to society. Tobacco accounts to more than $10 billion in costs a year to the Medicare system and $5 billion each year in terms of costs to the Medicaid system. In my home State of Rhode Island, the smallest State in the Union, health expenses related to smoking were estimated at about $186 million in 1996. These are staggering totals. The cost of smoking and lives lost and resources consumed is a serious, serious issue in this country. This problem clearly starts with children. 
Ninety percent of adult smokers began to smoke before they were 18 years old. The average youth smoker begins at the age of 13 and becomes a daily smoker by the age 14 1/2 . You have young people as early as 13 beginning to smoke and within a year and a half many of them are hooked for the rest of their lives. 
Each year, 1 million American children become smokers, and one-third of them will die from lung cancer, emphysema, and similar tobacco-related illnesses. Unless current trends are reversed, 5 million kids who are 18 and younger today will die prematurely because of smoking. You know, there has been a lot of attention has been paid to smoking, and we are finally seeing some positive results. There are many signs that adults are beginning to realize the dangers of smoking. 
In my home State of Rhode Island, the adult rate of smoking is stabilizing. But, shockingly, smoking among high school students has increased by 25 percent. This is not an accident--the tobacco industry has targeted its advertising to lure children to smoke. It is a dilemma that companies face, when every year your customers die--and many die because of your products--you have to find replacements. For generations, the industry has targeted efficiently the children of this country. 
Mr. President, this is a real nationwide public health crisis. I have a chart that depicts `students who reported smoking,' prepared by the University of Michigan. They found that daily smoking among seniors in high school increased from 17.2 percent in 1992 to 22.2 percent in 1996. It continued to climb to 24.6 percent in 1997, representing a 43 percent increase in daily smoking among our Nation's high school seniors over the past 5 years. At a time when we are all appalled at the health consequences of smoking, we are seeing an increase in smoking among high school seniors. 
It is far too easy for children to buy these products. It is against the law in every State in this country to sell tobacco 
products to minors. Yet, it has been estimated that children buy $1.26 billion worth of cigarettes and other tobacco products each year. 
More and more, we are learning that these children are beginning to smoke because of industry advertising and promotional efforts. A recent study by John Pierce and some of his colleagues in a Journal of the American Medical Association article found clear evidence that tobacco industry advertising and promotional activities can decisively influence children who have never smoked before, to begin smoking. 
Among the findings, they found that tobacco industry promotional activities in the mid-1990s will influence almost 20 percent of those who turn 17 years of age each year to try smoking. At least 34 percent of youth experimentation with cigarettes is attributed to the advertising and promotion efforts of the tobacco industry. 
They surveyed nonsmokers who were in high school, and they found that among nonsmokers, 56 percent had a favorite cigarette advertisement. They have been programmed--preprogrammed, if you will--to begin to smoke. Eighty-three percent of those nominated either Camel or Marlboro as their favorite ad. In fact, Camel was the favorite among children ages 12 and 13. Again, it is no wonder, because, as we all know, companies rely on cartoon characters like Joe Camel, giveaways of hats, T-shirts, and key chains, and promote recreational activities and sporting activities, targeting much of their efforts toward young people. 
Industry advertising is consistent with the history of the tobacco industry, in terms of trying to deceptively promote their products, to make of their products appear to be something they never were and never will be. They are spending huge amounts of money to do so, and they have been doing it consistently. This is an industry whose record is one of irresponsibility toward children in our society. They have said in the settlement with the Attorneys General that they want to change their culture. They recognize the bad old days and they want to do something different. I think we have to seriously question whether or not this will take place, whether or not they will do this, unless we impose significant restrictions on their ability to influence the young people of this country. 
Now, the story of the tobacco industry is, in many cases, a story of advertising in the United States. If you approach someone my age and ask them, `What does LSMFT mean?--and I see Senator Torricelli here, who probably would say of course he knows--younger people might think that it is gibberish. We all know that it means `Lucky Strike Means Fine Tobacco.' Now, to pull that out of your subconscious, if you are 40 years or older, just like that, is because it was drummed into us persistently through tobacco advertising. It was a little jingle or acronym that kids would recognize. Then, of course, we all remember, going back years, the slogan `sold American.' All of these are part of our culture. All of them program young people in particular to be receptive and welcoming to the suggestion that they should smoke.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to formally introduce legislation that would amend the Internal Revenue Code to deny tobacco companies any tax deduction for their advertising and promotional expenses when those ads are aimed at America's most impressionable group, children. 
This bill addresses a key element in our ongoing public debate on tobacco: the industry's ceaseless efforts to market to children. My legislation can stand on its own, or can easily be incorporated into a comprehensive tobacco bill. With or without congressional action on the state attorney generals' tobacco settlement, it is time for Congress to put a stop to the tobacco industry's practice of luring children into untimely disease and death. 
I am pleased to be joined today in introducing this legislation with Senators Boxer and Chafee, and I urge the rest of my colleagues to join us in this effort to protect America's children.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to announce legislation that would amend the Internal Revenue Code to deny tobacco companies any tax deduction for their advertising and promotional expenses, when those ads are aimed at America's most impressionable group, children. 
This bill addresses a key element in our ongoing public debate on tobacco: industry's ceaseless efforts to market to children. My legislation can stand on its own, or can easily be incorporated into a comprehensive tobacco bill. With or without Congressional action on the state attorney generals' tobacco settlement, it is time for Congress to put a stop to the tobacco industry's practice of luring children into untimely disease and death. 
I am pleased to be joined today in introducing this legislation with Senators Boxer and Chafee, and I would also like to recognize the leadership of my colleagues on this issue. Senator Harkin, along with former Senator Bradley and others, has made continuous efforts over the years to completely eliminate the tax deduction for tobacco advertising. And while I concur with Senator Harkin that the deduction is a questionable use of our tax dollars, I would like to emphasize to my colleagues that this bill does not eliminate the deduction for tobacco manufacturers, as long as they do not advertise to children. 
Limiting the promotion of tobacco products to children is a necessary part of any comprehensive effort to prevent tobacco use by minors. My legislation offers a constitutionally sound way to enforce strong tobacco advertising restrictions, with or without federal tobacco legislation on the proposed tobacco settlement. 
The advertising restrictions contained in our bill are included in S.1638, legislation introduced by Senator Conrad, cosponsored by myself and 29 other Senators. S. 1638 establishes strong restrictions regarding the promotion of tobacco products to minors. 
Under my bill, if tobacco manufacturers do not comply with the proposed advertising restrictions, the manufacturer's ability to deduct the cost of tobacco advertising and promotion expenses would be disallowed. 
These advertising restrictions are appropriately tailored to prevent the advertising and marketing of tobacco to minors. The restrictions contained in this legislation are similar to those contained in the FDA rule and the June 20 proposed settlement. Key components of these restrictions include: a prohibition on point of sale advertising except in adult only stores and tobacco outlets; a ban on outdoor advertising within 1000 feet of schools and publicly-owned playgrounds, and outdoor advertising beyond those areas restricted to black-and-white text only; and, a prohibition on brand-name sponsorship of sporting or entertainment events. 
On numerous occasions, tobacco industry executives have indicated that unless they receive liability protections, they will continue to advertise as they do now. Today I am offering an alternative enforcement mechanism because failure to act on this issue is a failure to meet the needs of our children.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment would broaden the definition of capital expenditures for paratransit facilities. These are vehicles used for disabled American citizens. There are many communities in the United States that have these facilities. This definition would not adversely affect the allocation and would provide, we hope, for more use of the paratransit services. I encourage adoption of the amendment.

Mr. REED. I concur with the analysis of Chairman D'Amato with respect to this legislation and also commend the Senator from Florida. This is a legislative initiative that puts further precision into the granting of startup contracts. It puts in factors that are critical to the whole consideration of when we should support at the Federal level a local initiative. 
As the chairman said, one of the major criteria is local support, which is measured most effectively in terms of dollars, but also in terms of the population density and leadership they anticipate in this new startup. All of these are important additions to existing criteria, which the Senator retains. 
So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the accomplishments of Sara DeCosta of Warwick, RI. As a member of the U.S. Women's Olympic Ice Hockey Team, Sara and her teammates made history this year by winning the first-ever gold medal awarded in women's ice hockey at the 1998 Olympic Winter Games in Nagano, Japan. 
Sara's efforts were a great part of the drive to bring home the gold. Her world class talent and solid determination helped team USA rise above the best in Women's Ice Hockey. Sara and her teammates proved that years of discipline, hard work, and tough sacrifices can pay off. Their magnificent display of sportsmanship and pride lifted our hearts and hopes. Truly, Sara and the U.S. Women's Olympic Ice Hockey team exemplify the best America has to offer and their success serves as a gleaming reminder of what can be achieved through bold determination and persistence. 
Mr. President, Sara's victory is not just about hard work and discipline. It proves that if you believe in your own abilities you can succeed, no matter what outdated gender stereotypes would dictate. Sara has served as an example to the state of Rhode Island and the country. Her dedication and enthusiasm will inspire others to look beyond the traditional path and to reach for the stars to bring home their own personal gold medals. I congratulate Sara, the other eight players who are alumnae or students in Rhode Island's schools and the rest of the Women's Hockey Team. We can be proud of this group of young women for their commitment to follow their dreams. Sara DeCosta and her teammates are an inspiration to us all.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment this afternoon to talk about the pending highway bill and particularly the transit provisions in that bill. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-reed-ri-2-19980310</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend Senator D'Amato and Senator Sarbanes for their work on this initiative. The bill they brought to the Banking Committee adds immensely to the act we are debating. It provides a critical component to the overall transportation in America, and that component is mass transit. This bill that Senator Sarbanes and Senator D'Amato have worked so hard on would provide $5 billion, which, over the next 6 years, would accumulate and provide sufficient funding for mass transit throughout the United States. 
The legislation recognizes that in many regions of the country, particularly the Northeast where I come from, mass transit is one of the critical elements of our transportation policy. We do not have the space to build more roads. We also are in a congested area of the country in which environmental factors are so critical. Without mass transit we cannot deal with transportation problems, environmental problems, and also the basic needs of the people of my State and my region to be productive citizens. 
This is particularly the case when we are talking about reforms we have just undertaken with respect to the welfare system, moving Americans from welfare to work. For many of these Americans, literally, their path to the work site is through mass transit, through buses, through subways. Without these vehicles, without these mechanisms, they cannot become effective participants in our work force. Transit is particularly important to my State of Rhode Island. 
Just this morning I had an opportunity to meet with our director of the Rhode Island Transit Authority, Dr. Beverly Scott. She is doing a remarkable job. She impressed upon me again the important role that transit plays in my State. Ridership is up in Rhode Island. We are one of the few States in the country with a statewide system, one system serving the entire State. Last year 19.5 million bus passengers used our rider services. In addition, we had over 450,000 paratransit riders. These are small jitneys that move around the State, many times serving disabled Americans who cannot use the traditional buses that we still have in our fleet. Indeed, 18 percent of the riders of mass transit in Rhode Island are seniors or disabled Americans. These are individuals who cannot avail themselves of the highways through their own vehicles in many cases. They depend upon transit. They depend upon our role here in Washington to adequately fund mass transit throughout America. 
We also have, because of our mass transit investments in Rhode Island, done some remarkable things with respect to the environment. It is estimated that the buses of the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority over the past several years have kept about 1.2 million pounds of pollution from entering our system. In doing so, they have allowed us to keep pace, at least, with the demands for a cleaner environment up in Rhode Island. We have to do more, but without mass transit we would be in a much more perilous situation. 
There are those who are arguing with respect to transit that we should move away from traditional formulations of transit policy and start talking about minimum allocations, State by State, which, in effect, would reward certain parts of the country that do not have the history and, indeed I would argue, the strong need for transit services, as we do in the Northeast or in other parts, the older urban parts of America. I think this approach would be wrong. This bill we are considering in effect shapes national transportation policy. As Senators in the National Assembly, we have to recognize our national responsibilities. One responsibility is to continue to support those systems that are so essential to my region of the country, so essential historically. 
I was thinking, as I spoke to Dr. Scott, my director of public transportation, that his family goes way back in transit. My grandfather, James J. Monahan, worked for the United Electric Railway System, which was the local transit system. In fact, he started around the turn of the century. Before there were electric railroads, there were horse-drawn rail cars, and he was working on those. We have seen, in my section of the country, this reliance upon transportation for years. We must maintain appropriate funding. 
I hope we can do that because I think, if we would try to arbitrarily distort the funding for transit, if we would suddenly yield, not to sensible national transportation policy but simply regional interests, we could undercut something which is very essential, not only to my region but also to the Nation. If we do not have good transit in the Northeast and other parts of the country, we will not make our environmental targets, we will not be able to continue to develop a strong economy, we will not be able to ensure that all of our citizens have access to the job sites, we will not be able, in short, to do what we all want to do--provide for a transportation system that serves all of America. 
I should point out, too, that in this debate we have seen changes impacting, through the highway formulas, adversely on many parts of the country. Those parts of the country are most dependent on transit. The idea of reformulating highway policy, which many of us have approached with some sense of cooperation because of our view of the national economy and the national needs, to turn around now and inject strident regionalism into the transit formula would, I think, be a mistake. We cannot, I think, in our position, bear to see some of these changes in the highway position without the confidence that transit funding will be maintained on a reasonable basis and that we will continue to develop and support good transit throughout this country but particularly in those areas that historically have relied upon it. 
Mr. President, I hope we could summon not only the wisdom and courage to support this bill coming from the Banking Committee but also to oppose those proposals which would impose a minimum allocation on the States. We have to recognize and support transit as it exists today and develop new starts, for which there is plenty of funding in the proposal that Senator D'Amato is bringing to the floor to do that. But we cannot, I think, impose some arbitrary constraints on the transit formulation which so far has served us very well. 
I hope we can support this amendment from the Banking Committee, oppose the amendment that would distort it dramatically, and in doing so contribute, along with our highway 
provisions, to sound and very important national transportation policy. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Lautenberg-DeWine amendment, and I commend both Senators for this excellent amendment. It would, as previous speakers have discussed, establish a .08 blood alcohol concentration level, or BAC level, as a threshold for driving under the influence throughout the United States. 
As we all know, drunk driving is a scourge on the highways of the United States of America. It is something that we are all against. This legislation would take a very positive step to ensure that all States provide for a very rigorous .08 blood alcohol content standard as their measure of driving under the influence of alcohol. 
This law builds on previous success. Since 1986, alcohol-related fatalities on our roads have decreased by 28 percent. That is a result of the efforts of many, many people. It is the result of tougher laws, increased enforcement, public education, and particularly the work of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, who have done so much to illustrate this problem and reach policymakers throughout the United States. Although we are proud of this success, we can and must do more. 
In 1996, more than 17,000 people were killed because of drunk driving. Now, these deaths are not accidents because these are tragedies that could have been avoided--many of them--if we had tougher laws and better enforcement. That is what we are about today. We are trying to declare throughout this country that we have a tough standard for those who would drink and drive, a standard that would save lives throughout this country in every community. 
I don't think any of my colleagues would like to say to a family who lost a loved one and tell them, `Well, the standard of .10 was OK,' because in that situation it's not OK. We can do better. We know these laws work, and we want to make them work much, much better. 
In essence, the .08 blood alcohol concentration standard means fewer deaths on the roads of America, fewer driving fatalities, fewer young people cut down in the prime of their lives, and it means a safer America. That is what we should stand for today. 
Currently, 15 States already have adopted a .08 blood alcohol concentration standard. A recent study by Boston University showed that these States experienced a 16 percent decline in fatal driver crashes where the driver's BAC was .08 or greater. 
Already these States have shown that this standard saves lives. And we can do better. 
It is estimated that nationally, if we adopt the .08 standard, we can save between 500 and 600 lives a year. Those are impressive statistics. But lives alone are not at stake. Each year drunk driving accidents cost this country $45 billion. That is six times more than we spend on Pell grants. We can do better. We can save lives. We can save resources. We can make our world much, much safer. 
There are those who argue that this would put a huge constraint on law-abiding Americans who occasionally will have a drink and then drive. That is something I don't think is true at all because under this standard a 170-pound man must consume more than four drinks in an hour on an empty stomach to reach this BAC. A woman of 135 pounds would have to consume three drinks. That is not social drinking. That is drinking irresponsibly, and then getting into an automobile. 
This law will not affect the reasonable, rational, careful, deliberate person who may have one social drink or two and then drive. In fact, the American Medical Association said that really the beginning of impairment is not .08, it is .05 blood alcohol content. So this standard is far from what medical experts would argue is the beginning of deterioration of motor skills when one drives an automobile. We can do better. We have to recognize today that we must do better. 
There are those of my colleagues who have suggested that this proposal is an improper infringement on the prerogatives of the States. First of all, we have taken positive steps before in this land. For example, just a few years ago we adopted through congressional action a zero-tolerance policy that would say for young people driving that the blood alcohol content was basically zero, that they should have no drinks if they are driving an automobile, and we have seen success already. 
Mr. President, we have already seen the success of our zero-tolerance policy throughout the United States, a policy that was promulgated through Congress and adopted by many States, where fatalities at night by younger drivers have dropped 16 percent in States that are following the zero-tolerance policy. 
So this law and this approach is not an impermissible imposition on the States. It is a rational, reasonable way to encourage what is the right thing to do. It is small comfort that if one State, such as my State of Rhode Island, adopts this standard but it is not adopted next door in Massachusetts or Connecticut, and someone in Massachusetts comes speeding into my State. That is not a States' rights issue. That is an issue of interstate commerce, of national economy, of national highways that reach every corner of this country regardless of State lines. We don't stop the national highways at the State lines. We shouldn't stop good, sensible bills that will control drunk driving in this country at the State lines. 
I urge passage of this legislation, and again commend Senators Lautenberg and DeWine for their excellent effort. 
I yield my time. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, March 3rd was the eighth annual celebration of National Sportsmanship Day in over 10,000 schools in all fifty states and more than 100 countries throughout the world. 
Recognized by the President's Council on Physical Fitness, National Sportsmanship Day was conceived by the Institute for International Sport, located in my home state of Rhode Island. As the President's Council Co-Chairs Tom McMillen and Florence Griffith Joyner have stated, `this event will serve as a highly visible, one-day effort to stress the importance of ethics and sportsmanship, not just on the athletic field but in all aspects of life. . . having a powerful and positive effect on the youth of the United States and the world.' 
Heeding President Clinton's challenge to begin a serious dialogue on race relations in the United States, the centerpiece of this year's National Sportsmanship Day was a seminar and town meeting at the University of Rhode Island discussing race issues in sport. This day long event included panels composed of athletes, coaches, and journalists who discussed the many different aspects of these issues. 
In addition, the Institute has enlisted the help of several Sports Ethics Fellows, including Mills Lane, a Reno, Nevada district judge and internationally known professional boxing referee, Billy Packer, CBS sports commentator, and Ken Dryden, the president and general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs. These men and women are wonderful role models who can be admired for more than just their athletic prowess. They have consistently demonstrated an interest in furthering the principles of honesty and integrity in sport and society. 
These Sports Ethics Fellows are helping to teach the important lessons of National Sportsmanship Day by developing programs for National Sportsmanship Day. Through competition, young athletes can learn that while winning is a worthy goal, honor, discipline, and hard work are more important. Indeed, these values will guide them in all aspects of everyday life. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports and the Rhode Island Congressional delegation in recognizing this day and the principles it embodies.

Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of the bipartisan compromise amendment offered by Senators McCain and Feingold. This would be reasonable but limited reform of our campaign finance system, reform that is long overdue. 
This legislation would effectively change two very important issues with respect to campaign finance reform. First, it would ban soft money, those unlimited, unregulated gifts by corporations, wealthy individuals, and unions to political parties. The soft money issue has created a great crisis within the electoral system of the United States. 
Second, the bill would require those who run broadcasts which expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate within a certain window, 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election, to play by the same rules applying to candidates and others who participate in political campaigns. Thus, organizations funding such broadcasts would have to disclose the individuals and political action committees which fund their advertisements. 
This would curtail what has become an explosion throughout our American political system. Phony issue advertisements are unconstrained, cropping up suddenly, without attribution, to strike at candidates. 
These are two very important reforms which must be implemented to preserve the integrity of our political system by inspiring within the American people confidence that we, in fact, are conducting elections and not auctions for public offices. I believe these provisions are very, very important. 
Again, I commend both Senators McCain and Feingold for their efforts. I also commend my colleagues from the States of Vermont and Maine. Senator Jeffords and Senator Snowe are proposing another amendment which would help break the current gridlock we have on this legislation. The Snowe-Jeffords proposal also addresses the issue of phony advertising through better disclosure of those who are participating in campaigns. I think their efforts are commendable. 
Frankly I prefer a much more robust form of campaign finance reform. I believe that at the heart of our problem is the Supreme Court decision of Buckley v. Valeo, which more than 20 years ago held that political campaign expenditures could not be limited. Frankly, I think the decision is wrong. Justice White, who dissented from that opinion and, by the way, was the only Member of that Court with any practical political experience, declared quite clearly that Congress has not only the ability but the obligation to protect the Republic from two great enemies--open violence and insidious corruption. 
Indeed, the Court in Buckley did accept part of that reasoning by outlawing unlimited contributions to political campaigns, but they maintained that unlimited expenditures were constitutionally permissible. 
I believe that we should go further than this bill proposes today. Indeed, we have practical examples within the United States of systems that do constrain contributions and expenditures in political campaigns. 
I was interested to note that in Albuquerque, NM, since 1974, the mayor's campaign has been limited to an expenditure of $80,000, equivalent to the salary of the mayor. I know as I go around my home State of Rhode Island, people often ask why a candidate would spend more money in a campaign than he or she would receive in salary to hold that office. In Albuquerque, they took the rather interesting step of capping expenditures to the pay of the mayor. 
It turns out that for the last 23 years, the Albuquerque system worked well. Unfortunately, last year the Albuquerque law was challenged in court under the Buckley v. Valeo theory. Up until last year, the municipal law was a model of not only good campaign finance practice but of also good electoral politics. A former mayor, who held the position during the challenge said, `No one's speech was curtailed, no candidates were excluded, the system worked well.' 
I hope we can adopt on another day robust campaign finance reform that would begin to revise the Buckley v. Valeo decision. But today we are here to support McCain-Feingold, to take a limited step forward to ensure that we go after the two most pressing problems currently facing our political system: the prevalence of soft money and the explosion of issue advertising by third parties. These unaccountable groups surreptitiously enter the race, deal their blow and leave. 
I believe if we support today the McCain-Feingold formula, we can, in fact, take a step forward to ensure that our political system is recognized by people as legitimate and positive. I yield back my time.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Christmas in April USA, our Nation's oldest volunteer home repair initiative. This program has helped to rehabilitate the homes of over 31,000 elderly, low-income, and disabled individuals nationwide. 
I would particularly like to recognize the 5th anniversary of the Christmas in April program's arrival in Providence, Rhode Island, where it is making a difference in many communities. In just five years, Providence's Christmas in April has helped to restore over 100 dwellings, through the efforts and commitment of thousands of volunteers. Indeed, this important initiative has dedicated almost $1 million to improve our communities and to help Rhode Island's less fortunate homeowners. The Christmas in April program exemplifies the true spirit of volunteerism. 
Mr. President, I would particularly like to commend Providence College and its President, Reverend Philip A. Smith, for his leadership in creating our nation's first Christmas in April campus chapter. I am convinced that this unique volunteer service organization will continue to better Rhode Island's communities for many years to come.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator Conrad from North Dakota, in supporting and introducing the HEALTHY Kids Act and thank him for his kind words. I must say, if there is anyone who has been a true leader and true hero in this struggle to date, it has been Kent Conrad, whose leadership helped pull together not only an impressive array of cosponsors but, with over hundreds of witnesses and many, many sessions, he was able to get to the substance of a very complicated and difficult issue: How are we going to respond to the crisis of teenage smoking in the United States? How are we going to protect the public health of America, particularly America's children? 
Today we are introducing the HEALTHY Kids Act, which will, I believe, do that. Again, I commend Senator Conrad for his great leadership and effort, and I look forward to working with him and all my colleagues to develop legislation that will once and for all prevent the illegal sale of cigarettes to children in this country. 
We are all aware of the depressing statistics with respect to smoking and children in the United States. Today, some 50 million Americans are addicted to tobacco smoke. Every year, 1 million children become regular users of cigarettes, tobacco. One-third of them will die prematurely of lung cancer, emphysema, or other horrible smoking related illnesses. 
This is an addiction. Fully three-quarters of smokers want to quit but they cannot because they are addicted. The most disturbing aspect of this addiction is it begins with young people. 
Mr. President, 90 percent of adult smokers today began to smoke while they were 18 years old or less. In fact, this goes down to children who are 10, 11, 12 years old. It is a shocking, disturbing, and all-too-real aspect of American life and culture. We have an opportunity, indeed an obligation, to do something about it. That is why I am here, along with Senator Conrad, to join in the introduction of this HEALTHY Kids Act. 
In my home State of Rhode Island, we have a situation in which adult smoking is beginning to stabilize. Unfortunately, teen smoking continues to rise, with a more than 25 percent increase among high school students. That is a bad omen for the future, a bad omen for the country. It is too easy for children to buy cigarettes. It is too easy, in a climate in which the tobacco industry spends upward of $5 billion a year making cigarette smoking appear to be alluring, sophisticated, adult-oriented--all those things which are attractive to children. 
We know from the record that has emerged over the last several months in court proceedings that this is not a coincidence, we know that children have been deliberately targeted by cigarette companies. They are the replacement customers for the 400,000 Americans who die each year of smoking-related diseases. We have to stop that insidious replacement, that insidious attack on the youth of America. 
We begin this legislative process in a situation in which the tobacco industry has worked hard to earn the distrust--let me say it again--the distrust of the American people. Over the years they have not been candid. They have deliberately confused, fought against, and frustrated attempts to regulate their product in the marketplace. 
I recently came across an interesting story about youthful smoking among boys. One of the research scientists said, `The cigarette smoker is slowly and surely poisoning himself and is largely unconscious of it.' That report was in Education Magazine in 1909. The tobacco industry has long known that cigarette smoking is harmful to children, and harmful to public health. 
In 1963, Battelle Laboratories in Switzerland did a series of studies for the British American Tobacco Company, that's the parent of Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. The conclusion, after review of these studies by the general counsel of Brown & Williamson, was shown as follows: `We are then in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug, effective in the release of stress mechanisms.' Since 1960, the industry has known they were selling an addictive product, and has known they were selling a product that killed people. 
It has all, though, been obscured and dressed up by advertising that would suggest to everyone that smoking is not harmful; indeed, claiming it is healthful. That is absolutely wrong. Back in the 1920s, the companies that were selling cigarettes were advertising themes like, `20,679 physicians say Luckies are less irritating.' Promoting cigarettes, in effect, as a healthful practice and not a harmful practice. Another theme of those days was, `For digestion's sake, smoke Camels.' Again emphasizing an illusory therapeutic value that never existed in cigarettes. 
In 1953, an advertisement read, `This is it. L&M filters are just what the doctor ordered.' As if the medical profession was endorsing a product which they knew was harmful and which they suspected, but perhaps did not yet know, was highly addictive. 
In this Congress, we have tried to rein in the use of tobacco by children, tried to control the access of young people and tried to warn the American public about the dangers of tobacco. In the 1960s, we brought the industry, we thought, kicking and screaming to accept legislatively mandated warning label. Only after the fact did we learn that the industry privately accepted this label as a good fortune because it allowed them to defend themselves in court with the notion that smokers assumed the risk because they read these labels. Only recently, with the evidence that is more and more conclusive each day of the addictive quality of 
cigarettes, has the industry begun to respond. 
Today we are here to ensure that the past is not repeated, the past of addiction of young people to cigarettes and the past of a very pliant Congress, not effectively regulating the tobacco industry. That is why the HEALTHY Kids Act is so important. It represents a comprehensive effort to ensure that our children are safe and the public health is protected. 
One of the important elements of this bill is a price increase of $1.50 a pack. This is not in any way an attempt of retribution on the industry. Rather, it recognizes the fact that a price increase is probably the strongest deterrent there is to teenage smoking. Unlike adult smokers who may already very well addicted, teenagers will respond to price increases. A price increase is one sure way, perhaps the best way, we can ensure that teenagers do not smoke. 
The second aspect of the act is giving the FDA full authority over tobacco products, all tobacco products. This proposal would not condition their authority; it would give the FDA the authority, the responsibility, the obligation to regulate tobacco as it regulates so many other drugs and so many other products in our society. 
This legislation also includes strong look-back penalties. The HEALTHY Kids Act would set a goal of reducing teenage smoking rates by 67 percent in 10 years and would hold manufacturers accountable for these tough goals by imposing 10-cent-a-pack penalties on the industry across the board and 40-cent penalties on brand-specific products that do not meet the targeted reductions. There would be no rebate. In the proposal the industry negotiated with the Attorneys General, there would be the possibility of a company receiving a rebate by just trying hard. This legislation would require the goal be met, not simply the effort be made. This would also include comprehensive anti-smoking programs, through advertising, prevention programs, and other means that would help ensure that children do not smoke. These program would also give adults, if they wish to change, access to programs to make sure they can make that transition from smoking to nonsmoking. 
Because of the money that is generated, we will be able to commit significant resources to programs that are extremely important, programs that have been outlined so well by Senator Conrad: education, child care, health resources. 
Also, this legislation, importantly, does not curtail prospective liability for the tobacco industry. It would settle the suits that have been lodged by the State attorneys general. Also, it would settle claims with respect to governmental entities, but it would allow individual citizens who have been harmed and who will be harmed by tobacco smoke to bring their case to court. 
I believe this is a crucial part of the legislation, because without this, the other mechanisms that we develop may well be undermined by sophisticated corporate reorganizations by the industry, by challenges to aspects of the law, and by many things which the tobacco companies have done in the past to remake themselves to comply with Federal statutes. Statutes which Congress thought would control their behavior but which in many cases not only did not control their behavior but gave the tobacco companies additional ammunition to defend themselves against civil suits in the courts. 
I believe that this liability issue is an important one and one that distinguishes this legislation from others that have been introduced in this Congress. 
We here today have the opportunity to do what all Americans want us to do, ensure that children do not have ready access to cigarettes, ensure that the next generation of Americans is not addicted before they become adults, ensure that the public health in this country is protected, ensure that we are able to create an environment in which a parent does not have to confront what must be one of the most harrowing moments, the realization that a young son or a young daughter is beginning to smoke and realizing also, as we do today, that that means that this child will die prematurely. 
No parent should have to endure that moment. No child should have to be subject to the barrage of advertising, the barrage of influences which have forced that child to smoke cigarettes. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this bill and to meet these goals. I look forward, as we all do, to the day in which cigarette smoking is not something that we associate with the youth of this country. 
I yield my time.  
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation with my Republican colleague on the Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Susan Collins, as well as Senators Kennedy, Murray, Dodd, Mikulski, Conrad, Levin, Akaka, Kerry, Johnson, Torricelli, Kerrey, and Hollings to reform and reauthorize an important student aid program, the State Student Incentive Grant program or SSIG. 
Last fall, I was pleased to join forces with Senator Collins to lead the fight to restore funding for SSIG on an 84 to 4 vote. 
This program provides funding on the basis of a dollar for dollar match to help states provide need-based financial aid in the form of grants and community service work study awards to 700,000 students nationwide, and 13,000 students from my home state of Rhode Island. Grants are targeted to the neediest undergraduate and graduate students. 
As I noted last fall during the debate on the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill, many states would not have established or maintained their need-based financial aid programs without this important federal incentive. Moreover, students, searching for sources of need-based grants to make their higher education dreams a reality, have come to rely on SSIG. 
Indeed, the importance of SSIG has increased over the years as skyrocketing college costs have eroded the purchasing power of the Pell Grant, and as the grant-loan imbalance widens. Twenty-three years ago, 80 percent of student aid came in the form of grants and 20 percent in the form of loans. Today the opposite is true, and students face significant debt upon graduation. 
In addition, low-income students are still finding it particularly hard to afford higher education. Less than 50% of high school graduates with incomes under $22,000 go to college, while more than 80% of their higher income counterparts pursue education beyond high school. 
To address these trends and ensure that needy students have alternatives to borrowing, SSIG must be strengthened during the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. The legislation we introduce today, the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership (LEAP) Act, does this by reauthorizing and making significant reforms to the SSIG program. 
The LEAP Act provides states greater incentives and flexibility to help needy students attend college. Our legislation creates a two-tier grant program. Any funds appropriated over a trigger level of funding--$35 million-- would require an increased state match of two new dollars for every federal dollar. However, states would gain new flexibility to use these funds for activities such as increasing grant amounts or carrying out academic or merit scholarship programs, community service programs, early intervention, mentorship, and career education programs, secondary to postsecondary education transition programs, or scholarship programs for students wishing to enter the teaching profession. 
These improvements restore the incentive nature of the program by attracting more state funds for student aid and providing greater flexibility for the use of these funds, while not disenfranchising states that can only match according to the current 1-to-1 requirement. 
The LEAP Act is supported by students, educators, and student aid officials, including the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs (NASSGAP), the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU), the American Council on Education (ACE), the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU), the United States Public Interest Research Group (USPIRG), the United States Student Association (USSA), and the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students. 
Mr. President, I believe we should help all our citizens achieve the American Dream and ensure access to higher education, especially for hard working families whose wages have not kept up with inflation. I urge my colleagues to join us in this critical effort to strengthen federal-state student aid partnerships and our commitment to America's students.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Michael S. Pinto, Superintendent of Schools in Middletown, Rhode Island. After 36 years, Superintendent Pinto is leaving the school system where he began his career, bound for a well-deserved retirement. 
During his tenure in Middletown, Superintendent Pinto has held almost every possible position one can hold in the field of education. He has been a teacher, a principal, a business manager for the school district, an assistant superintendent, and, most recently, the superintendent. 
Over the years--even when I represented Rhode Island's neighboring Congressional district in the House of Representatives, I was privileged to have the advice of Superintendent Pinto on a variety of issues related to education, from school choice to educational standards. Indeed, I could always count on hearing from Superintendent Pinto about Impact Aid. He is the program's number one advocate. 
His commitment to Impact Aid underscores his overall dedication to Middletown's schools and students and the cause of education. A measure of his commitment was shown in a recent news article which reported that in the last fifteen years he has had no more than seven consecutive days off. 
As superintendent, Mr. Pinto has presided over a number of successful initiatives including the fundamental repair of two schools, a new system of measuring student learning, and an optional all-day kindergarten. Superintendent Pinto has consistently sought to share the professional accolades he has received with his colleagues in Middletown. His emphasis on team work has earned him the admiration and respect of those who have worked with him. 
I thank Superintendent Pinto for his tremendous dedication and congratulate him for all that he has done for Middletown. While the Middletown school system will miss Michael Pinto, I am sure that even in retirement he will continue his work to improve education and better his community. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Chafee today in saluting Superintendent Pinto and wishing him the best in his retirement.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference report on S. 830, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act of 1997. This is an important bill with serious implications for the protection of the health of the American people. Although I did not support this bill when it was first considered on the floor of the Senate, I am pleased that significant changes have been made and that this final version of the legislation is worthy of support. 
This FDA reform bill is the result of ongoing negotiations both prior to and subsequent to the Labor Committee's markup of the bill. Through this process, a number of provisions that seriously threatened public health and safety were dropped or otherwise resolved. I am particularly pleased that improvements made include important protections to the third party review process. Significant changes and additions also include provisions regarding health claims for food products, health care economic claims, a notice of discontinuance when a sole manufacturer stops producing a drug, and a range of other items. 
The original Senate-passed bill contained a provision regarding the FDA device approval process that posed a serious threat to public health. In effect, the Senate-passed bill would have limited the FDS's current authority to ask device manufacturers for safety data. It would have prohibited the FDA from considering how a new device could be used if the manufacturer has not included that use in the proposed labeling. As a general matter, the FDA does not consider uses that the manufacturer has not included in its proposed labeling. However, there are instances when the label does not tell the whole story. It is these instances--when the label is false or misleading--that my and Senator Kennedy's amendment addressed. 
I was not alone in my concern about this issue. Indeed, this provision was also identified as worthy of a veto threat by the administration. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services said on numerous occasions that if this provision were not changed, that she and other top Presidential advisers would recommend that President Clinton veto this bill. 
By accepting the House language on this device labeling issue, the conferees have struck a reasonable compromise that will give the FDA the authority it needs to ensure that medical devices are safe and effective. In this case, the legislative process has worked, and worked well. I commend the conference committee for the sensible compromise they reached on this important issue. 
The FDA is responsible for assuring that the Nation's food supply is pure and healthy and to provide a guarantee that drugs and devices are safe and effective. The FDA has an immense impact on the lives of all Americans. Indeed, the FDA's mandate requires it to regulate over one-third of our Nation's products. Few Government agencies provide this kind of important protection for the American people. On a daily basis, the FDA faces the delicate balance between ensuring that patients have swift access to new drugs and devices while guaranteeing that those new products are safe and effective. 
The bill we are considering today contains many positive elements. It reauthorizes the important Prescription Drug User Fee Act, one of the most effective regulatory reforms ever enacted. The legislation also includes a number of provisions that will improve and streamline the regulation of prescription drugs, biologic products, and medical devices. I believe that these important reforms to the 
operation of the Food and Drug Administration will increase its efficiency and speed the delivery of important new medical treatments to patients. 
One of the most important elements of this legislation is the aforementioned reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, often referred to as PDUFA. PDUFA established an important partnership between the agency and the industry, and has successfully streamlined the drug approval process. 
I am pleased that this bill will provide expedited access to investigational therapies. This provision builds on current FDA programs related to AIDS and cancer drugs. Another important element will allow the designation of some drugs as `fast-track' medications, thus facilitating development and expediting approval of new treatments of serious or life-threatening conditions. The bill will also require the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a data base on the status of clinical trials relating to the treatment, detection, and prevention of serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions. Patients have long needed access to such information, and I am pleased that this bill provides a mechanism to grant it. 
I am also pleased that this bill contains my amendment requiring that within 18 months of the date of enactment, the FDA must issue regulations for sunburn prevention and treatment products. In August 1978, the FDA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to establish a monograph for over-the-counter sunscreen drug products. To date--almost 20 years later--while progress has been made, this rule has not been made final. 
Sunburn prevention and treatment products can go far to help prevent sun exposure related to skin cancer. The facts on skin cancer are compelling: one person an hour dies of malignant melanoma; half of all new cancers are skin cancers; one million Americans will develop skin cancer this year, making it nearly as common as all other types of cancer combined. 
The Food and Drug Administration has a key role in our response to this skin cancer epidemic through the regulation of safe and effective sunburn prevention products that are vital to avoiding skin damage from the sun's rays. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that this compromise is a bill that I can support. I look forward to working with my colleagues to oversee the implementation of this important legislation and to ensure that its provisions streamline FDA processes while also protecting the public health of the American people. 
I compliment Chairman Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, and many other colleagues in both the Senate and the House of Representatives who have worked hard on this bill together to eliminate many other troublesome provisions in the bill as originally introduced. 
Mr. President, again, I support the conference report on S. 830, the FDA reform bill. The challenge throughout this process has been to balance a more efficient, streamlined, and productive FDA with their obligation to protect the public health. It has been a difficult task, but we made remarkable progress over the last several months. At the committee level, there was a serious discussion and debate. I could not support that version because at that time there were still outstanding issues which I thought could jeopardize the public health and safety. 
When we reached the floor, there was another serious and productive debate about this legislation. Once again, I felt there were issues that had to be further addressed before I could support the measure. Today, happily, through the work of the conferees and colleagues on the floor today, we have reached a point where we have legislation that both provides for a streamlined, productive, and efficient FDA, and continues to give FDA the authority to protect the public health. 
With specific regard to the debate on the floor, there was one major issue that I felt was very important, and that was to allow the FDA to have the authority to carefully review medical devices that may be used by the public. The legislation at that time circumscribed significantly the ability of the FDA to look beyond the label, look beyond the listed use by the manufacturer, to contemplate possible other uses that may take place when the product is in the stream of commerce. Fortunately, through the work of the conferees, this situation has been resolved. 
Indeed, on the floor I offered an amendment with Senator Kennedy. It did not pass, but I think that effort helped spur a concentrated effort during the conference to develop a legislative formula to give the FDA the power to regulate these devices appropriately. 
We have many, many things to be thankful for in this bill. One issue I would like to address, also, which does not rise up, in some respects, to the major reforms, PDUFA or these issues, but it is critically important; that is, the issue of protecting the public with respect to sunscreen products and sunburn products. I am pleased to note that the FDA has been directed to promulgate regulations within 18 months with respect to these products which are sold to the public to protect them from the Sun. This might seem like an innocent product, but, in fact, we are seeing a remarkable growth in incidence of skin cancer throughout the United States. One person an hour dies of malignant melanoma, skin cancer. Half of all the new cancers developing are skin cancer. One million Americans will develop skin cancer this year alone. So we have to begin to focus our attention on those products which are advertised to protect the American public. 
Once again, I think this is totally consistent with the role of the FDA. I am pleased that this provision has been included in the legislation. 
Let me conclude by saying, again, I believe we have struck the vital balance between an efficient, productive FDA and their obligation, historically and statutorily, to protect the public health. We have done that through the work of Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, and many others. I personally thank them and applaud them for their efforts today. 
I would be remiss if I didn't also thank my staff member, Bonnie Hogue, for her help through this entire process. I yield the balance of my time.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, my amendment would, within the context of fast track, direct the President to undertake as a principal negotiating objective to promote the adherence of internationally recognized environmental standards. 
Essentially, what we have to do to improve the legislation before the Senate is to recognize that environmental quality is an important issue. It is an important issue for us, all of us who breathe the air, swim the waters, eat the bounty of our land, but it is also a very important issue in terms of economic competition because in many respects what we are seeing in countries that are trading with us is a conscious and at times very committed and deliberate attempt to use environmental quality and the lack of environmental quality to gain advantage over American workers. 
The underlying legislation circumscribes the ability of the President to deal effectively and forcefully with the issues in environmental quality within our potential trading partners. That, I think, is essential. Indeed, the experience of NAFTA should convince us very persuasively that we have to deal with the environment in order to set up a reasonable, fair, balanced trading regime between one country and another. The experience of NAFTA has shown us that there are trading partners who are using the environment, environmental laws, preferential environmental treatment of their companies, to attract and to lure American businesses to their country. 
For example, the Canadian Province of Alberta, which was one of the only two Canadian Provinces to sign the side agreement with respect to the environment in NAFTA, adopted legislation in May 1996, prohibiting citizens from suing environmental officials to enforce environmental laws. In effect, limiting the authority, the enforcement capability of their own environmental laws. As a result, Alberta has since been advertising its lax regulatory climate as `the Alberta advantage.' Now, that might be an advantage for Alberta but it is definitely a detriment to the men and women of America who have to follow environmental laws which we pass in this body. 
In October 1995, Mexico indicated that they would no longer require environmental impact assessment for investments in highly polluting sectors such as petrochemicals, refining, fertilizer, steel. Now, we all recognize and realize that any company in the United States that was investing or proposing to invest in one of these facilities would have to go through a very rigorous environmental impact assessment process. So when you have a multinational company making a decision of whether to go and respect and follow the law of the United States or go to a country that has announced they don't do environmental assessments, I think it is very difficult to see why some of these countries stay in the United States. 
At the heart of our fast-track efforts should be a strong commitment to the environment, not just because it is the right thing to do but because it is the most consistent way that we can make our companies as competitive as we can with companies around the world. 
There is another example in Mexico. After NAFTA, a series of multinational companies built a technology center in Ciudad Industrial. Now, these are state-of-the-art factories, state-of-the-art facilities, but what they are doing is taking all their waste and dumping it right into the sewers without any treatment or hardly any treatment at all, something we could not do in the United States, something you couldn't do in Europe, but something that is done every day there. Again, an advantage to these companies in terms of costs they must pay for environmental quality and inducements for companies like that to leave countries like the United States and other countries that have high environmental quality standards and go overseas to these particular areas. 
We have to take strong, purposeful steps to ensure that environmental quality is at the heart of our trade policy. Again, it is not just altruism or idealism. It is cold, hard, economic facts that we have to recognize. You don't have to go very far to find examples of how multinational companies are taking advantage of lax enforcement around the world in environmental quality. In today's New York Times on the front page there was a story about the Nike corporation. In January of this year, Ernst & Young, the auditing company, prepared a report to Nike about one of the factories in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. It found that the workers there were exposed to carcinogens that exceeded local legal standards by 177 times. That is, 77 percent of the employees suffer from respiratory problems. Moreover, when they looked further into the plight of these employees, it found that they were working 65 hours a week for a grand total of $10. That is 15 cents an hour. If you look at those low wages, together with lax environmental standards, that is a very potent combination that makes it very difficult for our manufacturing companies in the United States to be competitive at all. 
Now, some proponents of free trade say that is one of the consequences of free trade, that lower wages will attract investment. But the benefit to the people in America is low-cost goods. Nike sneakers are about $125 a pair or $150 a 
pair. These are not exactly low-cost goods. Last year, Nike made $800 million on total sales of $9.2 billion. 
The workers in Vietnam certainly are not benefiting from this great, tremendous, volume of sales, and in fact, American consumers are not benefiting from low-cost sneakers. They are very high-priced, prestige sneakers. What has happened is that our footwear manufacturing industry has been decimated. Growing up in Rhode Island, I was quite familiar with surrounding communities, particularly Brookline, MA, where most of the shoes in the world at one time were made. Those factories are empty and idle and those workers have gone off to do other things, but not to compete in the footwear industry. 
It is absolutely critical to recognize the reality of international trade where environmental quality--I should say the lack of it--is a strong competitive inducement to move capital into these countries. The result in some cases is very frightening, not only in terms of the impact on our workers but certainly the impact on the workers who are working in these facilities. 
Let me summarize the Ernst & Young report as reported in the New York Times. They painted a dismal picture of thousands of young women, mostly under age 25, laboring 10 1/2 hours a day, 6 days a week, in excessive heat and noise and in foul air, for slightly more than $10 a week. The report also found that workers with skin or breathing problems had not been transferred to permanent chemical-free areas, and half of the workers that dealt with dangerous chemicals did not wear protective masks or gloves. We could say well, gee, I feel sympathetic to the worker and as a humanitarian and as a kind, decent person that shouldn't happen, but that is their country. That is their culture. Those are their decisions. 
But it is hard when, as I do, you go into a Rhode Island jewelry factory, for example, and look at individual entrepreneurs whose families have built a business over two generations, who invested their sweat and their time and their fortune to try to build a big company, good company, and you find out that they have to pay a minimum wage, they have to ensure that their workers, if they are exposed to chemicals follow rigid procedures, they have to ensure that their waste is pretreated, and you ask those business men and business women how they are doing, and they say poorly because of international competition. Then you know that reports like this are not merely academic journalistic humanitarian conclusions. They strike at the very heart of whether small business men and women in this country can continue to compete. 
They are not asking for protective tariffs. They are not asking for us to withdraw from the world trade as some of the proponents of this legislation might suggest. But what they are saying is, give us a chance to be competitive on an even basis. When you negotiate treaties, raise the standards, the environmental standards and the working conditions so that we can try to use our talents, our ingenuity, our skill, and our resources to be competitive. 
If you don't do that, not only are you doing a disservice to these people who are trapped in these 10-hour days, in poor health-threatening environments, you are striking at the very competitiveness, the very survivability of so many small businesses around this country, particularly in my part of the world.

Mr. REED. The Senator's understanding is correct. My reading of the legislation would allow certain discussions about environmental standards, along with other standards, if they directly related to trade. But they would not provide the President with the instructions, the support, and the direction to go out there and make environmental quality in these foreign countries a centerpiece, an important part of our negotiations.

<DOCNO>105-reed-ri-7-19971108</DOCNO>

Mr. REED. I think that's right. Again, I think it's probably not even that clear in terms of what they can do because, essentially, as I read the restrictive language directly related to trade, it could be read to simply say that we have a product, for example, that we are sending in with a label on it, and if the country objects to it or wants more labeling, then we can say, well, that is impermissible. But as far as whether they have pretreatment of their waste, as far as whether the respirators in their factories, as far as whether they have environmental standards--air quality and water quality--that seems to be totally off the table. But that is what impacts on the quality of the workplace. Also, it is an inducement for capital to go from our country into these countries because, essentially, they are avoiding costs. 
The Senator probably was contacted, like I was, by individuals concerned about the proposed ambient air quality regulations in the United States. Some representatives of major companies have bluntly told me, `If these pass, we are going to Mexico. They don't have these ambient air quality standards, and we will avoid millions of dollars in costs. We will just move out.' 
Now, that might simply be a bluffing tactic, a negotiating ploy to try to stop these regulations. But at some point, if we continue to try to have a clean and healthy and safe environment, these costs add up and companies can avoid them by going elsewhere.

<TEXT>
Mr. REED. The Senator is exactly right, in my view. Let me add another point that I think is very important. We have talked about the inducements for capital investment because of low environmental quality around the world. We have talked about the effects on working men and women who are there in those factories in Ho Chi Minh City, Malaysia, throughout the East, and in Mexico. I suggest that this has a real impact in our own home communities, such as Baltimore, MD, and Providence, RI, where small business men and women are struggling to apply the environmental quality standards that we all passed and they agree with. We all see the benefits to our society and culture, 
but it is detrimental to their economic viability versus these countries across the sea. 
There is another factor, too. Just a few weeks ago, Senator Hagel and Senator Byrd came before this Senate with a resolution, Senate Resolution 98. It essentially said that we are not going to tolerate an environmental regime internationally that puts the burden of remediation and cleanup on the United States to the detriment of our economy. We are going to demand that developing countries also stand up and share the burden of cleaning up the environment. It passed with overwhelming support. 
It seems just common sense that, of course, we are not going to prejudice ourselves in an international regime by saying we will add further burdens to us, as the developing world keeps spewing out bad air, polluting the waters, et cetera. 
But in trade agreements, which are the focal point of most of our strong, bilateral and multinational relationships, we have completely ignored that point. So, on one hand, we are saying we have to get tough with these countries down there and make them start cleaning up their environment. But when it comes to the point where the rubber meets the road, where we are negotiating, we have leverage, and we want them to change behavior, we say it is not important. We are talking out of both sides of our mouth.

Mr. REED. I am equally amazed--if I may reclaim my time --by leaving this out. Certainly the jewelry manufacturers in Rhode Island would say, `Put it in because I want them to clean their waste like I have to.' Working men and women who have seen jobs lost because companies moved out of their communities would say, put it in. But my suspicion is that many people who are promoting this legislation are supportive of those multinational corporations who say: Listen, we want to avoid environmental policy because we want to get our production out of the United States and get into these countries, and we don't want them to have tough environmental standards.

Mr. REED. Again, I indicate that the Senator, I think, is absolutely right. Let me give an example within the text of the agreement. Part of the negotiating objectives is to develop internationally agreed rules, including settlement procedures, which are consistent with the commercial policies of the United States. So when it comes to commercial law, dispute resolution, we want our American laws down there because they are balanced, fair, they work, are effective, and are comfortable to the investors going to these countries. 
I daresay, if we tried to substitute our ideas consistent with the environmental policy of the United States, we would draw the unalloyed opposition of the proponents of the fast-track procedure. In our view, I believe environmental quality is one important factor in terms of economic competition between our country and other countries. So, in effect, I think you are right. I think that the thrust of this agreement is that it is unbalanced. You and I--I will speak for myself--we believe that we have to have sensible rules about investment. 
We have certain guarantees that our investors are protected. We have to have protection for intellectual property. We have to have protections for dispute settlement. We certainly don't want to have a situation where American companies go into a foreign land, make investments, and then can't repatriate their profits or, in fact, go to court and solve commercial disputes. That is fine. But we have to take the next step. We also have to negotiate with those countries so that their environmental policies are not inconsistent with ours and at least move toward an international standard.

Mr. REED. The Senator from Maryland is absolutely correct. Recognize that the major international environmental issues which we face--not alone, but collectively as a world community--are significant: global climate change, which we were talking about recently; ozone depleting substances, which have affected all of us around the world; reduction in ship pollution of the ocean; international ocean dumping; transboundary movement of hazardous waste materials and disposal. What happens to all of this waste in countries where it is being produced? How does it move from one country to another? 
All of these are critical issues. Yet, within a context and scope of this fast track agreement, they would be relegated, as the Senator from Maryland said, to side agreements at best. Our experience has been such that these side agreements are ineffectual in most cases, if not all cases. If we put them in the center of our concerns as a negotiating objective, not only will we make progress on these issues, but we will send a strong signal to all of our potential trading partners that they have to be prepared to come to the table and talk turkey about the environment and about how they will improve their environmental quality. That will result not only in a cleaner environment, which is an extremely noble objective and one that has very practical ramifications, but it will also help level that competitive playing field between those small businesspeople up in Rhode Island and Baltimore who are doing it already. All they ask us is to ensure, as we enter the world of international trade, that we try our best to bring up the standards of their competitors because they are their competitors. If we do that, then we leave it to them, their ingenuity, their imagination, and their skill to win the trade battle. 
But essentially what we are doing today by taking those off the table is we are effectively dooming thousands of small businesses across this country to extinction.

Mr. REED. I again agree wholeheartedly with the Senator. It is a situation in which, when we go to table, we have direct one-on-one negotiations, when we have as our leverage more liberal entry into our market, the largest market in the world, when we in fact have all of the force and the power behind these types of negotiations, we simply say we are not interested in 
the environment. Yet, when we go to international conferences, we say how not only must we all collectively clean up the environment, this Senate weeks ago said, by the way, the developing world, the world which will be the parties to the bilateral agreements, they must do their share because we can't do it alone.

Mr. REED. I thank the Senator for that kind word. We have an opportunity to provide balance in this agreement. No one is objecting to the need for better support for investment overseas. No one is objecting to the adoption of commercial laws and agricultural policies that are better, and, in fact, according to this legislation, mirror U.S. policy. 
But what we are saying is, if you simply create an environment for investment that leads to the opportunity for poor environmental quality--and I also add the environment--in which workers are hardly paid anything for hours of work--15 cents an hour is hardly something that is going to compete with American workers and never should be something that we would see as a goal. We should raise those. But if we do not do that, you have a one-sided agreement. You have an agreement which is a green light for capital to leave the United States and, as a result, move jobs and production to those other countries. This is detrimental to our small businesses, particularly some of our older industries. 
I don't believe it is inevitable that our old industries, like the jewelry industry, the footwear industry, just inherently can't compete. They can't compete if we allow countries of the world to pay 15 cents an hour, with no real environmental enforcement, turning the other way when there are regulatory problems, et cetera. But if we sought today to insist in our trade agreements that environmental quality is raised, that respect for workers and adequate wages are the order of the day, then I think you would be surprised at the ability of our industry to compete. 
That is what I believe we are trying to do here today, is put some balance in this legislation, recognize that unless we can enter into negotiations on all the critical issues that affect goods coming to the United States, we will never solve all of the issues that the Senator talked about. 
Frankly, you can look at so many industries. The footwear industry is a classic example. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, growing up near Brockton, MA, that was the home of footwear manufacture for the whole world. There is nothing left there. It is not because the workers weren't good workers. It wasn't because the managers didn't understand managerial techniques. 
We allowed countries to ship into our country goods that were produced at 10 cents an hour in conditions which we would not tolerate here in the United States of America. And unless we recognize that we will never get a handle on this issue of the trade deficit, the trade balances that the Senator talked about with Senator Dorgan.

Mr. REED. Again, the Senator is absolutely perceptive about these particular issues. I noted before the article in today's New York Times about Nike and Vietnam and one of the officers of Nike indicated that the factory that was inspected was `among the most modern in the world,' in fact directly competitive, `but there are a lot of things they could get better,' according to the spokesman. But the point the Senator makes is well taken. This is not some old rattrap that was built in the 1930's and has some ad hoc machines there. This is a modern facility. It is a modern facility, the best technology to produce footwear, but it is obvious from this report no thought or concern was there to protect the workers to do the things we insist must be done in our factories. 
So the Senator is absolutely right. So far as the new machines to make the product cheaper, better, faster, of higher quality, they are there, but all of the other concerns that go to the bottom line of any company, environmental quality being a major one, they can be avoided, and that is what we are facing. 
I believe that unless we elevate environmental considerations to a major negotiating objective, not only will we see the further deterioration of the world's environment, not only will we be in a situation where we go to international conferences with the rest of world asking us to do more and more and more to raise our standards, making us less competitive, we are going to see the impact in our trade balance dramatically and directly. This is not about altruism alone. This is not about ecopolitics. This is not about sensitivity to the environment alone. It is all of those things, but it is something else. It is something about having a system of trade laws which recognizes the important bottom line impact of environmental quality here and with respect to our trading partners. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, if I may briefly comment upon the amendment. First, I recognize certainly the strong commitment of the Senator from Delaware to environmental quality in the United States. Indeed, because of his commitment and the commitment of many of my colleagues, we have environmental laws which are significant, which provide for high quality in our country. But the problem is that our foreign competitors do not have anything close to these laws in many, many countries, particularly countries with which we are endeavoring to establish bilateral trade relationships. 
I agree with the Senator that the purpose of the fast-track procedure is to conform our laws to the negotiated results that the President achieves with our trading partners. I also believe and concur with the Senator that there is no attempt to lower or diminish our environmental laws. 
Simply stated, what my amendment would do is ask the President to go out and try to bring up, as best he can, foreign environmental laws to our laws. So, in effect, we would be asking him to go out and take what we have done in the United States and try to apply it to another country, not simply because of its decency, its correctness in an intellectual way, but because of its profound impact in the pattern of trade between our country and other countries of the world. 
It is interesting in other areas of this underlying legislation, we are quite specific in directing the President to do just that: go out and bring up the laws of our potential trading partners to our level. For example, in the section with respect to trade in services, we quite specifically direct the President to `develop internationally agreed rules, including dispute settlement procedures, which are consistent with the commercial policies of the United States.' 
I would be very happy if we had language like this that would say bring it up to the environmental policies of the United States. That is the point that I am trying to make. I would be very happy if we changed not one environmental law of the United States pursuant to fast track, that we did not try to diminish or decrease any of our environmental laws, but we simply ask the President to try to bring up their standards somewhere near to our standards. 
Not only would I be happy but, again, returning to the very strong, in my mind, analogy to my home State, I would be very happy if I could go back to my jewelry manufacturers--these are small companies; many of them have family connections over long, long periods of time where fathers and mothers have passed it on to sons and daughters--I would be very happy if I could tell them our fast-track agreement has resulted in increased environmental standards so that they are not exactly like the United States, but no longer will you have to provide pretreatment of your wastewater and then see competitors around the world simply dumping raw solvents into municipal wastewater systems. Not only would you have to provide ventilation for your workers, but other entrepreneurs will have to try to do the same thing. 
If we do that, I don't think it is violative of the spirit or the letter of fast track, but it will produce a much more even, competitive playing field for our manufacturers versus our potential trading partners. 
So I, again, urge that the Senate adopt this amendment that would move environmental quality to the center of negotiations as a principal negotiating objective, not because it is an altruistic noble goal alone, but because it impacts dramatically on the bottom line of American companies and foreign companies and, in that sense, should be part of our trading policy, should be a key goal which our President is seeking to achieve in any negotiations. I yield the floor.

Mr. REED. I understand the Senator's point--it is very well taken--about the procedures. In a sense, it might prove too much. The idea that we can do things outside of fast track raises or begs the question why we do certain things within fast track. Why, for example, are we saying let's make foreign laws with respect to commercial practices consistent with our laws, when, in fact, when it comes to the environment, we are saying, `Oh, no, don't include environment in this same context'? 
I think perhaps the logic might be that some people either feel the environment is not important to international trade--and I think our discussions tonight should have indicated it is very important, indeed crucial--or others are simply saying we want a trade agreement, an arrangement with a foreign country which will allow us all the benefits of commercial practice in the United States, all the protection of intellectual property laws, all the protections for capital investment but none of the burdens, if you will, of high-quality environmental laws. 
Again, I just can't understand, with respect, why we can't include environmental conditions as we have otherwise.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the `Haffenreffer Museum Restoration Act of 1997', legislation that Senator Chafee and I introduced to assist in the relocation and expansion of Rhode Island's Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology. 
Currently situated in Bristol, R.I., the Haffenreffer Museum is home to one of our Nation's finest collections of Native American and other cultural artifacts from around the world. Each year, thousands of visitors enjoy the Haffenreffer's exhibits and benefit from its commitment to education, which is a tribute to the museum's close ties to the Brown University Department of Anthropology. Recognizing this effective combination, the American Association of Museums has described the Haffenreffer as a `superb medium-small facility with outstanding collections, excellent exhibits, and a superb program of public education and outreach.' 
In an effort to increase access to the Haffenreffer's resources, Brown University has begun preparations to relocate the museum to Providence, R.I. Toward this end, the university has acquired two structures on the National Register of Historic Places, the Old Stone Bank Building and the Benoni-Cooke House, to house the Haffenreffer in downtown Providence. 
This move would preserve these historically significant buildings, while contributing to the resurgence of Providence by adding a nationally renowned museum to its growing arts and entertainment district. The new site would also allow the Haffenreffer to display more of its collection for visitors, whom the museum estimates would increase fivefold after the relocation. This development would particularly serve children, who currently make up more than half of the museum's visitors and for whom the downtown location would be more accessible. 
Brown University is raising funds to restore and expand the Old Stone Bank Building and the Benoni-Cooke House, and to complete the relocation of the Haffenreffer's collection to Providence by the year 2000. The bill before the Senate today authorizes Federal cooperation in advancing these goals, increasing knowledge of Native American history, preserving architectural treasures, and promoting the revitalization of our Nation's downtown areas. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and the work needed to bring the Haffenreffer to Rhode Island's capital city.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few comments concerning legislation which I am introducing to deal with the problem of slamming. Earlier this year, I outlined the remedies necessary to deal with this serious consumer problem in a Sense of the Senate Resolution which was amended to the Commerce State Justice Appropriations legislation. The legislation I introduce today embodies those remedies. I would like to take a moment to thank Ranking Member Hollings and Chairmen McCain and Burns for the assistance they have lent to me on this issue. 
Telephone `slamming' is the illegal practice of switching a consumer's long distance service without the individual's consent. This problem has increased dramatically over the last several years, as competition between long distance carriers has risen. Slamming is the top consumer complaint lodged at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), with 11,278 reported complaints in 1995, and 16,500 in 1996. In the first nine months of 1997 alone, 15,000 complaints have been filed. Unfortunately, this represents only the tip of the iceberg because most consumers never report violations to the FCC. One regional Bell company estimates that 1 in every 20 switches is fraudulent. Media reports indicate that as many as 1 million illegal transfers occur annually. Thus, slamming threatens to rob consumers of the benefit of a competitive market, which is now composed of over 500 companies which generate $72.5 billion. As a result of slamming, consumers face not only increased phone bills, but also the significant expenditure of time and energy in attempting to identify and reverse the fraud. The results of slamming are clear: higher phone bills and immense consumer frustration. 
Mr. President, we are all aware of the stiff competition which occurs for customers in the long distance telephone service industry. The goal of deregulating the telecommunications industry was to allow consumers to easily avail themselves of lower prices and better service. Hopefully, this option will soon be presented to consumers for in-state calls and local phone service. Indeed, better service at lower cost is a main objective of those who seek to deregulate the utility industry. Unfortunately, fraud threatens to rob many consumers of the benefits of a competitive industry. 
Telemarketing is one of the least expensive and most effective forms of marketing, and it has exponentially expanded in recent years. By statute, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulates most telemarketing, prohibiting deceptive or abusive sales calls, requiring that homes not be called at certain times, and that companies honor a consumer's request not to be called again. The law mandates that records concerning sales be maintained for two years. While the FTC is charged with primary enforcement, the law allows consumers, or state Attorneys General on their behalf, to bring legal action against violators. Yet, phone companies are exempt from these regulations, since they are subject to FCC regulation. 
While the FCC has brought action against twenty-two of the industry's largest and smallest firms for slamming violations with penalties totaling over $1.8 million, this represents a minute fraction of the violations. FCC prosecution does not effectively address or deter this serious fraud. To date, state officials have been more aggressive in pursuing violators. The California Public Utility Commission fined a company $2 million earlier this year after 56,000 complaints were filed against it. Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Vermont, and Wisconsin have all pursued litigation against slammers. Earlier this summer, public officials of twenty-five states asked the FCC to adopt tougher rules against slammers. 
As directed by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the FCC has recently moved to close several loopholes which have allowed slamming to continue unabated. Most importantly, the FCC has proposed to eliminate the financial incentive which encourages many companies to slam by mandating that all revenues generated from an illegal switch be returned to the original carrier. At present, a slammer can retain the profits generated from an illegal switch. Additionally, the FCC proposed regulations would require that a carrier confirm all switches generated by telemarketing through either (1) a letter of agency, known as a LOA, from the consumer; (2) a recording of the consumer verifying his or her choice on a toll free line provided by the carrier; or (3) a record of verification by an appropriately qualified and independent third party. The regulations are expected to be finalized by the FCC early in 1998. While this represents a start, I believe that these remedies will be wholly inadequate to address the ever-increasing problem of slamming. The problem is that slammed consumers would still be left without conclusive proof that their consent was properly obtained and verified. 
My legislation encompasses a three part approach to stop slamming by strengthening the procedures used to verify consent obtained by marketers; increasing enforcement procedures by allowing citizens or their representatives to pursue slammers in court with the evidence necessary to win; and encouraging all stakeholders to use emerging technology to prevent fraud. 
Mr. President, let me also thank the National Association of Attorneys General, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners which through both their national offices and individual members provided extensive recommendations to improve this bill. Additionally, I have found extremely helpful the input of several groups which advocate on behalf of consumers. I was particularly pleased to work with the Consumer Federation of America to address concerns which its members expressed, and I am honored that this legislation has received the endorsement of their organization. 
Mr. President, let me take a few minutes to outline the specific provisions of my bill. My legislation requires that a consumer's consent to change service is verified so that discrepancies can be adjudicated quickly and efficiently. Like the 1996 Act, my bill requires a legal switch to include verification. However, my legislation enumerates the necessary elements of a valid verification. First, the bill requires verification to be maintained by the provider, either in the form of a letter from the consumer or by recording verification of the consumer's consent via the phone. The length that the verification must be maintained is to be determined by the FCC. Second, the bill 
stipulates the form that verification must take. Written verification remains the same as current regulations. Oral verification must include the voice of the subscriber affirmatively demonstrating that she wants her long distance provider to be changed; is authorized to make the change; and is currently verifying an imminent switch. The bill mandates oral verification to be conducted in a separate call from that of the telemarketer, by an independent, disinterested party. This verifying call must promptly disclose the nature and purpose of the call. Third, after a change has been executed, the new service provider must send a letter to the consumer, within five business days of the change in service, informing the consumer that the change, which he requested and verified, has been effected. Fourth, the bill mandates that a copy of verification be provided to the consumer upon request. Finally, the bill requires the FCC to finalize rules implementing these mandates within nine months of enactment of the bill. 
These procedures should help ensure that consumers can efficiently avail themselves of the phone service they seek, without being exposed to random and undetectable fraudulent switches. If an individual is switched without his or her consent, the mandate of recorded, maintained verification will provide the consumer with the proof necessary to prove that the switch was illegal. 
The second main provision of my legislation would provide consumers, or their public representatives, a legal right to pursue violators in court. Following the model of Senator Hollings' 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act, my bill provides aggrieved consumers with a private right of action in any state court which allows, under specific slamming laws or more general consumer protection statutes such an action. The 1991 Act has been adjudicated to withstand constitutional challenges on both equal protection and tenth amendment claims. Thus, the bill has the benefit of specifying one forum in which to resolve illegal switches of all types of service: long distance, in-state, and local service. 
Realizing that many individuals will not have the time, resources, or inclination to pursue a civil action, my bill also allows state Attorneys Generals, or other officials authorized by state law, to bring an action on behalf of citizens. Like the private right of action in suits brought by public officials damages are statutorily set at $1,000 or actual damages, whichever is greater. Treble damages are awarded in cases of knowing or willful violations. In addition to monetary awards, states are entitled to seek relief in the form of writs of mandamus, injunction, or similar relief. To ensure a proper role for the FCC, state actions must be brought in a federal district court where the victim or defendant resides. Additionally, state actions must be certified with the Commission, which maintains a right to intervening in an action. The bill makes express the fact that it has no impact on state authority to investigate consumer fraud or bring legal action under any state law. 
Finally, Mr. President, my legislation recognizes that neither legislators nor regulators can solve tomorrow's problems with today's technology. Therefore my bill mandates that the FCC provide Congress with a report on other, less burdensome but more secure means of obtaining and recording consumer consent. Such methods might include utilization of Internet technology or issuing PIN numbers or customer codes to be used before carrier changes are authorized. The bill requires that the FCC report to Congress on such methodology by December 31, 1999. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss my initiative to stop slamming. I hope that this issue can be addressed quickly. As a result, I would urge all my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.

Mr. REED. Madam President, I am here today to comment once again on not only the fast-track agreement but also the overall context of U.S. trading. The discussion between the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from New York pointed out the complexity of looking at the trade deficit. But there are some things that are quite clear despite the complexity. 
In 1980, we had a surplus of roughly $2.3 billion. By 1996--we have now a deficit of $165 billion. That is the time in which fast track has been operative. That is the time in which fast track has been the centerpiece of our legislative efforts, our international efforts to increase trade in the world. 
This deficit right now is a result of many things. It is a result of, in some respects, our fast-track policy. But it is a result also of our inability, I think, to deal with some of the more basic issues in international trade, dealing with some countries that utilize access to our market but at the same time deny us access to their market. It is a phenomenon also caused by the proliferation of multinational corporations that move their operations, in many cases, out of the United States because of our environmental laws, because of our labor laws, because of many stringent requirements that raise and maintain the quality of life and the standard of living here in the United States. And they have gone to other countries. In fact, some of our policies have encouraged their departure. 
One of the striking differences between this fast-track bill today, 1997, and the fast-track bill that was adopted in 1988, is that we have neglected to include within the principal negotiating objectives attention to the rights of workers of our potential trading partners. We have also neglected to include currency coordination, which is an important aspect of ensuring that a free-trade system operates appropriately and correctly. We have also narrowed significantly the scope of concerns which we can address with respect to the environment. 
Regardless of our budget situation, we will have contributed to the further deterioration, if this bill passes, of our trade position, because we have included increased incentives to deploy capital from the United States from other parts of the world to developing countries, which effectively will mean that they will be our competitors. 
I know, when the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from New York were talking, they were talking about the overall trade balance, making the distinction between our trade balance and our Federal deficit. But I think if you just aggregate that trade balance, you will see clearly that in terms of manufactured goods we are consistently losing. And that is the most prescient, tangible point with respect to the arguments that, because of some of these trading rules, literally our good manufacturing jobs are going overseas.

Mr. REED. The Senator is quite correct--reclaiming my time. It illustrates his point, that there may be, in fact, countervailing foreign investments in this country to make up for our budget deficits, but that does not explain the phenomenon of losing consistently and persistently the battle for the sale of manufactured goods from our suppliers to other countries around the world.

Mr. REED. Again, the Senator is absolutely correct. Frankly, to move to an analogy which is a little more colloquial but perhaps just as compelling, if we were managing a professional baseball team and we lost every year for 10 or 15 years, I don't think we would be managing that baseball team. 
That is essentially, if you charge us as managers of our international trade policy, we have lost every year for the last several decades. The trade policy has to be changed. Frankly, I don't believe anyone here is advocating that we could not use a good fast-track procedure. The argument is this is not a good fast-track procedure; that we are neglecting several of the most critical items when it comes to realistic competition between countries in the world today for international trade. We are totally neglecting the differential between our wage structure, particularly our manufacturing wage structure, and the wage structures overseas. We are neglecting it by simply saying that is not important to us, we don't care if workers in Third World countries are making 2 or 3 cents an hour or 20 cents an hour, when our workers are making $6 or $7 an hour or more. We don't care about that. 
We should care about that because, frankly, that is one of the reasons why we have a huge trade deficit, particularly in manufactured goods. Because there are incentives now, huge incentives, to deploy capital from the United States into these countries so that they can set up manufacturing plants. And we have seen it consistently. We have seen it even deliberately, blatantly, in the sense of finding places where the labor laws are so lax that there are incentives for companies to move in. 
In Malaysia it was an explicit condition of the movement of many American manufacturers into that country that Malaysia would not have, or enforce, strong labor laws. They would not give their workers the right to benefit from these new industries coming in and developing and selling successfully in the world economy. 
Is that wrong? It's wrong for those workers, which is a concern. But what is more of a concern for me, it is wrong for our workers because how can we expect to be competing against workers with new, modern technology based on new capital investments, workers who are as well skilled as ours may be, in a world in which they are paid a fraction of what is the minimum wage here in the United States? 
Then you can also look at the issue of environmental quality, which is so important. It is not important in just a touchy-feely sense; we want to make sure there are forests and the streams are filled with fish, et cetera. It is really a very practical sense. 
When a group of multinational countries now can go into Mexico, set up new manufacturing plants and literally take all their effluent and just pour it into the local sewer--something they could never do in their home country, not in the United States, not in Europe--that is an advantage for them to go there. We have to recognize that. We can't be naive and sloganize here on the floor and say it's just free trade, and free trade. Free trade makes sense if there are the conditions for free trade: That there are, in fact, complementary monetary and fiscal policies in each country; that there is, in fact, respect for workers' rights and workers' ability to organize. 
One of the assumptions underlying free trade is that when workers are displaced by imports in one sector of the economy, they move to a more efficient job in another sector of the economy. And we know that is not the case. It doesn't happen. Maybe it will 
happen in 50 or 100 years. But in the lives of Americans today, and their children's lives, that doesn't happen. We see dislocation. And we see dislocation that can be avoided, at least minimized, if we adopt strategies in this fast-track legislation that will direct the President to deal with these issues, to deal with them aggressively and to come back to us with an agreement that does talk about how we are going to raise the standard of living, through trade, of individuals in our trading partners' countries; of how we are going to deal with environmental issues in those countries; how are we going to make sure that currency valuations changes, manipulations, don't undercut all that we think we have gained at the bargaining table. 
The classic example of course is Mexico. We went in and reduced significantly, we thought, the tariffs that the Mexicans would charge us, the tariffs that we would charge them, thinking that now our goods would move back and forth freely. All of that was wiped out by a 40-percent reduction in the value of the peso; the purchasing power of Mexican citizens who might want our goods. And to not be concerned about that, to not elevate that issue of currency coordination to a major negotiating objective is absurd. It is particularly absurd within the last 2 weeks when all we have read about is the currency attacks in the Far East and Thailand, in all of these countries, leading to a shock wave on Wall Street.

Mr. REED. Let me just, in the remaining 3 minutes, say that individuals, colleagues who come to the floor and just talk slogans about free trade have not, I think, understood what is going on. Why does Japan run a $47 billion a year surplus with the United States? Because they exclude our goods. Why does China run a multibillion-dollar surplus with the United States? Because they exclude our goods; and because they manipulate their currency to reduce the wages, effectively, of their workers; because they are insensitive to environmental quality; because they claim, for cultural reasons, historical reasons, they don't have to abide by intellectual property rules or anything else. 
Those are the real issues that we face concerning our ability to compete in the world economy. What does this legislation do about those things? Ignores workers' rights; ignores environmental quality; and to a great degree it ignores currency coordination as major negotiating objectives. In effect what we said is: Listen, we are going to give the President fast-track power to do everything except what is most important to be done. And that is our objection. No one is here on the floor saying that we can withdraw from the world trade economy or we should withdraw from the world trade economy. What we are saying is let's negotiate agreements that will benefit all the citizens of this country; that will benefit working men and women throughout this country; that will ensure that they have a fair opportunity to work and earn wages that are decent. And that is not going to happen under this agreement. 
What we have to do, I believe--and I hope we can--is ensure that the negotiating objectives are changed; that we do provide the President with the directions, with the incentives, with the authority to go out there and talk seriously about all these issues. Frankly, there was some discussion before that our trading partners won't take us seriously. What they won't take seriously is any President of the United States talking about workers' rights, about environmental quality, and about a strong stable currency coordination in the world, if we pass this fast-track agreement. Because we basically told them we are not interested. What we are interested in here is promoting capital deployment from the United States into areas of the world that don't treat workers properly, that don't care about the environment, and may or may not manipulate their currency to maintain the advantage they have against the United States. 
This is not an agreement that we should support. If we want fast track, let's get it right, let's do it right. This is not the right way to go.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to use my time to discuss the fast-track bill. First, let me commend the excellent statement by the Senator from West Virginia. His staunch defense of the Senate and the Congress is based not only on his unsurpassed knowledge of the Constitution, but also his common sense and appreciation that the wisdom of the American people expressly represent the best way to make a treaty. 
I rise to discuss a number of issues with respect to our trade policy, most particularly, the fast-track legislation that is before us today. Like all of my colleagues, I understand the importance of international trade. Today, the value of trade equals 30 percent of our gross domestic product, which is up from about 13 percent in 1970. Indeed, trade is of great importance to my State of Rhode Island, which exported goods totaling $1 billion in 1996. 
There is nobody on this floor today that is arguing that trade is not important and that the United States shouldn't be actively involved in international trade. The question today is not whether the United States should engage in trade. The question today is whether we will establish a framework that will open markets without undermining our standard of living. This debate is more than about simply increasing our access to cheap goods; it is about our continuing efforts to promote employment at decent wages here at home, continuing our efforts to protect the environment around the world, and strengthening our efforts to promote stable trade and fair trade throughout the world. 
The critical aspects of this fast-track legislation are the goals which we set as Members of the Senate. These goals are known as principal negotiating objectives. This is the mission we give to the President--to go out and negotiate, based on these goals, to reach settlements that will advance these multiple objectives: freer trade, fairer trade, a rising standard of living here in America and, we hope, around the world. 
The rationale for fast track was aptly summarized back in 1974 when the Senate Finance Committee wrote its report with respect to the first fast-track legislation. This report language bears repeating: 
The committee recognizes that such agreements negotiated by the executive should be given an up-or-down vote by the Congress. Our negotiators cannot be expected to accomplish the negotiating goals if there are no reasonable assurances that the negotiated agreement would not be voted up or down on their merits. Our trading partners have expressed an unwillingness to negotiate without some assurances that Congress will consider the agreement within a definite timeframe. 
The key operative phrase in this passage is the phrase which we have highlighted behind me. The negotiated goals. That essentially is what we are about today. 
Charting negotiating goals that will give the President of the United States the direction and the incentive to conduct appropriate negotiations, to yield a treaty which will benefit ourselves, and also to signal to our trading partners what is critical and crucial to this Congress and the American people in terms of trade agreements. This rationale for fast track makes sense, and only makes sense, if we get it right here, if we get the negotiating goals correct. 
Unfortunately, the bill before us does not provide the President with the full range of goals necessary to increase U.S. trade and enhance our standard of living. Indeed, this bill is contrary to some of the provisions of the 1988 fast-track legislation which specifically recognized workers' rights and monetary coordination as fundamental negotiating goals. In addition, the 1988 fast-track bill gave the President greater authority to negotiate on environmental issues in the context of these trade agreements. The Roth bill limits this authority. 
Fast track is a great slogan. Free trade is a great slogan. But here today we are not about sloganizing, we are about legislating. And, as such, we must look to this bill, to all of its details and specifically to the goal which it lays out for the President of the United States. In failing to adequately address issues such as labor and monetary conditions, the Roth bill neglects the serious assumptions that underlie the whole theory of free trade. 
The theory of free trade evolved over many, many years, based upon the economic notions of comparative advantage and specialization, notions that were advanced hundreds of years ago by David Ricardo, the English economist. At the core of these notions of comparative advantage and specialization is that certain nations can produce or prepare goods and services better than others, and that if we trade we can maximize values throughout the world. These assumptions, though, rest on other critical assumptions. As Professor Samuelson, the famous economist, pointed out in his 10th edition work on economic theory: 
The important law of comparative advantage must be qualified to take into account certain interferences with it. Thus, if exchange rate parities and money wage rates are rigid in both countries, or fiscal or monetary policies are poorly run in both countries, then the blessings of cheap imports that international specialization might give would be turned into the curse of unemployment. 
We will hear a lot about free trade, but this bill does not give the President the direction to establish the underlying environment which is necessary for free trade--respect for and recognition of the rights of workers to freely associate, to seek higher wages, respect for and acknowledgment of the critical role of currencies in the world of trade. Because of these reasons and many others, this bill, I think, falls far short of what we should in fact pass as a means to achieve the goal we all fervently seek, which is free, open trade and fair trade throughout the world. 
Now, the debate on trade in the United States is not new. From the beginning of our country we have fiercely debated the role of trade in our economy. Beginning with Alexander Hamilton's `Report On Manufacturers,' there has been a constant ebb and flow between those that would advise protective tariffs and those that would suggest free, open trade is the only route. This battle back and forth between opposing views took on, in many respects, the characterization of protectionism versus free traders. It reached its culmination, perhaps, before World War II when, in 1930, this Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act which has become infamous because of its effect upon, at that time, the beginning of the world depression. And then, in 1934 the protective tariffs embedded in Smoot-Hawley were reversed. In 1934, the Tariff Act gave the President the right to reciprocally negotiate trade and tariff adjustment. So, this phase, running from the beginning of the country to the advent of World War II, saw a fierce battle between protectionists and open-marketeers. 
The second phase of our debate on trade began in the aftermath of World War II where a dominant American economy sought to establish rules for freer trade. But from World War II through 1974, particularly with respect to the Kennedy and Tokyo Rounds of GATT, our view was more or less using trade as a foreign policy device, using trade as a way to establish bulwarks against the threats of communism, the threats of instability. And in so many respects it was this unintended but accumulation of concessions to trading partners around the world that has left us where we are today, which in many respects our market is virtually open in terms of tariffs and in terms of nontariff barriers, but there are many other countries who still maintain barriers to our trade. 
Beginning in 1974, we recognized that an important part of access to markets was not just the tariff level but those nontariff barriers. As a result, we started the fast-track process. In this context that I described, fast track makes sense if we get the goals right. Today's legislation, I suggest, does not get the goals right. Indeed, since 1974 international trade has taken on a much more central position in our economy in terms of its size and, now, in a variation on some of the foreign policy themes we heard during the 1950's and 1960's, as a way of some to create the democracies, the markets which we think are essential to progress around the world. In any respect, we are here today not to stop the progress of free trade but, in fact, to ensure that free trade results in benefits for all of our citizens and, indeed, benefits for those citizens of the world economy which we hope to trade with. 
Some have labeled anyone who opposes this fast-track mechanism as a protectionist. I think quite the contrary, those of us--let me speak for myself. I certainly think that we represent interventionists, because we feel that to get trade right, you can't simply leave the country we trade with as we found it. We have to insist that they begin to adapt to and accept international standards with respect to workers' rights, environmental quality, currency coordination, a host of issues. In fact, when we look at the agreement, we see instances within this legislation, it is quite clearly acknowledged, where we are pushing or trying to push countries to adapt to our way of doing business. But they seem to be exclusively with respect to commercial practices--commercial laws or agricultural policies. So we have in some respects the will to try to develop a world system based upon our model, but when it comes to critical issues like workers' protections and environmental quality, this legislation does not express that necessary role. 
The administration has expressed their deep desire for this legislation. Indeed, I hope we could pass a fast-track legislative bill this session to open up markets to American firms, to compete in a global economy. With under 5 percent of the world's population living in the United States, we certainly have to find ways to sell to the remaining 95 percent of the world's population. It is no secret that economies in many parts of the world are growing faster than we are and offer tremendous opportunities for our investment and our exports. It is indeed predicted that economies in Asia and economies in Latin America will continue to grow at significant rates and we have to be part of this. 
But we have to be part of this growth in trade in a way that will ensure that American firms and American workers are in the best position to compete and win in this global economy, this battle for success in the global economy. But I don't think, as I mentioned before, that this bill will set the goals necessary to win that competition. 
Now, as Senator Byrd indicated so eloquently, this legislation also represents a significant expansion in the authority of the President to conduct the foreign policy of the United States and the commercial policy of the United States. In fact, since the adoption in 1974, the President's ability to negotiate and enter into trade agreements to reduce or eliminate tariff and nontariff barriers has increased significantly. But because it is such a 
significant delegation of authority, we have to, as I indicated before, make sure that we get the general goals correct, because we won't have the opportunity, as we do in other ways, to second-guess or correct the President's decision as we go forward. 
So, again, as the Senator from West Virginia indicated, this is the opportunity for us, and maybe the only opportunity, to set the appropriate agenda for discussions going forward on international trade. I think, as I said, the current bill before us does not establish the appropriate negotiating goals so that we do ensure the President not only has the authority but the appropriate direction to serve the interests of the American people in establishing a regime of free and open trade throughout the world. 
Now, as I indicated before, the Roth bill that is before us today is deficient in many specifics. First, let me take one specific and that is the notion of providing a very active negotiating goal to seek ways to improve and enforce labor relations in other countries around the world. In 1988, fast-track legislation stated that one of the administration's principal negotiating objectives in trade agreements was:  
To promote respect for worker rights; to secure a review of the relationship between worker rights to GATT articles, objectives, and related instruments with a view to ensuring that the benefits of the trading system are available to all workers; to adopt as a principle of the GATT, that the denial of worker rights should not be a means for a country or its industries to gain competitive advantage in international trade. 
This legislation before us eliminates this workers' rights provision as a principal negotiating objective in trade agreements. I dare say if we read that to any Member of this Senate, they would say of course that has to be a goal of our trade negotiators. Yet in this legislation it is not such a goal. 
As a result, it will limit the President's ability to try to negotiate improvements of labor standards and, as such, it will cast aside the interests of millions of American workers as well as the interests of workers worldwide. 
It is no secret that income inequality has risen substantially in the United States in recent years. For nearly 2 decades the real wages and compensation of American blue-collar workers have been declining. Hourly compensation for nonsupervisory production workers fell by approximately 9.5 percent between 1979 and 1995. 
There are many reasons for this. Some would cite declining rates of unionization, some the erosion of the real value of the minimum wage. But others would cite the increasing globalization of trade. Although it is difficult to determine exactly the composition, the factors that are influencing this phenomena, there is an emerging consensus by economists that approximately 30 percent of the relative decline in the wages of noncollege-educated workers, and even a larger share in the decline with respect to production-wage workers, is a result of international trade and its effects. And I should say even though the President has suggested Executive initiatives in the last 2 days to try to correct some of these incongruities, it is not likely to do so. In fact, if we want to ensure that our wages remain comparable with our increases in productivity, we have to ensure that when our negotiators go to the table and negotiate arrangements, they are conscious of the rights of American workers and conscious of the rights of those workers in the countries with which we are attempt to go negotiate these trade agreements. Indeed, in light of these trends it is imperative that this provision be part of our fast-track legislation. It is not such a part of the legislation. 
We have the recent experience of NAFTA to further inform the debate on these issues. It has been estimated that since enactment of NAFTA in 1993, trade with Canada and Mexico has cost the United States approximately 420,000 jobs, including 2,200 in my home State of Rhode Island. As a minimal estimate of job loss, the Labor Department has certified approximately 143,000 workers as being eligible for assistance because of trade dislocation. 
The list of companies that have made NAFTA-related layoffs is a veritable `Who's Who' of American industry. It includes General Electric, Allied Signal, Sara Lee, Black and Decker, TRW, Georgia Pacific, Johnson & Johnson--and the layoffs continue. 
Indeed, I don't think one can point the finger merely at these companies because they are certainly just taking advantage of something which we created, the opportunity legally--in fact some would argue the incentive legally--to move production out of the United States to other areas, in this case Mexico. 
But the effect is not simply in the jobs lost. The effect perhaps is more decisive in the suppression of wages. There are reports that companies will either explicitly or implicitly threaten to relocate to places like Mexico if wage concessions are not made. In fact, during the debate last year on NAFTA, a Wall Street Journal poll of executives found a majority of executives from large companies intended to use NAFTA, as they indicated, as `a bargaining chip to keep down wages in the United States.' 
And this is borne out by numerous anecdotes. For example, workers at a plant in my home State in Warwick, RI, agreed to freeze wages and work 12-hour shifts without overtime pay because the company threatened to move production to Mexico. Similarly, 4,000 workers in a plant in Webster, NY, accepted 33-percent cuts in base pay to avoid a threatened plant relocation. A company in Georgia threatened to move 300 jobs at a lighting plant to Mexico unless workers took a 20-percent cut in pay and 36-percent cut in benefits. Mr. President, 220 workers at a plant in Baltimore agreed to take a $1-an-hour pay cut to keep the plant open. And the list goes on and on and on. 
The negative implications of NAFTA has been felt by U.S. workers and it should give us renewed energy and commitment to ensure that in the next round of fast-track legislation we at least replicate the 1988 goal of actively trying to ensure that worker protection, workers' rights are a central part of our negotiating strategy. Once again, this legislation does not do that. 
It is important also to note that in the context of NAFTA, the benefits for Mexican workers have not been what they were advertised as. Since the passage of NAFTA, real manufacturing wages of Mexican workers have declined 25 percent. Part of this decline is attributable, of course, to the peso crisis. However it is important to recognize that real wages were stagnating prior to the peso crisis, while worker productivity in Mexico continued to grow. So, despite increased productivity, wages in Mexico continue to stagnate or decline. In fact, the percentage of Mexicans considered extremely poor rose from 31 percent in 1993 to 50 percent in 1996, after NAFTA. And two out of three Mexicans report that their personal economic situation is worse now than before NAFTA. 
Following NAFTA, we have the benefit of these experiences which we did not have when we were considering the legislation back in 1988. Again, it seems inconceivable that seeing what has taken place in NAFTA, seeing how important--not only to our workers but to the workers of the country we hope to trade with--how important it is to negotiate and to reach principled agreements on worker protections and worker rights, that we are neglecting to do that in this legislation. And, as such, we have left a huge hole in our responsibility to give the President the responsibility and the direction to do what is best for the working men and women of this country, do what is best for the overall welfare of this country. 
Now, with respect to the environment, that is another area where this legislation is deficient. It restricts the ability of the President to negotiate environmental issues and trade agreements by requiring that they be `directly related' to trade. And this differs from the 1988 fast-track bill which provided greater latitude for the President to negotiate on environmental issues. I would assume that `directly related to trade' means that if we have a problem getting a good into a country because they 
object to an environmental rule, that we might say, for example, labeling of a can, of a product, that that might be actionable. But it is not actionable if the country has absolutely no environmental enforcement; that it allows pollution to run rampant, that it actually encourages the relocation of factories and production facilities because of lax environmental rulings, because one I assume would argue that's not directly related to trade, it's not directly related to a good we are trying to get into the economy. But in fact, and again the NAFTA experience is instructive, this is precisely one of the ways in which countries undermine our environmental laws at home on the standard of living of our workers here in the United States. Indeed, after NAFTA we should be much more interested in including strong environmental protections. For the examples that the NAFTA experience has given us. 
Subsequent to the passage of NAFTA the Canadian province of Alberta, which was only one of two Canadian provinces to sign the NAFTA environmental side agreement, adopted legislation in May 1996 prohibiting citizens from suing environmental officials to enforce environmental laws. And, in fact, since that time, to attract corporate investment, Alberta has advertised its lax regulatory climate as part of `the Alberta advantage.' 
Now, it might be an advantage to Alberta. Certainly I don't think it is to many residents of Alberta. And it is not an advantage to U.S. companies or U.S. workers who are faced with laws that we passed, and rightfully so, that demand high-quality environmental controls in the workplace. 
In October 1995 Mexico announced that it would no longer require environmental impact assessments for investments in highly polluting sectors such as petrochemicals, refining, fertilizers and steel.

<TEXT>
Mr. REED. Mr. President, Mexican officials said they were eliminating these environmental impact assessments to increase investment, which may well be an apparent violation of NAFTA because it prohibits, apparently, the weakening of environmental laws to attract investment. 
So our experience with NAFTA should tell us that we must redouble our efforts to have the principal negotiating objective of environmental concerns. Yet, again we have constrained and circumscribed the ability of the President by simply saying they have to be directly related to trade, and many environmental problems are not directly related to trade. 
For example, near the United States-Mexican border, there is an area known as Ciudad Industrial, where a number of sophisticated, highly automated manufacturing plants have been established since NAFTA. These manufacturing plants discharge hazardous waste through a nearby sewer outfall which adjoins a river that is used for washing and bathing. The Mexican Government has enacted a number of institutional barriers to environmental progress to prevent pollution abatement. For example, Mexican law prohibits the local government from taxing these state-of-the-art factories to pay for sewers, to pay for cleaning up. 
In these ways, unrelated directly to trade, there are advantages to relocating production in countries. These are the type of actions which we should be concerned about, that we should, in fact, direct the President to be concerned about, that we should, in fact, insist the President bring to the table as a significant negotiating goal. 
There is a final point I would like to make with respect to the specific deficiency of these goals, and that is the issue of monetary coordination. The 1988 fast-track bill included monetary coordination as a principal negotiating objective. Specifically the bill stated: 
The principal negotiating objective of the United States regarding trade in monetary coordination is to develop mechanisms to ensure greater coordination, consistency and cooperation between international trade and monetary systems and institutions. 
The bill before us today eliminates monetary coordination as a principal negotiating objective, thereby limiting the President's ability to address issues of currency valuation, fluctuating currency, all of the issues that have become tangible and palpable in the last few days, as we witnessed the gyrations of currency and the stock market throughout the Orient. 
Currency valuation is a key component of trade policy because it affects the price of imports and exports. For example, as the U.S. dollar gets stronger relative to other currencies, U.S. exports to a foreign country will likely become more expensive in that country and the country's imports will become cheap in the United States. Inversely, as the U.S. dollar gets weaker relative to other currencies, U.S. exports to a foreign country will become cheaper in that country, and that country's imports will become more expensive in the United States. As a result, and quite clearly, currency valuation affects trade flow between countries and, consequently, the trade deficit. 
We have to be terribly conscious of these currency valuations. It is evident in recent statistics on the valuation of the dollar in trade that there is a high correlation between the two. Since mid-1995, the dollar has risen against a number of foreign currencies, and during this period, the United States trade deficit rose also. It is estimated the trade deficit will increase to $206 billion by the end of 1997. Also, currency valuation affects direct investment into our country by foreign investors, and that is something that we also have to be sensitive to. 
Again, the NAFTA experience gives us further evidence--if we didn't know about it before--it gives us further evidence. As you know, NAFTA was enacted and shortly thereafter, the peso collapsed. What we thought were significant reductions in Mexican tariffs were wiped out by a 40-percent reduction in the value of 
the peso. 
This reduction was part of inevitably the continuing strategy of Mexico, and the strategy of many countries, to have export-led growth to reduce the cost of their goods to United States consumers, and one way they did this was through the devaluation of the peso. 
If we continue to be indifferent to the notion of currency and its role in our international trade, we are going to continue to see these problems and others like them. 
It turned out that before the negotiation of NAFTA, Mexico was running a trade deficit of $29 billion with the United States, a very large trade deficit, 8 percent of its gross domestic product. By 1994, after the onset of NAFTA and towards 1996, their deficit had turned into a surplus, again, in many respects because of the currency changes that took place because of the peso prices. 
So we do have to be very, very conscious of these currency effects. Once again, this is not a part of the major negotiating goals for this legislation. 
Reduced currency values in Mexico has prompted increased investment there. In the past year, investment in maquiladora plants in the Mexican State of Baja California, have increased by more than 35 percent. In effect, because of their policies, because of our adoption of NAFTA, we have created monetary incentives to move and invest in Mexico and not just for the United States but for other countries around the world who are using Mexico as a platform for low-cost production which, in turn, is imported into the United States without duties. 
Over the horizon, there is another major trading partner whose currency manipulations, if you will, can cause us significant problems, and that is China. As part of its strategy to encourage exports and discourage imports, China has engaged in an effort to reduce the value of its currency relative to the dollar. These currency valuations wipe out many of the concessions that we think we have sometimes with the Chinese with respect to their trade and our trade. 
It puts, of course, downward pressure on the wages of U.S. workers as we cannot produce here the items that can be produced overseas more cheaply, not because of differences in productivity, but, in many cases, in part at least in the very calculated manipulation of currencies by foreign countries. 
Again, the absence of such a major negotiating provision within the bill, I think, is a fatal flaw. 
Overall, the bill before us continues a policy of protecting capital without, I think, sufficient protection for workers, protecting the ability of capital to relocate throughout the world, without recognizing that there must be commensurate protections for workers, workers both here in the United States and workers worldwide. 
Because of the incentives now to deploy capital almost everywhere, we are beginning to recognize the phenomena of excess capacity in production facilities around the world, and many economists fear that this will lead to a massive deflation, and this massive deflation could be the major economic challenge that we face in the year's ahead. 
The lack of work protections, the fact that countries can manipulate currencies, the lack of sensitivity to environmental policies has been an incentive, a very powerful incentive, to move production from the United States into these developing countries. For example, Malaysia's booming electronics industry is based on the explicit promise to American semiconductor companies that workers will effectively prohibited from unionizing. In fact, when Malaysia considered lifting this ban on unionizing, American companies threatened to move to China or Vietnam, more receptive countries. This competition for cheap labor continues to put downward pressure on wages in developed countries as companies use the threat of relocation to leverage or reduce the pay of their workers. 
These trends, related to labor and technology, are creating a

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1292, the Military Construction Appropriations Line Item Veto Disapproval bill. 
I have long questioned the line-item veto in general terms. I am not convinced of its merit and I am particularly concerned with the manner in which it was applied to the Military Construction Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. 
Like my colleagues I believe that wasteful spending must be cut. However, since the line item veto was exercised for the first time on the Military Construction Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998, we have learned that even the White House now recognizes that its own data and process for identifying `wasteful' items to be subjected to the line item veto were seriously flawed. Indeed, OMB Director Franklin Raines wrote in the official Statement of Administration Policy, `. . .we are committed to working with Congress to restore funding for those projects that were canceled as a result of the data provided by the Department of Defense that was out of date.' Indeed, it is my understanding that the Administration is seeking ways to right these wrongs through other avenues. Moreover, I am perplexed by the theory that only the Administration knows what deserves to be in the budget. Instead, I believe there is plenty of wisdom here in Congress as well as the White House to establish budget priorities based on rational compromise and debate. Lastly, I would suggest to supporters of the line item veto that the real task of balancing the budget requires votes like the one I cast in 1993 for deficit reduction, not line item vetoes. 
There are also some who believe the line item veto is an innocuous device that could never be used for purely political purposes. However, the people of Rhode Island know full well what giving the President the authority to pick and choose specific budget items means. Rhode Island has already experienced a Presidential effort to eliminate an essential program. In 1992, President Bush tried to rescind funding for the Seawolf submarine program which is vital to our nation's defense and the livelihood of thousands of working Rhode Islanders. Fortunately, Democrats were able to beat back the attempt to rescind funding for the Seawolf, but this experience led me to believe that a line item veto would make future battles even more of a lopsided battle than a fair fight. In addition, a President, of any political party, could use the line item veto to eliminate other programs that are important to Rhode Island without fear because a small state like mine only has four votes in Congress. 
Mr. President, The line item veto is of untested constitutionality. Without a Constitutional amendment, the line item veto act transferred significant power from the Legislative Branch to the Executive. I would hope that the Supreme Court rules on the constitutionality of the line item veto in the near future so the Congress can act accordingly. In the interim, I believe the two principle tests on the use of the line item veto should be: One, is a particular line item veto politically motivated? Two, is a particular line item veto the outcome of a rational and coherent analysis based on sound policy?

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the achievement of Western Coventry School of Coventry, Rhode Island, which was honored earlier this year as a U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon School. 
It is a highly regarded distinction to be named a Blue Ribbon School. Through an intensive selection process beginning at the state level and continuing through a federal Review Panel of 100 top educators, many of the very best public and private schools in the nation are identified as deserving of this honor. These schools are particularly effective in meeting local, state, and national goals. However, this honor signifies not just who is best, but what works in educating today's children. 
Now, more than ever, it is important that we make every effort to reach out to students, that we truly engage and challenge them, and that we make their education come alive. At the Western Coventry School, a kindergarten through sixth grade school, parent-teacher cooperation, through an award winning Parent Teacher Association (PTA), has helped to improve the quality of education. The school has instituted a mentoring program for at-risk youth and has made concerted efforts to ensure that students with special needs receive the assistance they require. In addition, teachers have taken an aggressive role in developing new approaches to teaching reading and math. 
Mr. President, Western Coventry School is dedicated to the highest standards. It is a school committed to a process of continuous improvement with a focus on high student achievement. Most importantly, Western Coventry recognizes the value of the larger community and seeks its support and involvement. This school and community are making a huge difference in the lives of its students. 
Mr. President, the Blue Ribbon School initiative shows us the very best we can do for students and the techniques that can be replicated in every school to help all students succeed. I am proud to say that in Rhode Island we can look to a school like the Western Coventry School. Under the leadership of its principal, Barry Ricci, its capable faculty, and its involved parents, Western Coventry School will continue to be a shining example for years to come.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the VA-HUD Conference Report and to commend the conferees for their work in resolving a number of contentious issues with the House. 
First, I would like to commend the conferees for providing adequate funding to renew all expiring section 8 contracts. In my State of Rhode Island, it is expected that section 8 contracts on 4000 units will expire in fiscal year 1998, and I am pleased that this bill will ensure that all of these contracts are renewed. 
I would also like to commend the conferees on their successful effort to include the section 8 mark-to-market reforms in the conference report. The Senate Banking Committee passed a mark-to-market bill in June that was initially attached to the balanced budget legislation, but was subsequently dropped in conference. 
The significance of inclusion of the mark-to-market reforms in the conference report cannot be overstated because these reforms address an increasingly serious problem, which, if left uncorrected, will threaten the future viability of the section 8 program. The problem I am referring to is the projected increase in section 8 costs as the number of expiring section 8 contracts increases in coming years. In fiscal year 1997, approximately $3.6 was provided to renew expiring contracts. However, absent mark-to-market reforms, the costs of renewing expiring section 8 contracts is expected to increase to $9 billion in fiscal year 1998, and to $18 billion in fiscal year 2002. 
The reforms included in this bill address this issue by enabling landlords of section 8 properties to restructure their mortgage contracts, which will reduce the escalating costs of the section 8 program. The reforms will also reduce the subsidy levels that HUD pays to landlords for section 8 assistance. Because of the high costs to build many of these section 8 properties, HUD has been forced in many cases to pay subsidies that are in excess of 120 percent of fair market rent. In fact, a recent study found that 75 percent of HUD's newer assisted housing projects had rents above fair market rent, and that 50 percent of this housing had rents greater that 120 percent of fair market rent. I am pleased that this bill will address this problem by reducing rents to below fair market rents, or fair market rents for most section 8 housing. These changes will produce $500 million in savings for taxpayers. 
Also, the mark-to-market provisions will improve the quality of section 8 housing by requiring landlords to evaluate the rehabilitation needs of their property and undertake necessary repairs. For too long, many of our section 8 properties have been in an embarrassing state of disrepair. In a recent study, it was found that 24 percent of the section 8 properties were distressed. Sadly, some of these section 8 properties have become havens for crime and drug activities. I am pleased that the mark-to-market reforms will begin to attack this problem by requiring landlords to make repairs to their properties and become more responsible owners. 
The bill also includes provisions that will enable HUD to screen out rogue owners and managers, as well as provide more effective enforcement tools that will minimize fraud and abuse of HUD insurance and assisted housing programs. 
Most importantly, the reforms in this bill will require landlords who are restructuring their mortgages to maintain their property as section 8 housing throughout the life of the mortgage. This provision is particularly important in ensuring the preservation of the existing stock of section 8 housing. 
The mark-to-market reforms included in this bill could affect five Rhode Island housing developments in the near term, and could affect countless other developments in the future, as these provisions are fully implemented by HUD. Overall, I believe these reforms will improve the quality of life for tenants of section 8 housing, half of whom are seniors, and most of whom are very low income. 
However, it should be noted that these reforms are not a panacea, and we should be mindful that there is much more to be done. For example, we must take steps to address the ever-worsening affordable housing crisis facing this Nation. Unfortunately, this bill follows HUD appropriations bills in recent years and fails to provide funds for new section 8 vouchers. Indeed, such funds have not been appropriated since 1993. 
Also, there is the issue of the term of section 8 contracts. In years past, section 8 contracts have had terms that ranged from 5 to 40 years, with budget authority being allocated in accordance with the terms of the contract. However, because of the adverse budgetary implications of providing long-term contracts, expiring contracts are now being renewed for 1-year terms which require annual appropriations. These 1-year renewals have created a great degree of uncertainty among tenants of section 8 housing who are being notified annually by HUD that they may not have housing if Congress fails to provide section 8 funding. In a meeting with constituents, I was informed that some seniors who are residents of section 8 housing have suffered strokes and other ailments after being notified that their housing was in jeopardy if Congress failed to appropriate funding for section 8 renewals. Mr. President, this is a very serious issue which must be addressed. 
While HUD is required to notify tenants about contract renewals, something must be done to ensure that this notification does not unnecessarily alarm seniors and other residents of section 8 housing. I understand that HUD is currently working with a number of tenant groups to craft a notification letter that is less alarming than letters in years past. I intend to work with HUD to see that future notices provide adequate information, without unnecessarily alarming section 8 residents. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that this bill increases funding relative to fiscal year 1997 for a number of important programs to Rhode Island. For example, funding for the Community Development Block Grant Program, which provides flexible funding to States and localities for community development initiatives, is increased by $75 million. In fiscal year 1997, Rhode Island cities used over $20 million in CDBG money to fund initiatives ranging from job training to neighborhood revitalization. 
In addition, funding for the HOME Program, which is aimed at expanding the supply of affordable housing, is increased by $100 million over fiscal year 1997. Last year, Rhode Island received $3 million in HOME funding which was used to provide 283 units of affordable housing. 
Finally, the VA-HUD appropriations bill maintains level funding for a number of important programs such as the section 202 and section 811 programs that provide housing for the Nation's elderly and disabled. A number of Rhode Island groups have successfully used section 202 and section 811 grants to build housing for the elderly and disabled, ameliorating the shortage of affordable housing for these groups in Rhode Island. 
In conclusion, I would again like to commend the work of the conferees. Their efforts will help preserve and maintain the section 8 program, in addition to a number of other important housing and community development programs.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of meaningful campaign finance reform. In particular, in support of the McCain-Feingold bill. I want to commend those two Senators for their excellent work and their unflinching efforts to bring this measure to a vote. I also want to rise in opposition to the proposed Lott amendment. It is an amendment that is clearly a poison pill designed not to do anything other than derail meaningful campaign finance reform. This is the conclusion of all observers who have looked at this carefully--Common Cause, the League of Women Voters, editorial pages in the New York Times and Washington Post. Political scientist Norman Ornstein said, `A vote for the Lott amendment is a direct move to kill reform.' Rather than killing reform, we should be embracing it today, in terms of the Feingold-McCain legislative initiative. 
In 1884, the Supreme Court gave us the task of protecting the electoral system. In the words of the opinion in Ex Parte Yarborough, they said Congress has `the authority to protect the elective process against two great natural and historical enemies of all republics, open violence and insidious corruption.' 
What we are witnessing today in our electoral process encompasses this form of insidious corruption--not specific misdemeanors, or infractions, but a system in which the American people are losing faith and confidence, that they are seeing their system transform from one in which free elections are based on the merits of the candidates to one which they perceive is based upon simply the sheer volume of cash that flows into the system. This corrupting influence is weakening our ability to govern and the confidence of the people in our motives and indeed in our actions. 
Ninety-two percent of Americans think that too much money is spent on campaigns; 89 percent want fundamental change in the campaign finance system; 85 percent believe special interests have more influence than the voters; 69 percent believe that public officials are indifferent to their views, their concerns, their needs; 51 percent believe that quite a few Government officials are corrupt. 
If that is not evidence of insidious corruption, then I don't know what is. Perhaps other evidence might be the fact that people are no longer participating in the most meaningful way a citizen can participate, by voting. We have seen voter participation plummet. In 1996, voter turnout was below 50 percent, which is the lowest since the early 1920's. Fewer people volunteer to participate as volunteers on campaigns, as canvassers, as public-spirited citizens who want to be involved in the Government. The most frequently cited reason for people not actively engaging as candidates is the fact that they can't raise the enormous amounts of money that they perceive is essential to becoming part of the American political process. 
All of this argues, I think, eloquently and decisively for fundamental campaign finance reform. But what is happening today in this amendment is an attempt to throttle the views of working men and women throughout this country. And at the same time, protect and enshrine the right of the few to give very, very much to political campaigns. 
That, I think, is another example of how the system has gone haywire and askew. Six hundred thousand people contributed over $200 in Federal campaigns in 1996. That represents .31 percent of eligible voters. Of those individuals that gave over $1,000, 237,000 Americans, .12 percent of eligible donors. Those individuals who gave the maximum amount under Federal law to Federal candidates, $25,000, in the entire United States, 126--an infinitesimal fraction. That is what this argument is about today in many respects. It is to allow those individuals to give directly and indirectly unlimited sums to the political process and to further erode confidence in our Government. At the same time, the Lott amendment would circumscribe the ability of working men and women to make small, routine contribution through political action committees. 
The sum of all this is that we need fundamental reform. The Feingold-McCain bill presents such reform. It would ban soft money to national political parties as well as the use of soft money by State parties to impact Federal elections. It would eliminate the abuse of issue ads. The last election cycle saw an explosion of issue ads, ads in which candidates were beaten about the head and shoulders regularly, not by their opponent, but by groups that rose up suddenly and put ads on television and departed just as quickly.

Mr. REED. The Feingold-McCain bill would also strengthen disclosure in election law. It would provide for strict codification of the Beck decision, not circumscribe and prevent 
labor from participating in elections, but codify the Supreme Court decision, allowing the notification of the use of funds for political purposes by unions and also reduction for those individual members who object to such uses. Also, it will put limits on party assistance of wealthy candidates and the ban of foreign money into American campaigns. This is fundamental, necessary reform of our campaign system. I argue in fact that as worthy as these reforms are, we would have to go further. But today at least let us take the step forward for this sensible, moderate balanced reform, which the American people are demanding. 
There are States in this country that have taken the step, have gone much further and passed expenditure caps on campaigns, that are experimenting with other ways in which they want the issues to be decided by candidates based upon their positions, not by campaign committees based on their balances in their checking accounts. We should take the step forward today. We should in fact resist the Lott amendment, which would derail meaningful campaign finance reform. We should rather urge that we, as the Senate of this great country, proudly step forth and endorse meaningful campaign finance reform. Many years ago, in 1914, the New England poet Robert Frost wrote: `Good fences make good neighbors.' 
Well, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, when it comes to campaign finance reform, all our fences are down. They have been demolished by a flood of cash running into elections. Unless we build good, strong fences, we can't be good neighbors or good candidates or indeed good citizens. We need to reform our campaign finance system, we need to begin today by defeating the Lott amendment and moving forward to pass the McCain-Feingold legislation. 
I yield the balance of my time.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Hagel in introducing the Small Business Banking Act of 1997, legislation that eliminates a Depression-era Federal law prohibiting banks from paying interest on commercial checking accounts. This legislation represents an important victory for small business and the banking industry because it eliminates a costly and burdensome Federal prohibition that has outlived its usefulness. 
The prohibition against the payment of interest on commercial accounts was originally part of a broad prohibition on the payment of interest on any deposit account. At the time of enactment, it was the popular view that payment of interest on deposits created an incentive for rural banks to shift deposits of excess funds to urban money center banks that made loans that fueled speculation. Moreover, it was believed that such transfers created liquidity crises in rural communities. However, a number of changes in the banking system since enactment of the prohibition have called into question its usefulness. 
First, with the passage of the Depository Institutions Deregulatory and Monetary Control Act of 1980, Congress allowed financial institutions to offer interest-bearing accounts to individuals--a change which has not adversely affected safety and soundness. Second, a number of banks have developed complex mechanisms called sweep accounts to circumvent the interest rate prohibition. Because of the costs associated with developing sweep accounts, however, large banks have become the primary offerors of these accounts. As a result, many smaller banks are at a competitive disadvantage with larger banks that can offer their commercial depositors interest-bearing accounts. Most important, the vast majority of small businesses cannot afford to utilize sweep accounts because the cost of opening these accounts is relatively high and most small businesses do not have a large enough deposit base to justify these costs. 
In light of these developments, it has become clear that the prohibition on interest-bearing commercial accounts is nothing more than a relic of the Depression era that has effectively disadvantaged small businesses and small banks, and led large banks to dedicate significant resources to circumventing the prohibition. I am, therefore, pleased to cosponsor this legislation that will eliminate this prohibition and level the playing field for small banks and small business.

Mr. REED. I thank the Chair. 
I rise to express my support for the defense appropriations conference agreement, and I commend my colleagues, particularly Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, for their great work on this measure. 
I am particularly pleased that an important provision in the conference report is language which will allow Newport News and Electric Boat, this country's only two manufacturers of submarines, to team together to design and build the next generation of attack submarines. Without this language, these shipyards and our submarine program could be endangered. With this language, however, we will continue to build the Navy's most valuable weapon, a silent and very effective submarine. Work will commence on the new attack submarines, which will boast great stealth and great strength with advanced war-fighting capabilities, yet will be smaller, more flexible and more cost effective. 
This teaming agreement will preserve America's vital submarine industry base, which encompasses over 3,000 high-technology companies in 44 States. This conference report brings us one step closer to ensuring that the United States continues to maintain the finest submarine force in the world. 
Since the first day I arrived in Congress, there has been a strong debate over the future of the U.S. naval submarine program. There are those who believe that the era of the submarine ended with the end of the cold war. But a majority of my colleagues and I believe that our submarine fleet needs to be maintained and modernized and that it will serve us as well in the future as it has in the past. 
In a time when the mission of our armed services is constantly changing and a threat could emerge anywhere in the world, we need such flexibility. I think it is fitting to note the comments of our respected Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John Shalikashvili, on the eve of his retirement. General Shalikashvili said, `Submarines are an integral part of U.S. global influence and presence. Their stealth and endurance provide the unified commander enormous capabilities across the full spectrum of conflict.' 
I believe that the provisions in this defense appropriations agreement indicate that the submarine has proven itself. This legislation allocates scarce defense dollars to build up the submarine industrial base, to procure new torpedoes, to procure new submarine periscopes, and to assure excellent training programs for our submarine crews. This agreement will provide funding for the completion of the Seawolf program and for the first new attack submarine. 
This report shows support for the submarine procurement program as well as a logical and cost-effective way to harness the expertise and skill of our Nation's submarine builders. 
I would like particularly to again thank Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye for their continued support, Senator Warner for his efforts on the committee, and all of those who have played a critical role in ensuring that our submarine fleet will continue to be the finest in the world, that our sailors will go forth with the best ships in the world and that with their service and these ships we will continue to protect America and defend our principles. 
I thank the Senator for the time. I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. REED. I yield myself such time, under the control of Senator Kennedy, as I may consume. 
I rise this afternoon in opposition to the Coats-Lieberman amendment. I have sensed from the comments of the Senator from Indiana and the Senator from Connecticut that they, too, share our mutual frustration with the status of public schools in the United States and particularly in the District of Columbia. That frustration is forcing us to look at ways in which we can improve education because we believe it is so vitally important to the future of the young people of America and indeed to the very success of America in the future. 
I don't think this frustration should cloud our vision as to what we are doing if we would adopt an amendment such as is proposed today. I believe it would represent an abandonment of public education, not a reform of public education. I feel very strongly that our first commitment should be to a strong system of public education throughout this Nation, that we should be seeking to make school reform and excellent schools the right of every child and not just those who may be fortunate enough to receive some type of voucher to leave the system. 
Indeed, we can ask ourselves, even if this measure should pass and 2,000 children would leave the public education system in the District of Columbia, what about the thousands of children remaining? What have we done to make their lives better and their education better? I don't think we can save a few and sacrifice the many. I think what we have to do is sit down, conscientiously and cooperatively, and reform public education, not abandon it. 
Now, the District of Columbia, as we all know, has stark educational needs. Their class year was delayed for days and days and days, not because of anything more complicated than the fact that the buildings were in disrepair. Yet, rather than investing in roofs or boilers or those items that would actually put children literally into the classroom, we are now debating a voucher bill that would take some of those resources that could be available for these activities and disburse them to private education. Indeed, I believe we have a special obligation here in the Nation's Capital to ensure that the schools are the best in the country. However, we are not talking about that today. Instead, we are talking about allowing 2,000 students to leave that system, rather than talking about how we can make every school in the District of Columbia the best in this country and in the world, and how we can give every child in the District of Columbia the chance to succeed educationally so that they can succeed in life. 
The amendment offered by Senators Coats and Lieberman brings the issue of the quality of education, particularly education in many of our urban areas, clearly into focus. For that, we thank them. It is a crisis we must address, but a crisis that I believe is not solved by vouchers. Vouchers would take the limited resources necessary to improve, reform, and reinvigorate public education and, instead, allow some students to leave the system.  
Indeed, as part of this amendment which is being debated today there is absolutely no requirement that schools accepting the vouchers would also have to accept the great task of public education, which is to educate all students regardless of their abilities, regardless of their proficiency in the English language, regardless of discipline problems or troubles they may have. This is the task we set for public education. That is not the task that is frequently embraced or supported by private education. 
In Cleveland, which has a voucher program, no students with disabilities are served. 1,460 students, nearly half of those that were given the vouchers, could not even find a private school that would accept them. The essence of a private school very clearly is they get to reject students, and they get to reject them on very subjective grounds. That is the nature of private education. That does not apply, obviously, to public education. Public education not only must accept every child but has a moral and legal requirement to serve those children as best they can. And that is a significant difference. 
Private education works very, very well. It has provided good education to many Americans. I was a student in parochial schools in Rhode Island. But one thing that was true then and is true now when I talk to parents is that, if your child has a particular difficulty or disability, if your child needs enhanced care, specialized attention, the first choice is specifically the public schools because the public school not only has the obligation but will make available those resources as best they can. And, once again, in the arena of private schools it is not because of any ill-will but simply because of the fact that they just do not have to do that. 
So we are talking about a system in which there is not equality, not equality admission, and in many cases not equality of resources either. 
We have to support the mission of public education in the United States, and it is not just about training workers for the world economy. It is not just preparing young people to engage in the technologically challenging world of the next century. It is also about Americans, because one of the hallmarks of our country has always been that we have a system of public education that is a common ground for the American people--that children of all races, children of different national heritage, children of different religious convictions can come and be educated in a place that emphasizes not their differences but their common status as citizens of this great Republic. 
We are in danger perhaps of losing that. We are in danger because there is a great deal of skepticism about the effectiveness of public education in the United States. And, looking at the record, one should be skeptical. But we should not respond to that skepticism and that frustration today by turning our back on public education. Rather, we should look at the way we can make public education better for all students. What we should be thinking about and talking about and enacting is tough academic standards in public education. 
How do we involve parents and the community more deeply and more intimately in the lives and schools in the neighborhood? How do we make schools safe and drug free? How do we bring technology into every classroom? And how do we ensure that every classroom is a place that is structurally sound, clean, and creates an environment where young people want to learn and want to strive to get ahead? 
The notion of school choice in the public education system is a good one. Parents should have some flexibility within the public system to pick out charter schools, magnet schools, or special schools. Those types of schools help stimulate innovation and improvement in the public system. 
In my home State of Rhode Island we are fortunate to have several different schools, particularly at the secondary level which draw on the special talents and special skills of the 
students and which give parents and students a choice. But when we start moving away from that system of public education into funded private education, funded now by these vouchers, we are stepping across a boundary which I think we will regret because inevitably we will be pulling resources away from the needed improvements and reforms in public education, and we will see our schools deteriorate even further. 
There is a better way to reform education. 
If you look at schools which have the same basic demographic characteristics, one of the most persuasive comments that I have seen is that the difference in performance between a good school and a bad school is most accounted for by the qualifications of their teachers. We are not talking about dealing with that issue of teacher preparation here today. We are skirting it, where, in fact, I think if we have scarce Federal dollars, and, indeed, we do have scarce Federal dollars in every category of expenditures, we have to look at where we can get our best value. And it is not balanced. It would be better spent, I feel, in improving the quality of teaching in our public schools. 
I introduced legislation--the Teacher Excellence in America Challenge Act, the TEACH Act--which would turn around the model of professional development and training in the United States to provide for better teachers. This legislation is based upon an extensive study by the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, which contains some disheartening statistics about the quality and preparation of teachers in America. 
Over 12 percent of newly hired teachers have no training; 23 percent of all secondary teachers do not have even a minor in their main teaching field; and in schools with the highest minority enrollment, students have less than a 50 percent chance of getting a science or mathematics teacher who holds a license and degree in his or her field of teaching. 
These are the real problems of public education. These problems have to be addressed. And we can address them, and we must address them. If we do that we will be on much firmer ground in improving public education. 
What is the price tag, as estimated by the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, for improving the quality of teachers throughout this country? It is over $4 billion. It may seem inconsequential today. We are debating a very small program with respect to the District of Columbia. 
But we need all the resources we can to meet the greater challenge of preparing our teachers and the greater challenge of simply ensuring that school buildings are suitable and safe for children. 
To turn away from these challenges and to adopt this amendment is, I believe, the wrong approach. 
I believe we have a lot to do to improve public education. We have the necessary task ahead of us to improve teaching, to improve the school environment, and to challenge schools with demanding standards. 
I also hope that this body will adopt a national evaluation system so that schools know where they stand, and so that when we talk about how well a school is doing it is not just anecdotal, but we will actually know how well they are doing. 
In fact, I hope that the national evaluations would be participated in by both public and private schools so we can make a judgment about how well the public schools are doing versus private schools. I think we would be a bit surprised. I think we would find despite the disparagement, despite the criticism, despite the constant bombardment against public education, that it would stand up very well. But we all can do better, and we all must do better. 
The dollars that we are talking about today are important. They should be applied to provide every student in the District of Columbia with a chance--not 2,000 lucky students--but every student in the District of Columbia. They should be focused not on retreating from our commitment to public education but to 
reaffirming it by assuring every child in this District, and we hope in this country, will have a good, safe school building; they will have well-prepared and motivated teachers; they will have textbooks that are current; and, they will have the chance to use all their talents not only for their own success but ultimately for the great success of this Nation. 
I yield my time.

Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise today to address S. 830, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act of 1997. This is an important bill with serious implications for the health of the American people. 
The FDA is responsible for assuring that the Nation's food supply is pure and healthy as well as providing a guarantee that drugs and medical devices are safe and effective. The FDA has an immense impact on the lives of all Americans. Few government agencies provide this kind of important protection for the American people. Indeed, the FDA's mandate requires it to regulate over one-third of our Nation's products. Daily, the FDA faces the delicate balance between ensuring that patients have swift access to new drugs and devices, while guaranteeing that those new products are safe and effective.

Mr. REED. I thank the Senator. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, we debated this morning the Reed amendment, which would give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to look behind the labeled use in evaluating a class 1 or class 2 medical device before that device would be sold on the marketplace. My amendment is very simple. It would allow the FDA, if they felt the label was misleading or false, to ask for additional information with respect to possible uses other than the labeled use. This is consistent with their current practice. And it would protect the public health dramatically. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment. 
I heard opposition on the floor this morning to the amendment--first, not so much opposition but an attempt to diminish the importance of this amendment by saying, `Well, class 1 and 2 devices are just simple little medical devices. They are low-risk medical devices.' I don't know about you. But, like many Americans, I think the definition of a low-risk medical device is a device that is being put into someone else's body, not my own. Because, if there is any type of device that is coming into a person's body, they expect and anticipate that the FDA would thoroughly review it, ask all the questions, and look at all the possible uses that are reasonably discernible from the device itself. 
The other objection which has been made to the amendment is that it is unnecessary because the FDA can step in and ask for this type of information. But, in fact, that is not the case. 
As some have explained here today, there is a two-prong test to get 501(k) approval under current. First, the device must be substantially equivalent to another device already on the market, and this device performs essentially the same task that the other device does. If there are technological differences in the device, then the FDA can make an evaluation of this technology to determine its effectiveness. 
But all of these different tests collapse into one point. The question is, what is the device being used for? 
That is where the current language in the bill is so restrictive of FDA responsibility and the obligation we expect them to discharge. Because, according to the language in the bill, the FDA and the Secretary of HHS reviewing any of these proposals could only do so with respect to the intended use of the device based on the intended use included in the proposed labeling of the device. 
You have to evaluate these devices for safety and health, and efficacy based upon some use. And if the FDA is restricted solely to the use indicated on the label, then they will not be able to look behind the label to other possible uses--look beyond the label to other possible ways--in which the device could be used and ask for supporting data to justify those uses. 
We have seen and heard examples today on the floor with respect to biopsy needles, with respect to lasers, with respect to a host of very important medical devices. The American public I hope would demand that these devices be evaluated thoroughly for all reasonable uses--not only the use that a manufacturer would suggest as a way to take advantage of this expedited procedure for review and entry into the marketplace. 
One does not have to repute ill will or bad motives to the manufacturers of these devices. Simply stated, they have a tremendous incentive to get these items into the marketplace. Once they are in the marketplace, there are different uses that could be promoted. 
Also, in terms of marketing, there are scores of salesmen and women who are zealous in trying to promote these goods. They might not be as scrupulous with respect to these uses as intended by the manufacturer. 
All of these factored together suggest strongly that if we do not initially have a good approval process which allows the Food and Drug Administration to look behind the label, to look at likely uses other than the ones presented by the company, we could run the 
risk of introducing medical devices into the marketplace that would be harmful to the American public. 
We have made great progress on this legislation. We have done so because we all feel sincerely that our chief responsibility is to protect the public health. My amendment would do so. 
My amendment would give the FDA the authority to request additional safety information in the rare circumstances in which they have suspicions that the labeled use is either false or misleading. The FDA could look behind that label and require additional data before they would release a device onto the marketplace. 
I hope that we all support this concept. I hope we can all rally around the principle that when in doubt, and when confused about the different interpretations of various sections, that we will ultimately allow the FDA to use its judgment and its discretion to protect the public health of the American people. 
I yield our time.

Mr. REED. I concur with the Senator's notion that the FDA could look at safety and effectiveness but the critical question is safety and effectiveness to do what? To do what the labeled use is or to do something else. And the language of the bill restricts the answer to that question, to do what, statutorily to simply say whatever the company puts into the label. And that seems to be the crux of this debate. Yes, they can look at safety and effectiveness; yes, they can look at technological change, but only in the context of what the company purports in the label to say is the intended use. They can't look beyond it. 
I yield back to the Senator from Massachusetts.

Mr. REED. We have made great progress with respect to the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] bill. That is a tribute to Chairman Jeffords and the ranking member, Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts, and all the members of the committee and the Members of the Senate participating in this debate. 
However, there remains at least one issue of concern, one issue that was a subject of extensive debate today. That issue is a provision regarding the 510(k) approval process for class I and class II devices. As I mentioned previously, these class I and class II devices are serious medical devices. This is not a Band-Aid or gauze. These are lasers or biopsy needles or many other complicated, necessary medical devices. 
As a result, we cannot, I think, assume that this is a small or inconsequential issue we are debating. It is a very important issue. 
Essentially, the legislation that is before the Senate today limits the FDA from looking behind the stated use on the label presented by the manufacturer when they request approval to put a new product on the market. It is important, in certain cases, to make such a searching review beyond the proposed use by the manufacturer. It is particularly important in the case where there is strong suspicion that the label is either misleading or fraudulent or false. Although my amendment was not favorably considered earlier today, it would have given the authority to the FDA to look beyond the label in cases where they could show--and this is a very high standard of proof--that the label was false or misleading. 
There is no other provision in this new legislation that would give the FDA such authority. Indeed, one could ask why the proponents of this legislation deliberately chose to remove the FDA's authority and to effectively prevent the FDA from conducting a thorough review of medical devices as they come on the market. 
I have outlined, as many of my colleagues have, the detailed reaction of several sections of the FDA law. It is complicated, arcane legislative language. 
I have tried to think of a more homely and mundane example which might illustrate the dilemma the FDA would be facing as it contemplates this new legislation. If the FDA were in the position of not approving medical devices but approving, for example, land transportation vehicles, they might be confronted with an existing model, perhaps a Ford Mustang. And say, for example, a new product such as an F-16 fighter plane is presented for review. Both can move over the ground, both of them are fairly fast, and both of them have certain similar aerodynamic capacities. Both of them can carry passengers. So one could make the argument that the F-16 could be substantially equivalent in use as a ground transportation vehicle. 
But I think anyone would have to say, upon looking at both of these devices, that there is a strong suggestion the F-16 can be used for something else. If the FDA, or in this example, the hypothetical agency, did not have the authority to ask the simple question: Will it be used to fly and can it fly? The hypothetical agency may not be doing the job. 
That is a homely example to illustrate that the FDA is frequently confronted with devices that are presented as being substantially equivalent to existing devices. These new devices may be similarly labeled to that existing device, but they have the potential for other uses. If it is obvious that the device is for uses not listed on the label, the FDA should have the authority to make an inquiry into those other uses. 
In fact, my suspicion is that in the development of new medical devices there is a long history of starts and stops. A history of contact with other individuals, many researchers working 
together, exploring different uses and alternatives, different materials. In that process, it is very likely that other issues are contemplated, evaluated and perhaps designed into the device. 
Today we have a system where there is more incentive for approaching the FDA with a petition of a 510(k) approval because that is the fastest way to the marketplace. Even if there were uses that were discussed and contemplated, even if there are obvious uses that might become part of common practice, those may be dismissed in order to get this through the system quickly. 
What we have done today by not adopting my amendment is effectively prohibit the FDA from making that searching inquiry into possible uses. The consequences can be severe to the public health. 
Despite all of these issues we have discussed, this bill represents significant progress on many fronts. We are very, very close. I hope in the ensuing conference--or before we go to conference--that we could address this particular issue. It is an issue that has been highlighted by Secretary Shalala. It has been highlighted with respect to the potential for a Presidential veto. I hope we don't reach that point. 
The hard work that has been done over many months by my colleagues, the hard work of many representatives of the industry, and the hard work of public health advocates I think will lead us, if we can get over this hurdle, to a bill that we will all be proud of. 
In conclusion, today we have spent some time discussing the industry. We have spent some time discussing the FDA. There have been criticisms by Members with respect to both the industry and the FDA. Our job at this point is not to demonize or deify anyone. It is to get good laws passed. I believe this legislation can be approved and can succeed. 
I note the majority leader is standing by, and I yield back my time.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, today we are debating very important legislation, important for the country in the reformation and reauthorization programs at the Food and Drug Administration. Particularly important in this legislation is the prescription drug user fee program, which has proven to be a remarkable achievement that has speeded the approval of drugs, getting these necessary medicines to the American public.

Mr. REED. I thank the Chair. 
I rise in strong support of the arts. Earlier this afternoon, we were able to fend off a frontal asault on the National Endowment by the Ashcroft amendment. Today we are debating two amendments that would also do great damage to the National Endowment for the Arts. 
I come to this position with I think a very special standing because I have succeeded Senator Claiborne Pell, who was one of the architects of the National Endowment for the Arts. Senator Pell recognized that centuries from now this Nation would be recognized far more for its contribution to the human spirit than perhaps anything else. And through his efforts, the National Endowment was created and through the efforts of the National Endowment theater, ballet, and opera has spread throughout this country. 
One of the fallacies I think that is found in the argument of my colleagues is that the States are quite capable of doing this, they are ready to do this. But the reality is that before the National Endowment for the Arts there was not much art throughout many parts of this country, that there were not as there is today opera companies throughout America and theater companies. In fact, if the National Endowment for the Arts is eliminated, if this is put into a block grant, I fear, and I think I fear with very, very good evidence, that what will happen is a shriveling of the arts in America. 
Many of us have been in State government. We know that there is no monopoly on great wisdom or aesthetic sensibility at the State level, no more so than at the Federal level. We know that this money might be ill used. But we also know that it will be subject to a much more narrower and parochial focus. We have within the National Endowment a national vision, a national vision, though, that acts through local individuals, and that is what is critical also. 
The National Endowment is not running a great national theater here in Washington exclusively. But what it is doing is reaching into every corner of America and giving people an opportunity to appreciate and participate in the arts. In my home State of Rhode Island, we have theater companies that are supported by the NEA. We have educational programs that allow young children to witness the arts. Indeed, the first time I ever saw a play was as a grammar school student in Cranston, RI, when I went to see the Trinity Repertory Company, supported by the National Endowment, by Federal support, put on `Saint Joan' by George Bernard Shaw. That was a moving experience. And that experience is replicated every day throughout this country because of the National Endowment. 
In addition to contributing to the artistic quality of America, this agency has generated tremendous economic development and progress throughout the country. In my own State, its contribution to the arts has been multiplied in terms of the economic effect. Providence, particularly, has become a city that is proud of our arts, that has thriving companies that need the National Endowment, not just for aesthetic reasons but for good, solid economic reasons. And by eliminating the National Endowment, or by block granting its funds, we will, I think, dissipate that energy, that enthusiasm, and that achievement we have seen today. 
The arts are not only a source of pleasure, but in many cases a source of great economic progress, particularly in my home State of Rhode Island. So, for many, many reasons, I believe that these amendments, while well intentioned, will undercut what is a strong national policy to support the arts.

Mr. REED. I would say you have trotted out some impressive statistics about income as a measure of the wealth of these artistic enterprises like the Metropolitan, but the other side of the equation is their cost. Many of these institutions, even the famous ones, find it very difficult to make ends meet.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, the National Endowment for the Arts has served this Nation well for many, many years. There are things that we can do to improve its performance, but the wholesale scuttling of the National Endowment would, I think, be a mistake. I believe that we can make improvements but we cannot give up the vision of a national agency which reaches into every corner of this country to encourage and inspire the artistic excellence of the American people. By supporting the NEA, we can accomplish that. I believe these amendments would disrupt that support, and, therefore, I oppose them and request that my colleagues oppose them. 
I yield back my time.

Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding time. Very briefly, what we have done in the overall FDA law is create an incentive for companies, under section 510(k) to get approval of class I and II devices, to go out and pick out existing devices and say the new device is substantially equivalent. This, I think, provides pressure for companies to go out and simply say we are going to do exactly what these other devices do, even though their new design might have many more capabilities. This is not an academic problem. 
Take, for example, the issue of a biopsy needle. Typically these needles are very small. They remove a very small amount of tissue, about the size of a pencil tip. If the FDA was presented with a new biopsy needle that was claimed to be simply for biopsy of tissue but in fact removed 50 times that amount of tissue, a much, much larger bit of tissue, the suspicion would be that this is not just for biopsies, it's actually to remove the lesion. Yet under this law, today, as we speak, they could not look behind that claim on the label. They could not look behind it and say, give us some data about the removal of lesions. This is a serious public health problem. That is what we are addressing today. I hope, with Senator Kennedy's direction and leadership, we can resolve this along with Senator Jeffords and his colleagues. I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, last November, the people of Rhode Island gave me the great honor of succeeding one of this Chamber's true giants: Senator Claiborne Pell. Throughout his years of service, Senator Pell committed himself to increasing access to education and, fittingly, his name has become synonymous with the fight to open the doors of higher education to all of our Nation's citizens, regardless of income. 
Senator Pell also dedicated himself to increasing access to the arts for all Americans, regardless of an individual's or a community's wealth. He recognized the power of the arts to inspire people of all ages, through national and local exhibitions as well as arts education. With his wise and steadfast leadership, Congress made a commitment to advancing these aims, creating a National Endowment for the Arts. 
I am proud to follow in Senator Pell's footsteps in supporting the NEA and a strong Federal commitment to the arts. Across the country and in my home State of Rhode Island, the arts enhance our culture and strengthen our economy. 
The events of recent years in Rhode Island's capital city of Providence are a testament to the power of the arts. The last half decade has seen the revitalization of Providence's downtown area. One major factor in this rebirth has been the emergence of Waterplace Park, which uses architecture to take advantage of the Woonasquatucket and Providence Rivers' natural beauty. This summer, with NEA support, the WaterFire exhibition was introduced to the park. In the few short months since its installation, this artistic display has already encouraged thousands of Rhode Islanders to rediscover Providence's treasures. 
The arts have also contributed to Providence's revival in other ways. Institutions like the recently renovated Providence Performance Arts Center and Trinity Repertory Company, both of which receive NEA support, provide our State's residents with opportunities to see well-renown and innovative theatrical works. In addition, the passage of new tax incentives for artists residing in downtown Providence has attracted a vibrant and increasingly active artistic community to the city. Taken together, these developments led USA Today to name Providence a `Renaissance City' in 1996. 
The Federal investment in the NEA is minimal. The $100 million this bill would provide for the NEA, for which I commend the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee, represents less than 40 cents for each of our Nation's citizens. 
But with this tiny investment, the NEA does great things, offering our Nation's citizens increased access to all forms of the arts. In my State, the NEA supports not only theatrical productions, but also the work of the Children's Museum of Rhode Island, the youth concerts given by the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra, and the interactive 
music program that Rhode Island Hospital offers to its patients. In my hometown of Cranston, the NEA supports the annual Labor and Ethnic Heritage Festival, which brings people of diverse backgrounds together to celebrate and learn about each others' traditions and cultures. 
These programs reach a wide range of Rhode Islanders, but even those who choose not to participate in these events benefit from NEA support and our State's vibrant arts communities. There is a close relationship between the arts in Rhode Island and economic growth. 
Working closely with the NEA, the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts supports many arts organizations, social service organizations conducting arts programs, and arts educators. One of the Rhode Island Council's funding categories, which supports 26 of the State's largest arts organizations, is known as general operating support. In 1995-96, the council's grants in this category totaled $355,000, with an average grant size of $10,000. 
For this investment of $355,000, the State of Rhode Island saw an enormous return. The 26 general operating support organizations directly contributed more than $24 million into the Rhode Island economy. More than 1.1 million people attended these organizations' programs last year, further spurring the economy. Using modest Department of Commerce multipliers, these figures suggest that the activities of the general operating support organizations alone contributed a total of more than $97 million to Rhode Island's economy last year. The figure for all arts organizations would be even greater. 
These impressive findings are repeated on a national scale. Recent studies have shown that the national nonprofit arts industry generates some $36.8 billion annually in economic activity; supports 1.3 million jobs; and produces $790 million in local government revenue and $1.2 billion in State revenue. For each dollar the NEA invests in communities, there is a twentyfold return in jobs, services, and contracts. Without question, this is a wise investment of our resources. 
We must also recognize the importance of national leadership in the arts, which only a strong, sufficiently funded National Endowment can provide. As my colleague from Utah, Mr. Bennett, noted yesterday, the NEA's seal of approval helps countless organizations across the country to raise matching funds from private sources to support the arts. 
In addition, by identifying arts education and increased access to the arts as its priorities, the NEA has promoted these issues nationwide. In recent years, we have seen a resurgence of our commitment to include the arts in elementary and secondary school curricula in Rhode Island, largely spurred by the NEA's emphasis on how exposure to the arts helps young people to grow more proficient in all subjects. 
I am proud to serve on the Labor and Human Resources Committee, which has examined many of these issues. I am also proud to be a cosponsor of S. 1020, which the committee passed earlier this year by a bipartisan 14-to-4 vote. S. 1020 reauthorizes and continues to reform the NEA, while maintaining a strong Federal commitment to the agency and its ideals. I look forward to the consideration of this important legislation on the Senate floor. 
Standing on this floor 32 years ago, Senator Pell observed that `the arts throughout history have greatly enriched all truly worthwhile civilizations. The arts can put into tangible form the highest of man's creative ideas, so that they may become permanently memorable.' 
Today, I wish to echo Senator Pell's wise counsel. I urge my colleagues to support the NEA at the funding level requested by the subcommittee and to preserve a strong Federal commitment to the arts.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, we all recognize the need for qualified, well-trained and dedicated teachers to improve the education of students throughout the United States. Unfortunately, many students who are just returning from their summer vacations are entering classrooms where teachers have not been so prepared, who are not as qualified as they should be, and this, of course, impacts tremendously on the productivity and the excellence of American education. 
Today I am introducing legislation which I believe will change fundamentally the way teachers are trained and, thus, improve the quality of teaching in America's classrooms. This is absolutely critical, since over the next decade, 2 million new teachers will need to be hired. This is the result of a combination of retirements of existing teachers, together with the increase in student population which is taking place throughout the United States. 
Last year's report by the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future entitled, `What Matters Most: Teaching for America's Future', shed light on the disheartening state of the teaching profession in the United States: more than 12 percent of all newly hired teachers have no training whatsoever in educational technique and pedagogy; more than 14 percent enter the teaching profession without meeting State standards; 23 percent of all secondary teachers do not have even a minor in the main teaching field which they have been hired to perform, including more than 30 percent of mathematics teachers; and, in schools with the highest minority enrollments, students have less than a 50-percent chance of getting a science or mathematics teacher who holds a license and degree in the field which they are teaching. 
These findings were echoed also in `Quality Counts: A Report Card on the Condition of Public Education in the 50 States,' which was published this past January by Education Week. This report notes that on average, 4 out of 10 secondary teachers do not have a degree in the subjects they teach; there are too many unlicensed teachers in America's classrooms; and too few of our prospective teachers receive the high-quality education they need to be effective teachers. 
Overall, this report rated the States, and the average was C. No State received an A, and there were only eight B's: California, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Vermont. Three States received D's for their teaching: Arizona, Hawaii, and Idaho. And the rest, including my State of Rhode Island, received a gentleman's C, which in today's competitive world is unsatisfactory for the future of our country and the success of our children. 
It must be noted that teacher quality varies tremendously; that in different classrooms in the same schools, you will see outstanding teachers in one and less qualified teachers in another. Many students are taught by a qualified teacher who understands their subject and how to teach students to excel. But not all students are so fortunate. These students are being deprived essentially of the quality education they need because their teacher is not well prepared and not qualified. 
`What teachers know and do is the most important reflection on what students learn' is the first premise of the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future. 
Given the statistics I just recited about the current state of teaching in America, it is no wonder American students are failing to make the grade in a very competitive world. Indeed, a study which compared high- and low-achieving elementary schools with similar student characteristics found that more than 90 percent of the variation in achievement in math and reading was directly attributable to differences in the qualifications of the teachers in those schools. 
It is also no wonder that American students don't fare well in international comparisons. The results of the eighth-grade Third 
International Mathematics and Science Study found that these students barely scored above the world average in science and below the world average in mathematics. And today, being mediocre is insufficient in order to face the challenges of a very complex world. 
Even though much has been done to address teacher quality, the truth is that the current system of teacher preparation does not give teachers a fair chance at success. Prospective teachers, those in training in our Nation's teacher colleges, are not likely to be provided with the panoply of experiences which they need, such as actual classroom time, structured practice opportunities, a talented and experienced teacher as a mentor, and the skills to work with diverse student populations. 
These are the tools they need to be adequately prepared and, sadly, many do not receive this help while they are in teacher preparation. Indeed, as the 1996 report by the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future notes, traditional teacher education programs are failing because they are too short, too fragmented and they use textbooks rather than active hands-on teaching methods. They also neglect to develop some of the ideas and concepts that are critical to success, such as working in teams and using technology. 
Sadly, I believe there is a real disconnect between the teacher colleges that prepare teachers and the elementary and secondary schools that hire them to teach the children of America. Consequently, beginning teachers are thrown into classrooms without the skills to succeed. As Linda Darling-Hammond, the Executive Director of the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, writes, the message given to these teachers in the beginning of the school year is `Figure it out yourself. We'll see you in June. . .if you make it that long!' 
Due to this sink-or-swim method of teacher preparation, some teachers do not make it to June or survive past the first few years of teaching. As a USA Today article from earlier this year points out, 17 percent of new teachers leave the classroom after 1 year, and a 1987 study by Grissmer and Kirby estimated that 30 to 50 percent of new teachers leave the profession within 3 to 5 years. 
Add to this defection from the ranks of the profession the increased student enrollment due to the continuing Baby Boom Echo which will reach a record 52.2 million in 1997 and, indeed, increase each year through 2006, and impending retirements of many of our teachers. This situation creates a tremendous challenge and a need to prepare over 2 million new teachers to face the next century. 
The time is ripe to face this challenge. We must do so now before public support for education wanes. By enacting needed reforms and changes in how we prepare and continue the development of teachers, we can guarantee the success of both students and teachers. 
We must directly connect our teacher preparation and development system to our elementary and secondary schools. Our future teachers need and deserve the kind of hands-on training and `real world' experience they will get from more exposure and practice in today's classrooms, as well as the mentoring and assistance they will receive from our best and most experienced veteran teachers. My bill accomplishes this by fostering partnerships between the teacher colleges at our Nation's institutions of higher education and elementary and secondary schools. 
These partners should work in concert to prepare teachers adequately and keep their skills updated by working jointly to develop enhanced curricula and mentoring activities, as well as to research and implement sound teaching and learning practices. 
As Jerrald Shrive wrote in `Lessons from Restructuring Experiences: Stories of Change in Professional Development Schools':  
. . . educational partnerships and collaborations [between schools and universities] can be one significant piece of the actions necessary to move all of education to more productive levels. 
These premises underlie the legislation I introduce today. The Teacher Excellence in America Challenge Act or the TEACH Act, aims to improve the continuum of professional development from preservice preparation to the induction of new teachers to the improvement of veteran teachers, all of this designed to increase the achievement of our students. 
My legislation establishes a competitive 5-year grant program to provide grants to professional development partnerships consisting of institutions of higher education, public elementary and secondary schools, local educational agencies, and others, such as the State educational agency, teacher organizations, or nonprofit organizations. These partnerships must be based upon a mutual commitment to improve teaching and learning. 
These partnerships would use grant funding to support, as well as create, professional development schools, a reform that has been employed across this country and other industrialized nations and has shown success in increasing student achievement, better preparing prospective and beginning teachers, and providing critical ongoing opportunities for the professional development of veteran teachers. 
Professional development schools involve shared responsibility and cooperation between the institutions of higher education that prepare teachers and the public elementary and secondary schools that employ teachers, a system similar to teaching hospitals. 
An example of a professional development school can be found at the Sullivan School in Newport, RI. It is in a partnership with Salve Regina University. At the Sullivan School, Salve Regina students are given opportunities to practice teaching in a real classroom. Sullivan teachers are involved in observing these Salve Regina students, and they can also utilize the resources of Salve Regina University for professional development opportunities. Sullivan students go on field trips to Salve Regina for both higher education and career awareness activities, and the parents of these Sullivan students are also involved and are also provided opportunities for education and training. 
This is a model of one possible way to use professional development schools to enhance the preparation of teachers, the education of students, and the involvement of parents. 
Additional components of the TEACH Act include forging links between a university's school of education and their schools of arts and sciences. We have found in our discussions and research that many times within the university itself there is no collaboration, connection and concentration. This legislation will foster such cooperation. 
The TEACH Act also encourages the development of mentoring programs in which senior expert teachers would help younger teachers. It emphasizes technology training, which is a key piece now of higher education everywhere, and it recognizes that in order to be a good teacher, you have to have time to prepare to be a good teacher. It also would create a cadre of quality teachers that would act as a resource to enhance the professional development of all teachers and reestablishes principals as educational leaders. 
This is not a giveaway grant program. The TEACH Act offers resources to partnerships but it demands results. Strong evaluation provisions in the TEACH Act require that partnerships demonstrate increased student achievement, improved teacher preparation, increased opportunities for professional development, and also it insists that well-qualified teachers be placed in the classroom in order to continue to receive this grant funding. 
In addition, the legislation requires an independent national evaluation of the short-term and long-term impacts and outcomes of these professional development partnerships. 
Mr. President, given the growing need to update and improve the teacher training in this country, I expect we will see other proposals to address this problem offered in this body. I would be concerned if such proposals fell short on what we must accomplish by block granting training programs or failing to approach the kind of rigor that is included in the legislation I submit today. We have to have a rigorous and demanding legislative agenda in order to inspire and act as a catalyst for better teacher training across the country. Better teacher training will lead to better teachers. And better teachers will lead to better education and a better future for our children. 
My legislation puts us on track to answering the call of the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future to provide every student in America with access to competent, qualified, and dedicated teaching by the year 2006. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in this essential endeavor and to support the TEACH Act and help reform our system of teacher training as well as update the skills of teachers already in the classroom.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to offer an amendment with my Republican colleague from Maine on the Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Susan Collins, and we are joined by a host of other colleagues--Senator Kennedy, Senator Chafee, Senator Smith of Oregon, Senator Harkin, Senator Dodd, Senator Conrad, Senator Levin, Senator Kohl, Senator Wyden, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Murray, Senator Wellstone, Senator Bingaman, Senator Reid of Nevada, Senator Feingold, Senator Dorgan, Senator Torricelli, Senator Kerrey, Senator Johnson, and Senator Landrieu. I believe this indicates the widespread depth of concern and support for maintenance of the State Student Incentive Grant Program, or SSIG, as it is known. 
This is a remarkable program, which requires State governments to match Federal resources on a dollar-for-dollar basis and provides direct higher education grant assistance to needy students. I had originally intended to offer, along with my colleague Senator Collins, an amendment which would have restored SSIG funding to last year's level of $50 million, but out of deference to the subcommittee chairman and also because of a lack of sufficient offset, the amendment today adds back $35 million for SSIG with an offset of unobligated balances from prior years. 
In accepting this change, it is our intent to work with Chairman Specter and Senator Harkin, as they have agreed, to ensure that funding for SSIG, at no less than $35 million and hopefully even more, is secured during conference deliberations with the other body. 
Mr. President, I want to tell all of my colleagues why this amendment and saving student aid funding is so vitally important. 
SSIG is critical to higher education, critical to the dreams of more than 700,000 students across the Nation and 13,000 students just in my home State of Rhode Island alone. 
We are all familiar with another higher education grant, the Pell grant, and, as I think many in this Chamber, as well as students, parents, and those involved in higher education know, the purchasing power of the Pell grant has fallen drastically in comparison to inflation and the skyrocketing cost of college education. Students have searched for other sources of need-based higher education grants and have come to rely upon SSIG, the State Student Incentive Grant. 
With a relatively modest amount of Federal funding, this essential program encourages States to provide need-based financial aid to students in the form of grants and community service work study awards. 
SSIG grants are targeted to the neediest undergraduate and graduate students. The average family income for SSIG recipients in 1991-92 was approximately $12,000, which is below the Federal poverty level for a family of four. The average SSIG-supported grant was about $1,200 in 1995-96. This program reaches those families who are most desperately in need of support to send their children to college. 
Moreover, this program is extremely efficient. Every SSIG dollar goes to the students. These funds are not used in any way to cover administrative costs. 
With an SSIG expenditure at the Federal level of $63 million in fiscal year 1996, the program leveraged more than $784 million in State matching funds and served more than 700,000 students across America. In Rhode Island, an SSIG Federal expenditure of roughly $334,000 leveraged over $8 million in Rhode Island expenditures, serving more than 13,000 students. 
The history of this program is simple. Before its enactment 25 years ago, only 26 States provided need-based assistance to students. Now, all 50 States provide such assistance. 
While SSIG has been successful in increasing State aid, it is not true that it has outlived its usefulness. The statutory purpose of SSIG is not simply to start up State programs. Instead, its purpose is to encourage and assist States in making need-based grant and community service work-study awards to students. 
Indeed, if SSIG is eliminated, nine States, including Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, and Mississippi, could lose their entire grant program. In these States, SSIG funds represent 25 percent or more of their entire student grant program. It is unlikely they would sustain these programs without this Federal assistance and encouragement. In addition, if SSIG were eliminated, 43 States have already said they would reduce the number and amount of need-based grants, according to the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs. Thirteen States could face a 40-percent drop in funding for need-based grants, according to PIRG's Higher Education Project. 
Even with Federal funding, my home State of Rhode Island failed to maintain funding for the State grant program in 1993 and lost Federal SSIG funding. So Rhode Island, a State known for its commitment to education, also faces serious harm to its need-based program. 
How could SSIG have outlived its usefulness if States have already or are threatening to shut down student grant programs and cut student aid? 
Even the Appropriations Committee has noted that there is wisdom in maintaining funding for this program. In this Congress, the Senate will work on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which covers most higher education grants and loan programs including Pell grants and SSIG. During this reauthorization process, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, on which I serve, along with Senator Collins, will comprehensively review all higher education aid programs. Prior to the Labor Committee's work, I believe it would be inappropriate and unfair for Congress to eliminate a successful program like SSIG. It is a program that deserves support, but also deserves review, which it will receive in the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. 
It is also interesting to note that at a time when the majority party in this Congress is calling for more Federal money to be returned to the States, eliminating SSIG would end a successful program that gives States substantial flexibility and resources to help them help their citizens on to a better life. 
In addition, it is important to note in the recent budget, we have gone a long way in providing tax incentives to send young people to college, tax credits and deductions from taxes, but the people that are served by SSIG are those that cannot readily use the tax system to help their children go to college. In this way, SSIG is vitally important because it is a grant program directly to those low-income Americans that need a chance to share in the same opportunity that we have, in our wisdom, provided through the tax system to upper-income and middle-income Americans. 
Now, let me emphasize that SSIG is more important than ever as college costs continue to grow faster than income and grant aid, and as the grant-loan imbalance widens. In 1975, 80 percent of student aid came in the form of grants and 20 percent in the form of loans. Now, the opposite is true. 
Let me also add that low-income students are finding it particularly hard to afford higher education. Less than 50 percent of high school graduates with family incomes under $22,000 go on to college, while more than 80 percent of their higher income 
counterparts go on to pursue education beyond high school. Frankly, if we do not reverse this trend, if we do not let every segment of our society go on to higher education, we will continue to develop a bifurcation of our society and our economy as young people with a chance to go on to college gain skills that make them employable and, indeed, enhances their incomes and ability to seize all the opportunity in our society, while others are left out. We cannot let that happen. 
SSIG continues to make a difference for needy students in many States. However, I again remind my colleagues that nine States would likely end their grant programs without Federal encouragement and funding. Moreover, 43 States have said they would cut grants if SSIG were eliminated. 
Mr. President, we should be helping all our citizens achieve the American dream by ensuring access to higher education, especially for hard-working families whose wages have not kept up with inflation. 
Our amendment seeks to provide $35 million for SSIG. It is not a lot of money in a bill that contains more than $269 billion in funding, but it will make a huge difference to the students who rely upon it. 
This amendment, I understand, is agreeable to the chairman and the ranking member and they have committed to work with Senator Collins and myself to fight for this funding in conference.

Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding. 
Mr. President, over the past several months, we on the Labor Committee have been working diligently and effectively to try to create a Food and Drug Administration reform bill--a bill that truly balances the need for technological innovations and flexibility but that doesn't upset the fundamental obligations of the Food and Drug Administration to protect the public's health and safety. And we have made progress. 
We have to recognize that the purpose of this bill fundamentally is the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. That is the critical dimension that we are faced with. With the expiration of that authority at the end of this month or the beginning of the next fiscal year, we would lose a very valuable program, a program that has generally provided great success in speeding up approval, of ensuring that drugs are brought to the marketplace in a much more efficient and effective way. Linking the authorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act to the controversial FDA reform proposals may threaten many of the benefits of PDUFA--the acronym for the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. I hope that will not be the case. I hope we can work out some of these details and reach a suitable conclusion. 
Much of the credit is due to the leadership of both Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy. They have been working diligently to arrive at a legislative proposal that would balance the need for a rapid and effective regulatory response to the approval of medical drugs and devices but also fundamentally protect the public health. Frankly, I suggest that this is the motivation for our debate today. 
The critical issue has to be, must be, and should be the protection of the public health and safety. That is why we have a Food and Drug Administration. That is why we maintain a strong, vigilant Food and Drug Administration. 
We have agreement, I believe, that PDUFA is working, and that we can move forward with PDUFA. The industry is, indeed, thrilled by it. It works well. They pay fees dedicated to the examination and review of proposed drugs and devices. These resources have enabled the FDA to speed up the process. 
In terms of the FDA process, PDUFA has done a great deal. The bill that we are considering on the floor today includes a reauthorization of PDUFA, and represents many improvements in the original bill that we started with, and, indeed, even the bill that emerged from the committee. 
But there are still critical issues that have to be addressed in terms of protection of the public health and safety. They are complicated issues. They are issues that require careful review and deliberation. 
One of the disappointing aspects of this process is that the final version of this bill was just released publicly Wednesday, the same time the cloture motion was filed. Again, in the spirit of careful, thorough, thoughtful review, this does not provide the best opportunity to review all the nuances of this legislation. 
So that is why I believe the effort today, led by Senator Kennedy, is a very important one. It allows this body to more carefully, more intelligently and more thoroughly review provisions that will affect the lives of untold Americans. I daresay that the Food and Drug Administration reaches the lives of every American, probably more so than any regulatory agency in this country. 
All the prescription drugs on the shelves, all of the medical devices that are used--all of them, the food additives, all of these things--are influenced by FDA action. We have to be very careful, very thoughtful and, I believe, methodical. So today's debate--and again I commend Senator Kennedy for ensuring that we do have a thorough debate--is vitally important to that goal. 
I mentioned that we have made progress on this bill, but I should say there are also areas that need improvement--desperately need improvement. There is one in particular I would like to speak to for a moment, and that is the issue of medical device labeling. 
This bill contains a medical device provision which potentially opens up a serious public health loophole. Section 404 of this bill would prevent the Food and Drug Administration, before clearing a device for the market, from examining whether a device will be used for an unlabeled use before clearing it for use in the market. This provision could allow the gaming of the FDA process where companies could attempt to escape a requirement of providing essential safety and effectiveness data by adopting a very narrow use for the device. 
For example, under this bill, a company could get approval for a biopsy needle from the FDA, even though it may be used in practice--and, indeed, this would be something that the company might have knowledge of--for an entirely different purpose, such as for tumor removal. Yet, the company could avoid submitting to the FDA any safety or effectiveness data on this device for tumor removal because FDA would be prohibited by law from asking for that data. In other words, the FDA would be prohibited from looking behind the limited proposed use of the device. 
Another example is a company which receives approval of a general surgical laser, even though the laser is clearly designed for prostate surgery. The public health of the American people is dependent upon a thorough and complete review of such devices, and yet, section 404 would essentially put blindfolds on the agency. They very well might know from general literature, the company might very well know from its sales force who, when they present this product, hear medical professionals saying, `This is great, but I'll use it for something else,' and yet the FDA would not be able to require data on this likely use. This provision would prevent the FDA from providing for the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. 
The issue of allowing FDA to look beyond the conditions of use on the label and evaluating the use of a device is somewhat of a gray area. Certainly, advances in technology, new uses by the medical profession of devices should not be inhibited, but we also do not want to compromise the ability of the FDA to protect the public health. That is the great balance we must strike in this legislation: allowing for technological flexibility, regulatory efficiency, but not compromising the public health of the American people. It is a balance that we are edging close to. 
We have made progress since the adoption of this bill at the committee level, but more progress can and should be made. We are committed to making such progress. We are committed, I think, to coming up with final legislation that will reflect both the need for technological efficiency and innovation, but also protecting the public health of the American people. 
I hope we can do that. I know that we desperately want, all of us, to reauthorize PDUFA so that we can continue that outstanding record of regulatory efficiency and approvals that have been generated by PDUFA. But, I don't think any of us want to create a situation where months from now or years from now we are confronted with public health problems because we acted hastily or we acted without the thoughtful, careful review that is necessary to develop legislation that protects the public health and provides for all of the new innovations that are fast becoming part of our medical marketplace. 
Again, I commend Senator Kennedy for his unflinching efforts to ensure that these concerns are fully addressed. I also thank and commend the chairman of the committee who has worked diligently, sincerely and doggedly over these last several months to try to bring together opposing views on the committee. I believe we are close but not quite there yet. I believe in the days ahead, we can, in fact, reach a position of which we will all be very, very proud. At this time, I am prepared to yield back to the senior Senator from Massachusetts.

Mr. REED. If the Senator will yield for response, one of my fears is that not only would this situation result in perhaps not giving the FDA data on uses that the companies are aware of in the marketplace, but it might provide a subtle incentive in marketing these devices to encourage uses that are not authorized by the FDA and certainly not to be attentive to those types of uses and report back to regulatory authorities. 
Again, when we think about this legislation, we have to think about also that there are a complex set of incentives and disincentives for the best possible behavior by pharmaceutical and device companies. I don't think any of us would like to unwittingly create a situation in which devices approved for one use are cavalierly marketed by companies for other uses and are merely winked at when they do not fall within the category of the approval. So that is another important issue. 
There is another aspect of this which I would like to raise with Senator Kennedy, and that is, I understand that Secretary Shalala has communicated concerns about this issue. I understand that she is concerned about this and her concern may be of such a level that it could suggest that she recommend to the President a veto of this legislation. A veto would be, I think, particularly unfortunate since we have worked so hard, we have made so much progress, and we have reached a point where we are very close to legislation which could virtually pass with unanimity in this body. It would be unfortunate that this type of provision of the bill would disrupt that process. I wonder if that is correct.

Mr. REED. If the Senator will yield again, I concur with his analysis, with the danger, and also with the fact this has risen to the level of the Secretary of Health and Human Services as a significant an obstacle to passage or acceptance by the President. Again, I don't think any of us are suggesting that pharmaceutical and device manufacturers are going to--some may, but I hope not--deliberately try to bait and switch. But the market is evolving so much and there is so much innovation that if the FDA can't, by reviewing the literature, make an estimate of what a device might be used for and ask for data on that likely use, then I think we are really constraining FDA--as I said before, putting blinders on the FDA. 
That, I think, would be a mistake in policy. And I also feel, based upon my sense of the progress we have made to date, that this is not an unsolvable issue. This issue is one that there is compromise language, with which we can both provide for innovation, we can provide for marketing, we can avoid cumbersome demands by the FDA. But we can still give the FDA the authority to say, `Listen, you are marketing this device for a very specific use, but we are aware that it would likely be used two or three others ways. How does this device work in those contexts?' This is a very serious issue. 
Once again, without the efforts of the Senator from Massachusetts to try to focus on these issues, it well could have been lost in the clamor of getting out of here and getting on with other business. It would be, in the long run, unfortunate for the public health of the American people. 
Let me conclude by saying that it is vitally important in ensuring when the bill passes--and I believe we all hope it passes--it passes in a way we will all be proud of and will deal with all these issues that, leaving no unintended loophole or unintended consequences. I hope that we will have thought it through, worked it out and come up with legislation that will provide for the kind of technological innovation we all want, provide for the kind of efficient regulatory review that we all want and certainly protect the safety of the American public which not only we want but the American people demand. I yield the floor.

Mr. REED. If I may, if the Senator will yield, I, too, concur with the support, the assistance, the advice, and I think the general goodwill that the industry has brought to this debate. We are now, though, at the detail level, the fine detail, technical detail, and that is critically important. These are the types of details which later on come back to haunt us sometimes if they are not done well. 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-reed-ri-5-19970905</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. REED. The industry has been responsive and reasonable, and we want to incorporate their best advice but also recognize that our ultimate responsibility is to the health of the American people. 
Something else, too, that the Senator alluded to was that this industry is becoming a very important part of our economy, not just nationally but locally. In Rhode Island we have several companies that are emerging as leaders in the industry. They offer not only extraordinary opportunities to help the American people, indeed, the people of the world, through medicine and devices, but also are becoming increasingly important economic powers within our communities--sources of jobs, employment and the types of activity that we certainly want to encourage. 
Part of our motivation today is to ensure that we do this right. We need to give them the kind of direction and incentives that will make them stronger competitors in the international marketplace, stronger sources of strength in the communities of America, but also make them responsible and accountable to the American people through appropriate regulation. All of these things we can accomplish because I believe that the differences that separate us at the moment are not fundamental, ideological or in any other sense broad based. They are, rather, important details which will ensure or not ensure that this legislation can be used effectively to protect the public health. 
So again I thank the Senator.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report on the tax relief package. I believe the conference report represents significant progress from previous efforts to provide tax relief for hard-working American families that are struggling to pay their bills, educate their children, and save for retirement. As one who voted against the previous Senate version of the tax cut bill, I commend the conferees and the administration negotiators who worked to address some of the concerns that I and others expressed with the previous legislation to develop this compromise. 
However, I must also express strong concern with several provisions that remain in the bill. I believe that the provisions related to capital gains taxes, IRA's, and estate taxes unfairly benefit the wealthiest Americans, and threaten to upset the fiscally responsible decisions, such as passage of the 1993 deficit reduction package, that enabled us to reduce the deficit to its lowest point as a percentage of GDP since 1974. However, when considered in the context of the larger effort at bipartisan compromise and the willingness to expand healthcare coverage to millions of children, I believe this legislation presents a good deal for many working American families. 
In particular, the tax cuts contained in the conference report provide a greater amount of tax relief to middle income Americans than previous versions of this bill. For example, under the bill passed by the Finance Committee, the second lowest 20 percent of income earners would have experienced a tax increase, whereas under the conference report, these Americans would enjoy a tax cut. Although I still have concerns that a substantial share of the tax cuts will go to the highest income Americans, these concerns are counterbalanced by the fact that middle-income Americans will enjoy significant tax reductions and expanded educational incentives which were not as prominent in prior versions of this bill. 
As I have stated throughout the debate on this bill, I have reservations about provisions in the bill related to the capital gains tax, new backloaded IRA's, and the estate tax. Particularly disturbing is the fact that these tax reductions, which come at a significant cost after 2002, will almost exclusively benefit the wealthiest Americans. For example, the Joint Tax Committee has estimated that three-quarters of Americans receiving capital gains income are households that earn over $100,000 annually. Similarly, only 1.6 percent of estates are valued high enough to qualify for capital gains increases. Meanwhile, these tax cuts will cost $75 billion over 10 years. 
Beyond favoring the wealthy, I am concerned that the cost of these tax cuts, many of which are backloaded, will explode in the years after 2002 and ultimately upset the progress we have made on deficit reduction. These concerns are supported by the 10-year revenue estimates recently released by the Joint Tax Committee which suggests that the cost of this tax bill will be $275 billion over 10 years. This level of revenue loss may prove difficult to sustain, and I would hope my colleagues will protect vital investments like education and infrastructure if difficult economic times arise. 
At the same time, I believe that the conferees have made significant progress on the education tax provisions included in the bill. Of particular note is the decision to extend education tax reductions for the third and fourth years of a college education. The Finance Committee-passed tax bill did not extend benefits to years three and four, and I believed this was a major shortcoming of that legislation. By providing benefits for the duration of the average college education, I believe the provisions included in the conference report better reflect the realities facing many individuals desiring to get a college education. Indeed, this compromise before us today provides $41 billion in education tax incentives for those looking to invest in their education. 
I also support the changes that have been made to the child tax credit that will enable a greater number of middle- and lower-income Americans to utilize the credit. By making the credit partially refundable against payroll taxes, the legislation reflects the reality that the most significant tax burden of many low-income Americans is that of the payroll tax. The Senate bill provided no tax credit to many families making under $30,000. This compromise does. 
I would also like to express my support for the decision to keep provisions in the bill that will expand the use of IRA's to allow withdrawals for first-time home buyers. Perhaps the greatest hurdle faced by many first-time home buyers is the inability to get the necessary funds for a downpayment on a home. Provisions in the tax bill will lower this hurdle and enable us to continue to increase home ownership, which is currently at a 17-year high. 
In conclusion, I believe the tax bill will provide tax relief to hard-working American families who have faced stagnating wages and tough employment prospects. I am pleased that we in Congress have made the difficult budget decisions which laid the foundation for the tax cuts we are able to provide today. I would caution, however, that we must be ever-vigilant in ensuring that the tax cuts will not overheat the economy or lead to an explosion of the deficit. Indeed, we must be prepared to make the tough decisions that we will be called upon to make in the event that the revenue projections in this agreement do not come to fruition. As we prepare to vote on this legislation, I would encourage my colleagues to celebrate our success, but to consider the concerns that I have set forth. 
Mr. President, I will support this bill with reservations, but I also recognize as should we all, that this agreement is a compromise between a President and a Congressional majority of different political parties. As such, it embodies the often conflicting demands and ideals of each group. It is in this spirit that I will vote for the package.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, yesterday, while thousands of innocent men, women and children shopped in Mahane Yehuda market in Jerusalem, the peace of that sunny afternoon was shattered when two bombs filled with screws and nails detonated. Fifteen people were killed, close to 200 persons were injured. Later that day, the Israeli Cabinet voted to break off all contact with the Palestinian Authority, jeopardizing hopes that had soared just days ago when Israelis and Palestinians had agreed to resume peace talks for the first time since March. 
I have always been a strong supporter of the peace process, and there is no doubt in anyone's mind that this is a complicated issue and peace will only be secured after prolonged negotiations and compromises on both sides. No one expects it to be easy. 
However, the first step simply must be to end the violence. Terrorist acts such as yesterday's bombing simply cannot be tolerated. There is no reason, no excuse, no possible justification for killing innocent civilians shopping in a street market. It is an act of terrorism, nothing more, nothing less. 
Peace cannot be secured until the citizens of the Middle East are certain that they are safe. They will not feel safe until they trust each other, and they will not trust each other until their actions match their words and deeds. Yasser Arafat said he condemns these terrorists. He said it is an act against the peace process. Yet, it is more than likely that a known terrorist group detonated those bombs in the market. These terrorist groups have never had to account for their violent deeds. 
The Palestinian Authority must match its words of condemnation with acts. It must take tangible steps to increase security activity and security cooperation. It must be committed to bringing those who are responsible for this unconscionable act of terrorism to justice. Only when it is clear that these acts of terrorism will no longer be tolerated will they cease. Only when they cease can we take another step down that very long road to peace. 
I extend my condolences to the families of those who were killed. It is my sincere hope it is the last time that the people of Israel and the people of Palestine will endure the suffering and fear that terrorist acts bring. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.  
Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN addressed the Chair.

Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of this bill. As one who voted against the Senate version of this legislation, I am especially pleased today to be able to support this initiative--an initiative that, among other things, provides 10 years of solvency to the Medicare Program, and makes a substantial investment in the health care of our children. I would like to remind my colleagues that we were able to craft this agreement because of the tough vote that I and others cast in 1993 for President Clinton's deficit reduction plan--a plan that has reduced the deficit from almost $300 billion to approximately $40 billion or perhaps lower. 
I am particularly pleased that this bill makes a remarkable investment in the health care of our children by providing $24 billion to States to spend for children's health care. This new program represents the most significant and far-reaching expansion in our social programs since the passage of Medicaid and Medicare in the mid-1960's. These children's health provisions will give our children the healthy start that they deserve, and the healthy start that is necessary to help young people become effective students and help these students become effective workers, and help all of us raise a generation of American citizens who will serve this country and lead the world. 
Congress is committing significant resources to children's needs. And now we must turn our attention to the days ahead to ensure that these resources are used wisely. I remain cautious about this new initiative. As with any investment of our taxpayer's dollars, the Federal Government needs to ensure that the investment is well spent. The plan which is being offered today provides a wide array of options and benefit plans with a high degree of flexibility. And it is crafted in a such a way that it could perhaps be gamed--not for the benefit of the children but for the benefit of those who will be enriching themselves from the system. As this program is implemented, we need to provide adequate oversight to ensure that the children are the beneficiaries of this program, and that they receive the benefits they need, that their health care is protected, and that we as a Nation can prosper. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, along with the Congress, has her work cut out for her. And together we must ensure that this program is implemented wisely and benefits the children that we so desperately and appropriately want to serve. 
In addition, this conference agreement makes significant changes in the Medicare Program. Most importantly, this bill brings 10 years of solvency to the Medicare Program--a program that more than 30 million Americans depend upon, and that more than 170,000 Rhode Islanders depend upon. 
Like the amendment I offered during the debate on the Senate version of this bill, this legislation does not include the provisions which I believe take the wrong approach to solving our Medicare problems--provisions like raising the eligibility age, means testing for the part B premiums, and a home health copayment for home health services. This legislation strikes those provisions, as my previous amendment struck those provisions. 
A home health care copayment would have negatively impacted the sickest and poorest of Medicare beneficiaries. And an increase in Medicare's eligibility age is a step in the wrong direction. Simply put, raising the eligibility age for Medicare increases the ranks of the uninsured. Already, 13 percent of the 21 million people age 55 to 64 lack health insurance. It makes no sense at all for Congress to eliminate Medicare as an option for seniors who have nowhere else to turn. These and other issues will be debated in the context of long-term Medicare reform as we address the problems faced by Medicare for the next generation. 
During the Senate debate on this bill, as I indicated, I offered an amendment to strike these provisions. My amendment failed. But I am glad to see that today we have reached an agreement which protects Medicare, extends the life of the program for at least 10 years and does not attempt an ad hoc approach to structural reform. 
This bill includes many improvements to Medicare. For example, it has expanded preventive health care benefits for mammography, pap smears, diabetes, prostate, and colorectal cancer screening, bone density measurements, and vaccines. This bill also requires the Medicare Program and managed care plans to give more information to beneficiaries about their choices and their coverage, and the quality of that coverage. All of these are welcome developments. 
I am also pleased that this bill contains $1.5 billion for protecting low-income Medicare beneficiaries against an increase in Medicare premiums. However, I am disappointed that this comes in the form of a block grant to the States that ends after 2002. This approach has the potential to fall short of providing real protection for low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Any increase in Medicare premiums can result in significant hardships for low-income seniors, and these individuals deserve a permanent guarantee of protection. 
This bill also includes numerous changes in Medicare reimbursement policies--changes that will have a great impact on those individuals and institutions that provide health care to Medicare beneficiaries. I will keep a vigilant eye on the implementation of these changes, paying particular attention to their impact on the access to and quality of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries. 
This legislation also establishes a bipartisan national commission to examine the long-term solvency of the Medicare Program. The creation of this commission lays an important foundation to work on long-term reforms and solutions, and to tackle those issues that are not suitable for the narrow confines of a budget debate. Such reform is needed to address the challenges that the Medicare Program will face as members of the baby-boom generation become recipients of Medicare. This commission provides that framework, and I am encouraged that the commission is established by this legislation. 
I am prepared to vote in favor of this bill. As with any piece of legislation, it is not perfect. Indeed, many individuals will benefit from various provisions of the bill. Medicare beneficiaries will have the security of an additional 10 years of solvency in the program. The families of uninsured children will now have new State programs to turn to. Medicare beneficiaries will have new choices and increased preventive health care benefits. 
But this is no time to rest on our laurels. To ensure that Medicare beneficiaries continue to have access to high-quality care in the face of constrained payments to providers, to ensure that the $24 billion for children's health care is well spent, and to ensure the long-term viability of the Medicare Program, we will need continued vigilance on the part of many, including the Congress, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and those persons served by the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. 
We also must recognize that within this budget, as we continue to draw down discretionary spending over the next several years, harder and harder choices will ensue. We have to ensure that we make the right choices. We have to ensure that the spirit today--a spirit that reaches out to help our children, a spirit that reaches out to help and maintain our seniors--will be the spirit that dominates our future budget deliberations as it has ennobled our past efforts to strengthen America. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which is included, I believe, in the managers' amendment, with the concurrence of the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from South Carolina. 
The thrust of my amendment is to confront an issue which is growing--the issue of slamming--where individuals who have signed up for long distance telephone service have their service changed illegally. This is a growing problem, a problem that we must confront. It is a problem that--in fact, as I considered it, I also contemplated the construction of an amendment to this appropriations bill that would have dealt with the problem by mandating better proof that a customer has actually changed service, including criminal penalties for slamming, and other deterrences. 
As I spoke with my colleagues and law enforcement officials, I came to realize, through many different viewpoints, that an amendment at this time would delay the appropriations process. So rather than introducing an amendment, I have proposed a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which, again, I believe has been accepted and will be maintained within the managers' agreement. 
Before going forward, I commend and thank the chairman, Senator Gregg, and the ranking member, Mr. Hollings, and also Chairman McCain and Chairman Burns for their generous assistance in this endeavor.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his support. I would like to just briefly describe the problem and also the ongoing discussion with the FCC and also here within Congress. 
First, as both my colleagues have indicated, this is an alarming and growing problem. The Federal Communications Commission is dealing with the problem now. They will shortly propose a rule that will take away the financial incentive for some of these renegade companies who essentially illegally change service. Surprisingly, today under FCC rules, a renegade company can, in fact, illegally switch a customer and still get the benefits of that month or of several months of charges. The FCC has proposed to change this. 
This sense-of-the-Senate resolution supports that proposed rule change and the other activities the FCC is contemplating. One of the reasons we are here today is that, under the present rules of the FCC, telephone companies must get either a verbal or written response in terms of a formal request to change. The problem with respect to a written consent is that, many times, they are hidden in sweepstakes promotions, giveaways and, in fact, the nature of the written response is unknown to the consumer. Once again, the FCC is proposing to change this new rule. I support that change and encourage them to go forward. 
The phone company can also rely upon the verbal assent of a consumer, but there are problems with this verbal assent, also. Some of the problems we have seen with telemarketers are the fact that they will deceive the consumer about identity or the nature of the service, or they will obtain the consent of a child, or stranger in the household, or disregard the consumer's decline to switch the service, or flatout not even bother to get the verbal assent and claim that they do in retrospect. The problem with this verbal authorization is proof. Again, the FCC has taken some steps in this regard. They are proposing to eliminate what is an option today, where someone presumably could consent over the phone and then receive a package later from the company requiring that consumer to send a card in to deny the service change. 
The FCC once again is trying to eliminate that procedure, also. 
These are all positive steps. I encourage, and this resolution encourages, the FCC to pursue those steps. 
This is a major problem for consumers in the United States. Fifty million people each year switch their phone service. One million of those switches are likely to be fraudulent. One regional carrier now estimates that 1 in 20 of the switches in their system are fraudulent switches. This problem has tripled since 1994. It is now the FCC's No. 1 consumer complaint. Therefore, this problem is something that we should deal with, and deal with decisively. 
In my own home State of Rhode Island, there are abundant examples of consumers who have been disadvantaged by this illegal switching. Indeed, the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission has noted this complaint as the No. 1 complaint they receive with respect to telephone services. For example, a small businessperson in Newport, RI, had his 800 number switched, and rather than an 800 number, the only people who could call the business were residents of Alaska. 
In Smithfield, RI, a family had their phone service illegally switched. They protested, but before they could rectify the problem, their phone service was terminated because they refused to pay the bill for the illegal company that switched them. 
These are problems that have to be addressed, and I hope are being addressed today by the FCC, and perhaps ultimately our legislation in this body. 
What I hope we could do would be to focus more resources of the FCC on this problem. In 1996, the FCC received 16,000 complaints about slamming, but they only were able to successfully prosecute and induce judgment against 15 companies. They don't have the resources. They need those resources. Indeed, I worry that law enforcement agencies around the country not only lack resources but lack, ultimately, the proof that a switch has been made illegally. Law enforcement officials in certain States, such as Connecticut, Wisconsin, California, Texas, and Illinois, have been successful, but they need additional support. 
Indeed, one of the major elements of the legislation I was contemplating was the requirement not only of written proof but, also, in the case that an oral or verbal consent was given, some type of recording of assent so that law enforcement authorities could verify decisively whether or not the appropriate assent had been made. It is necessary for us to balance the needs for a flexible system by which consumers can make choices and change their service to one that protects their right to ensure that it is their choice and not the result of fraudulent or manipulative practices by unscrupulous companies. I believe we can do that. 
I believe we have taken a step forward today with this sense-of-the-Senate resolution to start on that path. I look forward to offering independent legislation which I think will assist the current effort of the FCC to resolve this grave problem that is growing each day. 
Once again, I thank my colleagues, Senator Gregg, Senator Hollings, Senator McCain, and Senator Burns, for their work and for their effort on this. Others are interested. I know Senator Campbell and Senator Durbin are also interested in this problem. 
We have an opportunity today to send a strong message to the FCC to move forward and also to continue to contemplate and deliberate about legislation which will assist in their efforts and end this scandalous problem, the No. 1 consumer complaint today with respect to telecommunications slamming. 
I thank my colleagues. I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. REED. Madam President, I stand in strong support of the Harkin amendment. We know today 90 percent of the adults who are smoking started when they were children. We know, if current trends continue, 5 million kids today under 18 years old will die because of smoking related diseases. We know all this, yet we are doing nothing effective to stop the use of tobacco products by children under 18 years of age. 
The Harkin amendment would actually provide resources to ensure that the FDA regulations are enforced. That, to me, is the most critical test. I believe we should support this amendment wholeheartedly. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss legislation I have just introduced, the Campaign Spending Control Act of 1997. The 1996 elections, unfortunately, will be remembered for two remarkable facts. First, Federal campaigns produced record spending; over $2.7 billion or almost $28 for every voter. Second, the election produced record-low voter participation: less than half of those eligible chose to vote. These two tragic facts are inextricably linked. 
Due to the vast sums of money spent on campaigns, most Americans believe our current campaign system is tainted by special interest money. Under a flood of money and television ads, voters view their voice as meaningless, their concerns as unaddressed, and their votes as unimportant. In order to restore public confidence, campaign finance reform must accomplish three goals. It must significantly reduce campaign spending; level the playing field for those who challenge incumbents; and, finally, encourage greater public participation and debate. 
These goals cannot be successfully addressed without significantly changing the rules which govern campaigns. Campaign scandals have posed a threat to the health of our democracy throughout our Nation's history. In 1907, after enduring embarrassment over a campaign scandal, President Teddy Roosevelt championed legislation prohibiting corporations from financing Federal candidates. In 1974, responding to the scandals of the 1972 elections and the resignation of President Nixon, Congress overwhelmingly passed legislation limiting spending by candidates, parties, and wealthy individuals. 
In 1996, all the past campaign reforms imploded, with a flood of corporate and individual money overwhelming legal limits. Million-dollar corporate contributions funded advertisements to impact Presidential and congressional campaigns. Well-funded individuals and organizations also got into the act. By spending a record $70 million on so-called issue advertising, labor unions, business organizations, and ideological groups circumvented limits on direct contributions to candidates. Thus, candidates, awash in a sea of outside money, were pushed to not only trounce their opponents in fundraising, but to match outside groups. The chase for dollars sapped candidates' time which could have been spent debating, attending forums, and otherwise engaging voters. Once solicited, most of these millions were spent on uninformative, 30-second advertisements, which only served to further alienate the electorate. Unchecked, this campaign system will spiral into exponential spending increases, further disenfranchisement, and less dialog. The system is already close to collapsing under its own weight; the time to act is now. 
The roots of this abysmal situation can be traced to a misguided Supreme Court decision. In Buckley versus Valeo, a 1976 case which challenged the 1974 campaign reform legislation, the Court held that, in order to avoid corruption, contributions to candidates and committees could be limited. However, the Court invalidated expenditure limits on candidates and independent entities as infringements on free speech rights. The Court surmised that unlimited spending would increase the number and depth of issues 
discussed. Twenty years of campaign spending has proven the Court's decision fatally flawed: fewer issues are discussed, less debate occurs, and voter participation has declined. The single most important step to reform elections and revitalize our democracy is to reverse the Buckley decision by limiting the amount of money that a candidate or his allies can spend. 
For this reason, Senators Bryan, Hollings, Johnson, and I are introducing legislation which directly challenges the Buckley decision and places mandatory limits on all campaign expenditures. These limits do not favor incumbents. Over the last three elections, these limits would have restricted 80 percent of incumbents, while only impacting 18 percent of those who challenged incumbents. Additionally, this legislation would fully ban corporate contributions, as well as unlimited and unregulated contributions by wealthy individuals and organizations. Further, our bill would limit campaign expenditures by supposedly, neutral, independent groups, and restrict corporations, labor unions, and other organizations from influencing campaigns under the guise of issue advocacy. The end result of this legislation would be to eliminate over $500 million from the system, discourage violations, encourage challenges to incumbents, and further promote debate among both candidates and the electorate. 
What effect would these limits have on political debate? Contrary to the Supreme Court, I believe such limits would increase dialog. Candidates would be free from the burdens of unending fundraising and thus be available to participate in debates, forums, and interviews. With greater access to candidates and less reason to believe that candidates were captives of their contributors, voters might well be more prepared to invest the time needed to be informed on issues of concern and ask candidates to address them. 
Some will argue that this legislation impinges upon freedom of speech. The bill will marginally restrict the rights of a few to spend money--not speak--so that the majority of voters might restore their faith in the process. Thus, speech will be restricted no more than necessary to fulfill what I believe to be several compelling interests. Such a restriction conforms with constitutional jurisprudence and has been demonstrated necessary by history. The fact is all democratic debates are restricted by rules. My legislation would simply implement necessary rules into our campaign system. Finally, it is important to remember that the vast majority of Americans, 96 percent, have never made a political contribution at any level of government. Capping expenditures will truly impact very few individuals, and that restriction will be marginal, but necessary. 
Implementing spending caps is a grass-roots initiative. Elected officials from 33 States have urged that the Buckley decision be revisited and limits implemented. Legislative bodies in Ohio and Vermont have implemented sweeping reform by enacting mandatory caps on candidate expenditures. Other States, such as my own, have embraced public financing as a means of reform. Yet, today, Congress struggles to even consider the most modest of reforms, such as banning so called soft 
money: unlimited donations by corporations, labor unions, and wealthy individuals to political party committees. Unfortunately, because most of the current reform proposals accept the reasoning enunciated in the Buckley decision, they will only serve to redirect an unlimited flow of cash. While I enthusiastically support any substantive reform, if we are to address the underlying cancer which has disintegrated voter trust and participation, the problem of unlimited expenditures must be directly confronted. This is a step that one municipality and two States have embraced. Many more State officials as well as prominent constitutional law scholars have urged such a course. Expenditure limitations have been proposed by congressional reformers in the past, and it is time to rededicate ourselves to this goal.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, our democracy is dependent upon participation, stimulated by a belief that the system works for everyone. Just as scandals led to reform in 1907 and 1974, Congress must now rise to the task once again to address a threat to our democratic process. Polls continue to demonstrate that a majority of Americans believe the political process is controlled by wealthy interests. The most dangerous aspect of the current situation is that polls also show that voters have no faith in the ability of their representatives to implement reform. If we do not address the influence of money in our electoral system, the health of our democracy will endure increasing risk. It is time to begin true, comprehensive reform. I would like to thank Senators Bryan, Hollings, and Johnson for joining me in this endeavor. Their leadership on this issue in the past has proven invaluable, and I am proud that they have chosen to join me in this important effort. It is my hope that the Senate will now move to address the problem of our campaign system at its root. Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, very briefly, I commend the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Virginia and my colleagues who have proposed the second-degree amendment. I also commend the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, for focusing our attention on this very critical issue. 
The danger for an immediate cutoff of funds, I think, is threefold. 
First, essentially demoralizing our troops. It would be very difficult for them to understand that we have cut off funds now for an operation that is extending into June 1998. In effect, it would be like the difference between knowing that your lease expires in June 1998 and getting the eviction notice. Cutting off of funds is very close to being evicted. I don't think our troops will understand that. 
Second, it would paralyze our efforts to construct a follow-on force by our European allies, a force that would not contain American troops but a force that would be necessary to maintain the peace in Bosnia. If we were to announce today a cutoff of funds, I believe we would have no chance to construct this follow-on force by our European allies. 
Finally, I think we embolden those force elements who are resisting within Bosnia. This would be the message, that we are leaving, categorically, that there will be nothing to replace it, and that idea can only lead to further violence. 
So I believe the best approach is the one that has been adopted in the second-degree amendment. And that is to, once again, reiterate our strong commitment to a withdrawal date by June 1998, but to give the time--and also to give the impetus--to develop a follow-on force, a non-American follow-on force, and support that force, and to continue to build on the structure of peace that is emerging today and that we hope will continue in the former Yugoslavia. 
I commend again all of my colleagues who are working on this effort. 
I yield my time.

Mr. REED. I thank the Chair. I rise to support the second-degree amendment offered by the Senator from Michigan on my behalf and on behalf of Senator McCain. 
I, too, compliment the Senator from Wisconsin for his amendment. One of the great frustrations in watching this policy evolve concerning Bosnia is that I fear we are wasting precious time in taking concrete steps so that we can effectively depart that country in June of 1998. The Senator's amendment has focused this debate and, I hope, gives further impetus to efforts by the administration to take these steps so that the withdrawal of our troops in June of 1998 will be a reality and not a situation where we are victims of a fait accompli and must stay longer. 
Like my colleague from Michigan, I share the Senator's goal. I believe that we should withdraw our troops by June of 1998. As the Senator from Wisconsin said, there are no good times to leave. In a tumultuous situation like Bosnia, with ethnic rivalries, with violence, with a history of centuries of violence, there are no good times to leave, but we must leave because, as my colleague from Virginia has pointed out, we have 
already spent $7 billion, and after June 30, 1998, the cost does not go to zero. The costs continue to accumulate. These costs are not just in terms of appropriations for our military forces. They are also in terms of the stress and strain placed on our military forces. There is discussion about mission creep, but I think the first symptom emerging from Bosnia is mission exhaustion as our troops will be forced to be rotated back to that country from their positions in Germany and outside of Bosnia. 
So for all of these reasons and more, I believe that we should have the requirement to return our troops to their home stations by June of 1998. I just believe that the Feingold amendment is the wrong approach to this situation. It would impose severe conditions on this announced departure date by cutting off funding for the deployment of any ground elements of the Armed Forces except guards at our diplomatic facilities and noncombatant advisers to NATO forces, and this arbitrary restriction could play havoc with our mission and with our troops' ability to carry out that mission. 
As one consequence, if this provision would pass, it could immediately begin to demoralize our troops. Even though we have set as our objective our departure by June of 1998, passage of this bill cutting off funds would, I think, send a signal that we are not only requesting them to leave but in some respects abandoning them in their operations. I think that is the wrong signal. 
I know, as the Senator from Wisconsin pointed out, that he, too, shares with me the esteem that we have for the performance of these remarkable soldiers in this operation. 
Second, I believe that this amendment would weaken the resolve of our NATO colleagues to participate in this mission. I know it has been said on this floor this evening that the Europeans have declared, if you go, we will go. But if we pass this amendment today, any possibility of constructive dialog and engagement to encourage them to stay beyond June will, I think, be totally lost, and that would be a severe gesture. 
I believe we have to keep this active dialog alive with our European colleagues, and with this amendment tonight, the Feingold amendment, we could very well cut off such dialog. In addition, the Feingold amendment contemplates leaving in place a few Embassy guards and some advisers to NATO. First, if we do construct a follow-on force and if that force is not NATO, this legislation could technically preclude any assistance to a follow-on force, and in that respect I think we are doing ourselves a great disservice, hampering the flexibility of the administration to construct a follow-on force, a constructive military posture in Bosnia after June of 1998. 
Furthermore, I believe there is a possibility that those forces left behind, Embassy guards or noncombatant advisers, would be placed in a very frustrating position. 
We are going through a situation where we have significant combat power in-country, with robust rules of engagement, suddenly to a position where American troops are merely, in a way, passive bodyguards for our own military personnel. Their safety could be jeopardized. And, in addition, they would be in the frustrating position of perhaps standing by helplessly when civilians, which we previously protected, could fall victim to the ethnic rivalries which we know exist in that country. 
I think also one of the detriments and deficiencies in the amendment is it obscures what I think should be the focus of the debate today. We all agree June of 1998 is the appropriate departure date. What we should be debating today on this floor is what steps we must take beginning today to ensure that we can safely and appropriately withdraw our troops by June of 1998. I believe there are several steps that must be taken. 
Like my colleague from Michigan, I believe we should constitute a follow-on force, but a follow-on force that is not composed of American ground troops. As the Senator from Michigan pointed out, we have the capability through NATO, or through the European security defense identity which would use NATO assets, to provide this follow-on force. 
Indeed, I think we have to remind Europeans of their brave words back in 1992 in Lisbon when the leaders of the European nations declared that assisting the people of former Yugoslavia in their quest for peace was a test of their ability to establish and maintain peace and security on the Continent of Europe. It is not inappropriate--in fact, I think it is most appropriate--that this situation be returned primarily to the European forces after the intervention of NATO successfully to suppress violence and give them a second chance, give them a second chance to maintain the peace and stability in that region. 
As we all know, for many years it was a primarily European-led United Nations force, United Nations-protected force that operated within Bosnia. That force was inadequate, but I believe with the intervention of NATO, with the steps we have already taken, a European force could, in fact, and should, in fact, carry out this follow-on mission. I also believe that to augment the European force within the former Yugoslavia, we should, in fact, create a residual force in a nearby country or in the Adriatic, which could respond in a crisis to the legitimate requirements for assistance for this force. 
In doing those two things, I believe we would, in fact, create a follow-on capability that would preserve the gains we have made in the former Yugoslavia. I believe it is also very important that our administration speak with a very clear voice and a single voice about our intention to depart in June of 1998. It is frustrating when the Secretary of Defense clearly states that deadline, but his words are sometimes confused by ambiguous statements from other leaders of our National Government. I believe we should have one voice, and that one voice should declare that we are leaving in June of 1998. 
While we go about our military preparations to depart, we have to address the concerns of economic development, and we can do that in a way which favors those parties within the former Yugoslavia, within Bosnia, who are trying to assist in an evolution to a democratic, peaceful society. If we do these things--reconstitute a follow-on force, provide for a residual American force outside of the country that can assist the follow-on force, and begin to support the economic and political development of the people of Bosnia--then I believe that when June of 1998 arrives we can and will successfully remove our forces. But the challenge we face today is not to arbitrarily cut off and terminate funding at this juncture. The challenge we face is to use the intervening months that we have to fashion a policy which will allow us to leave peacefully from the former Yugoslavia, and leave it in a condition where there is hope that the gains we made will be sustained and will be permanent within that country. 
As a result, I urge my colleagues to support the second-degree amendment and, in doing so, not only send a signal that we are serious about our departure, a signal that will be sent to the capitals of Europe and to the capitals of the former Yugoslavia that we will be serious about our departure date, but we will not be arbitrary and inflexible. And that, in the interim, we will build a structure of peace and security that will carry on the efforts that were so magnificently undertaken and continue today by our military forces in the former Yugoslavia. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my concerns with the tax bill passed by the Finance Committee, and to express my support for the Democratic alternative. I believe the Finance Committee bill is seriously flawed, and will put us on a path to exploding deficits, rising inflation, and future economic hardship. In a time when we are asking our seniors to absorb $115 billion in Medicare cuts, I think it is irresponsible to enact the large, across-the-board tax cuts that are contemplated in this legislation--tax cuts that will add to the pain of balancing the budget by the year 2002. 
Of particular concern is the fact that these tax cuts will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans who have already benefited from the unprecedented performance of our economy and stock market over the last several years. Specifically, 42.8 percent of the tax cuts will go to the top 10 percent of income earners, those who earn more than $120,000. Meanwhile, only 2.7 percent of the benefits will go to the bottom 40 percent of hard-working Americans. To continue this gravy train for the well-to-do, while ignoring the economic anxieties faced by middle and lower income Americans, is unfair. Nevertheless, the Finance Committee tax bill is loaded with breaks for the wealthiest Americans, leaving the average taxpayer holding the bag. 
Perhaps most illustrative of this point are three of the plan's largest tax cuts--the capital gains, individual retirement accounts [IRA's], and estate tax provisions. The Joint Tax Committee has estimated that three-quarters of Americans receiving capital gains income have household incomes over $100,000. Similarly, only 1.6 percent of estates are valued high enough to qualify for estate taxes. Finally, increases in the IRA income limitations will benefit only the top 30 percent of taxpayers. As laudable as some of these items are, their combination, without targeting, skews this bill to favor the affluent over middle-income Americans. 
Beyond favoring the wealthy, the cost of these tax cuts will ultimately threaten the progress we have made on reducing the deficit, which is at its lowest point as a percentage of gross domestic product [GDP] since 1974. This is because the costs of the tax cuts, which are relatively low in the early years, will explode in later years outside of the budget window. For example, from 1997 to 2002, the combined revenue loss of the capital gains, estate tax, and IRA provisions is $4.3 billion. However, the revenue loss from these provisions rises dramatically between 2003 and 2007 to $68.7 billion. In 2007, the combined costs of the capital gains, IRA, and estate tax provisions grow to $18.2 billion. This is 25 times the average annual cost of these provisions of $720 million, as indicated in the Joint Tax Committee distribution tables for 1997 through 2002 for the Republican tax bill. 
In addition, cuts in the capital gains tax rate will likely generate a flurry of unproductive economic activity that may produce an unwelcome side effect--inflation. Because there are no requirements for reinvestment, a significant share of the capital gains realized will likely be consumed. This increased consumption will put upward pressure on prices and fuel the fires of inflation that we have fought so hard to extinguish. 
I am supportive of the Democratic alternative because it contains targeted capital gains tax cuts aimed at productive, long-term investment and savings in areas that will best-serve our 
economy. For example, the bill provides a capital gains reduction for owners of small and startup businesses, which represent the most dynamic sector of the American economy. In addition, the Democratic alternative eliminates IRA provisions in the Finance Committee bill that will lead to dramatic cost increases over time. Moreover, the Democratic bill provides estate tax relief in a manner that will benefit true family-owned businesses and farms that continue to be operated by family members. 
The child tax credit is yet another example of the distributional unfairness of the Finance Committee legislation. Because the credit is nonrefundable, many middle- and low-income Americans will be unable to take advantage of the child tax credits. It has been estimated that nationwide, 47 percent of all dependent children will be completely ineligible for the $500 tax credit because their incomes are too low. In my State of Rhode Island, almost 141,000 children, or 46 percent of the dependent children in the State will be ineligible for the credit according to Citizens for Tax Justice. 
The fact that almost half of this Nation's children will be denied the tax credit is of great concern, and further reinforces my support for the Democratic tax alternative, which goes a long way toward solving this problem. The Democratic alternative improves the overall distribution of the tax cut by making the child credit refundable against federal payroll taxes. This is significant because most of the families that would otherwise be ineligible for the credit pay far more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes. The Democratic alternative would also establish an income limitation on the tax credit to target the benefits to low- and middle-income families that truly need the assistance. 
Mr. President, in these times of economic prosperity, we can afford to, and indeed we have an obligation to invest in priorities such as education that will have a positive impact on America's future. That is why I have been a strong supporter of the HOPE scholarship tax credit proposed by the President. While I applaud the committee for including education tax credits in their bill, I am concerned about reductions the committee has made in the size of the credit, which will limit its usefulness to many students. For this reason, I believe we should look to the Democratic alternative which allows for the full HOPE credit to be used by students for the first $1,000 in tuition expenses. Additionally, the Democratic alternative establishes a 20 percent tuition deduction that can be used after a student ceases to be eligible for the HOPE credit. Together, these tax credits provide the type of meaningful assistance that many middle-class students will need in order to meet the financial demands of postsecondary education. 
Also, the Democratic alternative addresses the problem of crumbling schools that threatens our education system at the most fundamental level--elementary and secondary grades. It has been reported that in order to repair the costs of this country's aging schools, we will have to spend at least $4.8 billion. The Democratic alternative takes a step toward addressing this problem by establishing a program to allocate tax credits among the states for the purpose of repairing and constructing school facilities. We cannot hope to improve access and opportunity to higher education, without first ensuring that our elementary and secondary schools provide a physical environment that is conducive to learning. 
Although hailed as the biggest tax cut since the Reagan era, the Finance Committee bill is perhaps a prelude to the biggest tax increase in our history. This is because the bill is loaded with gimmicks that reduce its costs in the early years, and will result in an exponential rise in costs beyond the 5 year budget window. Assuming that we reach a balanced budget by 2002, this bill will make it virtually impossible to keep our budget in balance, without raising taxes. In addition, the bill assumes that the U.S. economy will remain strong in the future--an assumption that flies in the face of the business cycle. An economic downturn would dramatically increase the costs and eliminate the hope of a balanced budget. 
The Finance Committee bill will also help those Americans who are least in need of help. The capital gains tax cuts, estate tax cuts, and many of the changes to IRA's will benefit those Americans who have shared most in the economic growth of recent years. I question how we can afford to offer these tax cuts, while asking seniors to pay more for Medicare. 
Mr. President, as we debate this bill, I ask my colleagues to consider the Democratic tax alternative. This amendment will provide for a fair distribution of the tax cuts and benefit a greater number of Americans. The amendment will eliminate the fiscal time bombs in the Finance Committee bill that will explode after 2002 and threaten our progress toward a balanced budget. Finally, the amendment rightly focuses on the targeted investments necessary to keep our country moving forward into the 21st century.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, this week the Senate has considered legislation to fundamentally change Medicare and other programs that are vital to millions of Americans. I realize that we must make difficult choices about these valuable initiatives as we move toward a balanced budget. However, as we seek to invest in our nation's future, we must also confront loopholes and subsidies that waste our limited resources. 
The tax code contains many such loopholes, which fail to reflect our nation's true priorities. For example, the United States is subsidizing thousands of professional gamblers by allowing tax deductions for gambling losses to the extent of gambling winnings. The Joint Tax Committee reports that this deduction costs taxpayers $1.43 billion over five years. 
The gambling loss tax deduction is an anomaly for individuals who frequent an industry that sells itself as providing entertainment. In general, the tax code does not allow deductions for discretionary spending on entertainment, and I believe that it is more than reasonable to hold gambling expenditures to this same standard. Repealing the gambling loss tax deduction merely increases the cost of one entertainment option, a factor that gamblers can consider in determining how to spend their discretionary income. Furthermore, while most business deductions are for investments--and even losses--that could have created needed job opportunities for our nation's citizens, this is not the case for the losses claimed by professional gamblers on their personal income taxes. 
Perhaps more importantly, the gambling loss tax deduction primarily benefits professional gamblers and wealthy individuals who spend large sums on gambling. In 1994 alone, $2.78 billion in gambling losses was deducted on some 427,000 tax returns. Individuals with adjusted gross incomes of at least $75,000 claimed nearly 55% of these gambling losses, and people with adjusted gross incomes of at least $100,000 claimed an astounding 40% of these deductions. 
When Congress is cutting essential programs to balance the budget, it is simply unsound policy to subsidize gamblers. I urge my colleagues to join me, Senator Chafee, Senator Coats, and Senator Inhofe in supporting legislation to repeal the gambling loss tax deduction, and in taking a step to ensure that we balance the budget in a way that reflects our nation's priorities and invests in our nation's future.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Corporal David B. Champagne, USMC, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for service in Korea. In honor of the sacrifice made by this heroic young man, I am introducing a bill to name the new post office at 551 Kingstown Road in Wakefield, RI the `David B. Champagne Post Office' with my Rhode Island colleague Senator Chafee. 
The son of Mr. and Mrs. Bernard L. Champagne, Corporal Champagne served in the National Guard before graduating from South Kingstown High School and enlisting in the Marines in March 1951. He was the only Rhode Island resident to receive this nation's highest award for valor, the Medal of Honor, for service in Korea. The citation accompanying the Medal read: 
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a fire team leader of Company A, First Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 28 May 1952. Advancing with his platoon in the initial assault of the company against a strongly fortified and heavily defended hill position, Corporal Champagne skillfully led his fire team through a veritable hail of intense enemy machine-gun, small-arms and grenade fire, overrunning trenches and a series of almost impregnable bunker positions before reaching the crest of the hill and placing his men in defensive positions. Suffering a painful leg wound while assisting in repelling the ensuing hostile counterattack, which was launched under cover of a murderous hail of mortar and artillery fire, he steadfastly refused evacuation and fearlessly continued to control his fire team. When the enemy counterattack increased in intensity, and a hostile grenade landed in the midst of the fire team, Corporal Champagne unhesitating seized the deadly missile and hurled it in the direction of the approaching enemy. As the grenade left his hand, it exploded, blowing off his hand and throwing him out of the trench. Mortally wounded by the enemy mortar fire while in this exposed position, Corporal Champagne, by his valiant leadership, fortitude and gallant spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of almost certain death, undoubtedly saved the lives of several of his fellow Marines. His heroic actions served to inspire all who observed him and reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country. 
In addition to the Medal of Honor, Corporal Champagne received the Korean Medal of Honor, the Rhode Island Cross, the Purple Heart, the National Defense Service Medal, the Korean Service Medal with 3 Battle Stars, the Korean Presidential Unit Citation, and the United Nation's Service Medal. 
Corporal Champagne is truly an American hero. In the best spirit of this country, he volunteered to go to a foreign land and fight for people he had never met, so that they would not be subjected to the rule of a totalitarian regime. 
In my home state of Rhode Island a Korean War Memorial is under construction at the State Veterans' Cemetery. Carved on that memorial will be the same words that are inscribed on the Korean War Memorial dedicated in Washington, DC: `Freedom Is Not Free.' Corporal Champagne understood the meaning of those words. He unhesitatingly paid the ultimate price to preserve the freedom of South Korea and to save the lives of his men. 
This legislation would pay proper tribute to this remarkable young man and commemorate his incredible valor for future generations. I ask my colleagues to join Senator Chafee and me in honoring Corporal David B. Champagne by supporting this bill.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, for the past 9 years the visa waiver pilot program has been a resounding success. Today, citizens from twenty-five countries are able to travel to the United States without the burden of obtaining a visa from a U.S. embassy before leaving home. Because the program makes travel so much easier, business has boomed, tourism has soared, and family members have been able to be with each other on occasions when it mattered. Cutting the bureaucratic red tape has strengthened our economic and cultural ties with participating countries. In addition, streamlining this administrative process has enabled the State Department to use its resources more efficiently and effectively, saving the American taxpayers thousands of dollars. 
Today, I am introducing a bill which will extend the privilege of the visa waiver program to additional countries with strong ties to our Nation. This legislation will slightly modify the criteria that a country must meet in order to participate in the program. Under these modifications, one country which will gain admittance to the visa waiver program is Portugal. Portugal is one of only two members of the European Union which is not included in the visa waiver program. It is time for that inequity to be corrected. 
The Portuguese were some of the earliest explorers and settlers of the United States and they have been contributing to our country ever since. Over one million U.S. citizens claim Portuguese descent and there are thriving Portuguese communities from New England to Hawaii. We owe these members of our American community the opportunity to see family members who live in Portugal when they need them, without the worry and hassle of obtaining a visa. 
Inclusion in the visa waiver program will promote the economic exchange between Portugal and the United States. Portugal is a valued trading partner and if members of the business community are able to travel to the U.S. without delaying to obtain a business, their contributions to this country will only increase. At a time when the U.S. economy is the wonder of the world and our market is truly global, our country should seek out and facilitate additional economic opportunities. 
In 1974, the citizens of Portugal overthrew a dictatorship and established a democracy. Their brave actions began a wave of democratization that spread across the world and is still reverberating today. No other country reflects the principles of the United States better than Portugal. We should do everything possible to lower the barriers and strengthen the exchange between our two countries. Including Portugal in the visa waiver program is an important first step in this process.

Mr. REED. I thank the Senator for his graciousness. Mr. President, my amendment would take the Finance Committee bill with its cuts to Medicare of about $115 billion and simply remove several provisions which I think jeopardize the long-term well-being and health of the Medicare system. 
These provisions are: raising the age limit to 67; striking the home health care payment; it would add my amendment, the Medicare balanced billing protection; my amendment would also eliminate the provisions that means tests Medicare; and finally, it would eliminate the medical savings account. 
This amendment would allow the Senate to vote for solvency of the Medicare system but not engage in some of these experiments that are in the Finance Committee bill, experiments which I think will weaken the overall system by driving healthy seniors away from Medicare and leaving the Medicare system to deal with very sick seniors, which is not a way to run a proper insurance program. 
This measure, I believe, will restore solvency and allow a more comprehensive review of the Medicare system.

Mr. REED. I thank you, Mr. President, 
Mr. President, my amendment this evening gives my colleagues of the Senate a clear choice to stabilize the solvency of the Medicare trust fund without including some of the provisions which we already talked about this afternoon, and others which undermine the concept of a universal Medicare system. Medicare provides excellent health care for all of our seniors--it is a system that has operated for 30 years, a system that works, a system that is supported by the vast majority of Americans. 
Specifically, what my amendment will do is provide for the revenue savings and the cost savings that are incorporated in the underlying bill, but remove from that bill those provisions that harm the structural integrity of the Medicare program. 
My amendment would retain the Medicare eligibility age of 65. It would strike the home health copay. It would add the current law that protects Medicare recipients with respect to balanced-billing protection for those recipients and beneficiaries who may choose to opt for private fee-for-service Medicare health coverage. It would also eliminate the means-tested provisions for Medicare. And, finally, it would eliminate the medical savings account as a Medicare option. 
All of these provisions which I have mentioned are not necessary to preserve the solvency of the Medicare fund. We can achieve solvency by agreeing to the savings and reimbursement changes which are in the underlying bill. And we can provide for a solvent Medicare system in the future without endangering the Medicare program itself. 
I would like to comment on the specifics in my substitute. 
First, as I mentioned before, my amendment would strike the rollback of the Medicare eligibility age to 67. I realize that this has been debated today. But this is such a critical point that it bears restating. 
Reducing the Medicare eligibility age is exactly the wrong way to proceed with respect to health care reform--not just Medicare reform, but health care reform in this country. Our goal should be to encourage more participation in health care, to extend health care benefits to more Americans and not to reduce health care coverage. 
Indeed, it is a cruel irony tonight that one of the beneficial aspects of the underlying legislation is the extension of health care to more children and, yet, we are contracting the health care coverage of seniors. 
I believe also that this provision will send shockwaves throughout our entire health care system as companies are forced to realize the additional liability under current accounting rules. Many employers provide health care to their employees until Medicare eligibility age. If that age is rolled back, employers incur more costs. If they incur more costs and have to show it on the balance sheet, they are going to have to make very difficult choices not only about the coverage for retirees, but also if they are going to continue to provide coverage for their current workers. 
This is something that should not be done lightly and, indeed, represents, a retreat from our commitment to provide more and more Americans with access to good quality health care. 
Let me also suggest with respect to the home health copay that this is a provision which does not support those people who particularly need this type of support. Forty-three percent of the individuals who would have to pay this copay have incomes under $10,000 a year. Two-thirds of persons using these benefits are women, one-third of whom live alone. 
Just yesterday we heard from a woman--an 82-year-old woman 
--who desperately relies upon home health care services. She--and many others like her--would be in no condition to pay the increased costs. This provision should also be stricken. 
With respect to medical savings accounts, this is the provision which I think will go toward the unraveling of the Medicare system as we know it. Under the MSA concept, a senior would be required to use Medicare money to buy a catastrophic health policy, and any savings left over from Medicare's payment could be put in the medical savings account. 
This provision will attract wealthy seniors who, frankly, can pay for some of these costs. It would also attract those people who are healthy. Essentially, they would be making a judgment whether they are healthy enough to run the risk of avoiding significant illness, and, if so, this is a good option. If they are not so healthy, then their best rational choice would be to go for fee-for-service, traditional Medicare. The consequence would be that we would see wealthy, healthy seniors leave the Medicare system and, with them, the proportion of money that is contributed in their behalf. The remaining seniors would be sicker, older, and more likely to use services. This would put increased pressure on the Medicare program. 
Those who see this as a way of making the system more solvent and more secure are missing the point. MSAs would lead to a situation in which the system is harmed, more costs are piled upon Medicare, Medicare becomes more difficult to fund and, indeed, to support. 
Also, my substitute would eliminate the means testing provision. Philosophically, I think Medicare works because it is seen as a health care program and not a welfare program. To the extent that we make this part B premium differential between wealthy individuals and nonwealthy individuals, this program will take on quickly the shades of a welfare program. It will undercut the tremendous support in all ranges of American life for the Medicare system. 
This part B premium adjustment is done in the context of a voluntary system, a system in which seniors might perceive--particularly wealthy seniors--that it is no longer a good deal to be part of part B. These seniors could voluntarily leave or buy other types of insurance--in fact the industry, I think, right now is probably planning to sell. 
Once again, we will see the unraveling of the Medicare system as more people leave and as their contributions are taken with them from the Medicare system. 
All of these together will lead to a situation in which we hear the first crack in the system. And as time goes on, those cracks will widen to deep fissures, and the solid support that we have today will ultimately erode. 
A final point is with respect to a provision in the underlying bill, the lack of balanced billing protections in the private fee-for-service option. Current Medicare law balance billing limits protect seniors now and would be undercut because of the options in the underlying bill that allow beneficiaries to choose medical policies in which physicians could charge beyond the Medicare limits. This balanced billing protection exists for fee-for-service, traditional Medicare recipients. It should be in place for all beneficiaries of Medicare regardless of the program they choose. My amendment would add balance billing limits to the Medicare Choice provisions of the bill currently without them. 
In a sense, what this amendment does in the nature of a substitute is say that we can provide solvency for Medicare. We can go ahead and provide the opportunities to make careful, comprehensive review of the system. We can make changes. But we don't have to do it today. We don't have to have to do it hastily. We don't have to do it in an ad hoc fashion which misses the systematic impact of all of these changes we have talked about today. Rather, we can--as I think the agreement reached with respect to the budget agreement several months ago indicates--we can stabilize the system, reduce the increasing costs associated 
with Medicare by roughly $115 billion and not defer, but study carefully and comprehensively and thoroughly the impact of some of these proposed changes. 
This amendment stabilizes the system. It eliminates precipitous changes in Medicare that will undermine the program--changes in this bill that may leave us in a situation where Medicare is no longer a universal program in which all of our seniors can participate. Medicare should continue to be a program in which all of our seniors can and will participate, and a program in which all of our seniors will be guaranteed high quality health care that they can afford.

Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Illinois for yielding. I join him in my opposition to this provision in the bill. I also have great respect and regard for Senator Kerrey, the primary sponsor of this provision. He has courageously identified many issues with respect to Medicare and has provided great insight, but in this particular situation I believe that to raise the eligible age for Medicare is going in exactly the wrong direction. It forgets why we created Medicare in the first place in the mid-1960s. 
The overwhelming reality was that seniors at that age could not get health care. That is why the Government stepped in. Private insurance companies were unwilling to sell insurance to those people at any reasonable price. Many things have changed since the mid-1960s--the demographics of our population, the efficacy of a health care program, the longevity of our citizens--but one thing has not changed, and that is the unwillingness of private insurance to step in and provide affordable and accessible health insurance to seniors. 
Today, 13 percent of the 21 million people aged 55 to 64 lack health insurance, and by adopting this provision we will simply add to that number because, now, from age 65 to 66, they will not have access to the Medicare system. Therefore, we have to, I think, maintain a situation where the Medicare system begins at age 65. 
Indeed, I hope that we will endeavor to try to develop programs that would broaden the base of health care insurance for all Americans. It is quite disturbing to listen to the statistics cited by my colleague from Illinois, and to point out that many, many companies are now no longer insuring, as a matter of routine, their employees and, consequently, the percentage of insured Americans, particularly in the later years of their work life, is declining. We would add to that precipitous decline by adopting this particular amendment. 
Indeed, also, we have to understand that the majority of Medicare beneficiaries between the ages of 65 and 67, who would be affected by this amendment, have incomes below $30,000. They certainly would not be in a position to pay a $10,000 a year private insurance premium, as is evident in some States, like Illinois. Often they are single, poor, unemployed. They would have no recourse. And this is not the way to fix the Medicare system--by denying health care insurance to people, by essentially pushing them out of the system of health care with the idea that we will somehow stabilize and increase the longevity of our health care system. 
There is another aspect of this that should be studied much more deeply before we embark on such a change; that is, many employers have provided health care benefits to their employees until they reach the Medicare age of eligibility. As a result, if we were to push back the eligibility table, we would require corporations throughout this country to immediately recognize, because of accounting rules, an increase in their liability, a significant increase in their liability. This could force them to rethink their overall health care strategy to accelerate the decline of health care not only for seniors but for working Americans, as companies simply say, `we can't afford to shoulder this burden any longer.' As a result, we also, I think, have to recognize the significant impact this would have on the application of health care insurance throughout our society. As one employer wrote to me, `The impact of this legislation will be to discourage companies from offering comprehensive retiree health benefits to their employees.' 
I think we have to be very careful and thoughtful about how we reform Medicare. We all want to stabilize the system, to ensure solvency. We can do that without adopting this amendment. To move away from a guarantee of health care for seniors, beginning at 65, is a retreat that I don't think we should make and I don't think we have to make. Therefore, I join my colleague from Illinois in objecting to this provision of the bill before us today. I thank the Senator and yield back my time.

Mr. REED. If the Senator will yield one more time. The fact is that this will create a significant system impact. For example, private companies may change their insurance packages, 
et cetera. There is another impact, also. In this country, sick people--and I hope in this country they will still get care someplace. As a result, without the Medicare Program, they will be thrust upon the hospitals for uncompensated care and thrust upon--if they are low-income citizens--Medicaid programs or special programs at the State level. So as we hope to save at the Federal level, we very well may generate other costs, and perhaps larger costs, at local-State levels and in other insurance programs. So, essentially, our commitment to Medicare, I feel, should be maintained. I, again, concur with the Senator and thank him for yielding me this time to further comment.

Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Vermont and my friend and colleague from Nebraska for their leadership on this very important issue. 
Mr. President, I am here to support, as an original cosponsor, the Leahy-Hagel landmine legislation, which would ban deployment of landmines after January 1 of the year 2000. The fact that this legislation has already acquired 56 cosponsors in the Senate is testimony to the compelling force of their logic and their argument. We should, in fact, ban landmines across the world, and we should begin with this legislation. 
Antipersonnel landmines have always been one of the greatest dangers facing our troops--one of the most horrific weapons on the battlefield. Indeed, the only United States casualty we have sustained in operations in Bosnia was an individual who was killed by a landmine. 
These landmines are scattered across the world. One hundred ten million active landmines are hidden in as many as 64 countries. And while 100,000 landmines a year are identified, deactivated and removed, another 2 million to 5 million are planted. These landmines claim about 2,000 victims a month. These are civilians. These are children. These are women. These are individuals who are not combatants but are simply at the wrong place at the wrong time. 
In the military, there is a quite strict regime for using landmines: Mapping them out, putting them in place, having the records so that, at the conclusion of hostilities, they can be identified, deactivated, and removed. But what has happened is that these landmines are now being used by renegade bands, by militias, by paramilitary units, and they are literally being scattered about those countries indiscriminately. 
I was in the former Yugoslavia and Bosnia a few months ago visiting our troops and visiting Russians who are participating with us. Literally within a few yards of the camp of these Russian soldiers is an area into which they cannot enter because it is strewn with landmines. They are unidentified, unable to be removed. This is just one example of the dangers that lurk because of the proliferation of landmines throughout this world. 
I hope that we will move aggressively to pass this legislation. It will be a testament, I think, to those individuals who are sponsoring it. But also it will help highlight other initiatives that need to be on the table. 
For example, in October 1996, Canada announced the goal of completing a treaty totally banning the use, production, and stockpiling of landmines by the year 2000. In addition to that effort, two months later the United Nations General Assembly, at the urging of the United States, passed a resolution by a unanimous vote, to vigorously pursue a treaty banning the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of antipersonnel landmines. These treaty negotiations will receive, I think, tremendous impetus from the actions we take on this floor. 
I hope this bill will be passed quickly into law. I hope we can essentially begin here today to outlaw the use of landmines for the protection, not only of our own forces, but for the hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians throughout the world who are, each day, subject to the dangers of landmines. This will make the world safer. It will not harm our military security. And it will give us, I think, a goal and the momentum to move forward toward a more comprehensive landmine ban. 
Again I compliment and commend my colleagues, Senator Leahy and Senator Hagel, for their efforts and for their leadership on this important measure.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, in April, President Clinton with former Presidents Bush and Ford convened a Summit on Service in Philadelphia. They and other national leaders called upon young people to serve their communities and urged them to spread the spirit of service throughout the country. 
The Corporation for National Service [CNS] is among those advancing this spirit. Its mission, as my colleagues are well aware, is to help the country meet its educational, environmental, and public safety needs through service projects conducted and led by young people. The young people who participate in the AmeriCorps Program assist needy individuals, families, and their communities, while building their own self-esteem and earning grants to help them meet the financial costs of higher education. 
Since its inception, the Corporation for National Service has taken steps to address the charges of its critics by making necessary changes. Today, CNS fulfills its mandates successfully, efficiently, and cost effectively. In fact, a University of Minnesota study shows that AmeriCorps Programs in that State return $3.90 in benefits for every dollar spent. Studies in Washington State reveal a similar return on investment.

Mr. REED. I thank the Senator for yielding. I commend him for his leadership on this important issue. And I also want to commend my colleague from Illinois for his very eloquent statement on this very important topic. 
I join my colleagues today in urging the administration to submit the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the Senate for its consideration and, hopefully, ratification. On this day in 1963, President John F. Kennedy delivered his famous address to the graduates of American University. He made his famous call for peace for all time. He was then searching for a solution to a tense nuclear standoff. He stated in that speech: 
Today the expenditure of billions of dollars every year on weapons acquired for the purpose of making sure we never need to use them is essential to keeping the peace. But surely the acquisition of such idle stockpiles--which can only destroy and never create--is not the only, much less the most efficient means of assuring peace. 
Mr. President, today we have an alternative means of assuring peace. After years of negotiations and false starts, 60 countries have approved the text of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty which would prohibit all nuclear weapons test explosions or other nuclear explosions anywhere in the world. 
This treaty would prevent deployment and impede the development of these deadly weapons. It would not enter into force however until ratified by all 44 states which possess nuclear power, including the five countries which have harnessed this power to make nuclear weapons. Its comprehensiveness would reassure the 177 nonnuclear weapons states that nuclear proliferation is waning, thus eliminating the need of these states to develop their nuclear capability. 
The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty clearly has one purpose: To end the arms race and prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It seeks to accomplish its goal in an objective and fair manner. 
The membership of the executive council, the treaty's principal decisionmaking body, will be distributed evenly throughout the world. 
An international monitoring system will use scientific methods to detect and identify prohibited nuclear explosions. A network of seismic, hydroacoustic, and radionuclide monitoring stations will continuously collect and analyze data to ensure global compliance. 
A consultation and clarification regime will provide state parties with the opportunity to address accusations of noncompliance before an onsite inspection is ordered. And any state party which demands a frivolous or abusive inspection may be subject to punitive measures. 
How can the United States not take the lead in this cause? If we ratify this treaty, others will follow. Imagine a day when world peace is not decided by the size of nuclear stockpiles, but 
rather by the will and wishes of the people of the world. This treaty is the next step toward that reality. 
Mr. President, in his book of several years ago, `The Good War,' author Studs Terkel presented an oral history of those touched by World War II. He spoke with many individuals whose lives were shaped by the bomb. Indeed, he spoke with survivors of Hiroshima, who still do not talk about the events of August 6, 1945, without breaking down. 
He spoke with an American sailor who swam in the waters of the Marshall Islands the day after a test explosion. He died of cancer before the book was published. 
But perhaps Terkel's most disturbing chapter is his last, when he interviewed some children, aged 11 to 15, on a Chicago street corner in 1965. 
One child, Sam, stated, `I hope I can die of old age, before the world starts THE war.' Ethel then chimed in, `I wanna see if I'm gonna grow up first. I mean, I might not live to be grown up. Cause I don't know when my time is up * * * I never know if I could die overnight from the bomb or something.' And finally Raymond said, `This might sound crazy, but I'd like to see a world without bombs. I mean without wars. It would be a lot bigger, the world. Maybe we could enjoy it more. Get a lot out of life, without worrying you would be blown up tomorrow.' 
Mr. President, generations growing up after World War II were haunted by the specter of annihilation by nuclear weapons. We now have an opportunity to rid these fears, the fears of our children, forever. The American people want this treaty. Over 80 percent of the public support its ratification. It is incumbent upon us to consider this treaty and to ratify it, to put to rest once and for all the specter of nuclear annihilation. 
I yield back my time to the Senator from Iowa.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the Rhode Island Historical Society on the occasion of its 175th anniversary. 
Founded in 1822, the Rhode Island Historical Society was established for the purpose of rescuing artifacts and records pertaining to the history of our State and spreading the legacy of Rhode Island history. The society today represents the fourth oldest historical society in the United States and remains as one of the noble guardians of American history and culture. Over the years the society's repository of Rhode Island history and culture has grown under the stewardship of generations of knowledgeable scholars, dedicated staff, and the generosity of gracious benefactors. 
From its humble beginnings, the society has served as a haven for precious artifacts which serve to record and preserve the rich history of Rhode Island. Today, we mark not only the past accomplishments of the Rhode Island Historical Society, but we pause at an exciting threshold as we embark upon the creation of Heritage Harbor. 
Housed at the site of a former power plant at the head of Narragansett Bay, the historical society will lead a consortium of museums and cultural organizations in forming Heritage Harbor. The new community will bring together the stories and treasures of the Ocean State through entertainment and enlightenment. Remaining true to Rhode Island's founder Roger Williams, this new endeavor will be a lively experiment. It will teach, entertain, and inspire. The Heritage Harbor promises to bring together the diverse cultures and communities of Rhode Island to celebrate the time, traditions, and our many contributions to collective greatness of this Nation. 
Mr. President, I would ask that my colleagues join me in applauding the Rhode Island Historical Society as we mark this milestone of 175 years, celebrating its legacy, both past and future.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the achievement of Mercymount Country Day School of Cumberland, RI, which was recently honored as a U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon School. 
As I think all in this chamber know, it is a highly regarded distinction to be named a Blue Ribbon School, since these schools represent some of the cream of our educational crop. Through an intensive selection process beginning at the State level and continuing through a Federal Review Panel of 100 top educators, many of the very best public and private schools in the Nation are identified as deserving of this honor. These are schools that are particularly effective meeting local, State, and national goals. But, Mr. President, this honor is not about determining who is best, it is about learning what works in educating today's children--the leaders of tomorrow. 
Now, more than ever, it is important that we make every effort to reach out to students, that we truly engage and challenge them, and that we make their education come alive. At the Mercymount Country Day School in Rhode Island, partnerships between parents and teachers have made an enormous difference in the education of their students. They have understood that the quality of education depends not only upon the efforts of schools and government; it also depends upon the ideas and innovation of parents and community. At Mercymount, parent-teacher cooperation has brought computers into the classroom, and their `Pull the Plug' on TV initiative has helped students get away from television sets and into reading and other challenging activities. Mercymount has also developed a wonderful fine arts program, and as research has shown, the pursuit of education in the arts at an early age improves a child's cognitive ability. Again, Mercymount is making a huge difference in the lives of its students. 
Mr. President, the Blue Ribbon School initiative shows us the very best we can do for students, and the techniques that can be replicated in all schools to help all students learn. I am proud to say that in Rhode Island we can look to a school like Mercymount Country Day. Under the leadership of its principal, Sister Martha Mulligan, its capable faculty, and its improved parents, Mercymount will continue to be a shining example for years to come.

Mr. REED. I thank the Chair. I will make two very brief points. 
First, in 1972, we passed the Pell grant. If we simply indexed that grant for inflation, the maximum Pell grant today would be $4,300. We are asking for an increase from $3,000 in this budget to $3,500. Second, back in 1980, the maximum Pell grant covered 72 percent of the cost of a 4-year public college. Now it covers roughly 20 percent. We need more. That is what the Wellstone-Reed amendment asks us to do.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, no one objects to Pell grants. This should be a vote about expanding the Pell grants so we can change the reality that faces working families in this country. 
In 1975, 80 percent of Federal financial assistance was in the form of grants and 20 percent in loans. Today, those numbers are reversed. I believe we should expand the Pell grants along the lines of the Wellstone-Reed amendment. 
I hope we can do that sometime.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, like many I recognize that this budget agreement is a good faith effort. It shows a recognition by Republicans that their past plans were extreme and unpopular. Indeed, the agreement acknowledges, to a degree, that Americans want us to invest in priorities. 
However, for all its positive steps, I do not believe it is the right budget outline for our future. I support a balanced budget plan, but I cannot support a resolution which sets in motion a questionable package of unfair tax cuts and other misguided priorities. 
The agreement contains a number of laudable elements. The welfare act's excesses are curbed. It takes a small first step toward health care coverage for children, and important education tax credits are provided. And it does purport to continue the march toward a balanced budget. 
Indeed, we would not be able to consider this agreement without the 1993 budget agreement. With only Democratic votes, that package has cut the deficit for 4 years in a row and brought the deficit to its lowest point as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product [GDP] since 1974. Ironically, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle predicted the 1993 budget would cause economic collapse and ruin. Yet, today, the economic growth generated, in part, by the 1993 budget has brought us to the point where it is conceivable to reach budget balance. Today's national economy is a marvel of low inflation, low unemployment, and strong revenues, which is good news for many although it has yet to reach some in my State of Rhode Island. 
Again, there are sound elements of this plan, but I would caution that a budget resolution is short on specifics, long on figures, and tends to obscure the magnitude of what is under consideration. While the budget resolution is nonbinding, it imposes an austere procedural and fiscal discipline on what the Senate can and cannot do. Certainly the defeat of the Hatch-Kennedy amendment showed that this budget resolution can, and could continue to be, used to thwart efforts to meet even the health care needs of America's children. 
Mr. President, for all its effort, I believe this agreement falls short in a number of key areas. 
First, the deal's economic assumptions are optimistic, and are based on a $225 billion midnight revenue windfall estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. Sadly, the accuracy of these estimates is not guaranteed. Since 1980, CBO's revenue estimates have been wrong 11 times, and, on several occasions, these estimates have been off by more than $50 billion. I would also add that try as the Senate might, the business cycle cannot be legislated out of existence. My sincerest hope is that the current economic growth continues, however, history shows that what goes up usually comes down. If we experience a downturn, this agreement could need massive retuning, which would probably not include the elimination of tax breaks for the well-to-do, but would mean pain for society's most vulnerable. 
Second, and, most important, I believe the agreement's nontargeted tax breaks are the wrong direction for an agreement which claims to balance the budget. When we are engaged in the task of trying to balance the budget, we should not make the job more difficult by enacting questionable tax breaks for those individuals who are already benefiting handsomely from the current economic growth. 
This agreement calls for tax cuts totaling $250 billion over 10 years. When it comes to taxes, what starts small, explodes later. Indeed, 44 percent of the cost of the agreement's tax breaks are packed into the years 2005, 2006, and 2007. Indeed, the cost of these tax cuts grows 32 percent in the final 2 years of the deal. What does this portend for the second 10 years of the agreement? According to the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the revenue loss could reach up to $650 billion from 2008 to 2017. I would hasten to remind my colleagues that this is the time when the baby boom retirees will begin to place enormous pressure on already strained entitlement programs. 
In contrast, targeted, middle-class tax breaks, like the Hope Scholarship, are supportable because they help working families afford college and prepare their children for the competitive international economy. Unfortunately, the agreement lacks even the attractiveness of closing corporate welfare loopholes that subsidize the shipment of jobs overseas and other questionable business activities to pay for tax breaks. 
Mr. President, the specifics of the tax bill this agreement calls for are questionable to say the least. As the resolution's year-by-year revenue loss tables show, there is plenty of budgetary room for time bombs and gimmicks. Indeed, after the revenue loss from the tax breaks doubles between 1999 and 2000, it falls in 2001 and 2002, but it keeps rising and explodes after 2007. As others have pointed out, the pattern is not accidental. Instead, it is designed to permit a number of questionable tax gimmicks to give the appearance of fairness and fiscal propriety. 
One such revenue trick is to phase in the capital gains indexation which conveniently hides the first 5 year revenue loss and assumes more revenue early on in the second 5 years as investors rush to cash in on capital gains indexing. According to experts, capital gains indexing will cost three times as much in the second 5 years as in the first 5 years of the budget deal. 
Some may argue that if gimmicks are employed and subsequently wreak havoc on deficit reduction, Senators will do the right thing and repeal these taxes. Mr. President, I am not so sure that you can put the tax cut genie back in the bottle. This agreement contains no commitment to control a revenue loss explosion. Indeed, all of the President's requests for such assurances were rejected by Republicans. The word `permanent' is used to describe the capital gains tax cuts, but not the President's education tax incentives. I would also add that it is very difficult to repeal taxes both politically and practically. For example, phased-in capital gains indexing and other revenue games are hard to repeal or modify because taxpayers will have accepted the Government's tax cut offer on which the Senate would be hard pressed to renege. 
But, I am not simply concerned with revenue loss and tax cut chicanery. I believe that many of the tax cuts called for in this agreement are of dubious merit and value. The best example of this fact is an across the board capital gains tax cut. Such a proposal is not investment oriented. There will be no holding period or connection to investments in small businesses. As Paul Volker, former head of the Federal Reserve said before the Senate Finance Committee:  
`. . . a near-term reduction in the capital gains tax rate from present levels does not strike me as a pressing matter, especially given the current performance of the economy and the medium and longer-term budgetary prospects . . . [A] very large across the board reduction of capital gains taxes poses serious problems of equity and complexity, of revenue loss and of distortion of decision making. 
If public policy is to make a serious effort to raise the level of savings and investment, and do so equitably, the priorities seem to me clear. We should move as fast as we can toward a surplus in the Federal budget.' 
There are those who would argue that a capital gains cut would help millions of Americans. However, the typical beneficiary of a capital gains cut is not a middle-income family. Indeed, households with incomes over $100,000 receive about three-quarters of all capital gains income, and as the Joint Tax Committee reported--JCS-4-97: 
`. . . [W]hile many taxpayers may benefit from an exclusion or indexing for capital gains, the bulk of the dollar value of any tax reduction will go to those taxpayers who realize the bulk of the dollar value of gains.' 
In other words a capital gains tax cut benefits the wealthy who actually have capital gains. 
There are other questionable tax cuts in this plan, such as the estate tax cut which would only benefit the top 1.2 percent of estates and the backloaded IRA proposal which aims to increase savings for retirement, but causes a revenue loss explosion when the pressure on entitlements is most acute due to the baby boomers. Again, the President had tax proposals which were better and helped family business owners without significantly adding to the deficit. 
Third, while the agreement correctly focuses on education through a $35 billion targeted tax incentives for college costs, a commitment to increase the Pell grant for fiscal year 1998, a commitment to technology in the classroom, and a minimal commitment to improving literacy, the need may exceed what this plan allows due to its 10 percent reduction in domestic investment in real terms. Groups like the Committee for Education Funding are greatly concerned about the restrictive discretionary spending caps in the agreement which could severely thwart efforts to invest in our education needs. The agreement contains no school construction funds and little room in budget caps for such an initiative. There is no room for further Pell grant increases, as the defeat of my amendment to increase Pell grant funding demonstrates. There are scarce resources for the estimated $4.8 billion price tag to reform schools as suggested by the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future. Moreover, there is no commitment to fund Goals 2000, School to Work, national service, or the burgeoning need for research into early childhood development 
Fourth, the agreement makes very modest room for health care needs, and, as I have stated there was no room in this agreement for a more robust children's health care program paid for with a tax on tobacco. I am also concerned that there are limited resources available for the National Institutes of Health's fight against cancer and HIV. 
Fifth, I am concerned that the $115 billion in Medicare cuts called for in the agreement may exceed what is absolutely needed to preserve Medicare. Indeed, the level of cuts in the years 2001 and 2002 total $69 billion. I am also disturbed that no solid estimates are available for the premium increases that many seniors face. The agreement also ignores the long-term-solvency issues of the Medicare program and may leave some with the mistaken impression that Medicare is guaranteed to be there for them. There are even those in the other body who would like to add the dubious concept of medical savings accounts to this plan. 
Sixth, the agreement ignores our investment deficit, and even its new initiatives lose ground due to inflation and in relation to the growing tax cuts. Specifically, infrastructure investment is frozen at a time when the U.S. Department of Transportation estimates we need $50 billion each year just to properly maintain our transportation system. Last week, a Rhode Island television station ran a series on the poor road conditions of my State, but sadly this agreement provides only minimal assistance to fix Rhode Island's roads. In the area of housing, the agreement notably extends essential section 8 contracts for senior housing, but leaves little for other affordable housing programs. Last, my colleagues should ask themselves whether the budget caps employed to offset the cost of unsound tax cuts will crowd out important programs and hamstring the Senate's ability to respond to the needs of all Americans in an increasingly competitive world? 
The agreement does not continue the path of deficit reduction begun by the 1993 budget agreement. Indeed, the deficit actually increases in each of the next 3 years from $67 billion this year to $90 billion in 1998 to $90 billion in 1999 to $83 billion in 2000. Then miraculously, the deficit falls as the Congress starts to cut $69 billion from Medicare, $49.7 billion from domestic investments, $46 billion from defense, and $10 billion from Medicaid. All these reductions fall in just 2 years, leaving little margin for unsound budget estimates or exploding tax cuts. 
Mr. President, on balance there is much in this agreement that should be applauded, and the bipartisanship it displays is laudable. It acknowledges that the Contract With America embodied the wrong policies and priorities for our future. It provides for some investments in health care and education. It restores some benefits for legal immigrants hurt by last year's welfare act, and it builds on the success of the 1993 deficit reduction package. 
However, the fundamental question is, Does this agreement meet the challenges of the future? Will it allow us to truly reform education? Will it help more working families afford college? Will it rebuild our roads, bridges, and rails? Will it provide opportunities for those making the transition from welfare to work? Most important, is this agreement fair or does it ask too much of those who can least afford it? 
Mr. President, this budget resolution is not the plan for our future. It is too generous where fiscal discipline is required and too tight-fisted where investment is direly needed. And, sadly, it fails to meet the test of fairness and honesty we owe hard working American families. 
Mr. President, as the specific legislation to implement this agreement is developed, I am hopeful that its excesses can be curbed, and I would urge my colleagues to accept amendments which would make this plan worthy of greater support.

Mr. REED. I want to thank my colleague from Minnesota for yielding me this time and also for sponsoring this amendment along with Senator Bingaman and Senator Moynihan. 
Today we are offering an amendment to increase the maximum Pell grant to $3,500. The Pell grant holds a very special meaning for me. In the last 6 years as a Member of the other body I have worked to open up further access to higher education. The foundation of that access to higher education is the Pell grant. 
As you know it is probably the enduring legacy of my predecessor, Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island. One of his most significant accomplishments was the creation of the basic educational opportunity grant program in 1972 during the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Later, this basic opportunity grant was named in his honor and has become the famous Pell grant. Its purpose then and now is to assist low-income Americans to gain access to postsecondary education, access which is critical not only to their future but to the future of this Nation. 
Going back to the very beginning of the Pell grants, the avowed purpose was to `in combination with reasonable family and student contributions and other Federal grant aid meet at least 75 percent of the student's costs of attendance.' Sadly, we have not met that 75 percent, and we need, in fact, to raise the Pell grant so that we can begin to recoup some of the original purpose and allow students to meet the significant cost increases in higher education. 
This program was premised on Senator Pell's belief, which is my belief, and indeed I believe the belief of so many people in this Chamber, that everyone who is qualified should have the opportunity to pursue higher education. The Pell grant has been the cornerstone of this effort for many, many years. Since its creation, over 60 million Pell grants have been awarded, providing over $75 billion in aid to students across the Nation. 
In the first year of the program, 1973-74 over 176,000 students received the Pell grants. By 1980-81, this total had grown to 2.7 million recipients. Today, over 3.6 million American students receive Pell grants. 
In my home State of Rhode Island, that includes 16,000 recipients. 
This investment clearly assists our neediest students. In 1995-96, 54 percent of Pell grant recipients had income levels of less than $10,000. Only 9 percent of recipients had incomes over $30,000. 
In 1992, during the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, I worked closely with Senator Pell to increase the authorization level of the maximum Pell grant from $3,100 to $3,700 for the 1993-94 award cycle with increases thereafter of $200 a year with the hopes that by 1997-98 that we would have a maximum Pell grant on the order of $4,500 a year. But, as we are all aware, we have not come even close to that figure. Indeed, this year the appropriated maximum Pell grant was only $2,700--too little to meet the needs of so many students across this country. 
This lack of resources has had a dramatic impact on students struggling to go to college. Indeed, as college costs have increased over the past two decades at an annual rate of between 5 percent and 6 percent, consistently outpacing inflation, there has been a decline in the purchasing power of the Pell grant. 
According to the College Board, for 4-year private institutions the average tuition has gone up by over $14,000 between 1980 and 1996. In that same period the maximum Pell grant has only increased by about $950, and the average Pell grant only by about $733. As a result, back in 1980 the maximum Pell grant covered 33 percent of the tuition costs of a 4-year private institution. Now it only covers 14 percent. The average Pell grant covered 18 percent of costs of 4-year private colleges in 1980 and now it only covers 9 percent. 
If you look at public institutions--those great institutions which we feel have a special obligation to educate all of our citizens, particularly those coming from disadvantaged backgrounds--the maximum Pell grant back in 1980 covered 72 percent of a 4-year public college. Today it only covers 22 percent. 
As I said before, the grant has not hardly kept up with inflation. If we had simply paid the Pell grant at inflation we would today be looking at not a $2,700 maximum grant but a $4,300 maximum grant. 
So, before us we have the obligation to raise the maximum Pell grant. I am pleased to note that the proposal in the budget does increase it by $300. But that is not sufficient to keep up with the accelerating costs that I have described. The Wellstone-Reed amendment builds on this request within this budget--the President's request--by increasing the maximum Pell grant from $2,700 to $3,500. This would be a $500 increase above the President's proposal. 
It calls for a $6 billion investment over five years by an offset of additional reductions in corporate tax loopholes and corporate welfare to fund this increase. By increasing the Pell grant to $3,500 we would be able to extend this grant to several hundred thousand more students. The average Pell award among poorest students would increase by almost a third. 
And, Mr. President, we recognize--all of us--the absolute necessity of higher education. A college education really pays off. It pays off for our country, and it pays off for individual graduates of college. 
The National Bureau of Labor Statistics has estimated that 60 percent of all the new jobs between 1992 and the year 2005 will require an education beyond high school. Without these skills, college and postsecondary technical school graduates will not be able to man the economy of the 21st century. College education is also the key to higher wages. And one thing that we have been talking about repeatedly here is how do we raise the wages of Americans to give them a fair share in the progress of our economy? Education is the answer--higher education particularly. This translates dramatically. 
It is estimated that college graduates earn 50 percent more than high school graduates. In 40 years of expected work a college 
graduate is estimated to earn over a half-million dollars more than a high school graduate. All of this points to the critical need to provide additional access to higher education. 
Indeed, in terms of the national well being there have been studies, one of which is Trends in American Economic Growth, that point to the fact that 37 percent of our growth as a Nation from 1929 to 1982 was attributable to education, and particularly higher education. 
So not to invest in Pell grants, not to invest in opportunities for Americans to seek higher education, will I think undercut the goal we all have of growing and providing for an expanding and productive economy. 
So the amendment before us today is a step in the right direction, to provide more access to higher education, to allow particularly students from low-income households to go to school, to learn skills, to work in this economy, and to build strong communities so that we prosper not only economically but as citizens in a community of other citizens. 
If we shortchange the Pell grant and other educational programs, we will be reaping a very short and very transparent economy, one that in the clear light of day in the future will reveal itself to be not a savings but a massive lack of investment in the potential of our people and the success of our economy. 
I hope that we will all join together, as the distinguished Senator from Minnesota has done, to put forth this amendment and support this amendment and to increase our contribution to the Pell grant. Doing so I think will prepare us well for the new economy we face, an economy which demands these skills. The world is changed. Technology is forging new boundaries. Capital investment respects no boundaries. The only determinant I believe that we will have to ensure that we maintain our superiority as an economy is that we have the best educated people with access to higher education being the key to that success. 
This amendment will I hope take that strong step forward to accelerate the process of education for all of our citizens to ensure that we meet these technological challenges, to ensure that we have the best prepared work force, and that we also have people who respect and, indeed, appreciate the value of education because they benefited from it. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Minnesota. He has stated very well what is at stake--which is the future of the country through the future of individual students who have the opportunity to pursue higher education. 
There is something else that I might add. This proposed increase in the Pell grant compliments some of the other provisions in this bill where the President has proposed higher education tax credits and tax deductions which will assist, I think, generally speaking middle- and upper-income Americans. This Pell proposal would be particularly effective in helping low-income working Americans, and also particularly effective in helping a new and growing category of students--not recent high school graduates but those people who through circumstance were forced in midlife to retrain themselves. And there are so many in this situation nowadays due to downsizing. 
So for all of these reasons this is a very useful and critical step. 
I thank again the Senator for yielding.

Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I want to thank the Senator from New Jersey for yielding me time. 
I want to commend Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch for their leadership on this critical issue. I rise in support of their amendment. 
Let us be very clear. What we are talking about today is providing health care for the children of the working families of this country. And despite the budget agreement's impressive commitment of resources to Medicaid, particularly for children's health care, it is not sufficient to cover all the children in this country. The Senator from Utah was very eloquent and accurate in describing the vast gap that is still left despite the resources being made available to Medicaid. 
And why is it important that we provide health care for all of our children? Because every day we learn from medical science the critical--the critical--role of good health care in the development of children. Prenatal care, early infant care from zero to 3, and continuous health care for children are critical factors in providing for the intellectual and social development of children. 
If children do not have that health care, if we do not allow these young people access to high quality health care, we are incurring a huge cost to society and a huge limitation on their potential and their ability to contribute to society. 
Just last week, we celebrated the passage of the IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Part of it was a further commitment of significant Federal resources for special education. I wonder how much we could save in that account if we had a fully funded comprehensive health care program for all the children in this country. I think it would be significant. 
There is something else that is also very clear, and it is why this bill is so compelling in its logic. It is very clear that smoking is the No. 1 public health threat to this country. 
One out of five deaths in this society are attributed to smoking. And, sadly, 3,000 teenagers a day are turning to that habit. This legislation, the proposed amendment, recognizes the need for good health care for all of our children, and the way to fund that health care is through an increase in the tax on cigarettes. 
It is sound fiscal policy. It represents a pay-as-you-go strategy. Also, it represents a further deficit reduction because part of these funds will be applied to reducing the deficit. In effect, it is consistent with the very, very core of what we are about here today--providing access to good health care, sound policies for public health, and being fiscally responsible by reducing the deficit. 
And there is something else worth pointing out today. Many of the opponents of this legislation will point to the dire consequences of increasing the tax on cigarettes to the tobacco industry and certain regions of the country. But let me share with you what the cigarette companies themselves are contemplating. 
Weeks ago, when there was discussion of a possible settlement for some of the liability claims, most financial analysts conceded that the companies would routinely raise the price of cigarettes by 50 cents a pack, causing a slight decline in their number of customers--which some would consider a sound business decision. And I do not think there can be anyone on the floor of this body claiming an increase in the price of cigarettes by the companies as 
an unfortunate tax on low-income Americans. In effect, this tax is not only sound policy for funding this particular program, but also would not lead to the horrendous consequences which are being conjured up on this floor. 
One of the opponents said that it is a regressive tax, because the richest smoker in America would pay the same as the poorest smoker in America. I can guarantee you, the richest smoker in America has a health insurance policy. I cannot make that same guarantee for the children of this country. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is sound public health policy. It recognizes that we must make an investment in our children for our own productivity as a Nation and for their own ability to seize all the opportunities of this country. The amendment also is sound fiscal policy because the cigarette tax pays for the program and reduces the deficit. I do not think we can ask for more in this budget. 
I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor and strong supporter of Senator Moseley-Braun's school infrastructure amendment. 
One of the major problems facing elementary and secondary education today is the poor condition of our school buildings. In my home state of Rhode Island, many schools are in need of extensive repairs and upgrades. 
I have visited several of these schools, including the Harris Elementary School in Woonsocket which was built in 1876. To put this in perspective, in 1876 the nation celebrated the centennial of the United States; Rutherford B. Hayes was elected President by one vote; Custer confronted the Sioux at Little Big Horn; Alexander Graham Bell transmitted the first complete sentence by voice over wire; Henry Heinz put ketchup in a bottle; and Colorado became the 38th State. 
Sadly, the Harris Elementary School's library is a small trailer parked in the school's playground. In addition, I have received compelling footage of the condition of the schools in North Providence, including the Stephen Olney School, which has asbestos in the floors and water damaged classrooms, and the Centredale School, which has leaking classroom ceilings. 
These examples and numerous others across my State and the Nation show the urgent and real need for a school construction initiative. A problem of this magnitude demands a Federal response. 
Indeed, a recent General Accounting Office (GAO) report found that in Rhode Island 29 percent of schools report at least one inadequate building of any type; 61 percent have at least one inadequate building feature; 75 percent have at least one unsatisfactory environmental factor, such as heating and ventilation; and 37 percent have insufficient capability for computers. 
Nationally, the statistics are equally compelling. Fourteen million children, in one-third of the Nation's schools, are learning in buildings that need major renovations or should be replaced outright. Seven million students attend schools with safety code violations, such as the presence of lead paint, asbestos, or radon in the walls, floors, or ceilings. One-third of students study in classrooms without electrical wiring and power outlets to accommodate computers and multimedia equipment. 
We should not pass up this opportunity to repair our Nation's schools. 
While the budget resolution before us does include some increases in education funding and provides protection for important education initiatives, the agreement's caps on discretionary funding do not guarantee room for the school construction initiative. The same may also be the case for school reform and efforts to improve the recruitment, education, and mentoring of teachers, for which the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future report, What Matters Most: Teaching for America's Future, suggests almost $5 billion is needed. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Moseley-Braun amendment, which seeks to make $5 billion available for school repair, renovation, and construction. Indeed, this must be a top priority as we work to provide students a quality education and prepare them for the future. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Feinstein and Daschle amendments and in opposition to H.R. 1122. 
The decision to proceed with a potentially lethal pregnancy or one that would endanger the future health of the mother should rest with a woman and her doctor. As a general principle, the Government's role in such a difficult decision should be secondary to that of the woman who must inevitably come to terms with her own personal moral, religious, and philosophical beliefs. 
H.R. 1122 supersedes the medical judgment of trained physicians and criminalizes medical procedures that may be necessary to preserve the life and health of the woman. Indeed, it seeks to restrictively and coercively dictate what constitutes appropriate medical practice. 
Furthermore, H.R. 1122 does not provide an exception for the health of the mother, thus rejecting the constitutional standard governing postviability abortions set forth in the Supreme Court's decision in Roe versus Wade. Let us make no mistake, Roe versus Wade does not allow a healthy mother of a healthy fetus to have a postviability abortion. 
During this emotionally charged debate, it is important to keep in mind those unfortunate women who have faced unpredictable, tragic, and life-threatening pregnancies. For instance, two women who endured such grave circumstances shared their stories recently before a joint House-Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. They testified to the heart-wrenching circumstances surrounding their decision--a decision that would have been illegal under this legislation. We have heard these and other equally compelling stories shared by many of my colleagues during this debate today. 
The amendments offered by Senator Feinstein and Senator Daschle, however, both take into consideration the woman's life and health. The Feinstein amendment bans all postviability abortions, except those necessary to preserve the life of the woman or to avert serious adverse health consequences. The Daschle amendment also bans all postviability abortion, but makes an exception for those necessary to save the mother's life or to protect her from grievous injury to her physical health. I will support these amendments because their sponsors seek to preserve the core principles of Roe versus Wade. 
Of these two amendments, the Feinstein approach is preferable to meet the tragic and trying circumstances of women facing this agonizing decision. I am concerned that the Daschle amendment may not ensure appropriate medical options for all the possible health-related difficulties faced by some women. If it is the true intention of H.R. 1122's proponents to address late term abortions, I would urge my colleagues to support the Feinstein and Daschle amendments which accords with the Supreme Court's decisions in this area and have been endorsed by the President. 
Mr. President, the debate on the issue of abortion involves profound questions. Questions of a moral, personal, and religious nature. I do not personally favor abortion. However, my duty as a Senator is to uphold the Constitution and ensure that the power of the State is not used to compel citizens in a manner which contradicts an individual's protected religious and moral beliefs.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. At a time when we should be debating ways to raise the wages of working Americans to reverse two decades of decline, S. 4 proposes comptime policies which will place additional downward pressure on the standard of living of working Americans. Rather than seeking a bipartisan solution to give great flexibility to workers without jeopardizing their income, S. 4 unnecessarily undermines longstanding wage protections afforded American workers. 
The problem is simple: Working families today find both their time and financial resources stretched to the breaking point. The average working family has not seen their income increase over the past 20 years. In almost two-thirds of families, both mom and dad have to work to make ends meet. Financial resources and family time both are at a premium. 
Manifestations of the problem are easy to manage, and they occur in various forms every day. We have heard much discussion about the working mom and her problems. The working mom, for example, might get a call from her daughter's school, and the teacher requests a meeting explaining that the child's grades have slipped, and normally the child is a very attentive child, but she has become disruptive. Concerned about her daughter, who is usually a good student, mom seeks to schedule a teacher conference as quickly as possible without diminishing her income. The factory where she works is currently busy, so she approaches the manager and requests to work an hour of overtime this week so she can take an hour and a half to see her daughter's teacher next Thursday. 
How would S. 4 address this problem? Unfortunately, the answer is, inadequately, if at all. First, under S. 4, a worker cannot avail herself of the program. Comptime is provided solely at the discretion of the employer. It is a program that only the employer can offer. Second, even if the employee had been offered comptime and, indeed, had already worked an hour of overtime, there is no guarantee that she will receive the time off that she needs. The Republican bill nebulously allows an employee to take time off within a reasonable period after making the request time does not unduly disrupt the employer. 
There are no further guidelines. So, if an employer found the timing of the mother's request was not reasonable or if the time would be unduly disruptive, the request could be denied. Considering the fact that the worker has already earned the right to this compensation, her request for a particular time off deserves deference. 
Inexplicably, the sponsors of S. 4 rejected an amendment offered in the Labor and Human Resources Committee that would have ensured a worker receive the time requested if the request was made 2 weeks in advance and would not cause the employer substantial injury. This bill offers quite a bit more flexibility to the employer than it does to the employee, and it does not represent another real option for the wage earner, the hourly wage earner in America. 
In addition, there are serious concerns regarding how much choice employees actually will have. The bill contains hortatory language dictating that programs be the voluntary choice of the employee and that employers cannot coerce employees into taking time off in lieu of pay. However, S. 4 fails to provide a verifiable system by which employees choose to take comp time. Indeed, the bill fails to stipulate safeguards concerning potential discrimination. 
Under the bill, employees will be quickly divided into two groups: those who accept time off as overtime and those who want pay. The bill does not explicitly or effectively prevent an employer from offering overtime only to those who will accept time off. Again, in committee, the sponsors of S. 4 rejected amendments which would have clarified the principle that employees cannot be distinguished based on their willingness to take nonpaid overtime. 
Most seriously, the current Family Friendly Workplace Act contains a provision which devastates the family's ability to both schedule time together and make ends meet: the evisceration of the 40-hour workweek. Under this legislation, an employer would be permitted to schedule employees to work 50, 60, 70, even 80 hours a week without providing any overtime pay. Overtime pay would only be required after working 80 hours in a 2-week period. It is difficult to contemplate how an employee scheduled to work 70 or 80 hours a week at the discretion of the employer will be able to better schedule time to attend to the needs of his or her family. Supporters of the bill may argue that the program is voluntary. Yet the bill's sponsors have 
denied workers the ability to refuse this voluntary program when the employers offer it.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to take one moment on a point that has been addressed periodically throughout the course of the debate. First is the argument that this legislation simply gives to private sector employees the same benefits enjoyed by public employees. Public employees do have certain flexibilities, but they also have a great deal more protection than typical hourly wage earners. When we tried to provide some of these additional protections to the private sector at the committee level that are enjoyed by public sector workers, they were rejected. 
Public employees can only be fired for cause, unlike most private sector employees, who have at-will contracts. Most public sector employees have grievance systems, which assure them that any disagreements with their employer will receive equitable redress. Public employees need not worry about the bankruptcy of their employer. The list goes on. Public employees have the power to ensure that flexibility works for them. If the sponsors of this legislation had been willing to provide any of these types of protections to those impacted by this bill, I think their argument would have some merit. Unfortunately, my colleagues have been unwilling to incorporate any significant worker protections into their bill. 
Mr. President, I believe that this bill has been offered in good faith. Many employers would implement this legislation equitably. However, some employers would not. And, sadly, large sectors of employers do not follow even the current rules. 
Unfortunately, portions of this legislation have been hijacked by those same interests who opposed an increase in the minimum wage, the implementation of the Family and Medical Leave Act, and who now impose the implementation of employee-oriented flexible work schedules. This well-intentioned idea now contains large loopholes by which some employers could dramatically reduce the pay of employees. 
Mr. President, I hope these problems can be addressed so we can provide today's workers stretched thin by demands of work and family, the power with which to make use of flexible work schedules. I hope we can work to amend this so that it would reflect a bill that is balanced between the needs for employees and time with their families and giving them the opportunities to make the choices so that they can effect the policies for their families and improve the quality and climate of the workplace. I hope that we all can work toward that end. 
I thank the Chair and yield back my time.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his gracious efforts. 
I rise today to support the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and also to oppose the proposed Gorton amendment. 
This legislation represents remarkable progress to date, building on progress in the last 20 years with respect to IDEA. In 1975, when IDEA was first passed, 1 million children were excluded from the public school system and another 4 million children did not receive appropriate educational services. 
Working in a bipartisan manner years ago, Congress passed IDEA, creating a situation in which all children are entitled to a free appropriate public education. 
IDEA has made a real difference in the lives of children throughout this country. Over 5 million children from birth through age 21 are now enjoying the benefits of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, and it has made a real difference. Indeed, the number of children with disabilities entering college more than tripled during the period between 1978 and 1991. The unemployment rate for those individuals with disabilities in the twenties is half that for the older generation. Simply put, IDEA demonstrates the positive and powerful role that Congress can play and has played. Today's bipartisan and bicameral effort builds on that great success of the last 20 years. 
I commend particularly Senator Lott, Senator Harkin, Senator 
Kennedy, Senator Jeffords, Senator Frist, and Assistant Secretary for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, Judith Heumann, for all of their efforts in leading this reauthorization process. 
In March, I went up to Rhode Island and met with many of the teachers, administrators, parents and families who are deeply involved and deeply concerned about special education. We talked to them, we got their ideas, and I am very pleased to say this legislation incorporates so many of the important ideas that they expressed to us. 
For example, this legislation promotes greater parental participation by providing parents with regular reports about the progress of their children. It also includes parents in group placement decisions which is so critical to the success of their child. This legislation strengthens the individual education plan, the IEP, by including children with disabilities in school reform efforts and also ensuring that performance assessments includes all children, including children with disabilities. All of these efforts will strengthen the education that is provided to these young Americans. 
In addition, this legislation strengthens and emphasizes early intervention services which are absolutely critical. In my home State of Rhode Island, we screen every child for disabilities and follow through with those children. People up in Rhode Island speak with great conviction and passion about the success of this aspect of the IDEA bill, and we are building on that success today. 
This legislation also reduces the paperwork and the litigation that we have seen in the past and strengthening and emphasizing mediation and reconciliation processes rather than going to immediate litigation. Indeed, it also requires that complaints be specified so that we don't get into an endless litigation process. All these things together add, I think, to the sensibility and the streamlining that this legislation represents. 
With respect to the amendment before us at the moment, it would undercut, I think, most of the progress we have made to date in this reauthorization. It would essentially undercut all of the specific goals and objectives that we have laid out carefully after considering this legislation. It would also, in a sense, undo so much of what has been done so positively and progressively by all parties coming together to deal with this legislation. 
To defer, once again, to local control I think is to invite what took place before IDEA, not because of insensitivity or any maligned intent, but the fact is, quite frankly, that millions of children with disabilities did not receive an appropriate education. It was only with the passage of IDEA in 1975 that we committed ourselves to ensure that every child, including those with disabilities, would have an appropriate education. 
This is the commitment we continue today. This is the work of many months by my colleagues who worked so diligently. I hope today we not only will reject this amendment but that we will overwhelmingly reaffirm the work that has been done, pass this bill, move it forward, let the President sign it and let us build on more than two decades of success and, once again, reaffirm our commitment that in this country, every child, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, will have a free appropriate public education. 
I thank the Senator and yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue that is important to many Rhode Islanders and I believe touches on the credibility of this body. I would like to add my voice to the voice of many of my colleagues in support of Alexis Herman as the Secretary of Labor. The appointment of Alexis Herman was approved by the Labor and Human Resources Committee unanimously on April 10, almost 3 weeks ago. This unanimous vote came after an appropriately arduous examination of Ms. Herman's record. She spent months successfully completing a far-reaching questionnaire submitted by the majority. She subsequently came before the committee and spent hours testifying as to her past accomplishments and her vision for the Department of Labor. She completed these tasks successfully, and a full vote of the Senate was originally scheduled for April 16. 
Yet, that vote has now been placed on indefinite hold. I believe this reflects poorly on this body. We have asked Ms. Herman to defend her record and outline her agenda for the Department of Labor. She has done that. Indeed, she has performed that task well enough to gain the unanimous support of our committee. We now owe her the courtesy of consideration by the full Senate. Not only do we owe this courtesy to Ms. Herman, but we have a duty to hard-working men and women in this country to have their interests adequately represented in the Cabinet of the President of the United States. Every day policy decisions affecting workers go unaddressed because there is no Secretary. 
While some may take financial stability for granted in today's economy, we in Rhode Island certainly do not. 
The Department of Labor has played a consistent and productive role in helping Rhode Island to cope with the economic challenges that it faces. We need a Secretary of Labor to help us continue in these efforts. 
Economically, Rhode Island has been hard hit by changing economic conditions and defense downsizing. 
In the late 1980's and early 1990's we lost over 10 percent of our manufacturing jobs due mostly to defense downsizing but also to changes in the economy. These effects continue to plague our economy. Thankfully, the Department of Labor, under the leadership of then Secretary Reich, was there consistently to provide assistance in lessening the burden of this impact on working Rhode Islanders. For example, in December of 1995, Rhode Island's largest grocery store, Almacs, declared bankruptcy immediately before Christmas. This bankruptcy resulted in Rhode Island's single largest layoff, over 2,000 workers, immediately before the 1995 holidays. The private sector committed what they could, volunteering food, holiday gifts and job placement services, but the former employees faced severe hardship. 
Then the Department of Labor stepped in to assist. They provided a total of $4.3 million to retrain 90 percent of the former Almacs workers who did not find employment in other grocery stores. This assistance came about because I was able to directly share the hardship of my constituents with the Secretary of Labor. Indeed, because the Congress had shut down the Federal Government at that time, several additional hurdles had to be overcome to help the people from Almacs. 
Thankfully, because of the work of the Secretary, those hurdles were overcome and my constituents were provided the services they desperately needed and, indeed, deserved. 
Just as in 1995, I am afraid that we are again confronted with a callous disregard for the working people of this country. They deserve a Secretary of Labor. Ms. Herman deserves a vote. Let us get on with this process. If you will, vote against her, but give her the opportunity to have her case heard here on the floor of the Senate and the decision made, not by inaction, but by the votes of the men and women of this body. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. REED. I would like, if I may, to talk about Senate bill 562. I am pleased the Senate took favorable action today. This legislation, the Senior Citizen's Home Equity Protection Act, would protect seniors from unscrupulous market activities of a very small group of business people. We have, throughout the United States and through the auspices of HUD, introduced a program called the reverse mortgage program. This allows seniors who have their house mortgage paid off, they have all the equity in the home, rather than selling the home to confront the costs of being a senior, they are allowed through this program to essentially go to the bank and have a monthly or a lump sum payment in lieu of the equity in their home. 
This allows many seniors to stay in their homes. It allows them to meet the needs of health care and all the pressing needs of seniors. 
What has happened though is that a group of unscrupulous operators have come in, under the guise of estate planning, and now are charging exorbitant fees to inform seniors of this reverse mortgage program, sometimes collecting up to $10,000. What is particularly alarming, indeed, and particularly reprehensible is the fact that all of this information is absolutely free from the HUD office in their locality. 
So what this legislation proposes to do--I am so pleased it was favorably responded to this morning--is to give HUD the authority to step in with very, very stern measures to preempt these practices, to move these unscrupulous operators out of the marketplace, and allow seniors to reap the full benefit of the reverse mortgage program. 
In my State of Rhode Island, over 500 seniors have taken advantage of the reverse mortgage program. In fact, we had our State program in place before the Federal program was initiated. Much of the effort at the Federal level has been led by the Assistant Secretary for Housing, Nick Retsinas, who is a Rhode Islander and who in fact was a leader in Rhode Island for this program. So we in Rhode Island understand very well the effect and the efficacy of this program. 
Our Rhode Island Housing and Mortgage Finance Corporation, RIHMFC, has done a remarkable job promoting these programs and also a remarkable job of policing these programs because we have not seen any evidence in Rhode Island of these scandals. However, throughout the country, as I indicated before, these unscrupulous operators have tried to move in and take advantage of very vulnerable seniors. 
We know so many seniors are house rich but cash poor. They have equity in their home but do not have the means to make ends meet each week. This reverse mortgage program should help them. It should not be an opportunity to be taken upon or set upon by unscrupulous operators. 
In Rhode Island, for example, the Providence Journal reported a typical story, that of George Tarbox and his wife. Mr. Tarbox and his wife were the perennial house rich and cash poor family. They purchased their home in 1958. They paid off the mortgage, but they were facing very difficult circumstances. They were on a fixed income, like most seniors. And they needed the resources to simply live. The choice between eating and buying medicine is very difficult. The reverse mortgage program allowed them to meet their needs. They were able to pay off their original mortgage. They were able to make their daily expenses. They were able to get the proceeds and resources that they needed to live. And this is just a typical story, a very, very good typical story of the effectiveness of the reverse mortgage program. 
Today, with action on S. 562, we are sending a very strong message out to those unscrupulous operators who might try to prey on seniors that we are going to take a tough, tough hard stand. This program is there. It is for seniors. It is not for speculators. It is for seniors. It is not for those who prey on seniors. And it allows seniors to have access, through their home, to the resources they need to lead lives of decency and dignity. 
I am so pleased with Senator D'Amato and Senator Mack for their leadership on this, and for my colleagues who joined in sponsoring this legislation. I hope that it will move quickly through the Congress, the President will sign it, and we will give HUD the tools that it needs to eradicate this detestable practice, and allow the seniors of America to fully enjoy what they have worked so hard for, their homes and the proceeds of their homes. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I yield back the balance of my time.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 82d anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. 
In the 1930's, someone questioned Adolph Hitler about the possible consequences of his plan for the systematic elimination of the Jews. Hitler seemed to believe that there would be none. He allegedly responded, `Who, after all, today remembers the Armenians?' 
One of my constituents, Noyemzar Alexanian, remembers. On a spring morning in 1915, when she was 6 years old, the Kurdish calvary surrounded her village. They rounded up all the men and teen-aged boys, tied their hands with rope, took them to a distant field and stabbed them to death. Her father escaped to a neighboring village but was soon discovered. Noyemzar says she remembers her father being led away while her mother cried for help. This little 6-year-old girl then `watched the white shirt of her father as he was led up a mountainside by the soldiers. The white shirt became a dot, and then it was gone.' Noyemzar's father was stabbed to death. Over the next few years, as she was shuttled from the houses of strangers to orphanages, Noyemzar lost her two sisters. But still she did not lose hope. After several years, she and the remaining members of her family escaped to Cuba. She later settled in Rhode Island with her husband, Krikor, another refugee from Armenia. Noyemzar Alenanian is now 88 years old, and every day she remembers. 
Mr. President, old and young around the world today remember the Armenian holocaust. We remember that on this date in 1915, the Ottoman Empire and the successor Turkish nationalist regime began a brutal policy of deportation and murder. Over the next 8 years 1.5 million Armenians would be massacred at the hands of the Turks and another 500,000 would have their property confiscated and be driven from their homeland. Engrossed in its own problems at the time, the world did little as the population was devastated. 
Despite having already undergone such terrible persecution and hardship, the people of the Armenian Republic still suffer today. The peace talks recently concluded in Moscow regrettably made no progress toward the resolution of the Karabagh conflict. Turkey continues to blockade humanitarian aid to Armenia. 
However, the Armenian people look hopefully to the future. Their quest for peace and democracy continues to inspire people around the world. Armenians who have emigrated to other countries, especially those in my home State of Rhode Island, bring their traditions with them. They enrich the culture and contribute much to the society of their new homelands. 
The continuing reports of the recent atrocities committed in Bosnia reaffirm the importance of our commitment to always remember the Armenian genocide. As long as hate and intolerance are a part of our world, we must be vigilant. We must stand as witnesses to protect people from persecution for the simple reason that they are different. 
I hope to visit Armenia in the near future. I wish to see the treasures of that land firsthand and pay tribute to the indomitable spirit of the people of Armenia. Until that time, I want to ensure the Armenian community that we remember. Menk panav chenk mornar.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to the chorus of support for the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. As a former company commander in the 82d Airborne Division, I have a keen interest in an international diplomatic agreement that will protect soldiers from one of the most terrible perils of war. As a Senator, I believe that the United States has a duty to assume a leadership role in this ambitious, global effort to not only reduce, but eliminate, an entire class of weapons of mass destruction. 
U.S. ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention is a paramount first step in removing the threat of chemical warfare on the battlefield. Soldiers in World War I were the first to know the terror of the release of poison gas. Over 1.3 million soldiers were injured or killed by chlorine and mustard gas during the Great War. This enormous number of casualties led to the negotiation of the Geneva Protocol in 1925 which banned the use of chemical weapons in wartime. Eighty years later, however, young soldiers are still plagued by the dangers of chemical warfare. Many veterans of the Persian Gulf war fight illness and lie awake at night, worrying and wondering, `Was there something in the air?' 
But this is not a treaty which will just protect soldiers in a time of armed conflict, it is a treaty which will protect innocent civilians from terrorist attacks. The 1995 Sarin gas attack in a crowded Tokyo subway that killed and injured dozens made this scenario a reality for everyone. It is imperative that we do what is necessary to ensure that such an incident becomes a distant memory rather than a daily fear. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention bans the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, transfer or use of chemical weapons by signatories. It requires the destruction of all chemical weapon stockpiles and production facilities. Parties to the convention must begin to destroy weapons within 1 year and complete the process within 10 years. If we ratify this treaty, we will take an important step toward eliminating the production, storage and use of blister agents, like mustard gas, which destroy exposed skin tissue; of choking agents that inflame the bronchial tubes and lungs and cause asphyxiation; of blood agents that block the circulation of oxygen when inhaled; and of nerve agents that cause the nervous system to overload, resulting in respiratory failure and death. The goal of this treaty is to ensure that these deadly chemicals will never again be dispersed over troops or civilian populations by bombs, rockets, missiles, artillery, mines, grenades or spray. 
Chemical weapons are terrifying because they kill quickly, silently, and indiscriminately. Even more disturbing is the fact that their production is easy, cheap and simple to conceal. With a little know-how, a solvent used in pen ink can be converted into mustard gas and a chemical common in pesticides becomes an ingredient in a deadly nerve agent. It must be acknowledged that eliminating chemical weapons is a herculean task. But the Chemical Weapons Convention, which we are finally considering today, addresses this challenge. This treaty is the most comprehensive arms control agreement ever negotiated. It institutes an extensive and intrusive verification regime which will include both government and civilian facilities. International teams of inspectors will conduct instrument-monitoring as well as routine and random onsite inspections of facilities known to work with chemical agents. Furthermore, it allows challenge inspections, without right of refusal, of sites suspected of producing or storing chemical weapons. The convention also requires export controls and reporting requirements on chemicals that can be used as chemical warfare agents and their precursors. In addition, the treaty establishes the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW], a permanent body which will oversee the convention's implementation and ensure compliance. The enemy is elusive but 162 signatory countries decided this treaty was the 
best means of waging war against chemical weapons. 
In January 1993, President Bush joined dozens of other nations in Paris and agreed to meet the challenge of eliminating chemical weapons by signing the Chemical Weapons Convention. Now some members of this chamber, members of President Bush's own party, are second-guessing that decision. The problem is that if we drag our feet any longer, the United States will be left behind. April 29, 1997 is not an artificial deadline imposed by a political party. One of the provisions of the treaty is that it enters into force 180 days after the ratification by the 65th country, and in 6 days, on April 29, the 74 nations who have ratified the treaty will begin its implementation. If we do not vote to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, we will not stop it. In fact, we will not even become a passive bystander. Instead, we will become the target of the trade restrictions that make this treaty so powerful. 
Now, no one can say the Senate has not had ample opportunity to consider this agreement. Thirteen years and two administrations ago, President Reagan proposed this treaty to the United Nations. It was approved by the United Nations in 1992 and President Bush signed the convention weeks before he left office. Several months later, President Clinton presented the CWC to the Senate for consideration. The Committees on Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Intelligence, and Judiciary held 17 hearings over three Congresses. The administration has provided the Senate with over 1,500 pages of information. In the past 2 months, the administration and a task force formed by the majority leader have held almost 60 hours of discussion. Twenty-eight additional conditions, statements, understandings, and declarations to the resolution of ratification have been reached. The overwhelming evidence persuasively argues that now is the time to ratify this treaty. 
Ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention complements the existing military strategy of the United States. We are already committed to unilateral destruction of our chemical weapons. In the early 1980's, the Department of Defense declared about 90 percent of our Nation's chemical weapons obsolete. In 1985, Congress directed destruction of these weapons. President Reagan signed the law that would eliminate approximately 30,000 metric tons of blister and nerve agents by the year 2004. Even President Reagan, one of the greatest advocates of a strong military, decided that chemical weapons were not needed to remain the most powerful fighting force in the world. 
We have much to gain by ratification. This treaty will force other nations to adopt the same standard as the United States. The monitoring regime and trade restrictions imposed by the convention will make the production and storage of chemical weapons by rogue states infinitely more difficult and costly. The CWC improves our ability to keep our troops safe and makes the enemy more vulnerable by reducing its options of weaponry. 
If we do not ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, we will abdicate our leadership role in the world. As I have said before, the United States initiated this treaty. It was American leadership that led the negotiations through to completion. It would be irresponsible, both to Americans and the world, to abandon the convention on the eve of implementation. If we do not ratify this treaty tomorrow, the United States will not be able to participate in the executive council which will oversee the implementation of the treaty. Furthermore, U.S. citizens will not be eligible to become international inspectors and serve in other key positions. The ratifying countries will be forced to carry on our idea without us, and the United States will have no choice but to stand aside and watch. 
Without our expertise and support, the entire convention may be jeopardized. One of the key elements of the treaty is intelligence gathering. The United States has the most sophisticated intelligence network in the world. If our country 
refuses to participate, we deny our intelligence community the opportunity to tap into new sources of information and we may cripple the verification regime by denying the international community the benefits of our knowledge. 
In addition, the United States is the only nation with extensive experience in destroying chemical weapons. We are also the only country investing heavily in research and development to find methods other than incineration to destroy these weapons. Without our advice, participants in the convention risk inadvertent but dangerous accidents and may squander scarce financial resources attempting to reinvent the wheel in learning how to destroy weapons. Furthermore, if the entire international community pools its resources, both intellectual and financial, to discover safe, environmentally sound methods of destruction, the development time would certainly be reduced. If we show reluctance to ratify the treaty, we will undermine the confidence and commitment of the entire international community. It is counting on us to continue to lead the way. 
There are critics of this treaty, but their criticism, I think, misses the mark. This will not inhibit our business, it will help our chemical business. This treaty is not perfect, but it is a better tool for controlling weapons than having no treaty whatsoever. We are, I hope, committed to the path of destruction of our own weapons and to ensure that the rest of the world follows this very prudent, indeed, noble course. 
Vocal critics of the Chemical Weapons Convention claim that it is fatally flawed. They state that we should not ratify this treaty because we will not be able to verify that chemical weapons are completely eliminated. Of course this treaty is not perfect. But we will have increased our capability to find and eliminate large scale production of chemical weapons which can cause the most damage. The verification regime will also enable us to discover production and storage of small quantities of chemical weapons that we have little or no chance of discovering now. The CWC is not a panacea, but no law or treaty is. It is a tool that can help us solve a problem. Isn't it better to use the tool to try and fix the problem rather than simply admit defeat? 
Critics also contend that the treaty cannot be effective until all nations, particularly those who are known to possess chemical weapons, ratify the convention. It will be impossible to convince every rogue state to sign the treaty. It is also safe to say that some who sign the treaty will cheat. But the CWC is designed to isolate and cajole those who do not join. The treaty uses a most effective weapon against rogue states--economics. Trade restrictions will be implemented against these nations and they will soon be unable to acquire `dual use' chemicals which they need for the production of common items. As these nations begin to feel the pressures from shortages, they may find it advantageous to sign the treaty. Trade restrictions are one of the most effective weapons that the international community has. 
In an era when balancing the budget is of primary importance, it is not sunrising that opponents cite the cost of joining the treaty as a reason for not ratifying it. I cannot dispute that there is a financial price for joining the convention. Most of the costs will be incurred for maintaining the activities of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW]. These costs will be apportioned according to a system similar to the one used by other international organizations. In addition, each signatory which destroys its stockpile must repay the OPCW for costs associated with verification. In his budget, the President requested about 20 cents per American to pay for CWC costs, a small price for the elimination of chemical weapons. Furthermore, members of this body can ensure that this cost does not escalate in the future, because the conditions agreed to in the Senate Executive Resolution allow Congress to control future payments by granting it the authority to authorize and appropriate any funds 
above this level. The cost of the CWC is reasonable, and certainly less than the cost of `going it alone' or entering a battlefield where chemical weapons are being used. 
Critics of the CWC claim that American private businesses will bear the brunt of the treaty provisions. However, the U.S. chemical industry, the private business which will be most affected by this treaty, heartily endorses its ratification. Contrary to what some have claimed, the burden on industry has not been discounted or ignored. The major trade associations which represent the chemical industry, like the US Chemical Manufacturers Association, have actively worked with those writing the treaty for the past 15 years. The chemical industry helped develop the confidentiality provisions, the data declarations and the inspection regime. Certain companies even participated in the National Trial Inspections to test the verification procedures outlined in the Chemical Weapons Convention. In addition, the conditions agreed to in the Senate Executive Resolution further protect businesses from unreasonable searches and seizures and the dissemination of confidential information. Less than 2,000 facilities will be affected by the treaty, and the vast majority of these must do no more than complete an annual two page form. 
Opponents of the Convention claim they are protecting American business interests. But American businesses seem to disagree. They fear, in fact, that the Senate will not ratify the treaty. Ironically, if we do not make the right decision tomorrow, our chemical companies will become subject to the same trade restrictions that will be imposed on non-signatories such as Libya, Egypt, Iraq, North Korea, and Syria. More than $600 million a year in sales could be lost. Treaty critics are protesting so loudly, they seem unable to hear the voices of the constituencies they claim to protect. 
We have overcome many hurdles to reach this point: Years of negotiations among the nations of the world, months of negotiations among the leaders of this Nation. We are finally debating this treaty on the floor of the Senate today because we have agreed to an unprecedented 28 conditions--28 duties, declarations and understandings added to a treaty which was proposed, negotiated and agreed to by Republican administrations. But, unfortunately, five hurdles remain. Five conditions demanded by opponents of this treaty may prevent the United States from assuming its proper role of leadership in an ambitious arms control treaty. These conditions unacceptably compromise the treaty and the ability of the United States to participate in its implementation. These conditions are simply not fair play. Every member of this body has a right to oppose this treaty. They can voice their opposition by voting against it and their opinion will be respected. But hobbling the ability of the United States to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention strikes an unwarranted blow to international arms control and our political process. I urge my colleagues to vote against these five killer conditions. 
Mr. President, 34 years ago, President John F. Kennedy undertook the challenge to convince the Senate and the people of the United States of America should ratify the Limited Test Ban Treaty. The same questions were raised about verification, about the reliability of those who might sign the treaty or who might not sign the treaty. In a nationwide television address, President Kennedy reminded us:  
We have a great obligation . . . to use whatever time remains to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, to persuade other countries not to test, transfer, acquire, possess or produce such weapons. 
According to the ancient Chinese proverb, `A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.' My fellow Americans, let us take that first step. Let us, if we can, step back from the shadows of war and seek out the way of peace. And if that journey is a thousand miles, or even more, let history record that we, in this land, at this time, took the first step. 
Complementing the President's words, though, were the words of a very wise, distinguished statesman of the Chamber, Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois. In September of that year, 1963, he came to this Chamber and began a speech, but threw the pages away and spoke spontaneously from his heart and said: 
A young President calls this treaty the first step. I want to take a first step, Mr. President. One my age thinks about his destiny a little. I should not like to have written on my tombstone, `He knew what happened at Hiroshima, but he did not take a first step . . .' 
We know what happened in World War I with poison gas. We know what happened in the Tokyo subway with sarin gas. Let us not have it said on our tombstone that we knew but were unwilling to take a first step. Let us, like the statesmen before us, take a first step to control weapons, to reduce weapons, to provide a more peaceful, a more dignified world. 
Mr. President, I hope we will take that first step and discharge our obligation to the world and to the citizens of this great country. 
On the eve of the vote to ratify another historic agreement, one that seeks not just to limit weapons of mass destruction, but eliminate them, the words of President Kennedy and Senator Dirksen still ring true. We have an obligation to take the first step. Let us do so. 
I yield back my time.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise this evening to join my colleague, Senator Chafee, in support of his resolution to return a statue of Roger Williams to the Capitol rotunda, and also to commend Senator Chafee for his excellent statement. He has described in detail the central role that Roger Williams has played not only in the life of Rhode Island, but in the life of this Nation. 
His displacement from the rotunda will not be the first time he was banished. In 1635 he was banished from his first home because he advocated at that time the revolutionary idea that there should be a separation between church and state, that individuals should have freedom of conscience, that individuals should be able to worship the god of their choice, and that the system of government should respect that choice. 
In a sense he began the intellectual revolution that would culminate years later in the revolution against Great Britain that would lead to our Declaration of Independence and to the Constitution of the United States, because he emphasized in his quest for the rights of conscience that element of individuality which is so much a part of America. 
Roger Williams was a central figure not only in the history of Rhode Island but in the history of this country, and we recognize that by giving him a place of honor and distinction in the rotunda of the Capitol. 
Like Senator Chafee, I do not object at all to the display of the suffragettes statute. That is once again a recognition of individual Americans who showed us the way, who advocated for the right of people. In fact, their behavior was in some way directly or indirectly inspired by the tradition established by Roger Williams in the 1600's. 
I also respect the deliberations of Senator Warner to find a location which would be appropriate for Roger Williams. But my feeling, as well as my colleague's feeling, is that he is of such a historical character, not just to Rhode Island but to the Nation, that he well deserves a place in the rotunda of the Capitol of the United States. 
When Roger Williams came to Rhode Island he created not just a State, but an attitude, an idea, that men and women could worship as they saw fit. He inspired the development of the first Baptist church in America which stands today in Providence. That spirit of tolerance, a respect for individuality, of respect for the dignity of the individual to choose, became a beacon for people around the world to come to Rhode Island. As Senator Chafee indicated, the first Jewish synagogue in North America was established in Newport and stands today as a symbol of Roger Williams' legacy, of our commitment to tolerance, and the right and dignity of the individual. 
Such accomplishments, which go to the very fiber and the spirit of America, must be recognized, and, in fact, I feel should be appropriately recognized by the display of the Roger Williams statue in the rotunda of the Capitol. 
When Roger Williams established Rhode Island, he said he was going to begin a lively experiment, and he has. That lively experiment has spun through the ages the creation of our Government; the very debate that we have here today. His legacy is monumental. His monument should be in the rotunda. 
I am proud to join my colleague from Rhode Island to cosponsor this resolution and to urge, along with him, that at the first appropriate moment the statue of Roger Williams should be returned to the rotunda, that its temporary banishment from the rotunda be ended, and that scores of Americans in this generation and generations to come can recognize his accomplishments, can recognize his particular contributions to America and, in recognizing those contributions, can continue to reaffirm the spirit of religious freedom, of tolerance, and of individual dignity which he represents so magnificently. I am proud to be associated with my senior colleague and hope that this Senate will move quickly to support the return of Roger Williams to the rotunda. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a fellow Rhode Islander and friend, Dr. Vartan Gregorian. On January 6, Dr. Gregorian announced that he will leave his post as president of Brown University in Providence, RI, to become President of the Carnegie Corp. After 9 years on College Hill, he leaves behind a flourishing campus and community. Brown has more than doubled its endowment during his tenure. An ambitious capital campaign has raised over $500 million under Dr. Gregorian's leadership, and he has brought 275 new faculty members to Brown, including 72 new professors. 
But, Mr. President, the true measure of Vartan Gregorian is not his skill as an administrator, booster, and fund raiser, it is his passion for teaching and learning. Even in the midst of the demands of his presidency, he has managed to find time to continue to teach, and I understand that he also continues to serve as an advisor for several fortunate students. In this regard, he is unique among his peers, and they recognize his prodigious efforts. James Freedman, president of Dartmouth, said of Dr. Gregorian, `He communicates the joy of learning.' 
Vartan Gregorian's interest in education is not limited to Brown or to other institutions of higher learning. He is deeply concerned about the condition of the Nation's public schools. As his colleague, Theodore Sizer, said recently, `No Ivy League president has put his shoulder to the wheel of public education more than Vartan Gregorian.'

Mr. REED. I thank the Chair. 
I rise with a great deal of pride to speak to the confirmation of Pete Peterson as our Ambassador to the Republic of Vietnam. 
Simply stated, Pete Peterson is a great man. He was a great man before he ever put on the uniform of the U.S. Air Force because he is a man of outstanding character and a deep devotion to his family and country. As my friend and colleague, the Senator from Nebraska, pointed out, he has that rare quality of dignity and purpose, not flamboyant, but quiet and determinative. 
Pete is a remarkable person. One of the great privileges I had in my life was to serve with him in the House of Representatives for 6 years. He brought all of this talent, this energy and this fierce patriotism to his work in every capacity. We all know the story. He was a young man, hailed from Nebraska, joined the U.S. Air Force, was in 1966 sent to Thailand, flew 66 missions in Vietnam and on his 67th mission he was shot down. He was captured. He spent 6 1/2 grueling, arduous years in captivity in three different prison camps. 
In all that time, not only did they not break his spirit but they could in no way touch that core of deep respect, regard for all people that he still maintains. He emerged from an experience, which would have seared and destroyed so many other people, unbroken, unbowed and without bitterness, a remarkable testimony to his character. 
Pete could have returned in 1973 and said, I have done my duty as an Air Force officer, as a patriot. He returned, in fact, in 1973 to greet his wife, his beloved wife, who sadly passed away and will not see this triumph today but I am sure understands from where she is what a great day it is for Pete. He, in fact, saw for the first time a son he had never met. 
Yet, despite all that, he still heard the call of his country, and he served with distinction the second district of Florida for 6 years. 
There has been some controversy about this nomination, but it has not been about Pete Peterson because there is no one in this Chamber or in this country that I think ever doubted his capacity or commitment to serve as Ambassador to Vietnam. The controversy is about the issue of POW's and MIA's, which was articulated by the Senator from New Hampshire. Those are serious, important issues which cannot be neglected. Indeed, I believe Pete Peterson is the best person to address those issues. 
He will go to Vietnam, a place where he has already spent one-tenth of his life, with the credibility of one who has served and with the vision of one who understands what went on there during the war and what we must do to bring our country and that country closer together. And he will not neglect the search for the unanswered questions of his comrades who are still missing and unaccounted for. 
Pete has long been involved in this issue. He has, along with my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, and the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, been involved with the Vietnam working group. He has been involved with the U.S.-Russian joint commission on POW-MIA affairs. These gentlemen have committed themselves to search for the answers, and that type of commitment I know will resolve the question. 
We have a great responsibility to develop a relationship, a mutually supportive relationship between the United States and the Republic of Vietnam. Pete Peterson can do that. He is not only a warrior but he is also a businessman. He understands that one of our challenges is to bring economic prosperity to both our countries, and he will be a leader in that regard also. 
I believe the President has made the wisest choice possible with this nomination. We will vindicate and recognize that choice this evening, and we will send a strong message, a message of reconciliation and of progress, a message that wars will end and peace will be begun, and a message also that a life of service to your country, selfless service to your country, will be rewarded by further responsibilities commensurate with that service. 
I, too, thank the majority leader and the Democratic leader, the Senator from New Hampshire, and particularly the Senator from Arizona for all his efforts to bring this nomination to the floor and, like Pete Peterson, also a heroic veteran of the war in Vietnam. As someone who served in the military for 12 years at that time but not in Vietnam, I recognize all of the tremendous contributions of the veterans of that war in this Chamber, in the other body and throughout our society. Pete Peterson will make us all proud but particularly those brave men and women who served in Vietnam. 
I thank the Senator. I yield back the remainder of my time.  
Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I pay tribute to a proud member of the Rhode Island community, Ms. Arlene DeSemone, who, sadly, passed away on March 11, 1997. 
A leader in the insurance industry, Ms. DeSemone served as president of the Rhode Island Life Underwriters Association in 1992. She was president of the National Association of Insurance Women of Rhode Island from 1988 to 1990 and was named professional woman of the year by this organization in 1994. Ms. DeSemone received the R. Kelly Sheridan Award in 1996, as the outstanding life insurance professional of the year. In addition, Ms. DeSemone received the Lloyd Saunders Award for professional dedication to her clients and the industry, and served on numerous committees, including the first Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation Continuing Education Advisory Board. 
Perhaps the greatest of Ms. DeSemone's contributions was her work in the fight against breast cancer. Despite her own personal struggle with the disease, Ms. DeSemone led the way in encouraging research efforts to find a cure for breast cancer. Ms. DeSemone cofounded the Rhode Island Breast Cancer Coalition in 1993, an organization whose initiatives received national praise and were recognized by President Clinton and the First Lady. The coalition continues to benefit from her efforts to raise consciousness about breast cancer. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering Ms. Arlene DeSemone for her many contributions to Rhode Island and selfless dedication to helping others. Certainly, Ms. DeSemone embodied the strength and determination we all seek to find in ourselves.

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in support of the Hollings amendment which I think is a wonderful first step to begin to reform our campaign finance system. As many of my distinguished colleagues have mentioned in the course of this debate, at any time when you attempt to amend the Constitution of the United States, you do so with trepidation. This is the fundamental organic document of our Government. It deserves great respect and reverence, and we do not do this lightly. 
But today we are facing a crisis of public confidence in the democratic order in the United States with respect to campaign finance reform. If the Constitution and the Court had remained silent on this issue, we would not be here today. But the Court has spoken, first in the case of Buckley versus Valeo, several years ago, and in its progeny. Their voice has concluded, and some would argue not correctly, but concluded that the first amendment prevents Congress from imposing limits on campaign expenditures. 
If the Court refuses to reassess its ruling, we have no choice but to propose to the people of the United States that in their wisdom they consider an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and that is why we are here today. We are not doing this in a vacuum. We are doing this because of a crisis in confidence by the public. 
To be kind, the public is disenchanted with the American political system, particularly the American political campaign finance system. They see far too much money going to campaigns. They are concerned that this money is extracting special interest favors. All of this undermines a sense of democracy, a sense of participation, a sense of what it is to be a citizen in this great country. Last year's election saw record fundraising and record expenditures. An unprecedented $2.7 billion was spent in Federal elections last year, three times the amount that was spent the year the Buckley versus Valeo case was decided. As this money is poured in, the public is becoming increasingly disenchanted and increasingly disenfranchised from the process. 
In a 1992 poll, 84 percent of the electorate stated that Congress was owned by special interests, a direct reflection, I think, of the perception of how the campaign finance system may work. For the first time in decades, last year's Presidential elections saw less than half of the eligible voters going to the polls to register their votes. The American public sees a great problem. Months ago, in the Washington Post, 80 percent of those surveyed indicated there was too much money in campaigns and favored the adoption of campaign spending limits. 
For the well-being of our democracy, for the confidence we must have of its citizens, as we go about doing our work, I feel this amendment is in order and indeed must be enacted. 
As I mentioned before, the great stumbling block to effective limits on campaign expenditures is the Supreme Court decision in Buckley versus Valeo. At the core of that 1976 decision, there is this language: 
The first amendment denies Government the power to determine that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the free society ordained by our Constitution, it is not the Government but the people, individually as citizens and candidates, and collectively as associations and political committees, who must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on public issues in a political campaign. 
That seems to be the core sense of why the Court decided it. But I suggest the notion that citizens and even candidates are controlling the system today has been overwhelmed by events, overwhelmed by an avalanche of money coming into political campaigns. In fact, the system that was created under Buckley versus Valeo has collapsed, in effect, inundated by independent expenditures, special interest expenditures, money by the torrent 
coming into campaigns. It is not surprising, then, that the Washington Post detailed that the special interests coming into a campaign in Pennsylvania's 21st Congressional District outspent either one of the candidates. In effect, the candidates control neither the dialog nor the issues; it was outside forces, some of them anonymous or at least ambiguous. 
All of this contributed not to what we think an election should be about, two candidates or several candidates presenting their ideas, arguing eloquently, reaching out to people. In effect, the candidates became a sideshow. It was the battle between special interests. That is not what the American people want to see in their elections, and if we are to control that and constrain that, we must have, in this particular moment, a constitutional amendment to do so. 
The issue about the Buckley versus Valeo decision is one that constrained our thought about campaign financing for many, many years. My colleagues in this body have offered many proposals, legislatively, to correct it. There is the Feingold-McCain bill. There is other legislation. Leader Daschle has introduced legislation. I support all of these. But my fear is if we adopt any one of them, and I hope we do adopt campaign finance reform legislatively, the ingenuity and creativity of lawyers and consultants will find ways around it, simply because ultimately we cannot control the amount of money going into campaigns. This amendment will give us that authority. 
The concept, also, that unlimited spending is good, I think, has to be looked at very skeptically. Unlimited spending can drown out free speech, can squelch someone who does not have the resources to compete. It may not, in fact, always advance the concept of a free exchange of ideas in an electoral campaign. 
Many of our leading constitutional scholars, in fact, have reached this conclusion. Paul Freund, the distinguished professor at Harvard Law School wrote:  
Campaign contributors are operating vicariously through the power of their purse, rather than through the power of their ideas. I would scale that relatively lower in the hierarchy of First Amendment values. We are dealing here not so much with the right of personal expression or even association, but with dollars and decibels, and just as the volume of sounds may be limited by law, so may the volume of dollars, without violating the First Amendment. 
Judge Skelly Wright, one of our most distinguished jurists wrote: 
Nothing in the First Amendment commits us to the dogma that money is speech. Far from stifling First Amendment values, campaign limits actually promote them. In place of unlimited spending, limits encourage all to emphasize less expensive, face-to-face communications, exactly the kind of activities that promote real dialogue and leave much less room for manipulation and avoidance of the issues. 
In the words of a distinguished New York School of Law professor, Ronald Dworkin: 
The Buckley decision was a mistake, unsupported by precedent and contrary to the best understanding of prior first amendment jurisprudence. It misunderstood not only what free speech really is, but what it really means for free people to govern themselves. 
All these experts would conclude that Buckley versus Valeo in effect is wrong. But Buckley versus Valeo as it stands today is the law and, recognizing that, we are attempting to give the people of this country a chance, through the amendment process, to change that decision, that position of the Court. 
If you look at Buckley versus Valeo, though, perhaps the best argument I found against it was contained within the very confines of the decision. It was the dissenting opinion of Justice White. I do not think anyone has to vouch for Justice White's fidelity to the first amendment and the values that it holds that are dear to us all. First of all, time has proven Justice White to be very perceptive, indeed prophetic. Because he wrote: 
Without limits on total expenditures, campaign costs will inevitably and endlessly escalate, pressure to raise funds will constantly build, and with it the temptation to resort to those sources of large sums, who, history shows, are sufficiently confident of not being caught to risk flouting contribution limits. 
This is in 1976. Again, recall, since he wrote those words, campaign spending has tripled. 
He also went on to add: 
I have little doubt that limiting the total that can be spent will ease the candidate's understandable obsession with fundraising and so free him and his staff to communicate in more places and ways unconnected with the fundraising function. I regret that, by rejecting a limit, the Court has returned them all to the treadmill. 
I would argue there is no one here in this body who would suggest that that treadmill is not still there. 
I have heard in the debate notions about how this would infringe on treasured values of the first amendment. But Justice White, in his opinion, pointed out that this is not a unique issue, that the limiting of the quantity of speech is done routinely. 
As he said: 
Compulsory bargaining and the right to strike, both provided for or protected by Federal law, inevitably have increased the labor costs of those who publish newspapers. Federal and State taxation directly removes from company coffers large amounts of money that might be spent on larger and better newspapers. But it has not been suggested, nor could it be successfully, that these laws, and many others, are invalid because they siphon off or prevent the accumulation of large sums that would otherwise be available for communicative activities. 
We do on a routine basis require newspapers, the great champions of the first amendment, the most vociferous defenders of the first amendment, to comply with laws that effectively limit the quantity of speech that they can put out. So this notion that what we are doing today trods on the sacred core of the first amendment, I do not think is right. 
Indeed, I think we would be better off to have the Court reassess its opinion of Buckley and find that these limits are appropriate under the first amendment. But today, we are left with presenting to the American people the opportunity to make that judgment. I hope that, as I said, Buckley could be reviewed and indeed be recognized by the Court to be inappropriate based on the facts today. They have the authority to do that. 
We have the authority to present to the American public this constitutional amendment. I urge that we do so. 
I want to commend the sponsor, Senator Hollings, for his leadership, for his perception of the issue, and for his unflinching commitment to develop a campaign finance system that is fair to all. 
One last point. I have also heard in this debate the notion that this Congress would impose irresponsible and reckless limits. In reality, any limits we impose we would all have to recognize and work within. They would be the same as applied to Republican candidates or Democratic candidates. They would limit the amount of money that right-wing, special-interest groups could put in or left-wing, special-interest groups could put in. 
They would, in effect, return our elections to the democratic process that our citizens believe we should have, a process by which they can listen to the voices of the candidates, they can communicate their views, they can, in effect, not be drowned out by an avalanche of money and 30-second sound bites. In fact, an election can be a dialog about democracy and not about who raises how much money. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
Again, I commend the Senator for his great leadership.

 Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in honor of National Sportsmanship Day, which was observed on March 4, in over 8,000 schools in all 50 States and 75 countries throughout the world. 
National Sportsmanship Day was conceived by the Institute for International Sport, located in my home State of Rhode Island. The Institutes slogan, `Dare to Play Fair,' challenges athletes, coaches, administrators, and parents to reflect on the true meaning of competition and to discuss the importance of ethics and fair play in sport, the classroom, and everyday life. 
The centerpiece of this years National Sportsmanship Day was a seminar and town meeting at the University of Rhode Island discussing the issue of violence in sport. This day long event included panels composed of professional athletes, coaches, and journalists who discussed the many different aspects of this issue. 
In addition, the Institute has enlisted the help of several Sports Ethics Fellows, including the winner of baseball's Roberto Clemente Man of the Year Award and 10 time All-Star for the Minnesota Twins, Kirby Puckett, Rhode Island's own Brad Faxon, one of the top golfers on the PGA tour and the cofounder of the Billy Andrade-Brad Faxon Charities for Children Program. These men and women are wonderful role models who can be admired for more than just their athletic prowess. They have consistently demonstrated an interest in furthering the principles of honesty and integrity in sport and society. 
Indeed, the Sports Ethics Fellows are helping to teach the important lessons of National Sportsmanship Day by writing articles on sportsmanship and developing programs for National Sportsmanship Day. Through competition, young athletes can learn that while winning is a worthy goal, honor, discipline, and hard work are more important. Indeed, these values will guide them in all aspects of everyday life. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports and the Rhode Island congressional delegation in recognizing this day and the principles it embodies.

Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment before us today. 
For many decades, Congress found it easier to debate a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution than to actually balance the budget. 
Support for the balanced budget amendment was a convenient badge of fiscal austerity at a time when many Members were voting for tax policies and spending proposals that saw our annual deficit and our cumulative national debt explode. 
After so many years, it is no wonder that the balanced budget amendment has become a talisman which its supporters clutch, suggesting that it has extraordinary powers to translate the difficult choices that this body must face into some type of simple constitutional formula which will miraculously erase the deficit. 
But, as the last few years have indicated, there is no magical constitutional language that will make the choices or the policies of budget balancing easier. 
Mr. President, in 1993, the Clinton administration began a process of deficit reduction which has helped to create a strong economy, cut the deficit by 63 percent, brought the deficit when measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product to its lowest level since 1974, and given us the lowest deficit of any major industrialized nation. 
It took difficult choices, not constitutional gimmicks; choices that Republicans refused to support. 
Whether or not this amendment passes, and I hope it does not, we will still be confronted by these choices. 
However, if this amendment does pass, for the first time in our history we will either surrender our role in shaping the budget and the social and economic policies which it defines to the courts, or simply surrender any decision to an adamant minority which could invoke the provision to block necessary action. 
Mr. President, the amendment before us today is flawed in many ways. It is the wrong answer to a real problem. It is the wrong way to manage the economy. It disrupts our tradition of majority rule. It needlessly jeopardizes essential programs and it needlessly enhances the role of the courts in budgetary and tax policy. The balanced budget is the wrong way to manage the economy. 
Over 1,100 noted American economists, including 11 Nobel laureates, voiced their opposition to this balanced budget amendment on the grounds that it would hurt our economy and graft improper fiscal policy onto the Constitution. They said, `It is unsound and unnecessary.' They added, `It mandates perverse actions in the face of recessions.' They went on to say it `would prevent Federal borrowing to finance expenditures for infrastructure, education, research and development, environmental protection, and other investment vital to the Nation's future well-being,' and that it `is not needed to balance the budget.' They also `condemn' the amendment and suggest it could place our economy `in an economic straitjacket.' 
One Nobel laureate, Prof. William Vickery, developed an analysis of 15 issues with respect to balancing the budget, reducing the deficit and providing for economic growth, and in this analysis he has a compelling and noteworthy passage: 
If General Motors, AT&T, and individual households had been required to balance their budgets in the manner being applied to the federal government, there would be no corporate bonds, no mortgages, no bank loans, and many fewer automobiles, telephones and houses. 
But this balanced budget amendment suggests that the Government do exactly the opposite of what the most sophisticated private industries do, and I think that is a mistake. 
While the majority may find it appropriate and even desirable to insert economic formulas into the Constitution, I would urge caution. For example, we all believe and we will say time and time again that we should have a full employment economy and that every able bodied American work. However, if I were to introduce a full employment constitutional amendment, I predict that the very same supporters of this balanced budget amendment would rush to this floor and condemn that approach, invoking the terminology that we should not enshrine economic ideas or formulas into the Constitution of the United States. The same thing would happen if we talked about an anti-inflation amendment. 
The point, I think, should be very clear. It is our responsibility, together with other institutions, outside the scope of the Constitution to rationally ameliorate the surges and downswings of the economy. This is what we should do. 
Some people might try to say, well, no, look at the States. They provide for a balanced budget. That certainly misses the point. State governments do not manage national economies. They do not issue and support currencies. They do not deal in foreign trade. And most of them, if not all of them, with balanced budget requirements have the good sense to separate capital spending from operational spending. So that logic does not suffice to support this balanced budget amendment. 
I also suggest that economically we are not immune from the difficulties of the business cycle. We have been enjoying over the last several years good, substantial economic growth, but we know that in past periods our economy has faltered. If it does falter, this balanced budget amendment could be a straitjacket, confining and constraining us in our response to these economic recessions. When the economy shrinks, revenue shrinks, throwing off our revenue estimates, throwing off our whole plan to get to the balanced budget, and we will be hamstrung by this amendment's proposals in terms of what we can do to address a recession. 
For example, the CBO has talked about the impact of recession on the deficit. Their estimates indicate that a 1 percent drop in the gross domestic product would increase the deficit by $32 billion. A 1-percent increase in unemployment would add $61 
billion to the deficit. These are staggering figures with which we would have to contend in the context of a very narrowly drawn balanced budget amendment. 
These are not just statistics. These are real people's lives. We have all lived long enough to have endured economic recessions and have seen the cost in human lives. We have to, as a Government, to such situations. We cannot, I think, plead, at that moment of need, we would like to help you, but the Constitution prevents us from doing sensible, appropriate things to put people back to work in this country. 
One of the aspects of the balanced budget amendment that would severely constrain our response to recessions is the fact that it would suppress the automatic stabilizers contained in our economic policy today, things like unemployment compensation and other entitlement programs which exist to meet the needs of people who have fallen on hard times during a recession. 
As the Congressional Research Service cautioned when it examined the economic impacts of this proposal: 
In sum, the balanced budget constitutional amendment could require action to neutralize the automatic stabilizers in the budget that expand outlays and reduce tax collections in economic slowdowns and recessions. In this case, the budget would no longer serve to moderate business cycles. 
And, under this amendment, we would lose a valuable tool in aiding the working men and women of America. 
There is more than just constitutionally historic interest involved in the question of this amendment's supermajority requirements because this amendment requires not a majority vote, in many cases, but much more than a majority vote. This provision holds the real potential for constraining effective action at the time we need Government to move decisively and purposefully. 
For example, in times of economic crisis, there would be no automatic stabilizers if a small minority of Senators or Representatives objected. Different regions of the Nation experiencing economic hardship could find no comfort in Washington because they could not muster the number of Senators and Representatives to deal with their region's particular problems. Frankly, over the last several years, we have seen economic situations in which the country overall appears to be doing fine, but when you go to the Northeast, to California, or to other parts of the country, you find regional recessions that need the help of this Government. Regrettably, in that situation there may not be sufficient will or political support to do what we must do, which would be extremely detrimental to the citizens who live in these areas. 
There is another aspect of this supermajority that is built into this constitutional amendment which should cause us all great concern, and that is in order to raise the debt ceiling a vote of three-fifths would be required. 
We have just in the last Congress seen the difficulty of securing approval of a change in the debt ceiling with a simple majority requirement. If we would require a three-fifths vote, we really would be putting our Nation at severe risk. 
As Secretary Rubin has pointed out with respect to the issue of raising the debt ceiling and consequently avoiding default on Government debt:  
The possibility of default should never be on the table. Our creditworthiness is an invaluable national asset that should not be subject to question. 
Default on payment of our debt would undermine our credibility with respect to meeting financial commitments, and that, in turn, would have adverse effects for decades to come, especially when our reputation is most important, that is, when the national economy is not healthy. Moreover, a failure to pay interest on our debt could raise the cost of borrowing not only for the Government but for private borrowers as well. 
This super majority provision would affect the Government's ability to deal rationally and prudently with the debt ceiling, and that is another reason, a very strong reason, why this proposed constitutional amendment is inappropriate. 
It is bad economics; 1,100 economists would condemn it, but it is also very poor budgeting. As Senator Byrd pointed out, the majority's proposal turns the Congress and the President into fortune tellers who must somehow predict and balance outlays and receipts exactly or find the supermajority needed to waive the amendment. 
 This appears to be an impossible task, because each year the CBO seems to revise its projected deficit and revenue totals on a regular basis. We should not delude ourselves into thinking we can accurately predict the future, and we should definitely not add this dubious proposition to the Constitution. 
In addition to the fact that this amendment's success is predicated on frail human predictions, there are other reasons to oppose this amendment. While the majority claims that States have managed to survive balanced budget amendment requirements, they fail to acknowledge, as I previously indicated, that States do so rationally by creating separate operating and capital budgets. I have supported a balanced budget amendment which recognizes this rational policy. But that proposal is not before us today and we are debating a proposal that does not recognize--in fact some scholars have indicated it would constitutionally preclude--the development of a capital budget by the Federal Government. 
Time and time again, the advocates of the amendment have rejected the idea of a capital budget for the Federal Government. I believe, in a sense, not only are we rejecting sound constitutional policy and sound administrative policy, but we are also undercutting this Nation's need to build up our capital infrastructure. So, this amendment, as proposed, is both bad economics and bad budgeting, and finally it is an abrupt departure from the constitutional balance that we have observed through the course of our history. It raises a number of fundamental questions about our Constitution, our tradition of majority rule, and the power of the judicial branch in the United States. 
One of the lessons I learned in law school was, where there is a wrong, particularly a constitutional wrong, there must be a remedy. Yet this constitutional amendment makes no mention of how it will be enforced and who has the legal standing to question those issues which arise under the constitutional amendment. This is an invitation to litigate rather than legislate on budgetary matters. If a future Congress finds it too difficult to take the painful steps needed to eliminate the deficit, then we may expect any number of possible claimants, from Governors upset about Medicaid payments to senior citizens upset about their Social Security checks, all of them urging the courts to step in and take action. 
Moreover, by placing the requirements that receipts and outlays be reconciled in the Constitution itself, the amendment effectively calls on the Supreme Court to ensure that this mandate is met. While the amendment may leave open the question of how the legislature reaches its positions and what items will be considered outlays and revenues, the Supreme Court will always have an obligation to uphold the Constitution. Once we declare constitutionally that revenues and outlays must be reconciled, the Court will have no inhibition, and, in fact an obligation, to step in and make this reconciliation if Congress fails. 
Likewise, under this amendment the President could be forced to impound funds, to cut off checks, to do many things because of a perceived constitutional mandate. I would think long and hard, and I urge my colleagues to think long and hard, whether or not we want to surrender what is traditionally the authority of the Congress over both the courts and the President to manage the public purse. These issues are all very difficult ones, raising profound questions of constitutional law. 
One other aspect of the proposal which is disturbing is the departure from a tradition in this country of majority rule. I have mentioned before the supermajorities which would be required to raise the debt limit and to do other things which today only require a majority vote of the Members of the House and the Senate. Indeed, the balanced budget amendment would create new supermajorities in many different areas. When the founders developed the Constitution, they recognized that only majority rule would work for a nation founded on the principles of liberty and opportunity. James Madison argued in Federalist 58 that if more than a majority were required for legislative decision, then: 
. . . in all cases where justice or the general good might require new laws to be passed, or active measures to be pursued, the fundamental principles of free government would be reversed. It would be no longer the majority that would rule: the power would be transferred to the minority. 
And, indeed, that is what this amendment would do inexorably. 
There is a final and significant issue which must be discussed with respect to this balanced budget amendment proposal. I believe it jeopardizes the integrity of the Social Security system and raises the specter of encroachments on the system, not to support seniors but to pay for the reckless spending of the 1980's. 
My State has the Nation's third highest percentage population of senior citizens. These are the men and women who fought in World War II and who made our country an economic power. Their sacrifices have made our Nation what it is today. They deserve our support and they rightly demand our assistance to maintain a dignified retirement. 
The hallmark of our commitment to these seniors has been the Social Security system. However, this amendment makes no provision to protect this essential program from the choices necessary to achieve a balanced budget. The amendment fails to recognize that Social Security is not just like every other program. It is directly funded through a dedicated payroll tax, and numerous acts of Congress have sought to protect it from improper manipulation or precipitous reductions in benefits. Yet the majority refuses to protect Social Security and, instead, wants to use the Social Security trust fund to mask the deficit. 
Mr. President, recently the Congressional Research Service produced a report regarding the impact of the balanced budget amendment on Social Security, which contained a shocking revelation. The report found that the Social Security Administration, even though it has accumulated a very healthy surplus, would not be able to pay benefits in certain years, due to the amendment's requirements that total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year. In other words, Social Security could only pay as much in benefits as it receives from payroll taxes in any given year, even if the trust fund was running a multibillion-dollar surplus from previous years. This is a grave matter that deserves more analysis and could jeopardize the 1983 Social Security reform law as well as future reform efforts. But it would be a consequence of this balanced budget amendment if adopted today or in the future. 
Some would argue that no legislator would touch the Social Security system, but a constitutional imperative may provide a shield which would allow legislators to break that sacred commitment between ourselves and those seniors who have contributed so much to this country. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this balanced budget amendment. The Constitution establishes the durable rights and responsibilities which are the heritage of our past and the best guarantee of our future. We should not let the Constitution fall prey to a proposal that reflects transient economic policy at best, and would erode both majority rule and the principle that the people's representatives, not judges, must be responsible for the public purse. 
Mr. President, before I yield, I would like to thank Senator Feingold for his graciousness in delaying consideration of his amendment in order to permit me to go forward with my statement. 
I thank the Senator from Wisconsin and I yield my time.

Mr. REED. I rise today to speak about an issue that is critical to our country and critical to our future, and that issue is education. 
Education has always been crucial to our country. Indeed, one of the greatest triumphs of our Nation has been the creation of public education through high school and in the postwar years the expansion of access to higher education. 
Our ancestors grasped a fundamental truth. Education is the engine that powers our economy, and it is the force that sustains our over 200-year experiment in democracy. `Yankee ingenuity,' groomed in the schoolrooms of New England and transported across the continent, spurred an era of invention that catapulted America to economic leadership. But education is more than just economic progress. Education has allowed us to keep faith with the basic tenet of our country. At the core of American experience is the commitment to equal opportunity, and education is the greatest source of opportunity in a free society. It can transcend the circumstances of income, region, race, and gender to reaffirm the enduring belief that an individual through effort can achieve his or her fullest potential in America. 
Throughout our history, education has always been an important part of the American experience. Today, it is rapidly becoming the essential component of our national life. The combination of extraordinary progress in technology, particularly information technology, and the unprecedented growth of international commerce has made education the key to our leadership in the world and our prosperity here at home. 
As we pass from the industrial age to the information age, the work of the future demands skills which only can be obtained through lifetime learning. And as we move into an era of global competition, we find ourselves pitted against workers and students around the world. What might have been adequate for America in the age of the Model T in a more insular world is plainly inadequate in the age of the Pentium processor and in a world in which the boundaries of business seldom conform to the boundaries of nations. 
As Norman Augustine, vice chairman and CEO of Lockheed-Martin, said, `More and more, we see that competition in the international market place is in reality a battle of the classrooms.' 
The American people recognize that we can and we must do much more to improve the quality of education. Studies comparing American students with their foreign contemporaries in the `battle of the classrooms,' as referred to by Mr. Augustine, show that American students are not first in the world. In fact, they are only about average. The third international mathematics and science study, TIMSS for short, the largest international science and math study ever undertaken, was released last fall. 
The study found that U.S. eighth graders scored barely above the world average in science and below the world average in mathematics. Being `average' will not sustain the United States in a world where technology and trade demand excellence. 
Just last month, Education Week, in collaboration with the Pew Charitable Trust, released a report card on the condition of public schools in the 50 States. The report characterized public education in the United States as `riddled with excellence but rife with mediocrity.' With respect to the bottom line, student performance, the conclusion of the report is sobering. `We did not give States a letter grade. If we had, all would have failed. Nationally, only 28 percent of 4th graders tested in 1994 were able to read at or above the proficient level and only 21 percent of 8th graders tested in 1992 were proficient or better in math.' 
The American people recognize these shortcomings and the compelling need to enhance education in the United States. They 
also want the Federal Government to play an appropriate role in this process of educational reform. Last month, a survey was released by the Coalition for America's Children, and it found that 76 percent of those polled favored increases in Federal spending for education. 
However, spending alone will not reinvigorate education in the United States. At every level of Government--Federal, State, and local--calling on parents, teachers, business and community leaders, the great civic core of America, we must all work together to make education come alive in the lives of our children. Our task is twofold: To improve the quality of public education and to enhance access to higher education. 
Now, when we consider elementary and secondary education, we immediately must recognize the central role played by the States. Historically, States have been the leaders in public education from grades K through 12. And when we boast of the extraordinary success of public education in the United States throughout our history, we are paying tribute to the foresight and wisdom of State and local leaders who invested in education. But it is not without some irony that today, as we talk about devolution of more and more social programs and policies to the States, we at the same time point to the disturbing signs of educational malaise. The `devolutionists' frequently prescribe the States as the all-purpose remedy for every social problem, forgetting that the States like the Feds are political institutions awash in conflicting interests and afflicted with lapses of political will. That is not to suggest that the role of education in the States has been overtaken. It should suggest, however, that States alone have not and cannot cut through the tangle of financial difficulties, political interests and emerging problems that beset public education as we approach the next century. There is a real opportunity and need for Federal leadership as a catalyst for reform. 
In confronting the challenge of public education, we cannot confine ourselves to just the schools. We must reach out beyond the schools to the children. The first goal of Goals 2000 is that all children will start school ready to learn. And as we discover more and more about childhood development, this goal becomes increasingly more important. It also becomes increasingly more obvious that our efforts must encompass the youngest children as well as those children just ready to enter school. Scientific evidence points to the critical years from birth to age 3 in the development of intellectual and emotional abilities. As such, child care is an essential part of any strategy for the long-term improvement of education. Good prenatal care, pediatric health care, and quality day care are all components of educational reform. In fact, an emphasis on early intervention may save scarce educational dollars in the long run. Research indicates that children who attend quality child care programs are less likely to be placed in special education or to be retained in grade. 
It is here in the area of child care that the Federal Government has long played an important roll. With the creation of the Head Start program in 1965, the Federal Government embarked on an ambitious attempt to reach low-income children. Over the past several decades, Head Start has gained widespread and bipartisan support. But despite this support, the program still only serves one out of three eligible children. More must be done to reach a larger population of eligible children. Moreover, we must consciously develop programs that involve very young children. 
If we are serious about having all children ready to learn when they enter school, then we must commit ourselves to ensuring that every child has affordable access to quality health care and day care. We cannot and should not usurp the role of parents. As such, our strategies should be just as much about enabling parents to be better parents, with the time and income to do their part, as it is to reach out and teach the children. 
While we summon the will and the resources to prepare children for school, we cannot ignore the urgent need to reform our schools. The recent study by Education Week revealed that on average less than one-third of fourth graders were proficient in reading and less than one-third of eighth graders were proficient in math. In a comparison of cut-off points on employer tests to student scores on national standardized exams, researchers, Richard Murnane and Frank Levy, found that `close to half of all 17-year-olds cannot read or do math at the level needed to get a job in a modern automobile plant.' And consistent with these findings, the TIMSS report revealed that American students were not leading the world but were about average in a world economy that increasingly demands excellence, not mediocrity. 
In evaluating this lackluster performance, the TIMSS report surprisingly did not blame the usual suspects--too much TV, not enough class time, not enough homework. It turns out that American eighth graders spend more hours per year in math and science classes than their Japanese and German counterparts. American teachers assign more homework and spend more class time discussing it than teachers in Germany and Japan. And, it turns out that heavy TV watching is as common among Japanese eighth graders as it is among American eighth graders. What then is the problem? The TIMSS report strongly suggests that American students receive a `less-advanced curriculum, which is also less focused.' At the heart of this disappointing performance is the content and rigor of what is taught and the techniques used to teach it. In short, content and instructional standards are not adequate. 
We will not materially improve public education in the United States until we adopt challenging standards, assess the performance of children with regard to these standards, and hold schools accountable for these 
standards. Standards, assessment, accountability: the keys to reinvigorating public education. 
A few years back, there was a popular book entitled All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten. I guess I was a little slow because I'm tempted to say I learned a great deal in the Army and that was many years after kindergarten. One of the great lessons of my Army experience is the transforming power of high quality standards, realistic assessments, and accountability. In the wake of the Vietnam war, a demoralized and publicly scorned military began to reinvent itself and, over the last 2 decades, has become one of the most effective institutions in the country. Many factors can be cited: the development of an all volunteer force, the leadership of an extraordinary group of professionals who served in Vietnam and went on to senior positions in the Pentagon. But, a critical, and sometimes overlooked, factor was the development of training doctrine that rested on detailed standards and realistic assessments. 
As a company grade officer, I saw the transition from unimaginative field manuals couched in general terms to materials that broke down missions into constituent tasks, stressed the mastery of these tasks, and, then, the careful merging of individual tasks into group effort. At every stage, clear standards of performance were identified and evaluated. Complementing these doctrinal changes was a renewed emphasis on `training the trainer'. Professional development was stressed not only for officers but throughout the ranks, particularly non-commissioned officers who are the backbone of the military. Finally, accountability, always a hallmark of the military service, could be refocused from the mundane, `did the troops look good', to the critical, could the unit accomplish its mission in the most realistic circumstances. American education, today, seems to be at a similar crossroads as the post-Vietnam military. And, the lesson of standards, assessments, and accountability seems equally compelling, for education today. 
American students are graded from the moment they enter school. They repeatedly take tests. But, seldom are they measured against agreed upon content standards. As such, school is less about understanding a core body of knowledge and using that knowledge than it is about attendance. For too many students, the only `standard' that counts is showing up frequently enough to get a high school diploma. Thus, it is no surprise that half of high school graduates would have a difficult time getting a job in a modern automobile plant. 
In a recent survey by a national non-profit group, Public Agenda, reported in the Washington Post, high school students expressed their criticism of school. At the top of their list was the observation that their classes are not challenging enough. A typical response from a student is revealing. ` 'I didn't do one piece of homework last year in math' he said. 'I just took the tests . I'd get A's on the tests, not do the homework, and I got a B in class. There's just lots of ways to get around it.' This subering comment was found throughout this discussion in the report, but, the researchers were encouraged to find `strong support among students for having tougher standards in class. Three-fourths of them said they believed they would learn more, and school would seem more meaningful, if they were pushed harder by better teachers.' As Deborah Wadsworth, the executive director of Public Agenda, declared, `The students seem to be crying out for the adults in their lives to take a stand and inspire them to do more.' 
Standards are about excellence, but they are also about equality of opportunity. Diane Ravitch, a professor at Columbia and a former official in President Bush's education department, wrote,  
`[n]ations that establish national standards do so to insure equality of education as well as higher achievement . . . they make explicit what they expect children to learn to insure that all children have access to the same educational opportunities.' Until we establish effective standards and evaluate children according to those standards, we will continue to ignore disparities in the educational experience of children throughout the United States. 
In keeping with the critical role of standards as benchmarks for excellence and equality of opportunity, it is exciting to note President Clinton's proposal to develop voluntary national assessments for reading at the fourth grade and math at the eighth grade. These assessments could truly be the bridge between standards and accountability; the bridge to a renewal of public education, in the United States. 
Recognizing the critical role that standards can play in the reformation of public education, Congress in 1994 adopted the Goals 2000: Educate America Act. Goals 2000 sought to place voluntary national standards at the center of national debate about educational reform. 
As a member of the Education and Labor Committee in the other body, I was an active participant in the drafting of Goals 2000. I vigorously pressed to ensure that standards were a key component of the strategy for educational reform, and that there would be accountability for these standards. One of the persistent failures of educational reform is the failure to follow through. We all are aware of repeated studies that chronicle the problems of public education and propose credible reforms, but never seemed to go anylace. All of these studies seem to languish, gathering dust on the shelves. Even if the diagnosis is right, no mechanism is put in place to translate plans into results. 
As such, I thought that, along with standards, the Goals 2000 process should require the state and local educational authorities to answer a fundamental question: what will you do when a school or a school system fails to meet the standards established for its students? Failure to answer this question and to act accordingly will doom meaningful educational reform. 
I was pleased that a provision encompassing this question was included as a requirement of the state plan pursuant to Goals 2000. In the spirit of the voluntary nature of Goals 2000, the Federal Government did not mandate any particular approach to failing schools, but, in the process of developing standards-based reform, it would prompt states to ask this fundamental question. This provision is still on the books. However, the overall importance of the state plan has been diminished. Tucked into the budget signed by President Clinton in April of 1996 is language that removes the requirement for these State plans to be submitted to the Secretary of Education. 
This unraveling of the minimal requirements of Goals 2000 does not bode well for ultimately tackling the tough issues of reform at the local level. Without the `seriousness' engendered by preparing a submission for Secretarial review, these plans might become another specimen on the dusty shelf of accumulated plans for educational reform. Moreover, despite the protests of many local elected leaders, many local educational leaders will concede that requirements in Washington frequently help them to cut through the tangle of local interests that impede effective local reform. 
Nevertheless, Goals 2000 is a milestone in emphasizing voluntary national standards and hopefully will continue to serve as a springboard for educational reform. Standards are critical, but without good teaching these standards will also languish.
