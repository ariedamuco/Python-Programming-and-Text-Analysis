    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as America honors and remembers those who have served in our armed forces, I want to recognize the service of Mr. Gervase Miller, a North Dakota native who served his country during World War II. Mr. Miller was drafted into the Army in September 1942 and was away from home while his wife was pregnant with their first child. Although deaf in one ear, Mr. Miller served with distinction for more than three years in China, Burma, and India. 
   Mr. Miller was a part of the 1575th Heavy Shop Engineers, a group of men who helped to build roads in Burma and then drove heavy supply trucks in this dangerous territory. Throughout his service in the Army, Mr. Miller earned three Battle Stars and one Bronze Star for his heroic actions. 
   He finally came home for good in December 1945. He was discharged as a Technician, 5th Grade. It is men like Gervase Miller who won World War II for the Allies and helped to guarantee the rights and freedoms that we all enjoy today. 
   Today, Mr. Miller lives in Parshall, North Dakota, with his wife Bernice. They have four children and 9 grandchildren. As his family gathers for Christmas this year, I want to send out warm holiday greetings to him and a word of appreciation for his service to our country more than 50 years ago.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the American people last evening heard a concession speech by Vice President GORE and a speech by Gov. George W. Bush, who is now the President-elect. 
   I supported Vice President GORE. I wish the result had been different in this election. But we have a process for contesting elections, and that process was finalized by the actions of the U.S. Supreme Court. I accept those actions, and we now have a new President-elect. 
   We went through some difficult times after the election day, and those times inflamed the passions of many Americans. The fact is, the American people created almost a dead even tie in casting votes for the Presidency. It wasn't just the Presidency. It was a 50-50 split in the membership of the Senate, and nearly a 50-50 split in the House, and as I indicated, a near tie vote for the Presidency. That is not likely to happen again in our lifetime. It is not unusual for the person on the losing end to want to make certain that all the votes are counted and counted correctly. So that is why we went through that process. 
   I know many passions were inflamed as a result of it. In fact, some of my colleagues--not so much in this body but in the other body--were using words such as ``stealing elections,'' and so on. I regret that those words were used. I don't think it contributes to what we ought to be doing. That is all gone and done. 
   As of last evening, we have a President-elect who addressed this country, and we have a Vice President who conceded that election. 
   Despite the fact that Congress is divided almost evenly between the Republicans and Democrats, all of us wish the new President-elect well. 
   It will behoove all of us to work together and extend ourselves to each other and try to create some unity, and move forward on things on which we can agree. There will still be policy differences, I might say, and we should aggressively debate them. But I think the American people want us to try to work together to find areas of bipartisanship, and we will do that. I, for one, am interested in seeing us make the progress on important issues for our country. 
   Let me make this comment as well. We not only will now have a new President. This new President inherits an economy that is going through some changes, some subtle and some not so subtle.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Federal Reserve Board meets on Tuesday of next week. The Federal Reserve Board has increased interest rates six times since June 1999 in search of inflation. They are terribly afraid that there is inflation either under the bed, or in the closet, or just around the corner, out in the garage, near the driveway, or somewhere inflation exists. Of course, all the evidence suggests that the core rate of inflation is very low--well within moderate levels. In fact, the Producer Price Index released this morning suggests that the core rate did not increase at all in November. The Consumer Price Index will be released tomorrow, and I suspect it will show something very similar. 
   Next week when the Federal Reserve Board meets, in my judgment, it will behoove them to reduce the additional tax on money they have imposed with six increases in the Federal funds rate. 
   Let me describe why I think we ought to do that. This economy is slowing. After unprecedented economic growth in this country, this economy is slowing. The evidence is all around us. 
   Manufacturing activity for the fourth straight month ending in November has declined. The National Association of Purchasing Management recently reported that its purchasing index had dropped to 47.7 percent from 48.3 percent. 
   Auto makers are idling plants. The real output of cars and trucks fell by some 20 percent over the second and third quarters. Car and light truck sales have fallen for the past 6 months with the largest drop in over 2 years in November. 
   The number of manufacturing jobs declined by 220,000 in the last 4 months. Factory orders are falling. 
   Factory orders plummeted 3.3 percent in October in its weakest showing in 3 months. 
   Housing starts and sales are off. Retail sales are well off. Yesterday, the Commerce Department reported retail sales fell by an unexpected 0.4 percent in November. 
   I will not go on at great length. But the evidence is all around us. This economy is slowing. 
   The Federal Reserve Board says it wants to slow the economy. The debate now is what kind of landing will occur--a ``soft'' or a ``hard'' landing, in the lexicon or jargon of economists. Nobody knows. 
   I taught economics in college briefly, and I have said I overcame that experience. The fact is that economists don't know what is going to happen in the future. The field of economics, as I have said previously, is nothing more than psychology pumped up with a little helium. They tell us what they think is going to happen in the future. 
   Prior to the last recession, 35 out of 40 leading economists in this country predicted that next year would be a  year of continued economic growth. That is what the field of economics produces. 
   What is going to happen in the future? I worry that this slowdown could very easily move this country into a recession. We have to be careful about that. 
   The Federal funds rate that the Fed has established is too high. It results in a prime interest rate that is too high. It results in higher interest rates paid by every American on their consumer debt, and on their real estate debt, and so on. That is higher than it should be. As a result of the Fed's six interest rate increases, the average household in this country pays about $1,700 a year more in interest charges. If we were going to have a tax on the American people, we would have great debate about it. This is a tax on money, and it is has required an average household to pay $1,700 a year more in interest charges. 
   There is no debate on that. It is done behind the closed doors down at the Fed. They have their wish. The economy is slowing down. 
   The question is, Will they have the sense next week to decide to reverse course and understand two things? One, there isn't any real inflation problem; and, two, they are overcharging for money, and they ought to begin reducing short-term interest rates because they have increased them too much. 
   These are the folks who go behind closed doors and make these decisions. There is no public discussion or debate here. 
   Here are the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks. They serve on a rotating basis as part of the Open Market Committee and as part of the decisionmaking down at the Fed. 
   Next Tuesday they will close the door. The American public isn't allowed in. They will make decisions about what kind of tax we will have on money. Six interest rate increases have been ordered by these folks over the last year and a half. They have slowed down the American economy. 
   Looking at housing starts, autos, and retail sales across the board in economic activity, in my judgment, they are tinkering with the notion of allowing this country to experience the beginning of a recession. That would be most unfortunate. 
   I want people to understand. Here are the names of the folks who are there. Here is their education, background, and their salaries. 
   I think it is important for us to understand who is making public policy behind locked doors. Next Tuesday, when they talk about monetary policy, I think the American people ought to understand that the question of the interest rates and the amount of interest they pay on their credit cards, home equity loans and so on depend on what these folks are doing with respect to the Federal funds rate. It is very important. 
   I worry very much that this economy may well head towards a recession unless we do something to reverse the course that the Fed has taken.

   Mr. DORGAN. I agree with that. One could find important uses for it, or perhaps give it back to the taxpayers. But this is a circumstance where the Federal Reserve Board, according to the GAO investigation that was done, has a rainy day fund. Can you imagine having a rainy day fund in a climate where it never rains? The Federal Reserve Board can never lose money. It will never lose money, and has never lost money. They accumulated a rainy day fund of some $3.7 billion. It is more now. 
   Here you have this last dinosaur on America's hill--the Federal Reserve Board--that operates in secret behind closed doors that creates its own rainy day fund. The GAO says they don't need it. They shouldn't have it. It ought to be given back. 
   Guess what. A couple of years after that study was complete, has that rainy day fund been divested by the Fed, and given back to the taxpayers? The answer is no. Of course not. Why? Because this Congress usually won't touch the Fed with a 10-foot pole. 
   There is this language about monetary policy that prevents almost anybody from even talking about it. That is one of the reasons I wanted to talk today about what happens next Tuesday. 
   Our economy, in my judgment, is in some difficulty. It has gone down dramatically. We have a new President who will be sworn into office, and may well inherit an economy that is slowing down, and could even be heading towards a recession, at least in part, because the Fed has decided they want to slow down the economy. 
   Six times they increased interest rates; they create a new tax on money, impose a new burden on every American family, and nobody thinks much about it. 
   It is time to turn that around. The prime interest rate is too high by at least two percentage points, and as a result, all other interest rates in this country are too high. Why? Because the Fed has pegged the price of money at an artificially high rate because they want to slow the economy down. The fact is they run the risk of pushing this economy off the track of unprecedented long-term economic growth and into the ditch of a slowdown into a potential recession and increased Federal deficits. 
   I hope the Fed will think long and hard next Tuesday about this subject and decide it is time to begin reducing interest rates following the six rate increases they have imposed on the American people. 
   I will speak more about this. My expectation is we will probably finish this session this week, so I will not speak on the floor of the Senate next week. But before the Fed meets on Tuesday, I want to give more advice on Monday. They seldom take my advice, but I think they would be wise, if they want to ignore my advice, to at least listen to some of the good economic thinkers around this country who worry a great deal that what is happening to our economy is it is slowing and threatening to head into a very difficult period. Now is the time, not later, to do something. 
   The Fed talks about preemptive strikes against inflation. My friends, there is no inflation at this point. All the evidence suggests inflation is well under control. What about a preemptive strike by the Federal Reserve Board preventing the economy from heading toward a recession? That would make sense next Tuesday. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know that the Federal Reserve Board reads everything. They are voracious readers of the economists who gather this information, provide it to the Fed, and assimilate it and make judgments. 
   Let me give a factoid for their consideration. I have no idea what it means. The Oscar Meyer Weinermobile, one of the vehicles that runs around the country, had an opening for a driver in the newspaper the other day. They were placing a help-wanted ad for a driver for the Oscar Meyer Weinermobile. They got 800 college graduates applying. I have no idea what that means. 
   It just occurred to me as the Fed looks at information about the economy, they might look at interesting things about this economy: Where it is headed, what is happening, who is employed, who isn't, and what might happen, 3, 6, and 12 months from now, and don't relent on interest rates and steer us back toward a longer term economic growth prospect.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago on December 8, 1999: 
   Walter Bryant, 23, Philadelphia, PA; 
   Bernardo Gonzales, 69, San Francisco, CA; 
   Demetris Green, 24, Kansas City, MO; 
   Arian McCollough, 23, Philadelphia, PA; 
   Diante Whitfield, 16, Oakland, CA; and 
   Unidentified Male, 60, Honolulu, HI. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I saw the Senator from Washington, Mrs. MURRAY, talking about her colleague, Senator SLADE GORTON. I wanted to come over and say a word about Senator GORTON. 
   I know people who perhaps watch the proceedings of the Senate see the tug and the pull of debate on public policy and probably think to themselves, gee, those people don't get along very well, or maybe those people don't like each other very much. 
   The fact is, most of us get along well and enjoy each other's company. SLADE GORTON is one of those Senators, a Republican, someone with whom I have severed on the Appropriations and Commerce Committees. We get along well, like each other, and he has been extraordinarily helpful to me. He is a Senator who always did his homework. There are some with whom you visit about the issues, you get kind of a glassy-eyed stare because you know that this isn't an issue on which they are connecting with you or haven't studied very much. I didn't find that with SLADE GORTON. He was always prepared and had always done his homework. And while at times he could be a bit frustrating because he took a position on an issue that you might have felt was the wrong position, he always had an opportunity to explain it because he had done his homework. 
   He was a fellow with an independent and stubborn streak, somebody who was patient and helpful. I enjoyed the opportunity to serve with him in the Senate. 
   He actually was elected to the Senate for the first time the same year I was elected to the U.S. House in 1980. We had an opportunity to be on a panel discussion way back in 1980 and talked about our entry into that Congress. 
   One of the things SLADE GORTON told me was that he had bicycled across North Dakota. I was surprised by that, but apparently he and his family had bicycled all across America. And in doing so, they had bicycled across I-94 or highway 2 through the State of North Dakota. We had a chance to talk a little about his acquaintance with North Dakota from a bicycle. 
   This is not a eulogy. We have a number of Members of the Senate who are leaving us, distinguished people who have given immense public service to this country. I have deep admiration and respect for all of them. Because my colleague from the State of Washington was talking about her colleague, Senator GORTON, I wanted to come to say that I have enjoyed serving with him. He has been very helpful to me in a range of ways on both the Commerce Committee and the Appropriations Committee. I wish him well as he leaves his service here in the Senate. 
   I will come to the floor at some point to speak about the other Senators who  have contributed so much and who are now leaving the Senate Chamber. 
   I thank Senator MURRAY for doing this. She is a remarkable Representative from her State, as was Senator GORTON. We will now be joined by another Senator, Ms. CANTWELL, from the State of Washington, and I look forward to working with her as well.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me, for 1 minute, add my voice to those today who paid tribute to Senator ASHCROFT for his service in the Senate. 
   As I indicated earlier, some think because we are engaged in heavy debate from time to time that we are not friends. Across the aisle, Senator ASHCROFT and I worked on a piece of legislation, one which we passed early on when he came to the Senate dealing with Federal funding of physician-assisted suicide. We worked together, and it was passed. It is now law. 
   We worked a great deal for a long period of time on lifting sanctions with respect to the sale of food and medicine. It is a fight that will continue even after Senator ASHCROFT leaves the service of the Senate. 
   Also, a couple of times, I joined Senator ASHCROFT and the quartet on the Republican side with the Singing Senators, along with my colleagues, Senator DASCHLE and Senator BOXER. I think on one other occasion I joined Senator ASHCROFT and the quartet. I have seen Senator ASHCROFT in action in a number of ways. 
   My expectation of his public service is that it is not at an end. I appreciate the service he has given to this country and to the Senate. I appreciate having had the opportunity to work with him. I know him to be smart and tough and tenacious on the issues about which he cares deeply. I wish him well.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on November 23 the Washington Post had a story about a murderer that I want to call to my colleagues' attention. This is the picture of the alleged murderer, Elmer Spencer, Jr. The headline of the story reads: ``Sex Offender's Arrest Makes an Issue of Mandatory Release.'' 
   Let me describe for a moment what I read in the story and how I related it to things I have spoken about on the floor of the Senate before and how disappointed I am that nothing ever seems to change. 
   The young boy who was murdered a couple of weeks ago was a 9-year-old from Frederick, MD. His name was Christopher Lee Ausherman. He attended fourth grade at the South Frederick Elementary School. He had two brothers. The story said he liked Pokemon cards and was developing a real passion for fishing. He was apparently in his neighborhood, very close to his home on the street or sidewalk, and then a maintenance found his badly beaten, naked body in a dugout at McCurdy Field in Frederick, MD. Christopher Lee Ausherman had been sexually assaulted and strangled. 
   The story described how the arrest was made. I want to talk about the fellow who has been arrested and charged with this murder. The fact that he was on the streets in this country to murder anyone is unconscionable and shameful. 
   Elmer Spencer, Jr. was sentenced to 5 years for assault and battery in 1977, 23 years ago, and released 3 years later. Within a year of his release, he raped and attempted to strangle an 11-year-old boy. He paid him $20 to drink liquor and then tried to strangle him with shoelaces. Spencer left him unconscious after raping him. The boy regained consciousness as Elmer Spencer's attention was diverted, and miraculously escaped. Elmer Spencer was sentenced to 22 years in prison for that crime and released in 1994 after serving 14 years in prison. 
   In 1996, Elmer Spencer, Jr. was charged with attempted rape and three counts of assault. He attacked the police officers responding to the cries for help from a woman whom he was attempting to rape. He was sentenced to 10 years, and, amazingly, released on November 14 of this year, after serving just 3 and a half years. 
   Five days later, Christopher Lee Ausherman, a 9-year-old boy from Frederick, MD, was murdered by this man. Five days after being released from prison, having served 3 and a half years of 10-year sentence, this pedophile, this man who had attempted murder previously, killed this 9-year-old boy. 
   The question is, When will we learn in this country? We know who is committing the crimes, especially the violent crimes, in most cases. It is someone who has committed other violent crimes, been put in prison, and often released early.  
   I spoke to the family of this 9-year-old boy. There is not much you can do to console that family. They are grieving, obviously, for the loss of this young boy. But I told them some Members are working very hard to try to change the circumstances of release for violent prisoners. 
   I have spoken many times on this floor about other crimes that are exactly the same--different victims, but exactly the same. Young Bettina Pruckmayr--I brought her picture to the floor of 
   this Senate--a 26-year-old human rights attorney who moved to this town with such great expectations and passion to do work in this area. On December 16, 1995, she was at an ATM machine and a man named Leo Gonzales Wright apprehended her there. He was a man who should have been in prison. He had committed many previous crimes. 
   At the age of 19, Leo Gonzales Wright was sentenced to 15 to 60 years for armed robbery and murder. He was released after 17 years. During those 17 years, he compiled a record of 38 disciplinary reports and transfers due to drug use, lack of program involvement, weapons possession in prison, and assaults on inmates and staff. Despite all that, he was let out early, so that in December of 1995 he was on the streets here in Washington, DC. He was able to stab young Bettina Pruckmayr 38 times. It wasn't that we didn't know he was a violent offender. He had used a butcher knife just four days earlier to rob and carjack a female motorist. While on probation and parole, he was picked up for drugs and let right back out on the streets. As a result, Bettina Pruckmayr was killed. 
   Jonathan Hall. I have spoken about Jonathan Hall here on the floor of the Senate; it is exactly the same story. Jonathan was a 13-year-old from Fairfax, VA. The boy had some difficulties, but in the newspaper stories I read about young Jonathan neighbors described him as a smart young boy, starved for affection. His mother reported him missing in December, 1995. Twelve days later, his body was found at the bottom of a pond near his home. He had been stabbed over 60 times with a phillips-head screwdriver. After this young boy had died, they found grass between his fingers. Despite being stabbed 60 times, he was not dead when his attacker left him. This young boy tried to claw his way out of that pond, and they found grass and mud between his fingers, but he didn't make it. James Buck Murray, who lived right there in the neighborhood, killed him. 
   Why was he living there? In 1970, Murray was sentenced to 20 years for slashing the throat of a cab driver, stealing the cab, and leaving the driver for dead. But a mere 3 years later, while on work-releasee, he abducted a woman, was convicted of kidnapping, and sent back to prison. But again he was let out. And then young Jonathan Hall, of course, was murdered. By someone we knew? Of course. By someone violent? Of course. Murray had been put in prison and released early. 
   Shame on those who run our prison system. Shame on the laws that exist, that allow this to happen. 
   I have asked, in this recent case in Maryland with Christopher Lee Ausherman, how could it be that a man who has been involved in such violent crimes--how could it be that, when sentenced to 10 years, he is released after 3 1/2 ? This is after many other crimes, mind you, and 5 days after his release, he kills a 9-year-old boy. How can it be he is released that early? 
   The answer? Unforgivable ignorance in the construction of public policy. I am sorry to say that about those who did it, but I cannot contain myself. Those who did it say those who served in prison for previous convictions can accumulate additional good-time credits at an accelerated pace against their current sentence because they have been in prison before. That is ignorance. We ought not reward anyone with ample or better good-time benefits because they served in prison before. Violent offenders ought to be put in prison and that ought to be their address until the end of their prison term. End of story. 
   I am so sick and tired of reading stories about innocent people--and I have mentioned just three. I have many more. I am so sick and tired of reading the stories about state governments that allow violent offenders out of prison to walk up and down the streets of this country and kill again. 
   Do you know, if you live in the United States of America you are seven times more likely to be murdered than if you live in France? The murder rate in our country is 7 times that of Germany, 6 times that of Israel, 10 times that of Japan, 7 times that of Spain. Is there something wrong here? I think so. 
   Let me show you what is happening in our prison system. For all the talk about truth in sentencing, if state convicts you of murder in this country on average you are going to be in prison 10 years. You are going to get sentenced for 21 years but you are going to be serving about 10 years in prison for murder. Rape? You can expect to serve about 5 years in prison. They will sentence you to 10 on average, but you are only going to be there about 5. For robbery you are going to be sentenced to a littel over 8 years, perhaps, and you will serve 4 years. 
   What is the answer to all this? Why are these folks let out early? Why would we decide in this country that a murderer should only serve half of his or her sentence? The prison authorities and others who construct these laws tell us the reason they have to dangle good-time benefits in front of these prisoners, including violent offenders, is because it allows the authorities to better manage them while in prison. In other words, if they behave while in prison they can get out early. That is a terrific incentive, they say, for prison inmate management. 
   I wonder, I ask the question about the management of Elmer Spencer, Jr. I wonder if I could get names of the people who decided the best way to manage Elmer Spencer, Jr.'s time in prison was to dangle in front of him the opportunity to be released 7 years early, so he could be on the streets in late November of this year and murder a 9-year-old boy? I guess the word is ``allegedly murdered him'' because he is now charged with the crime, but am told there is little question about the guilt in this case. 
   I wonder if we could have the names of those who have decided it is appropriate for James ``Buck'' Murray to be on the streets, or Leo Gonzales Wright to be on the streets after being convicted of 
   murder, only to murder again; violent criminals to be back on the streets so Bettina and young Jonathan and all the others are victims. 
   What is the answer? The answer is simple. This is not rocket science. It is simple. It is to decide as a policy--as I have advocated for some while, regrettably unsuccessfully--that in this country we distinguish between those who commit violent crimes and those who commit nonviolent crimes. In my judgment, we ought to have a judicial system in America that says: If you commit a violent act, understand this. All over America, understand this and listen well: If you commit a violent act, there will be no good time, there will be no parole, there will be no time off for good behavior. You will go to prison and the sentence administered by the judge in your trial will be the sentence that you serve in prison. No time off for good behavior--period. 
   We need to do that in this country. I have tried and tried and tried again in this Senate to advance that public policy, unsuccessfully. But I am not going to quit. This 106th Congress is ending without great distinction. We didn't even discuss the issue of violent crime. We should. I hope we will in the 107th Congress. I hope perhaps there are Republicans and Democrats who understand that there is nothing partisan about this issue. But there is a crying need in this country to decide that violent offenders must be put away and kept away for their entire term of incarceration. 
   In 1991, the Bureau of Justice Statistics found there were 156,000 people in State prisons for offenses that they committed while they were on parole from a previous conviction. 
   Let me say that again because it is important: 156,000 people were incarcerated for criminal offenses that they committed while they were out on parole from a previous prison sentence. 
   That is exactly the case in the description of the murder I started with today. It is exactly the case with Elmer Spencer, Jr., out early and a 9-year-old is dead. This is not an unusual story. I could speak for 2 hours and more, and not just about Maryland or Virginia or the District of Columbia. There is a courageous young woman  from North Dakota named Julie Schultz. Julie Schultz is a friend of mine, a mother of three from Burlington, ND. She was going to a League of Cities meeting in Williston, ND, on a quiet North Dakota highway on an afternoon with very little traffic and stopped at a rest stop. At this rest stop Julie Schultz, mother of three, encountered a man named Gary Wayne Puckett, who should have been in prison but was released early in the State of Washington. This issue knows no State boundaries. He assaulted Julie Schultz and then slit her throat and left her for dead. 
   I won't describe the events that allowed her to survive, but they were quite miraculous. But Gary Wayne Puckett should never have been near a rest stop on a highway in North Dakota on that day. He was released early. 
   Again, we know better than that. State governments should know better than that. Public policy should know better than that. We can do better than that. 
   It is my intention to reintroduce in the coming Congress, in January in the coming Congress, legislation that I have introduced previously. That is legislation that would provide financial penalties in the truth-in-sentencing grants that are given from the Federal Government to the State government, for those States that fail to enact laws that eliminate good-time credits, eliminate the dangling of time off for good behavior. My legislation will use these funds to provide financial incentives for states that say, instead, by statute: If you are convicted of a violent crime, understand your address will be your jail cell until the end of your term. 
   When and if we do that in this country, finally, innocent people walking up and down the streets of America will not be threatened by a violent murderer, a kidnaper, a killer, a rapist, someone who is let out early, and poses a severe threat to innocent citizens like Christopher Lee Ausherman. 
   Mr. President, my understanding is the Senate is now in morning business but there will be additional debate on bankruptcy; is that correct?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I worry very much that we are facing a slowdown in our economy that could be very significant. I hope Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board in December will decide they should begin to cut interest rates. Six increases in interest rates since June 1999 have clearly slowed growth in this country in a way, in some respects, that put us in a perilous position, with the liquidity crisis and a range of other issues that could very well derail the longest and strongest period of economic growth in American history. 
   I will speak more about this later because I see Senator GRASSLEY is about ready to speak on bankruptcy. I do want to say this. I have come to the floor previously when the Federal Reserve Board was searching for evidence of inflation--searching in closets, under beds, in virtually every crevice, trying to find some evidence of inflation, and used that fear to increase interest rates six times. We have had the highest real interest rates for many years in this country, and they threaten, in my judgment, to derail this economic growth. 
   I hope the Fed in December will think seriously about beginning to reduce interest rates to preserve an opportunity for continued growth. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday I voted against cloture on the bankruptcy reform bill. I voted against cloture even though I support bankruptcy reform, and even though I supported this legislation when it originally passed the Senate. 
   However, I oppose the motion to invoke cloture because I am troubled by some of the actions of the Republican majority. Neither the House nor the Senate ever formally named any conferees. Instead, the majority created a sham conference, hollowing out the State Department authorization bill and inserting the provisions of the bankruptcy reform. And even though the original bankruptcy reform bill that passed the Senate was a product of bipartisan input, the majority party did not include any Democrats in the discussions regarding the final package. Negotiators made significant changes to the bill without any input from Democrats. Important provisions were dropped; others were changed dramatically. All of this without the benefit of a formal conference that allows for debate and compromise by both parties. Under these circumstances, I could not support cloture. 
   I still support efforts to reform our bankruptcy laws, and I hope we can achieve this goal before the Senate adjourns sine die. I am disappointed by the way in which the legislative process has been twisted and broken by the majority in the development of this bill. That is why I opposed cloture.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened to my colleagues today--Senator FEINGOLD, Senator DURBIN, Senator WELLSTONE, and now the Democratic  leader, Senator DASCHLE--talk about a number of different issues. I want to take a moment to discuss my disappointment, as we near the end of this legislative session, with what this Congress could have accomplished, what we could have done for the American people, and what we left undone. 
   I note that in this Presidential campaign Governor George W. Bush talks about his desire to come to Washington, DC, to serve in the White House, and end the partisan bickering. As he says, he wants to ``end all of the partisan bickering.'' Well, it takes two to bicker and it takes two parties to bicker in a partisan way. 
   We have almost, on occasion, had debate break out in the Senate on some very important issues. But we never quite had that happen this year because we can't get to an aggressive, robust debate on the things that really matter. 
   My colleagues talked about the bankruptcy bill. How did they do the conference on the bankruptcy bill? One party goes into a room, shuts the door, handpicks their members, and writes it by themselves. It is hard to have bickering, and it is hard to be partisan when one party is doing the work behind a closed door and saying to the other party: Here it is; like it or leave it. 
   The tradition of debate in this country is the sound of real democracy. The sounds of democracy results from bringing people from all around America into our centers of discussion and debate. From all of those areas of the country--from a different set of interests and concerns, from the hills and the valleys and the mountains and the plains and different groups of people--we have ideas developed and nurtured and then debated. 
   Someone once said: When everyone in the room is thinking the same thing, nobody is thinking very much. 
   We have people here who kind of like the notion that you must think the same thing. Apparently, Governor Bush thinks we must all kind of think the same thing; we ought to stop all this disagreement. 
   Disagreement is the engine of democracy. Debate is the engine by which we decide what kinds of policies to implement and what course this country takes in the future. The issues on which we never quite had the aggressive, robust debate that we should have had in this Congress include education. Do you know that for the first time in decades this Congress didn't reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act? We didn't pass it. Why? Because it was feared that when the bill was brought to the floor, people would actually offer amendments. Then we would have to debate amendments and vote on amendments. God forbid a debate should break out in the Senate. So the bill was pulled after a short debate. So we let the Elementary and Secondary Education Act lapse. It just didn't get done. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights is another issue. We had sort of a mini debate here in the Senate on that because it was judged that there wasn't enough time to allow a robust debate. The Patients' Bill of Rights was not considered significant enough to allow a very robust debate on the different positions of the Patients' Bill of Rights. These, of course, are not just abstract discussions. The issue of whether we need a Patients' Bill of Rights is a very 
   significant issue for a lot of American people who are not only battling cancer, but also having to battle their HMO or insurance company to pay for needed medical treatment. 
   I have shown my colleagues many times during discussions on the floor of the Senate a picture of Ethan Bedrick. He was born with horrible difficulties. He was judged by his HMO to only have a 50-percent chance of being able to walk by age 5, which means that his HMO said a 50-percent chance of being able to walk by age 5 was ``insignificant.'' Therefore, they withheld payment for the rehabilitative therapy that Ethan Bedrick needed. 
   An isolated story? No, it goes on in this country all too often, day after day. I have told story after story on the Senate floor about it. We weren't able to get a final vote on this issue. We should have had a vote on the issue of a Patients' Bill of Rights toward the end of the Senate session because we would have had a tie vote, and the Vice President would have sat in that Chair and broken the tie. The Senate would have passed a real Patients' Bill of Rights if given the opportunity to vote again. 
   Do you know why we weren't able to do that? Because those who run this place didn't want a debate to break out. So they managed the Senate in a way that blocked any amendment from being offered. Since September 22 until October 31, not one Member of the Senate on this side of the aisle was allowed to offer one amendment on the floor of the Senate that was not approved by the majority leader. That is why a real debate didn't break out on the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   The issue of fiscal policy is important in this country because we are now in the longest economic expansion in our country's history, and how to continue it is something we would want to have an aggressive, robust debate on. The majority party said: Well, all of this economic expansion is just all accidental. It didn't really result from anything anyone did. 
   Well, of course, that is not true. We passed a new economic plan in this country in 1993. 
   In 1993, we had the largest deficit in the history of this country. This country was headed in the wrong direction, and a new Administration, President Clinton and Vice President Gore, said let's change that; we have a new plan. It was controversial. It was so controversial it passed by one vote in the House and one vote in the Senate. Not one Republican voted for it. 
   They stood on the floor and said: If you pass this, you will throw this country into a depression, and you are going to cost this country jobs, and you will just crater this country's economy. 
   Well, we passed it and guess what happened? The longest economic expansion in our country's history. Unemployment is down, inflation is down, home ownership is up, personal income is up, welfare rolls are down, crime is down, every single aspect of life in this country is better because of what we did in 1993. 
   Now comes George W. Bush and the Republican Party saying: Do you know what we need to do now? We expect budget surpluses in the next 10 years. We need to take a trillion and a half dollars and use it for tax cuts. Let's lock those tax cuts into law right now. 
   Well, a number of groups have provided some very interesting analyses of this plan. Do you know what the threat is? Providing substantial tax cuts, the bulk of which will go to the top 1 percent, will put us right back in the deficit ditch we were in 8 years ago. 
   Don't take it from me. The risks of this kind of fiscal policy were described last week by the American Academy of Actuaries, which is one of the most respected nonpartisan organizations of financial and statistical experts. 
   Their report says the Bush plan would probably signal a return to Federal budget deficits around 2015. 
   I encourage anybody to read their analysis. This is an independent, nonpartisan, respected group that says this tax cut proposal doesn't add up at all; it doesn't add up. 
   One of the questions is, Do we want to jeopardize the economic expansion that has been going on in this country, the progress we have made in this country, an economic plan that turned this country around? Do we want to jeopardize that with a fiscal policy that doesn't make any sense, that will put us back into the same deficits? Or what about having a debate on the question of Governor Bush's proposal of taking $1 trillion out of the Social Security surplus and using it for private Social Security accounts for younger workers? 
   This is what Governor Bush said about that:  
   ......and one of my promises is going to be Social Security reform. And you bet we need to take a trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus.  
   I don't know whether Governor Bush knows this, but the trillion he is talking about is already pledged. The reason we talked earlier about putting Social Security surpluses in a lockbox is we need them. The largest group of babies ever born in this country will retire in the next 10, 15, and 20 years. We are saving to meet their retirement needs. That is the $1 trillion. You cannot use it twice. It has been saved to meet the needs of the Baby Boomers, which is what it was designed for, or you can take it away and use it for private accounts for younger workers,  which is what Governor Bush suggests. If that is the case, you will short change Social Security by $1 trillion. You can't count $1 trillion twice. 
   I simply make the point that on the issue of fiscal policy, we should have had a real debate on the floor of this Senate on fiscal policy. When Governor Bush and others say they don't like the partisan bickering, I don't suppose anybody likes it in those terms. I like robust, aggressive debate. I think that is the sound of democracy in this country. 
   When people say they have plans to take $1 trillion out of Social Security, I say let's debate that. When they say let's have tax cuts that go to the upper income people and I think that will put the country back in a deficit ditch once again, I say let's debate that. When they say we don't have time to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act because somehow it is not important enough, I say that ought to be the subject of aggressive debate in the Senate. 
   Let's not shy away from debate. Let's understand what good, aggressive, honest debate does for this democracy, and let's have a few debates from time to time on things that really matter. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am not going to talk about Texas. There has been plenty of discussion about that tonight. I am going to talk about this country. I saw this morning an interview in which Governor Bush said: ``They had their chance,'' talking about Vice President GORE, of course. ``They had their chance.'' I want to talk about what has happened in the last 8 years. 
   It is important to remember exactly what the Clinton-Gore administration inherited and where we are. They had their chance. Let's talk about President Clinton and Vice President GORE. 
   In 1993, when they took office, we had a $290 billion deficit that year, and it was rising. That deficit was exploding. Our economy was in trouble. Economists predicted slow anemic growth for an entire decade ahead. That is what the Clinton-Gore administration inherited. 
   Now, instead of the largest deficit in history, we have the largest surplus in history. Is that an accident? I don't think so. We had a vote in this Senate and they had a vote in the House on a new plan to take this country to a new direction, and it passed by one vote--one vote in the House and one vote in the Senate. Not one member of the majority party voted for that in either the House or the Senate. We moved this country to a new direction. Now instead of the largest deficits in history, we have the largest surpluses in history. 
   This is a chart which shows what these deficits and surpluses were when Governor Bush said: They had their chance. This is what we inherited from President George Bush in 1992 and 1993: red ink that was growing every year. This country was choking on deficits, and every year, when we changed direction and created a new economic plan to give people hope that we would make the tough decisions to turn this country around, we have seen lower and lower deficits and finally surpluses. That is not an accident. 
   They had their chance, Governor Bush said. They turned the biggest deficits into the biggest surpluses. How about economic growth? In the 12 years prior to the Clinton-Gore administration taking office, average economic growth was 2.8 percent. Since then, economic growth has been on average 3.9 percent. 
   Jobs: 1988 to 1992 was one of the worst 4-year periods in history for the creation of jobs. In fact, I have a chart that I think will be useful to show in terms of the creation of jobs: In the Bush administration, 1988 to 1992, 2.5 million new jobs in 4 years. In 8 years, the Clinton-Gore administration had an economy that rebounded, and we had 22 million new jobs created in this country. They had their chance. 
   How about the unemployment rate? In 1981-1982, Reagan-Bush averaged 7.1-percent unemployment. Currently, there is 4.1-percent unemployment, the lowest level in 30 years. 
   Home ownership: From 1982 to 1992, home ownership fell in this country. Now it is the highest in history. 
   Welfare rolls increased 22 percent from 1981 to 1992. Now they have decreased by 53 percent. 
   The Dow Jones was 3,300. Now it is over 10,000.

   Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is absolutely correct. We have had the longest economic expansion in American history. That did not happen by accident. Governor Bush says: Well, gosh, that's due to the American people. The American people worked hard in 1981, 1982, 1983, and 1984. The American people had as much ingenuity, as much tenacity to work hard then. But you need public policies in place that help them as well. 
   The public policies that the Clinton-Gore administration and the Democrats in Congress put in place in 1993 said we were going to stop these Federal deficits. We had a new fiscal policy. We turned this country around. 
   The American people understand that when they have hope for the future, they do things that reflect that hope. They buy cars; they buy homes; and they take vacations. They do the things that represent their hope for the future. 
   There was not much hope for a long while because every year the deficit was getting worse and no one wanted to do much about it, but the Clinton-Gore administration came in and said: We have a new plan and it will be a little tough. It was hard to 
   vote for--in fact, so hard that not one member of the majority party voted for it. 
   I see on the floor my friend from Texas, Mr. GRAMM, whom we have quoted many times. He said: If you  pass this plan, this country is going to go into a tailspin. Those are not his exact words, but it is exactly what he meant. 
   Of course, he was wrong. This country passed a new economic plan and gave the American people confidence about the future. Guess what happened. The largest deficits in history turned into the largest surpluses in history. We have had the longest economic expansion on record--welfare rolls are down, home ownership is up, inflation is down. Almost every basic index in this country is better.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois asked a question about job creation. This administration, during these 8 years, has seen 22 million new jobs created in this country. In the 4 years prior under President George Bush, 2.5 million new jobs were created. You will see this is one of the most robust periods of economic expansion in this country's history. Is it an accident? No. This administration had a new economic plan that said let's move away from growing and choking deficits and give the American people some confidence about the future. The result of it was that confidence manifested a growing economy that created new jobs and new opportunities. Every single feature of this economy has become better in the last 8 years, every single one. Unemployment, inflation, welfare, home ownership--in every single instance, things are better in this country. 
   This morning, when I heard the Governor say, ``Well, you have had your chance,'' I would say, yes, this administration had its chance and it inherited a weak and troubled economy and turned it into a strong, vibrant, growing economy, and good for them. 
   It did not happen because they took the easy road. This was not the easy thing to do. In 1993, when they had the vote on the new plan, it passed by only one vote in the House and the Senate. We did not get even one vote on the majority side. We took our licks for voting for it, but history shows that what we created was the strongest economy in this world, and I think Vice President GORE and President Clinton and those who voted for that new plan in this Congress can take some pride in what the result of that plan has been.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments expanding on some I made the other day on the economy and what is happening. The reason I want to do that is there is a lot of discussion these days about what is happening in this country. Some say, well, what has been done in 8 years? 
   That is a legitimate question. There is this old saying that bad news travels halfway around the world before good news gets its shoes on. Let's talk about good news for a moment. Maybe we can get that fully addressed about this economy and what is happening in this country. 
   I want to talk about what has happened in the past 8 years. In 1992, we had a $290 billion Federal deficit that was growing by leaps and bounds. On this chart, these are the red ink numbers from 1985 forward. As you can see, there are massive quantities of deficits year by year. In 1992, it was $290 billion alone. At this point, Congress developed a new economic program. President Clinton proposed to change the direction with a new program, and Congress adopted it by one vote in the House and one vote in the Senate. You can see what has happened to deficits since then. The deficits have been reduced and finally eliminated. We have turned it around and we now have budget surpluses. That is good news. 
   Mr. President, 22 million jobs have been created in the economy that has been growing during the past 8 years. That is an extraordinary number of jobs compared to what had been created in the previous 12 years. 
   This chart reflects what happened to the inflation rate. It has gone down, down, and stayed down, which is wonderful news for our country. We have the lowest poverty rate in two decades. What has happened in recent years? You can see what happened here from 1993 on down. On this chart, the Federal spending related to the gross domestic product is down to the lowest level since 1966--related to the GDP of this country. So we have a lot of good news.

   Mr. DORGAN. The highest levels of spending relative to GDP occurred during the Reagan and Bush administrations. That had a lot to do with the size of the economy. As the economy has grown rather substantially, especially in the recent 8 years, what has happened is that Federal spending as a percentage of GDP actually decreased. 
   I think it is important to talk about what has happened in recent years because people raise the question of the tax burden for middle-income taxpayers. As the chart shows, $39,000 is the average income. Federal income taxes, as a percentage, have actually decreased; the Federal income tax burden has decreased. 
   There are a couple of other things I want to mention about our economy. In the last 8 years, the $290 billion deficit has gone, and now we have the biggest surplus in history. Eight years ago, economic growth averaged 2.8 percent for the previous decade. All of the leading economists in this country at that point said they expected we would have in the entire 1990s anemic, slow economic growth. 
   In fact, they were all wrong. We have had economic growth averaging 3.9 percent annually since 1993. Job growth: 22 million new jobs since January 1993. 
   The unemployment rate from 1981 to 1992 averaged 7.1 percent annually. Now it is at 4.1 percent--the lowest level in 30 years. 
   Home ownership fell from 1981 to 1992, but the growth was the highest in history in the last 9 years. 
   The Dow Jones was 3,300 in 1993, and it is now over 10,000. 
   The point is this: A lot of good things have happened in this country. Some say: Well, it is the rooster taking credit for the Sun coming up. 
   I don't know who is to share the credit here. It seems to me the country was headed in the wrong direction, and then President Clinton came to office and said: Let's change direction and plans. The planning proposed was not  very popular. It passed by only one vote in the House and one vote in the Senate, and it gave the American people confidence that Congress would make some tough decisions. It increased some taxes--not many but some. 
   It cut some spending, and we had a new plan--a new direction. The country moved in the new direction. 
   The American people had confidence that things were going to change. Our economy rests on a mattress of confidence. If people are confident about the future, they do things that manifest that confidence. They buy a house and they buy a car. They do the things that represent their confidence in the future. If they are not confident, they decide not to do those things, and the economy then contracts. 
   The point is that we have an economic plan in this country that has worked very well. The results are self-evident. 
   The question is: What is the plan for the future? 
   That is why we have this Congress. We have debates in Congress about what to do about the future. 
   Some say: Well, we expect 10 years of budget surpluses for the next 10 years. I don't know of a group of economists in this country that has been right for 5 years, let alone 10 years. 
   We would be very wise in this country, in my judgment, to take the conservative course on the question of what we do in fiscal policy. Economists don't know what is going to happen in the next year or in 3, 5, or 10 years from now. 
   We ought to establish as a priority paying down the Federal debt first. If during tough times you run the Federal debt up, it seems to me that during good times you ought to pay down the Federal debt. 
   I inquire whether that is a continuing resolution. If it is, I will suspend.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is interesting to hear the discussion of the process. Apparently there was no conference; there were no conferees. This was a small business authorization bill that was laying dormant, which they used as a large carcass to stuff a whole range of bills in the middle of and throw it then on the floor of the Senate. 
   I am curious; if the Senator from Massachusetts had been accorded the opportunity, as would normally have been the case, of being a conferee and being a part of deliberations, I assume first we would not have most of these provisions in a small business bill, but if we had, for example, would a conferee coming from Massachusetts been concerned about the massive quantity of money that would go to HMOs in response to this balanced budget fix? Would there not have been an aggressive debate saying you cannot do that in the dead of night, take bags of money and give it to HMOs that are not deserving, when, in fact, small hospitals, inner-city hospitals, and others who are desperately in need of these resources do not get it? Would there not have been aggressive debate on that, and probably the disinfectant of sunlight would have given us the opportunity to dump many of these provisions?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada. 
   It is always interesting to me to watch how a legislative session ends. None has ended, in my judgment, with less elegance and grace than this one. It is now 26 days past October 1st. That is the date on which we were to have passed appropriations bills and sent them to the President. 
   On the desk in front of all of us is the Calendar of Business, which says that it is Friday, October 27. The legislative day is September 22. 
   I just want to remind everyone why it says that, what we have on the floor of the Senate, and why some people are chafing about where we find ourselves. 
   What does September 22 mean? That is the day that a motion was filed, a motion to proceed on an energy bill that the leadership never intended to proceed to--a motion to proceed on an energy bill. 
   Since that day, we have never adjourned. We have always recessed. Why? Because that motion was designed to prevent any other activity on the floor of the Senate, to prevent any single Member from offering a motion, for example, or an amendment to deal with a Patients' Bill of Rights. Yes, we have had a vote on that before, but there has been a change in the Senate, as we know, and if we took that vote now, we would win that vote. So how do you prevent that from happening? You prevent anybody from offering an amendment and having a vote--or on the education issues that we have talked about. So that is what is going on here. 
   This Senate has been blocked since September 22, so that the people on the Democratic side of the aisle could not offer an amendment. And we have not even adjourned. We are in the legislative day of September 22. So 26, 27 days now have passed since October 1st, and we find ourselves not having passed the appropriations bills. People stand on the floor with great surprise, wondering, what on Earth is all the fuss here? 
   I cannot understand why things are not working very well, why things are coming apart on us. 
   I will tell you why things are coming apart. Because this Congress didn't get its work done. It was blocking the floor, afraid of amendments, and then we reached the time when appropriations bills were supposed to have been done. They are not done. Then the tax bill is cobbled together and stuck in this vessel called a small business authorization bill. It is cobbled together behind locked doors with no Democratic participation and brought to the floor of the Senate. And people say: Gee, this is reasonable. Why would anyone object to that? 
   Does anybody remember watching the old western movies, the old spaghetti westerns where someone inevitably would ride into a box canyon and then wonder: What on earth has happened to me? I am in a box canyon. I am attacked from every side. 
   What happened is, you rode into a box canyon. That is exactly what this Congress has done. It hasn't done its work. What it has done, it hasn't done well. And now it can't understand for all the world why anyone would object to cobbling together a tax bill on a small business authorization conference and shipping it through here and not receiving objections from us or from the White House. 
   Let's add up the numbers. Together these proposals for tax cuts represent the single priority of this Congress. It is around $1.4 trillion. I may err on either side a bit, but it is somewhere around $1.4 trillion. We have an appetite by those who have no end of desire to cut taxes, most of which will inure to the upper income folks, who say: Our fiscal policy is to move us right back into that same old risk of toppling this economy into the deficit ditch once again. 
   Our first priority ought not be large tax cuts for upper income folks and $1.4 trillion in tax cuts before we even have the surpluses which, incidentally, I don't think we will have for 10 years. We are not going to have 10 years of surplus. That suggests we no longer have a business cycle of contraction and expansion. But the first priority from the majority party is to say: Let's have big tax cuts, and let's put them in law permanently right now. 
   Our priority is to say: That doesn't make any sense. Let's do a couple of things. Let's pay down the Federal debt. If during tough times you run it up--and we did--then during good times, you ought to be able to pay down the Federal debt. 
   There is no money around to pay down the Federal debt when you have the majority party saying they demand $1.4 trillion in tax cuts. 
   Second, it seems to me reasonable that in addition to paying down the Federal debt, you want to make some investments that will bear some rewards for this country in the years ahead: invest in children, education, invest in health care. That is not the priority; we don't want to do that. 
   Third, yes, some tax cuts, but tax cuts that go to working families as well. 
   My friend from Texas a few moments ago said he would be happy to listen to me. I know better than that.

   Mr. DORGAN. I will talk about tax cuts later. The point is, if we are going to have tax cuts, they ought to be targeted to middle-income families. 
   We should not be surprised to find ourselves in this 
   position on October 27, 27 days after we should have completed our work.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes today about the issue of this country's economy. I was reminded the other day, in one of the discussions with respect to the contest for the Presidency this year, that some say: Really, nothing has happened with respect to the last 8 years and this administration. It got me to thinking of where we have been and what we are experiencing in this country today. 
   As I have indicated previously, I believe we are blessed in this country. We have the strongest economy in the world and the longest economic expansion in this country's history. And this is not all accidental. Some say that had nothing to do with Government, it had to do with the American people. The American people were working very hard in the 1950s and the 1980s, and during other periods. However, you also need a set of sensible Government policies that reduce the Federal indebtedness, stimulate investment and do the other things that are necessary to allow this economic engine to run and to work right. So this is not an accident. 
   Let me describe where we are. At the moment, we are 115 months into the longest economic expansion on record. That is something all of us should feel very good about. 
   Let me describe what happened to us back in the 1980s. In the early 1980s especially, we began a significant amount of red ink, deficit after deficit after deficit, and it kept getting worse and worse. 
   As you can see from this chart, the deficits went up to $290 billion in the Federal budget in 1992. Then, in 1993, Congress made some hard decisions. This President, a new President, proposed a controversial new economic plan. Some did not like it. Some still do not like it. It passed the Senate by one vote and passed the House by one vote. This new economic plan provided a different direction. The deficits got smaller and smaller, and then we began to see surpluses, and more surpluses, and more. 
   Is this a turnaround? Yes, I think so. Is it accidental? No. It happened, as you can see indicated on this chart, when a new President proposed a bold economic plan and, by one vote in the House and the Senate, we embraced a new direction and a new approach. You can see by this chart what the result has been. We went from the largest deficits in history to the largest surpluses in this country's history. 
   Jobs created. The Government does not create jobs. But jobs are created in a timeframe in which the Government, with a set of policies, provides for economic opportunity in the expansion of the economy. Under the Reagan administration, in 8 years, 16 million jobs were created; the Bush administration, 4 years, 2.5 million jobs; under this administration, in 8 years, 22 million new jobs. It is a wonderful record, with an economy that is working better than anyone ever could have anticipated. 
   The unemployment rate. This economy is full of good news for our country. You can see what has happened to the unemployment rate, beginning in 1992 and 1993, when this Congress set this country on a different course to an economy of reduced deficits, with more robust growth. Unemployment has gone down, down, way down. That is good economic news for America's families. 
   The inflation rate is down. As we can see, we have had a low inflation rate that has been stable throughout the 1990s. 
   The lowest poverty rate in two decades. You can see from this chart what happened when this economy began to kick into fifth gear and we began to see lower deficits and more economic growth. We saw lower unemployment, and now we see lower poverty rates. 
   Some say: That is just an accident; isn't it? No, it is not just an accident. This Congress, by one vote, embraced a new plan offered by a new President in 1993. It was very controversial, and it worked. The evidence is all around us. 
   We had people on the floor of the Senate who said: Pass this plan, and it will bankrupt our country. Pass this plan, and our country will experience a recession. Pass this plan, and there will be people unemployed in the streets. 
   They were wrong. Where we were headed was a very difficult circumstance for our country: Bigger and bigger deficits; slow, anemic economic growth. We changed the plan. The Clinton-Gore proposal in 1993 was passed by one vote in both the House and the Senate. We changed direction. And we see unemployment down, inflation down, poverty rates down, and more. 
   And now, as a result of economic growth and better opportunity, the federal income tax burden on middle-income taxpayers has decreased, as well 
   as the percent of income paid in Federal income taxes. 
   With respect to the burden of Federal income taxes on middle-income workers, those with average income of $39,000 in 1999, the Federal income tax  burden has actually decreased during this same period. 
   Federal spending as a percentage of the gross domestic product in this country is down. That is not an accident either. That relates how much we spend to what our economy is in terms of its total value of goods and services produced. Federal spending is lower as a percent of GDP. 
   Let's review the U.S. economy, since we passed the bill in 1993, that a new President, a new Vice President proposed that we pass to change direction. We were headed in the wrong direction. We saw deficit after deficit. It was getting larger. 
   Let me show the chart again, because I think it is important --deficit after deficit, getting larger each year. Here is where we were. As you can see, a $290 billion Federal deficit in that 1 year, growing by leaps and bounds. We changed direction. The deficits got smaller and smaller and turned into surpluses. That is not an accident. That is a function of good public policy. 
   In 1992, we had the highest dollar deficit in history. Today, we have the largest dollar surplus in our Federal budget history. Economic growth, 2.8 percent annually in the 12 years before 1993, since 3.9 percent annually; job growth, 1989 to 1992, one of the worst 4-year periods in history, 2.5 million new jobs; in the 8 years since, 22 million new jobs. The unemployment rate average, 7 percent from 1981 to 1992; 4.1 percent in the last 8 years, the lowest in 30 years. Home ownership fell between 1982 and 1992. Now it is the highest in history. Median family income fell from 1988 to 1992. Now it has increased by $5,000 since 1993. Welfare rolls increased 22 percent from 1982 to 1992; decreased by 53 percent between 1993 and 2000. The Dow Jones was at 3,300, and now it is over 10,000. 
   That is the consequence of having an economic plan that works. When people say, well, not much has changed, a lot has changed. In 1992, this country was headed in the wrong direction. Now it is headed in the right direction. In 1992, we had an anemic economy that was producing higher deficits, slower growth, more unemployment. Now we have an economy that is producing budget surpluses, lower unemployment, lower inflation, and the longest economic expansion in this country's history. 
   When I hear discussions on the campaign trail about where we have been and where we are, they need to be rooted in some basis of fact. You would have had to have been on another planet not to understand that the last 8 years have been truly significant. 
   I am not saying that one side or the other should claim credit for everything. I am saying this because I was here and I know it. This country was headed in the wrong direction, with fiscal policies that said you can have a very big tax cut, you can double defense spending, and somehow everything will turn out all right. It didn't. It turned out with huge, growing, abiding deficits every year that sucked the strength out of this country's economy. It meant people didn't have jobs when they wanted jobs. It meant businesses couldn't expand when they wanted to expand. It meant our Federal budget deficit was swollen with red ink. 
   It wasn't working. It was a plan that didn't work. David Stockman told us in his book, shortly after helping concoct the plan in early 1981, that it wouldn't work. It didn't work. It put this country in a deficit ditch, a deep hole. 
   We had a new plan, a different plan. No, it wasn't the same old trickle down where you pour something in at the top and hope everybody down at the bottom gets damp somehow. It was a plan that percolates up, saying that this country's economic engine works best when everybody has a little something to work with, when everyone has confidence in the future. 
   Our economy rests on a mattress of confidence of a sort. If 
   people are confident about the future, they do things that manifest that confidence. They buy a car, a house, do the kinds of things that manifest confidence in the future. If they are not confident in their future, they do exactly the opposite and the economy contracts. 
   No one has ever repealed the business cycle nor will they. We have economic expansions and contractions. But economic expansions occur when people are confident, and they are sustained when people are confident. 
   Right here, in 1993, this new President, President Clinton, and Vice President GORE said: We have a different plan. We are going to change directions. We don't want to be in the same deficit ditch we have been in all these years. It is going to be tough. It is going to be controversial, but we want you to be with us to make these changes. Enough of us were. As I indicated, by one vote in the Senate and one vote in the House, we changed direction. 
   The American people had an assessment that was different than the assessment they had in the past. They became confident that Congress finally was going to do something to tackle these deficits, not just talk about them but tackle them, to get this country's fiscal policy back under some amount of control. 
   People's confidence increased. The result was that our economy began to rebound. It produced more economic growth than anyone thought possible. It produced lower unemployment than virtually anyone thought possible, and we have economic strength and opportunity across the entire country as a result of it. 
   Some areas have been left behind; I understand that. My point is, even as we work on those remaining areas, this country has done very well. It is not an accident. I get a little fatigued hearing people say nothing has happened in the last 8 years. 
   What has happened is this administration, the Clinton-Gore administration, inherited a weak, anemic economy, and we turned it around. Was it easy? No. We paid a price for the votes we cast to do it. It wasn't easy. It wasn't the best political choice. It wasn't the most popular choice. But it was the required choice to say what is happening in this country isn't right and we need to change it. 
   Changing it has meant that virtually everything in this country has improved. Welfare rolls are down, home ownership is up, unemployment down, inflation down. Almost every indices of economic health in this country shows strong, sustained improvement. That is not some historical accident. It is not. It is a function of a Congress, a President, and Vice President teaming up to make tough choices, to say we are moving in the wrong direction and, with as much strength and courage as it takes, we are going to turn that steering wheel and move the country back in the right direction. 
   When people said, we blame you for the votes you cast in 1993, even back then, just after the vote, I said: You can't blame me. I demand that you give me credit for that vote. As unpopular as it might be, it was the right thing for this country to do. I am proud to have participated in it. I feel exactly the same way today. Do not dare to blame me for that vote. I voted to change direction because this country was headed in the wrong direction. 
   This country is now headed in the right direction. We have a lot of challenges ahead of us and a lot to do. One of my great worries is that those people who now say, oh, by the way, we are going to have 10 years of surpluses, don't understand the lessons of history. We don't have 10 years of surpluses. We have economic uncertainty ahead, unless we maintain a fiscal policy that makes sense. A trillion and a half dollars in tax cuts before even the surplus exists will put us right back into the same deficit ditch we had been in for so long back in the 1980s and early 1990s. 
   We dare not squander this opportunity. We need a fiscal policy that makes sense, one on which we can rely, one that says to the American people, our first priority is not to give tax cuts with money we don't have. Our first priority, when we have better economic times and have a budget surplus, is to use part of that surplus to pay down the Federal debt. If during tough times you run up the Federal debt, as we did, during good times you ought to have the common sense to pay down part of that Federal debt, as we should. 
   This is the story. This is where we have been, and this is where we are. I worry very much that the kind of proposals offered by some here and by Governor Bush running for President--about $1.5 trillion in new tax cuts, most of which will go to those who need it least--will put us right back into the same deficit we have been in too long. We have worked too hard to squander our economic strength now.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to comment today on this issue of credibility with respect to the Presidential race in our country. I know there has been a lot of discussion about credibility on one side or another. I wish to talk about the issue of credibility with respect to Social Security. 
   Some while ago, Governor Bush of Texas, who is running for President, suggested we should take about $1 trillion--about one-sixth of the tax moneys that are coming into the Social Security system--and invest it in private individual accounts in the stock market. 
   On May 30th, Senator SCHUMER and I were joined by twenty of our colleagues in sending a letter to Governor Bush asking how that added up and how he would replace the $1 trillion that would be a shortfall in the Social Security trust fund used to pay the Social Security benefits of those who are retired. We have not yet received a reply in the intervening months. And the Presidential debates did nothing to illuminate what might or might not be on the mind of the Governor with respect to that $1 trillion. 
   But this is not a case of double-entry bookkeeping, as understood by politicians, where you can use the same money twice. You cannot use the same money twice. If you take $1 trillion--or one-sixth of the tax money that would go into the Social Security trust fund--and say, we are going to take that money and invest it in private accounts in the stock market, then you have $1 trillion less in the Social Security trust fund with which to pay benefits for those who are retired. The question is, How do you make up that difference? 
   A great many studies have been done on this issue. Let me cite one. Last week, a distinguished group of Social Security experts--one of my favorites, Henry Aaron, at the Brookings Institution, who I think is a remarkable and wonderful economist, Alan Blinder, Alicia Munnell, and Peter Orszag--released an update to their report about what this plan would mean of diverting Social Security trust fund money into private accounts. 
   They point out that it could very well mean less in Social Security benefits for those who have the private accounts later, and that some $1 trillion in the Social Security system, that would be expected to be available, would no longer be available because that $1 trillion was moved. 
   There is an interesting comment from Governor Bush about this proposal. This is not a question of whether he proposes to do this. He says:  
   ..... and one of my promises is going to be Social Security reform. And you bet we need to take a trillion dollars --a trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus.  
   So he says he is going to take $1 trillion out of the Social Security trust fund and use that to establish private accounts for current workers. 
   Now, Allan Sloan had an article in today's Washington Post which I thought was interesting. He said:  
   If you ever wanted living proof of what a fool you would be to entrust your personal financial fate--or the nation's--to the stock market, you sure got it last week. On Wednesday the Dow plummeted more than 400 points before you could finish your first cup of coffee.  
   He said:  
   Sorry to disappoint you, but if you're looking for rationality, don't look at the stock market. At least not on a day-to-day basis. And don't look to the markets to bail out the Social Security ``trust fund'' or to make everyone in the United States rich.  
   He says:  
   If we put a big chunk of the Social Security trust fund into stocks, as many people suggest, the national budget will be hostage to short-term stock movements.  
   Aside from the issue of the credibility of saying to our senior citizens, ``It is going to be in the Social Security trust fund'' and then saying to the younger workers, ``I will take the same $1 trillion and allow you to have private accounts in the stock market with it''--aside from the credibility of having $1 trillion that is missing and no one forcing Governor Bush to answer the questions: What are you going to do with the $1 trillion? What is it going to be? How are you going to fill a hole that exists in Social Security if you take the $1 trillion and allow private accounts to be invested in the stock  market?--aside from that question, which I think is very important, the other point is this: If you look at 20-year periods in this country, there have been 108 20-year periods in which one can calculate a rate of return on a dollar invested in U.S. securities. In six of those periods, the return was less than 2 percent; and in only eight of those periods, the return was 11 percent or more. 
   The point is, instead of having a Social Security plan that provides some security of income when you retire, you might find--with Governor Bush's plan, assuming that the $1 trillion was made up someplace, assuming you did not have a $1 trillion hole, which now exists in the Governor's proposal--you might still find yourself having retired and having private accounts in your name and having much less money than you ever expected or ever would have received under the Social Security system because you don't retire on an average date, you retire on an actual date. You retire on a specific day. Who knows what the stock market is going to be doing in that particular period. It is not the case, as economists have demonstrated, that there will always be good news for everyone with respect to these private accounts. 
   But let me, again, go back to the central question: What about the $1 trillion? If someone in this Chamber said they would like to take $1 trillion out of this trust fund and use it for something else, logically someone would stand on the floor of the Senate and say, but if you are going to take it out of this trust fund and use it for something else, what are you going to do for this trust fund where the money is needed? That is the logical question to ask Governor Bush. And we did. And there has been no answer. Because the $1 trillion will be gone from the trust fund. He knows it. We know it. 
   So if there is a question of credibility on these issues, it seems to me it would be wise to at least question the credibility of someone who wants to take $1 trillion out of the Social Security trust fund and use it for private accounts and then say: Oh, by the way, it all adds up. It does not add up. 
   I went to a high school with only nine seniors in my senior class. We did not necessarily take advanced mathematics, but we took enough math to understand how to add these numbers. We did not discuss ``trillions'' in my school, but we discussed it enough to understand that if you take one-something here and move it over here, it is gone in the first location. 
   Politics, apparently, these days does not require one to reconcile; it does not require one to add and subtract in a traditional way. I think the American people will want to know the consequences of that. You cannot do both. You cannot promise that which you promised to senior citizens for their retirement and then say: By the way, that money is going to be promised to workers for private accounts in the stock market under your name. You cannot promise both. To those who do so, I would say, retake your accounting exam, and remember double-entry bookkeeping does not mean you can use the same money twice. That's a pretty simple lesson, it seems to me, for political dialog in this country. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in 1996, the Congress passed the Telecommunications Act. I was involved in the passage of that act. I served on the Commerce Committee, and we wrote the first rewrite of the telecommunications law in some 60 years. 
   One of the contentious areas in that debate was the ownership limits on television and radio stations. The ownership limits on television and radio stations in this country were established over the years because we wanted to promote localism in radio and television stations, local ownership, local control, so that people living in an area would have some notion that those who were distributing information over their television and radio stations would have some idea of local responsibility. 
   It is interesting what has happened since 1996. When we had that debate in 1996, the Commerce Committee took all the limits off radio stations. You could own as many as you want. They took the limits that existed on television stations and increased it. 
   I authored an amendment on the floor of the Senate to change what happened inside the Commerce Committee. I offered an amendment saying I didn't think that was the right way to go. We didn't need bigger ownership groups owning the radio and television stations. The amendment would have restored the ownership limits on television stations in this country. 
   We had a rollcall vote, and I won with Senator Dole leading the opposition. It was a surprise to everyone, but I won. Then a Senator on the other side asked for permission to change his vote. He changed his vote because he wanted it to be reconsidered at some point. That was at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. And then dinner intervened. About 7 or 8 o'clock that evening, as I recall, they asked for reconsideration of the vote, and four or five Members of the Senate had some sort of epiphany over the dinner hour and discovered their earlier vote was wrong and they really had to change their vote, so I lost. 
   I understand how things work here. I understand what happened over the dinner hour. People didn't have bandages and visibly broken arms, but clearly pressure was applied because over a period of 3 or 4 hours people changed their votes, and I lost. We have no ownership national limits on radio stations, and the ownership limits on television stations have been dramatically relaxed. The number of television stations you could own has increased. 
   Let me show a chart on radio stations. In 1996, we had the top 10 companies in this country owning roughly 400 radio stations. Clear Channel had 57 stations. This total was about 400 radio stations for the top 10 companies. Let me show you what this looks like today on this chart. These are the top 10. Between them, they now own well over 2,000 radio stations. Clear Channel owns over a thousand by itself following its merger with AM/FM. I won't go through the rest of them. You can see what is happening--a massive concentration. They are buying up radio stations all over the country. 
   In 1996, Clear Channel wasn't in North Dakota. Now they own numerous stations in the State. In Minot, ND, a former broadcaster called me and said: Do you know what is happening? They own all the radio stations except the two religious ones. I said: How could that be? 
   It was approved because the Minot service area was considered the same as the service area with Bismarck because their signals overlap. Therefore, it was one market and in a community like Minot, with 40,000 people, one company can essentially own all the radio stations. 
   The question is: What do they do with those? What kind of localism exists when you have a company whose headquarters is 
   somewhere else controlling a thousand radio stations? Does that matter? It sure does to me. It ought to matter to the Senate. How about television stations? 
   On this chart, the yellow bar represents the situation in 1996 when we passed the Telecommunications Act. For example, the number of stations Paxson had was 11, and now Paxson has 60 as the red bar indicates. That doesn't describe, incidentally, the management alliances that existed. It is much more aggressive than this chart indicates. 
   In television and radio stations, we are galloping toward concentrated ownership in a very significant way. I think this Congress ought to ask itself: Is this what we intend? Is this what we want to have happen? Don't we want local ownership in this country with radio and television stations? Do people in our communities not have a voice in what is broadcast on their radio stations? Does their voice have to extend to a city 2,000 miles away where the owner of their radio station resides? 
   I think the Congress ought to have a good discussion about that. Where does  it end? Do we end up with several companies owning almost all the radio stations? In one of our largest cities, two companies will bill over 80 percent of all the billing from radio stations--two companies. Is that competition? I don't think so. 
   I raise the question because I intend to meet with the FCC and send them a letter and meet with others. I don't mean to be pejorative with Clear Channel. I've never met with them, but they are the largest group in radio ownership. They were approved for the merger with AM/FM. They have well over a thousand stations. Where does this end? Is it good for this country to demolish the notion of localism in broadcasting? I don't think so. I don't think it is good for television or radio. These are public airwaves and they attach to it, in my judgment, the responsibility of certain kinds of public good that must be presented by broadcasters when they accept the responsibility of using the airwaves. 
   So I raise that question today, and I intend to visit with the National Association of Broadcasters, and especially with the Federal Communications Commission, to ask them if this is really what was intended, is this what Congress wants, and is it something that we think marches in the right direction? Frankly, I don't think so. I hope we can discuss this as we turn the corner next year and talk about public policy and whether we think concentration of radio and television stations is something that should alarm all of us. I believe it should. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this, I think, is the debate we ought to have in this country on the subject of Social Security. I am pleased to hear the Senator from Idaho describe the plan proposed by Governor Bush and describe the proposal by Vice President GORE on the issue of Social Security. 
   If you read history, you will find there are people for the last nearly 70 years who have predicted that Social Security won't work, will go broke, and won't be there when they retire. Decade after decade, people predicted that in every community around this country, especially the small towns of North Dakota. 
   There are people living better lives because the Social Security Program provided them something called ``security.'' Does it provide for all their needs? No. But it is a bedrock security for their retirement years. They invested in it when they were working and now they have Social Security in their retirement years. The word ``security'' in Social Security is not some accident. People understood that the purpose of Social security is just that--security. It is the economic baseline of retirement, the one means of financial support that Americans can count on. 
   As I indicated, there are people who, every decade, have said the sky is falling with respect to this program. There are some who never supported this program in the first place. They wouldn't have supported Social Security because philosophically they didn't believe Government ought to do anything, and they didn't support Medicare because philosophically they thought the Government shouldn't do anything. 
   What would America be like today if we had an aging population without Medicare or Social Security? This country would not be as good a country as it is without those two important programs. 
   People are living longer and better lives. That has placed some stress on both Social Security and Medicare, but do not let anybody tell anybody else that the problem is that these programs do not work. These programs work and work well. People are growing older and living better lives in this country. This is a problem born of success.

   Mr. DORGAN. I reclaim my time. Mr. President, $40 trillion --I do not know how big the school of the Senator from Idaho was. I assume he did not study a trillion, nor did I. There ought to be rules when one starts talking about trillions of dollars. If you extend it for two centuries, you can probably come up with hundreds and hundreds of trillions of dollars, but it is largely irrelevant. 
   The issue is this: We have a Social Security program and a Medicare program. Both of them have some funding challenges in the outyears--not next year, not in the next 10 years. For Social Security, it is well beyond the next three decades, but there are challenges. 
   Why do we have these challenges? This is good news. Let's not grit our teeth and wring our hands and wipe our brow over good news. People are living longer and better lives. Good for them and good for us. This is good news. This is born of success. 
   If you want to solve the Social Security problem and Medicare problem, go back to the old mortality rates. At the turn of the last century in 1900, if you lived in this country, you were expected to live on average to age 48. Now people are going to live 30 years longer on average. That is good news. Good for us. That causes some difficulties in Social Security and Medicare. This is not a big problem. We can solve this problem. 
   Let me describe something the Senator from Idaho needs to know. The Senator from Idaho never did address the question of the $1 trillion hole. He sort of went over it like: ``Well, people say 
   a trillion dollars but'' and then went on. 
   If you are going to take money out of the current revenue base for Social Security and say to young people who are now working--you can use it for private accounts, then what happens to the estimated $1 trillion over 10 years you took from over here which was to be used to pay benefits for current beneficiaries of Social Security? 
   I have served in this Congress with my colleague from Idaho and others. Over the years, we have put in place $100 billion a year in incentives for private savings and private investments. We have SEPs. We have traditional and Roth IRAs and 401(k)s. We have them all, and more. We say to people: If you put some money away in savings under certain conditions, you will have a tax benefit, a tax credit, a tax deduction. We spend $100 billion a year in reduced taxes by providing incentives for people to create and open private accounts, to invest in the stock market, and to invest in other things. We do that. I support it. I think it makes good sense for this country. But that is not the same as Social Security. 
   The word ``security'' ought to mean something. That is the bedrock, the foundation of retirement funds that we do as a country. The Senator from Idaho asks the question--I want to answer it--he asks the question about the issues that the Vice President has raised on the widow's benefit to surviving spouses and also of the issue of the motherhood penalty. 
   The Vice President proposes to solve those, which I think makes some sense. I assume the Senator from Idaho will agree that the issue of the widow's benefit, to increase the widow's benefit to 75 percent of the couple's previously combined Social Security benefit, makes sense. He knows and I know all kinds of retired women around this country living by themselves who are struggling mightily to make ends meet with a pittance in their assistance check, and we need to do better than that. The Vice President proposes we do better than that. 
   The Senator from Idaho asks: Where does he get the money? I will tell him where he gets the money. Then I will ask where does George Bush get the $1 trillion because I would like to hear an answer to that. 
   Where does Vice President GORE get the money? He does not propose a massive $1.5 trillion in tax breaks, most of which goes to upper income folks. He  proposes a smaller tax cut to working families and uses the difference to reduce the Federal debt. When we reduce the Federal debt every year, we have a surplus and will get to the point when we wipe out the indebtedness. When we wipe out the Federal debt, the third largest expenditure in the Federal budget, which is interest on the debt, will no longer exist. And that money which we now pay for interest on the Federal debt, the Vice President proposes be put into the Social Security system to help pay for the two issues the Senator from Idaho just described and provide increased solvency for the Social Security system. The answer is very simple. The Senator asks where does the money come from? It comes from reducing the Federal debt, eliminating interest on the debt as cost to the Federal budget, plowing that back into the Social Security system to help mothers, widows, and to increase and promote solvency in the system. That is the answer. It is a very simple answer.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of the Senator from Iowa. I will try to finish before 5 minutes. I want to finish this point. The Senator from Iowa is on the floor and I know wants to speak. Let me finish this point because I think it is so important. 
   The difference in priorities here is a priority. I am not saying one candidate is a bad person and the other candidate is a good person. Those who aspire to be President of this country have different priorities. Governor Bush says he supports a very large tax cut right up front even before we have the surpluses. We have all these economists telling us we are going to have 10 years of surpluses. Most cannot remember their telephone numbers, and they are telling us what is going to happen in this country 8 years down the road. Nonsense. 
   We would be very smart to be more conservative than that. What we ought to do, as Vice President Gore suggests, is use a substantial portion of that estimated surplus to pay down indebtedness. If during tough times you run up the Federal debt, during good times you ought to pay it down. One of the advantages of doing that is you reduce the third largest item in the Federal budget--that is interest on the debt--and use that for another purpose. That is exactly the answer to the question the Senator raises.

   Mr. DORGAN. I want to make one additional point. What brought me to the floor today was this discussion of $1 trillion that is proposed to be taken from the trust funds of Social Security that is now used to pay benefits to those who are now retired and to be used instead for private accounts for working men and women. My point is this: We already spend $100 billion a year to incentivize private investment accounts. I am all for that. 
   In fact, as far as I am concerned, we can increase that and probably will. Vice President Gore suggests Social Security-plus to keep Social Security, do not threaten the base of Social Security at all, do not take money and divert it, but then on top of Social Security say we are going to provide even more incentives for those who want to invest in private savings accounts. 
   My point is this, very simple: When the issue of credibility is raised about all of these claims and counterclaims, there is a serious credibility issue of taking $1 trillion out of the current trust fund over the next 10 years, $1 trillion that would otherwise go into the trust funds to pay current benefits to those who are retired, and saying at the same time: It is available for private accounts for other people. As I said before, when you take bookkeeping in high school or college, they do not teach you ``double entry'' means you can use the same money twice. 
   Yet that is exactly what has happened with this proposal.

   Mr. DORGAN. Let me reclaim my time. I am generous to yield and always yield when asked to yield. But this notion of a Ponzi scheme--the definition of ``Ponzi,'' it seems to me, is a description that says: The surplus that is going to go into the Social Security system each year, for a while, is somehow available for some other purpose. 
   We have a deliberate surplus going into Social Security. Why? Because it is needed, as the Senator from Idaho knows, to meet the day when baby boomers retire. We are going to need that money. 
   What is going to happen is, if you follow his proposal, or the Governor's proposal, and you take that money out, when you need it later, it is not going to be there. 
   So I do not want anybody to stand up on the floor and say: Oh, yes, there is a surplus right now. By the way, that is unobligated. Somebody can come and grab that, and it will not matter. That surplus is delivered. 
   I happened to be on the Ways and Means Committee in the House when we passed the Social Security reform plan. We did it to deliberately create a surplus to meet the needs when the baby boomers retire. 
   When the Second World War ended, the folks came back from fighting for this country's liberty and freedom, and they created the largest baby crop in the history of our country. They are called ``war babies.'' There was this outpouring of love and affection, I guess, and we had the largest baby crop in American history. 
   When that largest baby crop in American history retires, we are going to have a substantial need for all of the surplus we have designed to put into that trust fund now. 
   My point is, if you take that out now, by saying it is not obligated, that we do not need it, I just say you are wrong. You can stand up and holler ``Ponzi'' all you want.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from Iowa, Mr. HARKIN, a few moments ago, as he spoke about the unfinished agenda. I suppose every Congress finishes with a speech by 1 or 2 or 10 or 20 Members of Congress talking about the unfinished agenda. But that unfinished agenda in this Congress is mighty long and also mighty important. 
   The Senator from Iowa talks about the Patients' Bill of Rights, education issues such as the crumbling schools, smaller class sizes--a whole series of initiatives that we really should get to. The Senator just asked unanimous consent--I guess it was a nomination he was attempting to get to the floor of the Senate. 
   I made this point last week to the consternation of a couple of my friends here in the Senate, but I think it is important to make it again. On September 22, a motion was brought to the floor of the Senate, a motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 2557. That is an energy bill. That motion to proceed has now been pending here in the Senate for a month and a day. On September 22 it was put on the floor, and it has been here for 1 month and 1 day. My feeling is that the motion to proceed is here--and we are not voting on it and we are not proceeding--it is here because it is a motion to block any other effort to bring up any other issues. We have a wide range of issues; I suppose some of them are being negotiated these days, but most of them will remain unfinished at the end of this session. 
   The Senator from Iowa, who has a real passion to want to get certain things done, is unable on a Monday or Tuesday to come to the floor to say I want to offer a motion to proceed on his issue. Let's assume it is the minimum wage. He wants to test whether time has changed some minds on the minimum wage. He is unable to offer that. The Patients' Bill of Rights? He has been unable to offer that. Campaign finance reform? Unable to offer that. Why? Because there is a motion pending, and the motion pending is the motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 2557, a bill that I do not believe was ever intended to come to the floor. But the motion pending is a motion to block the efforts of others who might want to offer a motion here on the floor of the Senate. That is what I think is thwarting the interests of the Senator from Iowa. 
   When he described the unfinished business, one might say: If it is unfinished, why don't you come down here and make a motion? The Senator cannot make a motion because that particular motion to proceed has been blocking anyone else from offering anything for a month and a day. 
   The Senator did ask unanimous consent. Of course, unanimous consent never clears here. There is always an objection to unanimous consent to move to something. Then the question would be, Why couldn't he just make a motion? The answer is: You can not move to it because we have a blocking motion that has been here for a month and a day.

   Mr. DORGAN. I would say after a month now it is quite clear this motion to proceed is simply an effort to block the opportunity of others to offer amendments. People have a right to do  that in the Senate. But they should understand, as I said last week to some colleagues who were on the floor, one can chaff quite a bit at that kind of treatment because it means the passions that brought a number of them to the Senate to do certain things, come here and use all the energy you have to advance good public policy--those passions cannot exist in a circumstance where you are not able to offer motions even to pursue the kinds of things you think this country needs to be doing. 
   We just saw the chart of the Senator. Some of them said we should probably increase the minimum wage a bit at the bottom. We have 3 million workers working a full 40-hour week trying to raise the family on the minimum wage. They are at the bottom of the economic ladder. This Congress was real quick to say the folks at the top of the ladder, we need to give them a huge tax cut but not quite so quick to say let's help those at the bottom of the ladder. 
   Some might say we had a vote on that. Yes, we had a vote on that a long time ago. Maybe we ought to have another vote and see whether there is now the will to proceed for some modest increase in the minimum wage. Can we have that vote? No, you cannot offer that nor can I. I offer that as an example.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will make one additional comment. A Patients' Bill of Rights is an awfully good example of where we are at the moment. A bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights passed the House of Representatives which does what ought to be done: It gives patients protections against some of the practices of HMOs that allow accountants to practice medicine rather than have the doctor and patient decide what is best. The fact is, there has been a change in the Senate. The House passed a bipartisan bill, a good bill, and the Senate passed a watered down bill. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.

   Mr. DORGAN. A bipartisan bill passed the House. The Senate did not pass a bipartisan bill. It was a shell of a bill. Things have changed in the Senate, so if we had another vote on it, we would prevail. One Senator is gone; a new one is here. We would have a 50-50 tie. The Vice President would break the tie, and the Senate would pass the Patients' Bill of Rights. We are unable to get to the vote despite the fact, in my judgment, a majority of the Senate would now support a real Patients' Bill of Rights. We would then be in conference with the House having passed one. We would pass one, and the American people would have a real Patients' Bill of Rights.

   Mr. DORGAN. One other issue. I asked the majority leader a question about how the tax issues will come to the floor. It looks to me as if a menu of tax issues will come to this floor in the last hours put in a small business authorization bill. I believe the House has actually added other conferees to that conference who are not part of the Small Business Committee. 
   A small business authorization bill will now be the carrier for all kinds of tax provisions in a conference report, and no Member of the Senate who cares about taxes and wants to have a role in that, perhaps offer an amendment, or have some discussion about what ought to be in or out, no Member of the Senate is going to have that opportunity. It is done in a conference by a few people in a bill that is totally unrelated. 
   It will come in a conference report, and the result is none of us will have the opportunity to do much about it. The majority leader is a friend. I talked with him one day and said running this place is similar to that commercial on television where those leather-faced cowboys wearing chaps and buckskin vests, riding those big old horses, are herding cats, trying to run cats through the sagebrush, talking about what a tough job that is. I understand that. Running the House and the Senate probably is not much different. 
   I do believe at some point we have to be in a situation in the Senate where we use the rules to allow everyone to have their day and everyone to have their say, and at the end of the day we vote. If you lose, you lose, but you need the opportunity to have the votes so the Senate can express its will on a series of important issues. 
   Frankly, this blocking motion that has existed now for a month and a day that prevents the Senator from Iowa, me, or anyone else from offering, for example, the Patients' Bill of Rights on which we would now prevail, is what stands between the American people and a good Patients' Bill of Rights. The result is that men, women, and children will discover when they go to a doctor's office they will be told: Yes, you now have to fight your cancer, but you also have to fight your HMO to get payment for the treatment that you need from your oncologist. 
   That is happening all too often. The legislation we aspire to pass evens up the score a bit. It says patients have rights and those rights cannot be abridged or abused. We can pass that in the Senate if someone will take that blocking motion off, and we will get one more vote on a Patients' Bill of Rights. This vote will be 51 for, with the Vice President voting for, and 50 against. 
   I say to those who have this blocking motion, give us the opportunity this afternoon or tomorrow or Wednesday, and we will pass it and go to conference. It will take an hour in conference to resolve the House and Senate bills, and the American people will have a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I pay tribute today to a North Dakota family whose heritage not only spans the history of our state--and then some--but which also exemplifies the spirit of rural life and all that it contributes to our Nation. 
   Nils and Inger Midgarden started their family as homesteaders in North Dakota in 1874. That was 15 years before North Dakota become a state. They raised seven children, built a successful family farm, and just like thousands of other North Dakotans at that time, did the hard work that carved hardy communities and, eventually, a state from the prairie. 
   I have a letter I would like to share with my colleagues, written by one of Nils and Inger's great-grandchildren. It tells us a great deal about the founders of this family. It says:  
   Nils was a successful farmer and his sons greatly expanded the farming operation. When his children married, they built farms within sight of the homestead. Each one of those farms are today owned and occupied by the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of Nils and Inger Midgarden.  
   Let me tell you, that's quite an accomplishment. As anyone who knows much about it will tell you, farming is hard work. When you consider that this family managed to survive everything from the Great Depression to droughts, floods and grasshoppers over the span of more than a hundred years--while raising a family that has remained across the generations a close knit one--you understand why their's is such a remarkable accomplishment. 
   The letter goes on:  
   The farm, while a potent symbol of the pioneer spirit my great-grandparents embodied, is not the greatest legacy they left behind, ``Nils' and Inger's great grandchild writes. ``Nearly everyone who know me and my family remarks on our closeness and old-fashioned values, characteristics fewer and fewer families seem to share these days. What Nils and Inger gave to their children--to us--was the gift of family. Through bountiful harvests and times of drought, through births, deaths, and marriages, joy and sorrow, the Midgardens have always stood together. Older cousins taught younger ones to swim, uncles pulled wayward nieces and nephews out of snowy ditches, and Sundays brought the family together in worship, meal, and play. Once during a tornado sighting, all the Midgardens in Walsh County drove out to the homestead to stand on the road, as if sheer will power and their bodies alone would protect the place Nils and Inger made home.  
   Today, Midgardens still live on those family farms, and while not all family members remain on the farm, those who moved away to pursue other livelihoods continue to draw on the basic strength that came from the farm: they remain a close knit family, wherever they are, wherever they go. 
   Those who moved away contribute to our state, regional and national life in a variety of ways. They became veterinarians, lawyers, advertising executives, architects, doctors, teachers, nurses, and even congressional staffers. 
   Families like the Midgardens demonstrate the importance of preserving family farmers and the rural communities they make strong. through the generations, the Midgarden family makes clear what those of us who grew up and live in rural areas know so well: family farms produce much more than the food that feeds this nation and much of the world. They also produce strong, solid families.

This is one more in a series of continuing resolutions required by this Congress because we do not have the appropriations bills completed and sent to the President to be signed into law. 
   Now we have to do this. I understand that. We have to pass a continuing resolution. But this is not the way for the Senate to do its business. I came from a meeting we had with the President. The President indicated this is the last continuing resolution of this sort that he will sign. He indicated the next continuing resolution will be for 24 hours, no more than 24 hours. That is what he told a large group of people a bit ago. This continuing resolution takes us until next Wednesday, after which, apparently, continuing resolutions will be for no more than----

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let the record show there is a search for scope around here. 
   The President's number is 456-1414. Certainly, the Senator can consult with the President on that issue. 
   It is now October 19. We are keeping the Senate in session and preventing the Senate from doing business in many ways. We have something pending. As soon as we finish these votes,  do you know what is pending on the floor of the Senate? The motion to proceed to S. 2557. Do you know when the motion to proceed was filed in the Senate? A month ago; a motion to proceed to an energy bill. Does anybody think there was ever an intent to proceed to a bill? No. 
   Why is this motion to proceed pending? To block every other amendment that would be offered by anybody else in the Senate. So the purpose is, keep us here for the desires of those who need to do the appropriations bills but don't let anybody do anything else with respect to other issues. 
   That is the purpose of this block motion. It has been in place a month. Some of us chafe a little by being told, you stay in session for our purposes; that is, the purposes of those who control the agenda. But in terms of what you are here for, in terms of your desires and your passions on a range of issues, forget it because we will block it with this motion to proceed. 
   Now, this continuing resolution takes us until next Wednesday. We apparently will have at least two votes stacked, two sequential votes, following this discussion. Then I guess the question is--this is Thursday--what happens tomorrow, on Friday or Saturday or Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday? Who is doing what? When are we going to get these issues resolved? 
   I think the import of the question from my colleague was that this is somebody else's fault. Maybe so. Maybe someone hasn't provided a list of scope here or there. All I can say is it is now October 19. This is, I think, the third CR, perhaps the fourth, and more will be required, I suspect. But if we are going to be in session, if we are going to be in session for some while, some days, then I ask the question, why aren't we working on other issues? Why should we be prevented--those on this side of the aisle--from offering amendments on a range of issues? 
   I think it is not the way to run this Senate, to put up a blocking motion. I believe it was put up September 22. It is now October 19. The import of that blocking motion to proceed was to say we are only going to allow the Senate to work on the following issues, and we will do it by blocking all other amendments to be offered. 
   I don't know what next week will bring. I will say the President indicated he is not going to sign long-term continuing resolutions. I don't know how you could. A week from now, next Wednesday, is October 25. I don't know how much further you can take this session of Congress. 
   At some point we have to do the appropriations bills and resolve the funding issues. I don't think anybody has had an easy job doing this. The difficulty of this job started with the passage of the budget. That budget never added up. It was not realistic. We all knew we would have to spend more money than called for in the budgets on discretionary spending.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me reclaim my time. If the Senator from Alaska heard anything that represented ``abuse,'' that was not my intent. If there were discussions yesterday about lifting the cap, yesterday was October 18, 18 days past the October 1st deadline. 
   I happen to think the chairman of the Appropriations Committee is someone for whom I have had great respect. I don't think he has caused these problems. But I do think if you go back to the spring of this year with respect to the budget that was passed, there was not enough money in it, and we knew it then. There wasn't enough money in it for domestic discretionary programs, and we knew we would come to the end of the process with gridlock. Now we have this gridlock, and then we have these CRs that say: By the way, we will keep you in session until Wednesday but only on our issue. If you have issues--prescription drugs, minimum wage, the Patients' Bill of Rights--you ought not offer them, and we will block you. So they block it for a month. 
   I say to my colleagues, if you were in this circumstance, I don't think you would be as quiet as we have been. The fact is, we have been blocked for a month from offering amendments dealing with the central issues that we came to Congress to deal with and resolve and deal with. People talk about not leaving people behind. There are a whole lot of folks left behind with the agenda this Congress hasn't dealt with. 
   I am going to relinquish the floor, and we will vote on a CR. I assume this is not the last CR. I assume we will have more. I don't think any of us ought to be white eyed with surprise when we find ourselves in October trying to get out of a budget that was passed this spring. Incidentally, that is a budget I did not vote for because, in my judgment, it did not add up in the first place. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last evening I watched the Presidential debate, as I am sure many other Americans did as well. I was thinking, after the debate, that those who claim there is not a difference between these candidates, and not a choice in this election, just have not been listening. There is clearly a choice and a difference between the two Presidential candidates. 
   I happen to believe both are pretty good people. You don't get to the point where you achieve the nomination from your party for the Presidency of the United States without having some significant experience and talent. But there are vast differences in public policy. I want to talk just a little about this, and especially about one of the significant issues in this campaign: the proposals for tax cuts. 
   Governor Bush has proposed tax cuts that are somewhere in the vicinity of $1.5 trillion over the coming 10 years. 
   We have had a wonderful economy in recent years. This country has been blessed with economic opportunity and growth that is unprecedented. We have the strongest economy in the world. Virtually everything in our economy has been headed in the right direction. Unemployment has been down; inflation has been down; home ownership up. Virtually all of the indicators of economic health have been good. This economy has been heading in the right direction. 
   One factor in that health is that Congress made some choices early on; difficult choices, to be sure, but ones that helped put this economy back on track. I worry very much that, as some economists tell us there will be surpluses for the next 10 years, this rush to enact $1.5 trillion in tax cuts even before the surpluses exist could lead us to a much different economic place. If we take that path, and if we don't get the surpluses we expect, then we will begin to experience, once again, Federal budget deficits. We will be right back in the same dark hole of budget deficits and lower economic growth and more economic trouble. 
   I will read a couple of quotes.  
   There is no cause for worry. The high tide of prosperity is going to continue.  
   September 1928, by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon.  
   No Congress of the United States ever assembled on surveying the state of the Union has met a more pleasing prospect than that which appears at the present time.  
   December 4, 1928, President Calvin Coolidge. 
   Economic forecasting is a tricky business under the very best of circumstances. But it is particularly suspect in the political arena, when partisan agendas are at stake and when the forecasts purport to show whether someone's agenda can work or not work. We have two classes of forecasters, according to one economist: those who don't know, and those who don't know they don't know. We might want to add a third class of economist: those who don't know but don't care because they have an agenda to justify in the political arena with their forecasts. 
   The problem with economic forecasting is not just uncertainty around the edges. The problem goes to the very core of the endeavor. Most forecasting is simply linear; that is, it assumes that tomorrow will be pretty much like yesterday with just a little something added on. Of course, life is not linear. There are sudden lurches and jolts which none of us can anticipate. Yet forecasters always have a model they use that anticipates tomorrow will reflect the experience of yesterday. 
   If we start writing tax refund checks with money we don't yet have and return to the staggering deficits of recent times--a $290 billion deficit the year this administration took office 8 years ago--we will have a much less certain economic future. All of us should understand that. 
   The reason I want to talk about this is that it is at the core of the debate in the Presidential contest. The question for me is, Are we going to move forward and build on our economic success, or are we going to risk slipping back into big deficits? 
   How much budget surplus is there? We hear candidates talk about trillions, $3 trillion, $4 trillion, $4.5 trillion. I went to a high school with 40 kids in all four grades. My class was ninth. We didn't have a lot of advanced math. We never studied trillions, I confess. I am not sure I understand what a trillion is. I know how many zeros exist in a trillion, but I am not sure I, nor anyone else in this Chamber, knows exactly what a trillion is. 
   So we hear the Congressional Budget Office say, you have an estimated $4.6 trillion surplus in the coming 10 years. Then we hear candidates say, if we have all this surplus, let's propose a $1.5 trillion tax cut, most of which will go to the upper income folks, which I will talk about in a moment. The problem here is 
   this: We may never have this surplus. 
   First of all, $2.4 trillion belongs to the Social Security trust fund. It has to go there and should not be touched by anyone for any other purpose. Another $360 billion goes to the Medicare trust fund. It ought to be put away and not touched for any other purpose. Realistic spending adjustments will be about $600 billion; we are making these right now to exceed the budget caps because the budget that was passed earlier this year was wildly unrealistic in terms of what is needed for education and health care and a range of other issues, just to keep pace with increased population needs. These figures, incidentally, are from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. This organization says that, if you also include amounts necessary for Social Security  and Medicare solvency, which you are going to have to do, you have probably a $700 billion estimated surplus. That is if everything goes right--$700 billion, not $4.6 trillion. 
   Now, with this prospect, if you add a $1.5 trillion tax cut, what do you have left? Almost a $1 trillion deficit. 
   Should we be a bit cautious? Should we be concerned about talk of giving back taxes on a permanent basis based on surpluses that don't yet exist? The answer is yes. We would be, in my judgment, far better off if we decided to establish some basic principles for the use of any estimated surplus. 
   The priorities I think are these: First, we ought to pay down the Federal debt. Second, we ought to ensure the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare. Then we ought to address the urgent needs of this Nation, such as repairing our schools and making sure our kids are walking through classroom doors in the best schools in the world; and dealing with the prescription drug prices that are too high for many of our senior citizens to afford. Then we should provide targeted tax relief for working families. 
   There is a very big difference in the agenda of the candidates for President. Governor Bush says his priority is to provide a very large tax cut. The risk is that we won't have the money for a $1.5 trillion tax cut. The risk is that we may well go into a $1 trillion deficit because of that proposed tax cut. I hope that will not be the case, but it is certainly possible. 
   The problem with the tax cut itself is, even if you decided we should cut some taxes, the question is for whom and which taxes. Here is the proposed tax cut by Governor Bush. You can see the lowest 20 percent get $42 apiece a year, and the top 1 percent get $46,000 each. 
   In the debate last night, Governor Bush said: Well, of course, the wealthy, the upper income people get most of the tax cuts; they pay most of the taxes. 
   You can say that only if you are using a magnifying glass to suggest that the only taxes people pay are income taxes. I have a chart that shows something interesting. People pay $612 billion in payroll taxes in this country. Go to a convenience store somewhere. Maybe you will run into a person working in that convenience store for the minimum wage, working 40 hours a week, trying to raise two or three kids. They pay more in payroll taxes than they pay in income taxes. Yet that doesn't count, according to Governor Bush. All that counts is this: Let's give money back based on income taxes. 
   How about proposing a tax cut to the American people based on their real tax burden? Let me show you that burden. The fact is, 99 percent of the people in the bottom fifth income bracket in this country pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes. As to the second fifth, 92 percent pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes. Those folks work hard every day. They get a check that is less than their salary because money is taken out. Why is money taken out? For taxes. Which taxes? Payroll taxes as well as income taxes. Then they are told that when it comes to tax cuts, they don't count because we are going to give tax cuts based solely on who pays 
   income taxes. 
   So the wealthiest get the biggest tax cuts. Is that fair to the people at the bottom of the economic ladder who work hard every day and who pay heavier payroll taxes than they do income taxes? The answer is absolutely not. That is another difference in philosophy. 
   There are people in this Chamber and people who are advisers to Governor Bush and others who believe that the proper approach to taxation is to tax work and exempt investment. That is their philosophy. Why? It is a typical political debate that has gone on for decades. Do you believe this economy works best by pouring something in at the top--that is called trickle down--or by nurturing something at the bottom, called percolate up? Do you believe America's economic engine works best if you just get some cans and pour it in the top? Or do you believe that if you give everybody at the bottom a little something to work with, that this economic engine works because things percolate up? It is a difference in philosophy. 
   Governor Bush believes, as do those who control the Congress, in the trickle-down approach. 
   I received a note from a North Dakotan one day, a farmer. He said: I have been living under this trickle-down stuff for 15 years, and I ain't even got damp yet. 
   Of course, Hubert Humphrey used to describe the trickle-down approach in his famous quote: That is where you give the horse some hay to eat, hoping that later the birds will have something to nibble on. 
   So we have this debate in the country. Who is right? It seems to me that if we are going to do this in a conservative, thoughtful way, we ought to decide the following: We don't know what the future holds. Let us hope the future is as wonderful as the last 6 or 8 years have been in terms of economic performance. Things are better in the country; everyone understands things are better. 
   You can stand on this floor and say, like the rooster taking credit for the sunup, that this person or that person should get the credit for the success of the economy. The fact is, we were headed in the wrong direction. This economy was in deep trouble. We had run up a $5.7 trillion in debt, and we had a $290 billion annual deficit in 1992. We were moving in the wrong direction very rapidly. 
   We in this Chamber, and over in the House--by one vote in each Chamber--passed a new economic plan. It was controversial as the dickens. It was not easy to vote for. In fact, let me read a couple of statements that were made at the time on the floor of the Senate. I will not read the authors, but we had people stand up on the floor of the Senate, and they had their own predictions regarding what this economic plan would be for our country. 
   On August 6, 1993, one of my colleagues stood up and said:  
   So we are still going to pile up some more debt, but most of all, we are going to cost jobs in this country [with this plan].  
   Another Senator, another colleague, said:  
   Make no mistake, these higher rates will cost jobs [in this plan of yours].  
   Another one said:  
   When all is said and done, people will pay more taxes, the economy will create fewer jobs, government will spend more money, and the American people will be worse off.  
   Another said:  
   It will flatten the economy.  
   That was at a time when we had an anemic economy, with slow growth, huge deficits, and moving in the wrong direction. And where are we in the year 1999 and the year 2000, after 8 years of that experience? We have an economy that is the envy of the world, growing faster than any other industrial economy in the world. Unemployment is down. More people are working. Welfare rolls are down. Inflation is down. Home ownership is up. Almost every indicator of economic health describes a country that is doing better. 
   What should we do at this point? Some say give huge tax cuts, right now. Let's put them in law right now, lock them down. 
   If during good economic times you don't use the opportunity to pay down the Federal debt, you are never going to be able to pay down the debt. When you run up debt during tougher times, you ought to pay it down during better times. That is as conservative an ethic as you can have, it seems to me. 
   Why this Congress would not embrace that is beyond me. Why we would not agree together that it is our responsibility to pay down the debt during better times--what greater gift could there be to America's children than to unsaddle them from the debt, the $4.7 trillion that was added between 1980 and the late 1990s? What better gift could we give to them than to say our first job is to pay down this Federal debt? But, no, there is some political attractiveness, I guess, to say we want to give tax cuts. Gee, that is an easy thing to say, but it is not at this point a very responsible fiscal policy--especially when the largest portion of those cuts would go to the wealthiest Americans who have done the best in this economy. 
   It seems to me that tax cuts ought to come after the paydown of the debt and a number of other obligations. But second, when we do them--and we should if we have surpluses--we ought to do them based upon the burden the American families have in the workplace,  which includes not just the income tax but also the payroll tax. Those are the things I think we ought to consider. 
   Now, the other issue in the debate last night was, whose side are you on? I know there is a difference between the two candidates. Let me say I am not here to say one candidate is bad and the other is good. That is not my role. My role is to say there is a very significant difference in what they believe and how they approach public policy. I think on the key issues the American people ought to evaluate these matters that were before this Congress.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as we near the end of this Congress, one of the profound disappointments for me and for a number of others serving in the Senate is the inattention paid to the issue of arms control, especially the issue of nuclear arms reduction. 
   As we debate a range of public policy issues in this country during the campaigns for the House and the Senate and the Presidency, we will hear a lot about health care, education, taxes, and economic growth, but we hear almost nothing about the issue of nuclear arms reduction. 
   It is important to understand what kind of nuclear weapons exist in our world and why nuclear arms reductions are important for us, our children, and our future. 
   The nuclear arsenal in this world totals about 32,000 nuclear weapons--32,000 nuclear weapons. The Russians have about 20,000 of them, many of them tactical nuclear weapons, some strategic. The United States has about 10,500 nuclear weapons. France, China, Israel, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan also have nuclear weapons. We know India and Pakistan have a few nuclear weapons because they have exploded those nuclear weapons right under each other's chin by their borders. These are countries that do not like each other, and they have tested nuclear weapons recently, much to the consternation of the rest of the world. 
   We have a nuclear arsenal in this world that is frightening. What does this mean, 32,000 nuclear weapons? Let me put it in some perspective. The bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima killed 100,000 people. The bomb was named ``Little Boy.'' It was 15 kilotons. It was 6,500 times more effective and more efficient, as they say--only people who are involved in this could use that word, I suppose--than ordinary high-explosive bombs. 
   The amount of nuclear weapons that exist today in this world is equivalent to 1 million Hiroshima bombs. Think of that. The bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima killed 100,000 people. We have the equivalent of 1 million of those bombs among the countries that possess nuclear weapons. 
   It is hard for anyone to understand fully what this means. The world's nuclear arsenal today has a total yield of about 15 billion tons of TNT. That is equivalent to the power of 1 million Hiroshima-type bombs. 
   This Congress has done very little on the issue of arms control and arms reduction. It took a giant step backward, in my judgment, in the debate over the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. A little over one year ago, on October 13, 1999, this Senate rejected ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. The Senate did not hold hearings for 2 years on that issue. Then there were 2 days of hearings cobbled together quickly, and then the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty was brought before the Senate. There were 2 1/2 days of floor debate, and then it was defeated. 
   I guess it was defeated by those who say they do not want us involved in the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. However, 160 other countries have already signed the treaty. It was interesting. Just before the vote a year ago, Mr. Blair, Mr. Chirac, and Mr. Schroeder from England, France, and Germany, wrote the following in an op-ed piece that was rather unprecedented, published in the Washington Post:  
   Failure to ratify the CTBT will be a failure in our struggle against proliferation. The stabilizing effect of the Non-Proliferation Treaty ..... would be undermined. Disarmament negotiations would suffer.  
   This is from three of our closest allies. Their point was we have this  struggle to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Who else will gain possession of nuclear weapons? Many want them. Can we stop the spread of nuclear weapons and stop the spread of delivery vehicles for those nuclear weapons? It is a question this Congress needs to answer. Regrettably, when it voted on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, it answered no; that is not the priority. 
   I wonder how many of our colleagues are aware of an incident that occurred December 3, 1997, in the dark hours of the early morning in the Barents Sea off the coast of Norway. That morning of December 3, 1997, several Russian ballistic missile submarines surfaced in the cold water and prepared to fire SS-20 missiles. SS-20 missiles have the capability of carrying 10 nuclear warheads. They travel 5,000 miles--far enough to reach the United States from the Barents Sea. 
   On that morning, those Russian submarines surfaced and launched 20 ballistic missiles. Roaring skyward, they rose to 30,000 feet. They were tracked by our space command in NORAD, and at 30,000 feet, all of those Russian missiles exploded. 
   Why did those Russian missiles explode? Those missiles did not have nuclear warheads on them. Those missiles were not part of a Russian missile attack on the United States. In fact, seven American weapons inspectors were there, watching from a ship a few miles away as the Russian missiles were launched. These self-destruct launches were a quick and a cheap way for the Russians to destroy submarine-launched missiles that they were required to destroy under the START I arms control treaty they have with the United States. 
   What an interesting thing to see, the firing of missiles to destroy them--no, not to terrorize or attack an enemy, but to destroy the missiles because arms control agreements require that the missiles be destroyed. 
   With consent, I hold up a piece of metal that comes from a Backfire bomber. This is from a wing strut on an old Soviet Union--now Russian--bomber called the Backfire bomber. This bomber would fly in this world carrying nuclear weapons from the cold war with the United States, threatening our country. How would I have the piece of a wing strut of a Russian Backfire bomber? Did we shoot it down? No, we did not shoot this bomber down. I would like to show a picture of what we did with this bomber. This is the Backfire bomber. As you can see, we cut it in half. Why are we cutting up Russian bombers? Because our arms control agreements require a reduction in nuclear arms and vehicles to deliver nuclear weapons. 
   I have here ground up copper wire from a Typhoon Russian submarine. This used to be wiring on a Russian submarine that would stealthily move under the waters of this world with missiles and multiple warheads, nuclear warheads aimed at the United States of America. How is it that I hold in my hand copper wire from a Typhoon-class Russian submarine? Did we sink that submarine? Did we attack it and sink it and destroy it? No. What happened to the Typhoon submarine was it was brought to a shipyard, under the arms control agreement, and it was chopped up. I do not have a picture of what was left of it when this was brought to drydock and destroyed, but the fact is we cut these weapons systems up as part of our arms control agreements. 
   This is what the submarine looks like in drydock as it is being destroyed. 
   In the Ukraine, there is a little spot where you can travel and see some sunflowers growing. Do you know what used to be where the sunflowers now exist? A Russian missile with multiple nuclear warheads aimed at the United States of America. The missile is now gone. Under arms control agreements, it was pulled out and destroyed because our agreements with the Russians require that to happen. Where there was once a missile aimed at the United States of America, there is now a field of sunflowers. What a wonderful metaphor for progress. 
   I raise all these issues simply to say we have made significant progress in arms control and arms reduction, but not nearly as much as we must. Here is a chart of some of the examples of what we have done: 5,314 nuclear warheads have been removed, 507 ICBMs, 65 silos, 15 ballistic missile submarines, and 62 heavy long range bombers are gone--because we, through what is called the Nunn-Lugar program, have provided taxpayer funding to destroy the weapons that existed in the old Soviet Union, and now in Russia, to say, in concert with our agreements, we will reduce nuclear weapons. We have reduced nuclear weapons and they have reduced nuclear weapons. It makes a lot more sense to destroy these airplanes, missiles and warheads before they are used in hostile actions. It makes a lot more sense to destroy them by arms control agreements and arms reduction agreements. That is exactly what has been happening. 
   Going back to the chart I put up, despite all the progress and all the reductions in nuclear arms, here is what is left. It is 
   troublesome because there are a lot of countries that want to get into these arsenals, especially this one. There are a lot of countries, a lot of people, a lot of terrorist groups that want to grab hold of a nuclear weapon here or there, and have nuclear capability for themselves. That is very dangerous. That makes for a very dangerous world and a very dangerous future. 
   Some days ago we witnessed a cowardly terrorist act of a couple of people in a boat, pulling up by the side of an American Navy ship, the U.S.S. Cole, creating an explosion that took the life of many of our young sailors who were serving their country. I indicated before, I send my thoughts and prayers to all of those families who are now grieving the loss of their loved ones. They should know the service and dedication of their loved ones in serving this country is something a grateful nation will never forget. 
   But it is a dangerous world. The attack on the Cole reminds us again that there are those who want to commit acts of terrorism. It is a dangerous world. What if that small boat had contained a nuclear weapon? Don't you think those terrorists would love to get their hands on a nuclear weapon? Of course they would. 
   There are many countries that do not yet have the capability of building nuclear weapons that desperately want it. They are struggling, even now, to try to get their hands on the arsenal, and on the mechanics and capabilities of making a nuclear weapon. We must understand how dangerous it will be for our future and for our children if we do not make arms reduction, and the development of new agreements and new treaties to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons job No. 1; we must understand how dangerous that is for our future. 
   This Congress, as I indicated, decided it would not support the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. Lord only knows why they would make that decision. It is beyond me. The test ban treaty has formally been ratified by 66 states, signed by 160 states. The major holdouts, incidentally, are the U.S., China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea. Six countries have signed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty and 14 have ratified it since our vote to turn it down last October. All of the NATO states, all of our NATO allies, have ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty except the United States. 
   We are told by the critics that we not only should threaten our arms reduction agreements, including START I and START II, and the prospect of a Start III, we should also threaten all our arms control agreements--including the anti-ballistic missile agreement, which is so important, the center pole of the tent on arms reduction--we should threaten all of those for the sake of building a national missile defense program. We should threaten all of those for the sake of defeating the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. 
   It is interesting that this country has already decided of its own volition we will not test nuclear weapons. We decided 7 years ago we would not test nuclear weapons. So we have unilaterally said we will not test nuclear weapons, but we are then the country that says we will refuse to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. That is not a step forward; that is a huge step backwards. 
   I cannot describe my disappointment at a Congress that turns down the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty and the responsibility that should  come with this country considering the nuclear weapons it has. I cannot describe how profound my disappointment is. We have a responsibility to provide leadership. It is our responsibility. We are the world's leader in this area. We must say that we and our allies and all other countries must work every day, all day, to make sure the spread of nuclear weapons stops; to make sure those who want to achieve the capability of making nuclear weapons will not be able to achieve that capability. We must do that. That is our responsibility. It is on our watch. 
   We have a Senate that turns down a Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty but says: Let us build a national missile defense no matter what it costs; let's build a national missile defense system no matter what its consequences to our relationship with others in the nuclear club; let's build a national missile defense system no matter what it does to our arms control agreements. Build it, just build it; all the other things are irrelevant, they say. 
   I disagree with that. We have a lot of threats to which this country must respond. Some of them are nuclear threats. Some of them are nuclear threats that result from a rogue state acquiring a ballistic missile, and attaching to that missile a nuclear warhead, and aiming it at the United States. 
   That truly is a threat. However, it is one of the least likely threats, I might suggest, and all experts have suggested that as well. 
   The most likely threat, by far, is not to have a rogue nation acquire an intercontinental ballistic missile and fire it at the United States with a nuclear warhead; the most likely threat, by far, is for a rogue nation or a terrorist group to achieve some sort of suitcase nuclear bomb and plant it in the trunk of a rusty Yugo car, set that car on a dock in New York City, and hold the city hostage. That has nothing to do with an intercontinental ballistic missile. 
   Far more likely is a small glass vial of deadly biological or chemical agents that can kill 100 million people. Or far more likely, in my judgment--if the threat is a missile threat--is from a cruise missile, not an intercontinental ballistic missile. A cruise missile, which would be more readily available, is a missile which travels at 500 feet above the ground at 500 miles an hour, roughly, and is not detectable or defensible from a national missile defense system once it is built. 
   So we have our colleagues who turn down the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty and then say, by the way, we want to build a national missile defense system, and it will protect against one small sliver of the threat, and almost all the rest of the threat will be unresolved because we have spent all the money on this one small sliver, which is the least likely threat. 
   If the attack on the U.S.S. Cole teaches us--and it should --it ought to teach us that the more likely threat to this country is a terrorist threat by two people on a boat or by someone driving a rental truck that is filled with a fertilizer bomb, as happened in Oklahoma City, or dozens of other approaches in which terrorists, or others, use their skill to try to wreak havoc through terrorist acts. 
   My hope is that while this Congress seems oblivious to the value of arms control and arms reductions, we will at least have some kind of a discussion in this campaign going on in this country about how we feel, as Members of Congress and as Presidential candidates, about our responsibility to provide leadership to reduce the stockpile of nuclear arms and reduce the threat of nuclear war, and especially to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to those who want them but do not yet have them. 
   What is our leadership responsibility? Some say: It is not our job. Not now. Not us. It is not time. I do not agree with that. We are kind of waltzing along as a country. Everything seems pretty good. The economy is doing pretty well. 
   We have a great deal of uncertainty in the world. We have a country such as Russia with 20,000 nuclear weapons. We have a lot of others that aspire to get access to the delivery vehicles and to nuclear weapons. We have terrorist groups who are in terrorist training camps, as I speak, who would love to acquire small, low-yield nuclear weapons. We have command and control issues in Russia on both strategic and tactical nuclear weapons. Yet there is almost no discussion here in this Chamber--almost no discussion in the Senate--about these issues. 
   To the extent there is discussion, it is discussion with a set of very special blinders, saying: Let's do the following. Let's build a national missile defense system. And let's build it now. And notwithstanding the consequences, we don't care what it costs, and we don't care what its consequences might be with respect to arms control agreements that now exist. 
   That is not, in my judgment, the best of what we ought to be doing for future generations. It is our responsibility to lead on the issue of arms reduction and arms control. It is our responsibility to say to the world that 20,000 nuclear weapons in the Russian stockpile is too much, and 10,500 nuclear weapons in our stockpile is too much, and we need to begin systematic 
   reduction. 
   We know what does not work, and we know what does work. What does work is the Nunn-Lugar program, in which this country engages in treaties and, with the verification of those treaties, helps pay for the systematic destruction of nuclear weapons and delivery systems for those nuclear weapons. We know that works. We have been doing it now for several years. 
   I held in my hand, as I said earlier, a part of a Russian bomber wing. We did not shoot it down, we sawed it up. I held something from a nuclear submarine. We did not sink it, we dismantled it. One day, on the floor of the Senate, I held a hinge from an ICBM silo that was located in the Ukraine. I had that metal hinge not because we destroyed that silo with a nuclear weapon but because we sent bulldozers and heavy equipment over there and took the silo out. What a remarkable success. Nunn-Lugar, that is what the program is called; Republican-Democrat; LUGAR a Republican, Nunn a Democrat. Nunn-Lugar: These two people provided leadership in the Senate saying, this is the program we ought to have to try to steer an area of arms reductions compliance with treaties that actually reduce the nuclear threat. 
   But it is just a step. It is just a step in what ought to be a journey for us, a long journey, but one we must stick to and must reflect as a priority for our country. 
   So I just wanted to come, as we finish this session of Congress, to say I have been profoundly disappointed that in this Congress we have made no progress on the issue of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. We have a requirement to provide the leadership in this world on that issue. We have made no progress on the two major issues: The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, we took a huge step backward in terms of our world leadership responsibilities; and, second, on the issue of national missile defense, we have sent a signal to others that our arms control agreements really do not matter very much. That is, in my judgment, exactly the wrong signal to be sending. 
   I heard the Senator from Texas, my colleague, Mr. GRAMM, talk about another issue. I can't do his Texas twang, but he said: I am going to be here next year. Well, he is. I am going to be here next year as well. We have terms in the Senate. I was elected by my State to come and serve my State's interests here in the Senate and serve the interests of this country. I am going to be here. 
   It is my intention, with whatever strength I have, to try to provide some constructive leadership, with my colleagues, to say: This country has a significant responsibility to address the issue of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. To the extent that we don't care much about it, don't do much about it, don't discuss it, don't talk about it, don't debate it, in my judgment, our country's future is severely injured. 
   I hope that as we turn the corner and come to January and swear in the 107th Congress, the issue of arms control and arms reductions--dealing with the stopping of the spread of nuclear weapons and the proliferation of both nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles for them--can become part of a significant debate in Congress because all Members of Congress will understand our responsibility and its importance. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to share my thoughts on the prescription drug reimportation provision included in the Agriculture appropriations conference report before the Senate. As my colleagues know, I have been concerned for a long while that American consumers are charged two to three times more for prescription drugs than consumers in other countries pay. In fact, in June of 1999, I introduced bipartisan legislation, the International Prescription Drug Parity Act, to address this unfair pricing situation by allowing U.S. pharmacists and drug wholesalers to reimport FDA-approved prescription drugs from other countries at a fraction of the cost. 
   Ten months ago on a cold, snowy day, I accompanied a group of North Dakota senior citizens and pharmacists on a trip to Emerson in Manitoba, Canada. Emerson, Canada, is a tiny one-horse town just 5 miles from the North Dakota-Canadian border. In Emerson, I watched as my North Dakota constituents saved hundreds of dollars each on the exact same prescription drugs available to them in the United States. 
   One of the folks who went with me was a 70-year-old Medicare beneficiary from Fargo, ND, named Sylvia Miller. Sylvia has diabetes, heart problems, and emphysema, and she takes at least seven different medications each day for her various ailments. Sylvia told me that last year she received $4,700 in Social Security benefits and paid $4,900 for her prescription drugs. ``Things don't add up, do they?'' she asked. 
   By making the short trip across the border to Canada, Sylvia was able to cut her monthly prescription drug bill in half. As Sylvia said in a Fargo Forum article about this trip, ``It sure would be nice if I could just go over to my own drug store and get those prices.'' 
   Sylvia couldn't be more right. No American should be forced to travel to Canada or Mexico just to get more affordable prices for his or her prescription drugs. Yet a prescription drug that costs $1 in the United States costs only 64 cents in Canada, 65 cents in Great Britain, 57 cents in France, and 51 cents in Italy. Those price differences compel many senior citizens who are struggling to pay for their medications and make ends meet to leave the United States to get lower prices elsewhere. 
   Time and again over the last several years I have been asked by North Dakota consumers why the global economy doesn't work when it comes to prescription drugs. Why can't local pharmacists travel to Canada to buy these same medications at the lower prices and pass along the savings to their customers? Good question. 
   The answer is that, under current Federal law, only the pharmaceutical manufacturers can reimport prescription drugs into the United States from another country--even though these drugs were originally made in America and approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The lack of competition in the U.S. marketplace has created a situation in which the big drug companies can charge American consumers the maximum the market can bear. And if their 18 percent profit margins are any indication, that is exactly what the drugmakers are doing. 
   During the Senate's debate on the Agriculture appropriations bill, Senator JEFFORDS and I, along with Senators WELLSTONE, GORTON, and others, offered an amendment to allow U.S. pharmacists and wholesalers to reimport FDA-approved prescription drugs from Canada, Mexico, and other countries where these medications are sold at a fraction of the price. Our amendment included appropriate safeguards to ensure that only safe and effective FDA-approved medications, made in FDA-approved manufacturing facilities and for which safe handling could be assured, would be imported. This amendment was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate by a 74-21 vote. 
   The House also overwhelmingly passed amendments to the Agriculture bill back in July that would have allowed for prescription drug importation, although without the safety measures adopted in the Senate. Normally at this point, a House-Senate conference committee would have begun meeting to iron out the differences between the House and Senate bills. This year, however, most of the details were worked out behind closed doors and without the involvement of most of the members of the conference committee. As a result, many of us who have been working on prescription drug importation legislation for nearly 2 years were shut out of the negotiations. 
   I am very disappointed with the route that the House and Senate leadership took to develop the final reimportation language. When the Agriculture Appropriations Conference Committee, on which I served, met, the conferees were presented with final language that had been negotiated largely among only the House and Senate majority leadership. While this language is similar to the Jeffords-Dorgan amendment passed in July, there are some changes in the language. Some of these changes represent improvement, but some changes were not made that should have been. 
   I share in my colleagues' disappointment that some of the changes that I and others proposed, which would have improved this provision, were not included in the final language. After the Senate passed the Jeffords-Dorgan amendment, a few changes were brought to our attention that would help to ensure that our amendment meets the goal of achieving lower prices for American consumers. Therefore, during the conference, I tried to strengthen the final language in a few key areas. 
   The changes I proposed would have provided greater certainty that this approach would meet my goal of lowering drug prices for American consumers, but unfortunately they were rejected. First, the FDA suggested, and I agreed, that we should require the drug companies to provide importers with the FDA-approved labeling. I think it is pretty indisputable that I, as well as the other authors of the various prescription drug importation bills, intended all along for imported products to be FDA-approved, including having the appropriate labeling. I would prefer that the final provision make this explicit. However, I believe the final language, which gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services new authority to do whatever she believes is necessary to facilitate importation, provides the needed authorization to accomplish this end through the regulations implementing importation. It is my hope that the Secretary who implements this provision will write strong rules to ensure that reimportation will succeed in giving Americans access to safe, cost-effective medicines. 
   Second, Congressman WAXMAN and others pointed out that drug companies could prevent reimportation from occurring by requiring their foreign distributors to sign contracts promising not to re-sell their products to U.S. importers. To address this concern, the final provision includes language not in the original Jeffords-Dorgan amendment to prevent the drugmakers from entering into agreements with their distributors that would have the effect of preventing reimportation. Here, too, I wish that this language were stronger and broader, and I unsuccessfully proposed strengthening it. 
   I have no doubt that the drug companies are already searching for ways to thwart this legislation. If the drug manufacturers do take steps to clearly and purposefully circumvent this legislation, I personally am committed to closing any loopholes or taking another tact altogether to achieve fairer drug prices for American consumers. 
   Let me make one final point. I think this legislation sends an important message to the big drug companies that Congress will no longer tolerate unfair prescription drug prices. But this legislation is just one step, and it is no substitute for adding a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. 
   I have been saying all along that we have a two-prong problem with prescription drugs in this country. First, prescription drugs cost too much, and I have been fighting for a strong reimportation provision so that we can put pressure on the drug companies to lower their prices. Second, there are  too many Medicare beneficiaries who have no prescription drug coverage, and they need it. When the Medicare program was created in 1965, prescription drugs weren't the significant part of the practice of medicine that they are today. Congress must modernize the Medicare program by creating a prescription drug benefit in Medicare, and we should do it this year.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to make a comment about the tragic death last evening of Governor Carnahan of Missouri. Governor Carnahan, of course, was also a candidate for the Senate, a Governor of Missouri, Lieutenant Governor, and a distinguished officeholder for many years in the State of Missouri. His tragic death last evening is something that obviously allows all to say to his family, his widow, and the folks who were his friends and relatives, that our thoughts and prayers are with them. It is a difficult time, I know. This is a man who gave so much service to his country and such distinguished service to our country. 
   My thoughts are with him and his family this morning.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I indicated I wanted to talk today about the appropriations bill conference report that is going to be considered by the Senate. The vote at this point is ordered for tomorrow. It is a vote on the Agriculture appropriations bill conference report. 
   I am a member of the subcommittee dealing with Agriculture appropriations in the Senate. We have had a lengthy conference with the House of Representatives and have reported out a piece of legislation. While I am critical of the farm bill we have in this country because I believe it does not work, I do not want to start with criticism of anything or anybody. Rather, I want to start with compliments. 
   I compliment Senator THAD COCHRAN who is the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. He does just an excellent job. I appreciate very much the work he does. 
   I compliment Senator HERB KOHL who is the ranking member on that subcommittee. 
   I thank Galen Fountain, our minority clerk on the subcommittee, who does a lot of work with us, and good work; Rebecca Davies, Martha Scott-Poindexter, Les Spivey, Hunt Shipman--staff people who have done a great deal of work to put this legislation together. 
   On my staff, Dale Thorenson and Nicole Kroetsch, Brian Moran, and Stephanie Mohl, who worked on parts of this. Thanks to all those people. 
   When we bring a piece of legislation to the floor of the Senate after it has gone through conference, it has gone through a long, tortured process. It is not an easy thing to put together. It represents a lot of work and compromise. Thanks to all the people I have mentioned. 
   I will try to, for a moment, describe why all of this is important to me. There are a lot of things in this legislation dealing with research, agricultural research, food research, Food for Peace--you name it, there is a whole range of programs that deal with very important and serious issues. But I want to focus on one thing, and that is family farming. 
   I come from a State that is largely an agricultural State. The fact is, our family farmers in this country are in deep trouble. Some people probably couldn't care less. They get their butter from a carton, they get their eggs from a carton, they buy their milk in a bottle, they get their pasta in a package, and they couldn't care less what is happening to family farmers. 
   Those who think a lot about it understand the importance of farmers who are out there with their families living on the farm, with the yard light that illuminates their place at night. They understand its culture, and understand its contribution to our country. Those who think about it understand the importance of broad-based economic ownership in our country's food production. 
   I want to read a couple of letters because we are in a situation where commodity prices have collapsed, the grain prices are rock bottom, and our farmers are in desperate trouble. They are losing their livelihood, losing their farms, having to quit. This is a letter I received a couple of days ago from a woman named Lois. I will not read her last name. I do not know if she has indicated she would want me to read this on the floor of the Senate. This is a family farm in North Dakota. Lois and her husband run a family farm. The letter says:  
   Dear Byron, it's 6 a.m. I woke up [this morning] and feel compelled to write, as I feel farmers here are now at rock bottom. 
   Right now as we harvest a worthless crop, pay huge prices for our oil products, face winter and bills to pay, we find the [crops sprout damaged and injured] by rain. Harvest brings more stress and fears to all of us. I'm afraid for us. I'm afraid for my neighbors and others like us who can't make a profit thru no fault of our own. We ..... have other jobs, but we can't keep farming....... I am taking time off these days (from my work) to drive a grain truck. I'm hauling grain that is below $1 a bushel....... We need a price that is more than cost. It's called profit. I don't have a lot of answers. We've attended many meetings....... We can feed the world ..... we should feel pride in that.  
   But what's wrong? There's something not connecting here. 
   She, like so many others, is trying to make a living on a family farm, and they are going broke. 
   A farm family--a man and his wife--wrote to me about a week ago and said:  
   It is with tears in my eyes that I find myself writing to you today. After I have been assisting in what should be a joyous time, it just couldn't be further from that. So for the first time, I am taking steps to try and find help, for not only ourselves, but all of those who are worse off around us. Somebody has to help us now....... My husband and I farm--near a small community in the northwest corner of North Dakota. 
   We are blessed with some of the greatest soil and we felt very fortunate until now that it has helped to provide us with thousands of bushels of grain, plus cattle. In fact, up until recently, we had thought we were very fortunate. We couldn't have been more wrong, however. 
   We are facing the worst times our 3rd generation farm has ever seen since its existence began in 1914. As combines are cutting our fields, the last thing I would normally be doing right now is writing a letter, but we have no choice. Something has to be done and people need to know what kind of devastation is [occurring] in our economy. 
   It was just this morning that we were told that our very rare and beautifully colored, disease free durum wheat is now only worth 80 cents a bushel. Our neighbors were not so ``lucky.'' There is no market for theirs as it was not close to perfect. 
   Our banks will not collect on their loans, young people like ourselves are going to just pack up and leave....... There is just no reason for us to continually be abused.......  
   She raises the questions, as other farmers do, about everyone else making record profits that handle their grain. The grain elevators, railroads, and the grain trade all make record profits. 
   She says:  
   We are one of the very few young farmers left in our community and after this harvest there will be many more forced to leave. There just will be no alternative.  
   Another letter from another family farm in North Dakota. A farmer writes:  
   So why do I write? Simply to encourage you to continue the battle, to be a voice alerting the nation to the financial, cultural and social devastation that is taking place in rural America. As a seventy two year old lifetime farmer, now retired, I am a witness to farm after farm being discontinued. The immediate community in which I live vastly changed and changing. Good young family farmers are quitting one after the other, some forced out financially, others giving up before complete financial ruin. There is no profit incentive, the gamble is too great, the fight against weather, disease, regulations and prices too heavy a burden to bear.  
   This farmer writes:  
   Personally, I have a son now forty five, who has farmed since graduating from the University of North Dakota. His hope is fading. He talks of farming one more year and [then giving up]. He is a fourth generation farmer ready to give up. His son now seven never to continue into the fifth generation [on the family farm].  
   He says:  
   My concern is for my family, my community, the nation.  
   I will not read any more. I have so many letters from farmers. They are out there wondering what is wrong with an economic system which rewards everyone except those who produce the crops. 
   Some say: The ``family farm,'' that is kind of like the little old diner that  gets left behind when the interstate comes through. It was a great old place once, but it is irrelevant now because the interstate moves people past that diner. They say that is what the family farm is like. They couldn't be more wrong. 
   I have indicated before, go to Europe, if you wonder what an economy ought to be with respect to rural values. Europe was hungry at one point so it decided never to be hungry again. One part of national security is to make sure you have a network of producers, a network of family farms producing your food. That way you will not have concentration; you will have broad-based economic ownership, and you will provide national security with respect to food. Europe has a healthy agricultural base. Europe has family farmers who are making money and small towns that have life on their main streets. Why? Because Europe has chosen an economic model that says they intend to keep their family farmers on the farm. 
   Our country ought to do the same, for a whole series of reasons, some economic, some cultural, some social. But family farms contribute more than just grain. They contribute families, yes; they contribute community; they contribute a culture that is very important to this country. 
   A wonderful author named Critchfield used to write about the nurturing of family values in this country. He said family values have always started, in the two centuries of America, on its family farms, and rolled to its small towns and to its cities. The refreshment and nurturing of family values has always come from the seedbed of family values; and that is our family farms. 
   If one wonders what kind of cultural devastation occurs or what kind of cultural changes will occur in this country if we lose our family farms, our rural economy, and turn into a country in which corporations farm all of America from coast to coast--one 
   can see that model in a number of other areas. It is not something that advances our country's interests. Rather, it retards our country's interests. 
   So I do not come here making excuses in support of family farms. I come saying that the support of family farms is essential for the long term well-being of this country. 
   How do we support family farms? Well, we have a farm bill that is a disaster called Freedom to Farm. We gave farmers so-called freedom to farm, but not freedom to sell. So farmers are prevented from selling into certain markets. The freedom to farm is a presumption that individual family farmers have the economic clout in which to deal with everyone else with whom they have to deal. 
   Does a family farmer have a chance when complaining about railroad rates? I do not think so. Ask the folks in Montana who filed a complaint against the railroad rates. Ask them if they got a fair shake when it took 16 years to get the complaint processed down through the ICC. 
   Who wins when the family farmer is overcharged by a railroad for hauling grain? The railroad wins. 
   Who wins when the food manufacturers or the grain trade takes a kernel of wheat, moves it somewhere down the line on the railroad and into a plant, puffs it up, puts it on a grocery store, and calls it puffed wheat? Who wins when they take produce from farmers and give them a pittance for it, and then charge a fortune for it on the grocery store shelf? It is the same kernel of wheat, only it has had a puff added to it. The puff is worth more than the wheat. The people selling the puffed wheat are making a fortune, and the family farmers are going broke. 
   Is that an economic model that has any justice in it at all? The answer is no. So we ought to have a farm program that works. And we do not. Next year we ought to commit ourselves to repealing Freedom to Farm, and rewriting a bill that works for family farmers, that provides a safety net for family farms in the country. This is not rocket science. They do it in Europe. We ought to be able to do it in our country. 
   Let me describe, just for a moment, what we have in this appropriations bill. We have disaster assistance in this appropriations bill. 
   I want to show a couple of charts that talk about what happened in North Dakota in the spring of this year after the crops were planted. This chart happens to show a grain field. It does not look like it, but it is a grain field. From the evening of June 12 until the morning of June 14--a day and a half--a stalled thunderstorm system--actually several thunderstorms converging together--dumped as much as 18 inches of rain in the Red River Valley, near Grand Forks, ND. 
   North Dakota is a state that usually gets 15 to 17 inches of rain a year. We are a semiarid state which averages 15 to 17 inches of rainfall a year. From June 12 through June 14, in some of these areas, we had 18 inches in 36 hours. 
   A few days later on the evening of June 19, around 7 o'clock in the evening, flash flooding and severe thunderstorms hit the Fargo-Morehead area about 80 miles south of the first set of storms in the Red River Valley. By 11 p.m. that evening, more than 4 inches of rain had fallen, and it looked as if maybe the worst had passed. But thundershower after thundershower pummeled the area after midnight, dropping an additional 2 inches of rain in 90 minutes. So, this area ended up with a total of 6 inches of rain in a very short period. This is a totally flat terrain. It caused massive sheet flooding. Throughout the area around Fargo, seven to 9 inches of rain in total fell in the timespan of 6 hours. 
   This chart shows what a grain field looked like the day after. Here is another picture of grain fields. As you can see, there is no grain there. This is a lake. In fact, this area used to be Lake Agassiz long before any of us were around. But you can see 
   what this does if you are a family farmer and you have been out in the spring planting grain. We now have a flood. 
   The floods in North Dakota, the drought in Texas, the drought in Georgia, the drought in Mississippi, and other parts of our country, the disasters in Montana, all persuaded this Agriculture appropriations subcommittee to add more funding for disaster aid. We originally added $450 million for Crop Loss Assistance due to weather disasters when the bill was in the Senate--an amendment I offered on the floor of the Senate. 
   When it went to conference, the need was obvious, so we added more. It went to $1.1 billion for disaster aid because we had had continued disasters in Texas and in the Deep South. In fact, look at Georgia here. The weekend before we lost our late colleague, Senator Coverdell--who was a distinguished Senator and one I deeply admired--the weekend before we tragically lost our colleague, I had spoken to him about what was happening in Georgia. He said that he was going to cosponsor with me a disaster piece that would provide assistance for farmers in that area of the country. We had need--because of the floods--in our area as well. 
   We have had drought in the Deep South. As shown on this chart, we can see these red areas. We have had flooding in other areas. We have had a pretty difficult time this year in many areas of the country. 
   So this piece of legislation adds $1.1 billion for disaster assistance. This help allows farmers who have been struck by natural disasters to be able to claim some help for crops that they were not able to harvest. 
   In addition to that, we had folks up in this part of North Dakota that harvested a crop--a crop that looked great--but they had a disaster when they delivered that crop to the grain elevator. They took a durum crop from the field--a 45-bushel-to-the-acre crop, which is a pretty good crop--only to discover that when they got it to the grain elevator it was full of disease and sprout damage. They found out that grain they thought was going to be worth a decent price was now valued by the grain trade at only 80 cents a bushel. 
   The cost of producing this grain is probably $4 to $4.50 a bushel. So, they had a field waving in the wind, getting ripe and ready to be harvested. They got the combine out, took the grain off, and then discovered what cost them $4.50 a bushel to produce was now worth 80 cents. To make matters worse, they also found out that the crop insurance they had taken out to insure their crop does not provide help for them to cover the quality loss. 
   That is called a quality loss adjustment. Actually a better word for it is a  catastrophe. If you have a product that you have produced, and it turns out to be worth almost nothing, that is a catastrophe. 
   Here is what has happened to our farmers. You can see, going back to 1996, wheat prices were very high. That is when Congress passed Freedom to Farm. Many of us stood on the floor of the Senate warning, at that point, this isn't going to continue. But Freedom to Farm provided specific payments over a period of time after which there would be a phaseout of the program altogether. You can see what has happened to prices. You can see with prices at rock bottom, having collapsed and stayed down for some while, that the quality loss adjustments mean that farmers are getting pennies for their crop. 
   This disaster is not a natural disaster, but rather it has resulted in quality loss adjustments by the grain trade that had to be addressed in this bill. For the first time, this legislation will provide $500 million for quality loss adjustments. I will talk through that for a moment so people understand why this is in the bill and why it was necessary. 
   These farmers haven't caused the problem. These are good family farmers who have discovered that their crop, especially in our part of the country up in North Dakota, with the worst crop disease in a century, these are farmers who have discovered that they have produced a rather bountiful crop that is worth nothing when they take it to the grain elevator. Without the quality loss assistance, we would have had a wholesale migration from our family farms. We are going to have a lot of migration anyway by family farmers who simply can't make it. But the disaster aid and the quality loss adjustment is going to be a step in the right direction by at least extending a hand to say until we change this farm bill, here is some help. 
   I pushed very hard on quality loss assistance. I know I might have bruised some feelings here and there, but I just didn't think we had any choice. We can't say to family farmers, when their prices are collapsed, that it doesn't matter. We can't say to family farmers who are out there struggling: When your crop is hit by disease, it doesn't matter; when your crop insurance doesn't pay off, it doesn't matter; if you are hit 6 or 7 years in a row by natural disaster, as has been the case with many counties in North Dakota, it doesn't matter. 
   We have a responsibility to define the kind of economy we want in this country. The kind of economy I want is an economy that values that which is produced on our family farms. Our farm program needs changing desperately. We have not been able to get that done this year. In the meantime, this piece of legislation, this Agriculture appropriations bill, does provide some fill so that with respect to disaster and quality loss adjustments, we are able to provide some short-term, interim help to family farmers. 
   I say to Senator COCHRAN, Senator KOHL, and others who were willing to allow me to press as hard as I did to put this in the bill, I appreciate--and the family farmers in my State will appreciate--the opportunity to continue to try to make that family farm work and to make a living. 
   I say, again, that we have a responsibility to decide as a Congress whether we want family farms in our future. For those who don't, let's just keep doing what we are doing and that is where we will end up. We will eventually not have any family farmers left in this country. But for those who, like me, believe that a network of family farms is essential to this country, to its culture and its economy, then we better wake up and work together and write a farm bill that works and gives farmers some hope. We better do that, not 2 years from now, not 3 years from now. We better do that now. 
   We are about ready to adjourn, I suppose, at the end of this week or the end of next week, and we will reconvene as a Congress, the 107th Congress, in January. My hope is one of the first items of business is for us to understand that rural America has not shared in this bountiful prosperity of our country. It is not just that food has no value. You look around the world at night on your 
   television screen, you will discover that there are people who are hungry, there are children who are going to bed with an ache in their belly in every corner of the globe. Food does have value. But the food that is produced in this country, regrettably, has value only for established monopolistic interests, those who have become big enough to flex their economic muscle at the expense of those who produce the food. 
   Everyone who touches a bushel of grain produced by a family farmer seems to be making record profits. Every enterprise that touches it seems to be doing well. The railroads, the grain trade, the grocery manufacturers, they are all doing well. In fact, they are doing so well, they are marrying each other. Every day you read about another merger. They want to get hitched. They have so much money, they are all rolling in cash. It is the folks out here who took all the risks and plowed the ground and seeded the ground and harvested the crop. They are the ones who can't make a living. There is something disconnected about that kind of economic circumstance. 
   We can have the kind of economy we choose to have. It is within our ability to define the kind of economy we want for this country. I hope, beginning next year, we will decide that there is a different way, a better way to extend the help for family farmers with a farm program that really works during tough times and a farm program that we would not need during better economic times when grain prices reflected the real value of the grain produced by family farms. 
   We have made some progress in the Agriculture appropriations bill dealing with sanctions. It is not the best, but we have made some progress. Many of us in the Senate, many in the Congress, have believed that it is relatively foolish for our farmers to bear the brunt of national security interests by having sanctions against other countries that say you can't ship food or medicine to certain countries because we are angry with their leaders. That has never made any sense to me. 
   We can be as angry as we like with the country of Iran or Libya or Cuba or Iraq, but refusing to ship food to those countries doesn't hurt Saddam Hussein or Fidel Castro. All that does is hurt hungry, sick, and poor children. It hurts hungry people, sick people, and poor people in countries to which we are not allowed to ship food and medicine. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot, our public policy has been to say ready, aim, fire, and we shoot ourselves right smack in the foot on the issue of sanctions. 
   I don't have a quarrel with those who want to strap economic sanctions on the country of Iraq. That is fine with me. But sanctions should not include food. We have tried mightily to get rid of the sanctions with respect to a range of countries with whom we now prevent the shipment of food and medicine. This legislation marginally moves in that direction. It includes some elements of the amendment I put in the appropriations bill as it went through the Senate. But, once again, it is reactionary with respect to Cuba. There is going to be no grain sold to Cuba because of restrictions put in here by a few people who were trying to hijack this debate in the conference. The result is it tightens up on travel restrictions to Cuba, and virtually means there will be no food sold in Cuba. In my judgment, that is very foolish, but we will live to fight another day on that issue. At least part of what is done in this legislation dealing with sanctions on agricultural shipments is a step in the right direction. 
   There is much more to talk about in this legislation. Let me end by mentioning my thanks to the people who helped put this legislation together. It is not easy to do. On balance, while there are some things I don't agree with--I have not described what those are--I think it is a good piece of legislation and a pretty good appropriations bill. It ought to be a precursor for all of us who support family farmers to understand that year after year, when you have to add a disaster piece and emergency pieces to deal with the failure of a farm program, it is time to rewrite the farm program from the start. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate has passed S. 623, the Dakota Water Resources Act. My colleague from North Dakota, Senator KENT CONRAD, and I have worked on this legislation for quite some time. We have worked closely with others who have an interest in this bill and passage of S. 623 today is a result of tireless negotiation between our delegation and the downstream states, especially Missouri and Minnesota. The compromise that the Senate adopted today strikes an important balance between meeting the water needs of North Dakota and protecting the needs of other states. 
   This bill is essential to meeting the water needs of North Dakota. The bill, as amended, will provide authorization for the development of municipal, rural, and industrial water projects across the State of North Dakota. The bill would also help to meet the water needs of the four Indian Reservations in the state. 
   The Dakota Water Resources Act authorizes $631.5 million. This includes a $200 million authorization for municipal, rural and industrial water development and another $200 million authorization to meet the critical water needs of the four Indian reservations in the state. The Red River Valley water supply needs will also receive a $200 millions authorization. The bill includes $25 million for a natural resources trust and $6.5 million for recreation projects in North Dakota. Mr. President, the Dakota Water Resources Act represents a responsible way for the federal government to fulfill their role in the state. It also represents a serious compromise on the part of North Dakota, while still meeting our highest priority water supply needs. 
   The bill clearly lays out the process for meeting the water needs for the Red River Valley in eastern North Dakota. First, the Secretary of the Interior will identify these water needs and evaluate options for meeting them. The Department must submit a report on the needs and suggest possible solutions to the Congress. The Secretary is also required to complete an environmental impact statement, EIS, on the Red River Valley project and select the best option. 
   In the event that the Secretary of the Interior determines that the best option includes a transfer of Missouri River water to meet the Red River Valley needs, then a further act of Congress authorizing that option must occur before construction of that feature or features could begin. This is a key provision that will allow all of our colleagues downstream to have input on such a proposal. However, if an in-basin source of water is chosen, then no further action is needed from Congress. 
   This is a good bill that reflects hard work and compromise of many stakeholders all along the Missouri River. I am pleased that we were able to develop a win-win solution, that allows us to move forward in meeting the needs of North Dakotans while protecting the interests of those who are  downstream. I am confident that this bill can be signed into law this year, and look forward to working with our friends in the other body to pass this bill and send it to the President for his signature.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. This was obviously a senseless act of terrorism. Acts of terrorism are, in most cases, perpetrated by cowards who want to inflict terrible mayhem on especially those from our country, but others around the world as well. Yesterday, when we learned the news that the U.S.S. Cole had been attacked, all of us were deeply saddened. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of the families of those who are now known dead and those who are presumed dead or missing. 
   As Senator CONRAD indicated, we have just learned from the U.S. Navy this morning that a young man named Kevin Rux from Portland, ND, is among those missing and presumed dead, according to the U.S. Navy. I want to add my voice to my colleagues' comments that my thoughts and prayers go out to his family. We are thinking of them and praying for them today. We feel the same about all of those who have been the victims of this attack. It tells us, once again, that this is a difficult and in some cases troubled world, and those who wear the uniform of this country in all parts of this globe, who stand for peace, do so at some risk to themselves and on behalf of a grateful Nation. 
   Again, I want to simply say we are thinking of the Rux family and all of the other families whose loved ones have become victims of this cowardly terrorist attack. I say, as well, that this country has said to its President and Members of Congress that those responsible for this attack must be found and brought to justice for it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are nearing the end of the 106th Congress. No one is quite sure where the finish line is. My expectation is that within a week or two this Congress will be history. 
   Many will ask what this Congress did and what it did not do. There will be some people who will be joyous about its accomplishments and some who will be sorely disappointed over its failures. I think its accomplishments, however, will be a rather short list, and the areas where we could have and should have done better will represent a very long list. I rise to briefly discuss two of those areas before we near the end of the session. 
   I have spoken many times in the Senate about health care, and especially the two issues this Congress has a responsibility to address. One issue is providing a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. We have talked about providing a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program for some long while. We are near the end of this session, and it looks as though it will not get done. Why? Because some people don't want to do it well. Everybody here talks about wanting to do this, but somehow they are not willing to support a plan that really accomplishes it. 
   On the second issue, we are nearing the end of the legislative session and we are apparently not going to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. The Patients' Bill of Rights has been an issue over which we have battled for 2 to 3 years, and it has been a tough battle. I don't think there ought to be room left for those who believe there is not a need for a Patients' Bill of Rights. All we have to do is look at the evidence. The evidence is overwhelming that we need to pass a real Patients' Bill of Rights. The House did it; we have not. This Senate has dug in its heels and has not moved on either of these issues. 
   I will talk first about the issue of a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program. When the Medicare program was developed, many of the miracle drugs that now exist weren't available. People got old. They did what they were expected to when they got old. They retired and led a more sedentary life. Then something might happen to them. They would be hospitalized. They would stay for long periods in acute care beds in the hospital. It was very expensive. The kinds of prescription drugs that are available now were not available then. 
   So when Medicare was created, a prescription drug benefit was not made a part of the Medicare program. When Medicare was developed, that too was fairly controversial. In the early 1960s, a fair number of Members of this Senate said: No, we can't do that. We can't provide health insurance for older Americans. We oppose that. That is some sort of encroachment of government into our lives. 
   I wasn't here at the time of that debate. But when they had that debate, fully one-half of all senior citizens in this country had no health insurance coverage at all. Why? Because it was too expensive. 
   Insurance companies aren't running around this country trying to find old people to sell health insurance to. That is just a fact of life. They want to find somebody who is 22 years old and healthy as a horse and isn't going to need any health care treatment for a long while. There are not people running around trying to figure out how they can attract a 70-year-old or a 75-year-old to buy their health insurance policy. They are not doing that because it is much more expensive to insure people who are 70 and 80 years of age. The result was, nearly 40 years ago half of the senior citizens in this country had no health insurance coverage at all. 
   So this Congress had a big debate. As is typical, those progressive voices who said this is something we should do were met 
   by those voices of negativity who oppose everything for the first time. There are always people who just dig in their heels at any suggestion and say, no, this can't be done; no, it won't work. 
   Well, enough votes prevailed in the Congress over time that it passed a Medicare proposal. Now 99 percent of America's senior citizens are covered with health insurance under the Medicare program. What a remarkable success. People are living longer, better, healthier lives. 
   Now we know, however, that there is a deficiency in the Medicare program. The deficiency is that it does not cover prescription drugs. Let us me read some letters from North Dakotans. We could name a different State, and we would get exactly the same letters. My colleague from Florida just spoke. His constituents, I am sure, are writing exactly the same letters. 
   This is from a woman who lives in Bismarck, ND. She writes:  
   Dear Senator Dorgan: I am writing in regard to the medication I take. I think something has to be done about the prices they charge. I get $303 each month in Social Security. I pay $400 a month for my medication. I have had heart surgery and I have osteoporosis and this medicine is very high-priced. We are using our savings now and I am 86 years old so I can't work. Can you help?  
   This is a letter from a fellow in Rolla, ND. He writes:  
   Between me and my wife, we pay $350 to $400 a month on prescription drugs. We receive less than $900 a month in combined Social Security benefits. We have trouble paying for our prescription drugs.  
   A person from Rocklake, ND, writes:  
   One-fourth of my Social Security check goes for my prescription drugs, so that doesn't leave a lot for household and personal expenses. It would sure help if Medicare covered these.  
   A man from Cavalier, ND, writes:  
   Our drugs for the two of us--he is referring to his wife and himself--just about tripled last year from the year before. The total for last year was near $2300, and it only gets worse. We need a little help.  
   A woman from Williston, ND, who titled her letter ``Message In A Bottle,'' writes:  
   I have asthma and my medications and inhalers cost me over $100 each month, and my health insurance does not cover prescriptions. I am 84 years old, and it would be a great help to me to get Medicare coverage on my medications.  
   A woman from Bismarck, ND, writes:  
   Dear Senator Dorgan: Enclosed please find my prescription bottles. I just had these medicines filled today. I am having a hard time financially with a Social Security check of $400 a month. My medicines cost $175 per month. That doesn't leave much to pay for food, rent, utilities and gas. Something has to be done with the high cost of prescription medicines. I am thinking of stopping some of my medicines. Please help!!!  
   These letters could have come from any State, from senior citizens everywhere struggling mightily to pay for their prescription drugs. Senior citizens make up 12 percent of America's population, but they consume one-third of all the prescription drugs in our country because they have reached that age where they have various ailments and problems and they need prescription drugs. 
   We need to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare Program. We have been trying very hard to do that. Some have said, well, let's not put it in the Medicare program, let's pay the insurance industry so they will sell an insurance policy providing for prescription drug benefits. The problem with  that is, the Health Insurance Association of America says insurance companies will not be able to put together a policy like that which is affordable. In fact, I had CEOs from two insurance companies come to my office, and one said: In order to provide $1,000 worth of benefits to a senior citizen for prescription drugs, I would have to charge $1,100 for the premium. Do you know anybody that will pay $1,100 for an insurance policy that provides $1,000 worth of benefits? Not where I live. 
   I say to those who say we can have the private insurance industry deal with this: it won't work. Even if they could offer the policy, it would not be affordable. We must, it seems to me, put a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program, and we ought to do it now. 
   We are nearing the end of this session and this ought to have been one of the top priorities for the Congress. It just should have been one of our top priorities. We live in good economic times, we have unprecedented economic growth, and we are going to have some surpluses this year and, we hope, in the years ahead. But do you know what the priority was for the surpluses? The priority was to run out here on a big trolley a huge batch of tax proposals that would give big tax cuts really fast. Let's provide very large tax cuts, most of which will go to the upper-income folks in this country, and let's do it even before we experience these surpluses. 
   My feeling is that we ought to have a more balanced approach. First, if we have surpluses, let's use some of those funds to pay down the Federal debt. Yes, we can use some, perhaps, for middle-income tax cuts, and we could use some of it to make the other investments we need to make. We should put a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare Program that is optional, has a copayment, and provides Medicare recipients protection against these high drug prices. 
   The proposal I support also has the ability, through purchasing power, to drive down prescription drug prices. So I say to those who schedule the Senate: Time is wasting here. Let's see if between now and the end of this week or next week we can perhaps get a prescription drug benefit bill to the floor of the Senate and get it passed. Those who want to give tax cuts to the top 1 percent of the income earners were certainly quick to get that to the floor of the Senate. Let's see if we can't do something similar in terms of legislative speed to try to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. We have time to do that. The question is, Do we have the will to do it? 
   Just one other point. I want to talk for a moment about the issue of a Patients' Bill of Rights. A Patients' Bill of Rights is 
   not some theory that represents our interests or a wish. It is an absolute necessity to provide protection for patients in this country. Some managed care plans--although not all of them--have decided that health care is a function of their profit and loss. They administer their health care plans that way. The result has been devastating to some patients in our health care system. In fact, in some cases an HMO will not tell you all of your options for medical treatment, only the cheapest options. That is not fair. 
   Every patient in this country ought to have a right to understand all of his or her options for medical treatment, not just the cheapest one. There are some HMOs that don't give you the opportunity to have emergency room treatment when you have an emergency. That ought to be a patient's right. There have been instances of people hauled into an emergency room unconscious who are denied coverage because the HMO said they didn't get prior approval for the emergency room. It ought to be a patient's right, if you have insurance through an HMO, to have emergency room treatment when you have an emergency. 
   How about oncology care? In the case of a woman who has breast cancer and whose spouse's employer switches to a different health care plan, should that woman not be able to continue with her same oncologist and with the same cancer treatment under the new plan? Of course she ought to be able to. That ought to be a right.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mary lost her youngest daughter, Donna, at age 22. 
   She said:  
   The week of February 3, 1997, Donna went to our PCP--that is her primary care provider--4 times in 5 days. 
   With each visit her symptoms were worsening. She was told she had an upper respiratory infection and panic attacks. On Saturday, February 8th, she could barely get off the couch. I assisted her up the stairs to get cleaned up at 8 p.m. At 8:30 she started crying that she was very ill. I tried repeatedly to reach our PCP, but only reached the answering service, as this was a Saturday evening. 
   I called the hospital at 9 and was told I couldn't bring her in unless her doctor authorized it or if I thought it was a life and death situation.  
   Mary continued:  
   I am a school bus driver and a mom, not a doctor or a nurse. At 9:10 I called 911, at 9:12 she screamed that her back hurt and that she thought she was going to die. She lapsed into a coma. She was pronounced dead at 10:45 p.m. at the young age of 22. 
   I went to our PCP on Monday and the very first thing that was told to me was they couldn't justify to her HMO to send her for the diagnostic tests that would have shown what was wrong with her. Twenty-two-year-old kids don't die, so there were no tests done. None. In my subsequent research, I found that HMOs can and do penalize and sanction doctors for ordering tests which HMOs feel are unnecessary. I found out on Tuesday, February 11, she died from a blood clot on her lung literally the size of a football. A $750 lung scan would have shown this. But all for the sake of money, we lost a vital beautiful young lady that had only begun her life.  
   I have about 50 stories just like this which have been compiled from all around the country--people dealing with HMOs and discovering they have  to fight their cancer and their health plans at the same time. That is not a fair fight. 
   We should pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. Now, the House of Representatives passed a bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights and this Senate passed what I call a ``patients' bill of goods.'' It is a hollow vessel, one of those charade-like things that doesn't do anything. In fact, the Republican Congressmen from the House have said the Senate passed proposal is a step backward, even worse than nothing. It is a charade. We still have an opportunity to enact a real Patients' Bill of Rights. This legislation is still in conference. This Congress can, in its final days, pass the Patients' Bill of Rights. When Mary Lewandowski comes to Washington, DC, three times because her daughter died--and this young woman should not have died--and says, ``Do something, please,'' we have a responsibility to respond. We ought to do it now. 
   If the past is prologue, of course, we will end this session and we will not do the kinds of things we should--putting a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program or enacting a real Patients' Bill of Rights. The American people will have lost. We will be back in January organizing as a new Congress and many of us will reintroduce exactly the same legislation. We will, once again, engage in this battle. The battle will not be over until we get done what needs to be done. Go back 40 years and the same people who stood on the floor of the Senate and opposed Medicare, oppose doing these important tasks. They do not think the Federal Government should do it. This same mentality is what is now providing the roadblock for doing what we should and adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare and passing a real Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   We can alter that result. We can do it this week, if there is the will. There is a way. The question for the Members of this body is, Does the will exist in the Senate to do the right thing in these final days? I hope so. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   October 10, 1999: 
   Delbert Deaton, Dallas, TX; Sedric Gillespie, 24, Denver, CO; Julian Lanier, 31, Denver, CO; Maria-Teresa Marquicias, San Francisco, CA; Dexter Lamont McKee, 19, Washington, DC; Cherry L. Minor, 22, New Orleans, LA; Donald Nelms, 56, Hollywood, FL; Jack Nowlin, 63, Miami-Dade County, FL; Joseph Ridual, San Francisco, CA; Noel Ridual, San Francisco, CA; Cliff Roberts, 22, Bloomington, IN; Baltazar Torres, 18, Wilmington, DE; Craig Watkins, 23, Baltimore, MD; Derrick White, 30, Oakland, CA; Anthony M. Witt, 27, Chicago, IL; Unidentified Male, 26, Norfolk, VA; and Unidentified Male, San Francisco, CA. 
   One victim of gun violence I mentioned, 22-year-old Cherry Minor of New Orleans, was pregnant when she was shot and killed one year ago today. Cherry was at home with her two small children and a friend when her husband forced his way into her house and shot her in the head. Cherry was separated from her husband, who police say had a history of domestic violence. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. ROCKEFELLER and I, along with the Senator from Montana, Mr. BURNS, have been working on legislation dealing with our railroad service in this country. We have introduced legislation, S. 621, entitled the Railroad Competition and Service Improvement Act which addresses problems associated with shippers who are ``captive'' or dependent on one railroad for their shipping needs. Mr. President, I have with me a letter from over 280 chief executive officers of American corporations writing about this subject.

   Mr. DORGAN. These CEOs of some of America's largest companies, and companies all across this country, join us expressing concern about what has happened to America's railroads. There is no competition in the railroad industry in this country. The deregulation of the rail industry occurred, now, over 20 years ago. At that point, we had 42 class I railroads. Now we are down to only about four major railroad operations in this country--two in the East and two in the West. Rather than encouraging some competitive framework in the rail industry, the deregulation of the railroad industry has resulted in a handful of regional monopolies. They rely on bottlenecks to exert maximum power over the marketplace. 
   These megarailroads dominate railroad traffic, generating 95 percent of the gross ton miles and nearly 94 percent of the revenues, and they control 90 percent of all coal movement in this country, 70 percent of all grain movement in America, and 88 percent of all chemical movement in this country. 
   It is quite clear what consolidation has meant to all Americans. Let me give a practical example. If you are a farmer in my State of North Dakota and you want to sent a load of wheat to market and you put that load of wheat on a railcar in Bismarck, ND, and send it to Minneapolis, MN, a little over 400 miles, you will pay $2,300. If you are going to ship that same carload of wheat from Minneapolis to Chicago, about the same distance, you do not pay $2,300, you pay less than $1,000. 
   Why the difference? Why are we charged more than double as North Dakotans to ship wheat about the same distance? Because there is no competition on the line from Bismarck to Minneapolis, but there is competition between Minneapolis and Chicago, so the prices are competitive. Where there is competition, there are lower rates. Where there is no competition, there are monopoly prices. They say to businesses and farmers: Here's the charge; if you don't like it, don't use our service. 
   What other service exists? There is only one line, only one railroad. There is a monopoly service, and they are engaged in monopoly pricing, and we have no regulatory authority to say this is wrong. 
   We have what are called ``captive shippers.'' These are Main Street businesses, family farmers, big companies, small companies, and they are held captive by the railroad companies that say to them: We have the rails, we have the cars, we have the company, and here's what the service is going to cost you; if you don't like it, tough luck. 
   In the circumstance I just described, the railroad says to a North Dakota farmer: We're going to charge you double what we charge other people. Why? Because we choose to. Why? Because we want to; because we have the muscle to do it, and if you don't like it, take a hike. 
   That is what is going on in this industry where there is no competition and where we have shippers being held captive all across this country. 
   Do rail costs matter much to my part of the country? Let me give another example. 
   Grain prices have collapsed. A farmer does not get much for grain these days. If you take wheat to an elevator in Minot, ND, that elevator pays about $2.40 a bushel for it, which is a pittance--it is worth a lot more than that--the cost to ship that $2.40 a bushel wheat to the west coast is nearly $1.20 a bushel. Half the value of that wheat on the west coast ends up being transportation costs by the railroad industry. 
   How can they do that? It's pricing gouging and nobody can do much about it because there is no regulatory authority to say it is wrong. They hide behind the Staggers Rail Act which deregulated the railroads, gave them enormous power, and resulted in a substantial concentration. The result is, all across this country we have shippers who are now held captive, they are locked in by an industry that says: This is what we are going to charge you; if you don't like it, that's tough luck. 
   What happens if someone believes this is really arbitrary, really unfair and they intend to complain about it? We had what was called the Interstate Commerce Commission. That was a group of folks who had died from the neck up. Nobody told them, but they were dead from the neck up and had one big rubber stamp down there. It said: ``Approved'' They had one big rubber stamp and one big ink pad. Whatever the railroads wanted, the ICC said: ``Approved.'' 
   We got rid of the ICC. Now we have a Surface Transportation Board, and we have someone at the Surface Transportation Board, Linda Morgan, to whom I pay a compliment. She put a moratorium on mergers. We had another proposal for a merger, and she slapped on a moratorium. That merger fell apart. Good for her. It is the first good sign of life for a long while among regulators. Good for her. But all of the merger damage is pretty well done. Linda Morgan is fighting a lonely battle at the Surface Transportation 
   Board. 
   Let me show you what happens when somebody files a complaint for unfair rail charges. You file a complaint, and here are the steps. First of all, you need to ante up some money. The filing fee for the standard procedure of complaint will be $54,000. It differs in some cases. If you have a beef with the railroad, first of all, understand you are taking on somebody with a lot more money and muscle than you have, No. 1. No. 2, you are going to pay a filing fee to file a complaint against the railroad freight rates, and then when you file the complaint, you ought to expect to live a long time because you are not going to get a result for a long, long time. In fact, some folks in Montana filed a complaint against a railroad. It took 17 years--17 years--for the complaint to go through the process, and then it never really got resolved in a  satisfactory way. That is why rail shippers understand it does not make much sense to take the railroads on. 
   You have the railroad with the muscle to make these things stick, and then you have regulators who have largely been braindead for a long, long time and do not want to do much. The exception again is we have a new Surface Transportation Board. Linda Morgan showed some courage, so there is some hope with the current STB. 
   What is happening in this country must change. Senator ROCKEFELLER, who has been a leader on this issue, and I have held hearings on it. We both serve on the Senate Commerce Committee. We are joined by Senator BURNS in our efforts. It is a bipartisan effort. 
   We want to pass the S. 621, but we are not going to get it done by the end of this year. What we are hoping for is that the 280 plus CEOs of companies across this country, large and small, who wrote this letter saying they are sick and tired of being held captive by shipping rates imposed by railroads that are noncompetitive--a rate that does not often relate to value for service--will get the attention in Congress that they deserve. We hope these CEOs continue to weigh in, in a significant way, with those who matter in this Congress to say: ``Let's do something serious about this issue.'' This is a tough issue but it is one Congress has a responsibility to tackle. 
   I pay credit to my colleague from West Virginia, Senator ROCKEFELLER. He has been working on this issue for a long time. I have been privileged to work with him. We know that which is worth doing takes some time to get done often, but we are not going to quit. The message to the 280 companies that have signed this letter, the message to our friends in Congress is: We have a piece of legislation that tries to tackle this issue of monopoly concentration and inappropriate pricing in the railroad industry. It tackles the issue on behalf of captive shippers all across this country--family farmers and Main Street businesses and others--and we are not going to quit. 
   We hope as we turn the corner at the start of this next Congress that we will be able to pass legislation that will give some help and some muscle to those in this country who are now paying too much. They expect to be able to operate in a system that has competition as a regulator in the free market, and that has not existed in the rail industry for some long while. 
   I yield the floor, and I believe my colleague from West Virginia will also have some things to say.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the Interior conference report which is before the Senate, but first I want to make some brief comments on a bill called CARA, the Conversation and Reinvestment Act. 
   My colleague from the State of Louisiana and other colleagues from the State of Florida and many other areas of the country feel, as I do, that it is very important for us to try to finish this important bill before we finish our work this year. 
   CARA is a bill dealing with conservation, preservation, and reinvestment in our natural resources, wildlife, parks, and public lands. We struggled to bring that out of the Energy Committee under the leadership of Senator MURKOWSKI. My hope is, before this Congress adjourns, we will have the opportunity to pass it through the Senate and find a way to have the House of Representatives work with us to accept it so it can become law. It is a very important piece of legislation. 
   Mr. President, let me say a kind word about my colleague from the State of Washington, Senator GORTON, and also my colleague from West Virginia, Senator BYRD. 
   I come to the floor to talk about this conference report. I am on the Interior Subcommittee. I have told my two colleagues before--the chairman and the ranking member--that I think they have done an awfully good job. This is not easy work. It is hard work, trying to fit unlimited wants into limited resources. How do you do all of that? You have to make choices. Sometimes the choices are hard and painful, but you have to make choices. 
   While I would like to see more investment and more spending in some areas that I think are critical, I must say that this year, once again, Senator GORTON and Senator BYRD have taken another step--a significant step--in addressing some of these critical needs. And it has not always been done in the past. So I say to them, thank you. And good for you. I appreciate the work you have done. 
   I especially wanted to come to the floor today to speak for a few minutes about the issues of Indian education. I have been such a strong advocate of Indian schools. These schools on Indian reservations--both the BIA schools and the public schools on or near reservations--that do not have much of a tax base to help them are in desperate need of repair. The legislation that was brought to the floor of the Senate does, this time, make some significant strides in providing investments for those areas. 
   Let me use some charts that I have shown before to demonstrate why this is an important issue. 
   This is the Marty Indian School in Marty, SD. This picture shows what happens to be some of their plumbing. Take a look at that and ask if that is where you would be proud to send your kids to school--to an old 70- and 80-year-old building that is in desperate condition with, effectively, rubber Band-Aids around their water pipes and sewer pipes. 
   This is another picture of the Marty Indian School; an old rusty radiator with crumbling walls. Would we be proud to send our children into those classrooms? 
   I have been to the Ojibwa Indian School many times. This is a picture showing the plywood that separates this building from a caved in foundation, which separates children from danger. Of course, many of the children in Ojibwa go to a series of structures, modular structures, that are kind of like the double-wide mobile homes. 
   This picture shows the fire escape. Note the fire escape is a wooden set of stairs. These little children at the Ojibwa school move back and forth between all these modular structures, in the middle of the winter, with wind and snow blowing. I have been there. I have seen the wiring and other things that lead you to question whether those children are safe in those schools. We have report after report after report saying this school needs to be rebuilt. 
   Here is a fire escape made of wooden stairs in these modular classrooms. These modular classrooms go inside. Again, they are in desperate need of repair. My point is that we need to do better than this. 
   My two colleagues, who have put this bill together, have made a step forward this year in construction money and repair and renovation money for these schools. I say to them, thank you. I hope we can do even more in the coming years. But I appreciate the effort we have made this year. 
   I will make another point about Indian education. I want to read something to my colleagues. The other issue that is so important to me is the issue of the Indian tribal colleges around this country. They have been such a blessing to so many people who have been left behind. 
   There are so many people in this country who have been left behind, especially on the Indian reservations, living in poverty, 
   living in communities with substantial substance abuse, violence that is the kind of unspeakable violence that breaks your heart. 
   I have talked about a young woman on the floor of the Senate before named Tamara Demarais. I met her one day. Young little Tamara was 3 years old when she was put in foster care. One person was handling 150 cases of these children. So that person, working these cases, put little Tamara, at age 3, in foster care and did not check closely enough the family she was putting this little 3-year-old with. 
   This is what happened to Tamara. At a drunken party, this little 3-year-old girl had her hair torn out by the roots, had her arm broken, and her nose broken in a severe beating. 
   How did that happen? Why did that happen to this little girl? Because somebody did not care enough or did not have the time to check to see whether they were putting this little girl in a family who was going to be harmful to her. She went to a foster home and was beaten severely at age 3. 
   I met that little girl about 2 years later. I wonder how long it will take her to get over the scars of what happened to her. But it happens too often--the struggle, the violence, amidst the poverty. How do we break out from that in these circumstances? 
   I want to tell you a story about tribal colleges. As the Senator from Washington will remember, in the full Appropriations committee in the Senate, I offered an amendment to add a couple million dollars. I am pleased to say that this funding stayed in this legislation. These tribal colleges are the colleges where those who have kind of been left behind in many cases go back to school. Often the only way they can do that is to have an extended family right on the reservation for child care and for other assistance; and then they can go to school. 
   I have talked before about the woman I met who was the oldest graduate at a tribal college when I gave the graduation speech one day. This is a woman who had been cleaning the toilets in the hallways of the college, a single mother with four children, and no hope and no opportunity. 
   She said to herself: I would like to graduate from this college somehow. So as she toiled, cleaning the school at nights, she put together a plan to try to figure out a way to go to that college and graduate. The day I showed up, she had a cap and gown and a smile on, because this mother of four, with the help of Pell grants and student aid and other things, was a college graduate. 
   Imagine, that is what it does to the lives of these people. 
   I will read from a letter of someone who says it better than I could.  
   I grew up poor and I was considered backward by non-Indians. 
   My home was a two-room log house in a place called the ``bush'' on North Dakota's Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation. 
   I stuttered. I was painfully shy. My clothes were hand-me-downs. I was like thousands of other Indian kids growing up on reservations across America. 
   When I went to elementary school I felt so alone and so different. I couldn't speak up for myself. My teachers had no appreciation for Indian culture. 
   I'll never forget that it was the lighter-skinned children who were treated better. They were usually from families that were better off than mine. 
   My teachers called me savage. 
   Even as a young child I wondered . . . What does it take to be noticed and looked upon the way these other children are? 
   By the time I reached 7th grade, I realized that if my life was going to change for the better, I was going to have to do it. Nobody else could do it for me. 
   That's when the dream began. I thought of ways to change things for the better--not only for myself but for my people.  
   I dreamed of growing up to be a teacher in a school where every child was treated as sacred and viewed positively, even if they were poor and dirty. 
   I didn't want any child to be made to feel like I did. But I didn't know how hard it would be to reach the realization of my dream. I almost didn't make it. 
   By the time I was 17, I had dropped out of school, moved to California, and had a child. 
   I thought my life was over. 
   But when I moved back to the reservation I made a discovery that literally put my life back together. 
   My sisters were attending Turtle Mountain College, which had just been started on my reservation. I thought that is something I could do, too, so I enrolled. 
   In those days, we didn't even have a campus. There was no building. Some classes met at a local alcohol rehabilitation center in an old hospital building that had been condemned. 
   But to me, it didn't matter much. I was just amazed I could go to college. It was life-changing. 
   My college friends and professors were like family. For the first time in my life I learned about the language, history and culture of my people in a formal education setting. I felt honor and pride begin to well up inside of me. 
   This was so unlike my other school experience where I was told my language and culture were shameful and that Indians weren't equal to others. 
   Attending a tribal college caused me to reach into my inner self to become what I was meant to be--to fight for my rights and not remain a victim of circumstances or of anybody. 
   In fact, I loved college so much that I couldn't stop. I had a dream to fulfill . . . or perhaps some would call it an obsession. 
   This pushed me on to complete my studies at Turtle Mountain College and earn a Doctorate in Education Administration from the University of North Dakota. 
   I've worked in education ever since, from Head Start teacher's aide to college professor. 
   Now I'm realizing my dream of helping Indian children succeed. I am the Office of Indian Education Programs' superintendent working with nine schools, three reservations, and I oversee two educational contracts for two tribal colleges. 
   My life would not have turned out this way were it not for the tribal college on my reservation.  
   This is Loretta De Long. Loretta is a good friend of mine, a remarkable woman, a remarkable educator. She writes a letter--I have not read all of it, there is another page--but she writes a letter that describes in such wonderful, vivid detail the struggle and the difficulty to overcome the obstacles early in her life and the role the tribal college played in her life. 
   The Turtle Mountain Community College is a wonderful place. I have been there many times. I have spoken at their commencement. They now have a new campus. They have people going to college there who never would have had a chance to get a college education, but being able to access the extended family on the reservation for child care and a range of other things, there are people getting education at this tribal college who would not have had the opportunity before. 
   It is not just this college. It is the Sitting Bull College at Fort Yates. I was down there recently and helped them dedicate a new cultural center. There are so many good tribal colleges that are providing opportunity for people such as Loretta. 
   There are people like Loretta who are going to schools of the type I described earlier. They are going to schools with heating registers that look like this. They are going to schools with plumbing that looks like this. That ought not happen. We know better than that. We can do better than that for these kids. It doesn't matter where you are in this country, when you send a kid through a schoolroom door, you ought to believe, as an American, that we want that child to go through the best classroom door in the world; we want that classroom to be one we are proud of. 
   I have mentioned before--and if it is repetitive, tough luck--I have mentioned before Rosie Two Bears, who, in the third grade at Cannonball, looked up at me and said: Mr. Senator, are you going to build us a new school? Boy, do they need it. Rosie Two Bears deserves, as every other young child in this country, the opportunity to go to a school we are proud of--we, as Americans, are proud of. She goes to a school right near an Indian reservation, just off the site of the reservation, with no tax base at all. It is a public school. We need to fix that. 
   The point is, that is sort of a long way of describing almost an obsession of mine--that we can't leave people behind in this country. This country is doing well. I am proud of that. But we can't leave people behind. There are some young kids, especially in this country, who are being left behind, going to schools that are not adequate. There are others who will be left behind if we don't continue to strengthen these tribal colleges. 
   A final comment: The amount of money we provide for tribal colleges with this legislation will provide $3,477 per pupil, and that is an improvement. 
   Let me finish by saying I commend the Senator from Washington and the Senator from West Virginia and others with whom I have worked. But the authorization is at the $6,000 level. And, frankly, in community colleges around the country--community colleges, not tribal colleges--the average support for students is over $6,000 per student. So we are still well short in tribal colleges of doing what we can to make these the kind of institutions we all know they can be.

In his budget request, the Senator from Washington mentioned he did start a process this year to say we must do better. 
   So also, it seems to me, this administration deserves significant credit for the first steps in what I am sure will be a long journey, but one that we must complete. I thank the Senator from Washington and also the Senator from Illinois.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I also wish to say a word today about NBC and Fox, the two television networks that have decided they would not broadcast the Presidential debates live. I think it is deplorable, really, that networks, that use the public airwaves, and have some responsibility here with respect to the public good and public interest, have decided that Presidential debates are not important enough to preempt other programming. 
   I notice that NBC said its local affiliates could make their own judgment. It is not as if NBC, according to Mr. Kennard, the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has not interrupted regular programming previously. In fact, they have interrupted sports programming previously. NBC, last evening, said: We have a contract to show a New York Yankees-Oakland Athletics playoff game. So they did not really want to, on a national basis, show the Presidential debate live. They did allow their affiliates to make that decision. 
   Mr. Kennard points out in an op-ed piece in the New York Times that in 1994 NBC was showing the NBA finals, the basketball finals, but they cut away from the basketball finals to follow that white Bronco that was meandering around the highways of Los Angeles with O.J. Simpson in the backseat. So they were able to cut away from the NBA finals to deal with the O.J. Simpson saga in that white Bronco, we remember so well, but they could not cut away from a playoff game--not the World Series; a playoff game--in baseball to televise the Presidential debate. 
   Fox News is another story. They did not give their affiliates any choice. From their standpoint, ``Dark Angel'' was important last night, entertainment programming. Apparently Fox News' entertainment programming is more important than televising the Presidential debates for the American people. 
   I agree with Bill Kennard, the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. He wrote a piece that says: ``Fox and NBC Renege on a Debt.'' It seems to me, in this country we ought to take this system of ours seriously. Presidential debates are very important. They have a wonderful and hallowed tradition in this country. It seems to me that television networks have a responsibility to the American people to provide live coverage of those debates. 
   I regret that NBC did not. And I would say to the NBC affiliate in Washington, DC, they decided to carry the debate. Thank you for doing that. Good for them. But Fox News did not give any of their affiliates that choice. I think they have made the wrong choice.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   October 4, 1999: 
   Darius Bradley, 18, Baltimore, MD; Joseph Booker, 21, Chicago, IL; Vincent Dobson, 22, Baltimore, MD; Frank Garner, 22, Kansas City, MO; Larry D. Hadley, 43, Madison, WI; Joseph Hall, 20, Detroit, MI; Arthur Harris, 39, Houston, TX; Kendall Hawks, 18, Baltimore, MD; Clarence Jackson, 21, New Orleans, LA; Derrick Jacque, 24, New Orleans, LA; Jasul Johnson, 23, Philadelphia, PA; Charlotte Lindsey, 50, Memphis, TN; James McClinton, 24, Chicago, IL; Richard Mitchell, 51, Detroit, MI; Shawn Moore, 25, New Orleans, LA; Cedric Outler, 41, Miami-Dade County, FL; Zawakie Walker, 23, Detroit, MI; Darieus Washington, 31, Baltimore, MD; William Wilson, 24, Baltimore, MD; and Unidentified male, 72, Nashville, TN. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Administration recently launched a new website, www.firstgov.gov. That website is the first all-government portal and will offer one stop information from over 20,000 separate federal websites. This promises to be a great tool. Throughout the country people will be able to download tax forms, read up on the status of legislation, better understand the Social Security system. But Mr. President, meaningful access to all of the important information depends on what side of the Digital Divide you find yourself. To benefit from websites like firstgov, you must have a computer and understand how to use it, and you must have an Internet connection with speeds fast enough to search databases, view graphics and download documents. 
   As the demand for high speed Internet access grows, numerous companies are responding in areas of dense population. While urban America is quickly gaining high speed access, rural America is being left behind. Ensuring that all Americans have the technological capability is essential in this digital age. It is not only an issue of fairness, but it is also an issue of economic survival. 
   To remedy the information gap between urban and rural America, I along with Senator DASCHLE introduced S. 2307, the Rural Broadband Enhancement Act, which gives new authority to the Rural Utilities Service to make low interest loans to companies that are deploying broadband technology to rural America. 
   The Rural Utilities Service has helped before; it can help again. When we were faced with electrifying all of the country, we enacted the Rural Electrification Act. When telephone service was only being provided to well-populated communities, we expanded the Rural Electrification Act and created the Rural Utilities Service to oversee rural telephone deployment. The equitable deployment of broadband services is only the next step in keeping American connected, and our legislation would ensure that. 
   If we fail to act, rural America will be left behind once again. As the economy moves further and further towards online transactions and communications, rural America must be able to participate. They must be able to start their own online business if they so desire and access information about government services efficiently.  
   I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to address this problem and to bring meaningful data access to all parts of this country.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been listening to the discussion today on the floor of the Senate about process and procedure and where we find ourselves near the end of this session. I will speak to the comments made earlier today by my colleague from West Virginia, Senator BYRD, and perhaps speak a bit about the comments made by my colleague, Senator CONRAD, especially about fiscal policy. 
   First, let me talk about process. As I do so, let me acknowledge that it cannot be an easy job to try to schedule and arrange and deal with the House and the Senate, and pass all the legislation, authorization and appropriations bills, that are necessary. A lot of people over many years have had the responsibility of doing that and many people aspire to that responsibility. One of the circumstances of control is that those who win the most seats in the Senate and the House then become chairmen and leaders, majority leaders, chairmen of committees; and the responsibility of having those jobs, of course, means bearing the burden of having to schedule and trying to arrange to make certain that Congress  works the way it ought to work and passes the legislation on time and in regular order. 
   It is not an easy job. My colleague, Senator BYRD, who spoke earlier today, served as a distinguished majority leader in this Congress. He also served as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He has had the responsibility to try to find a way to get this Senate to move and get it to move on time and discharge its duties on time. Many others have done so, as well, including the distinguished Senator, Mr. Mitchell, most recently, as well as Senator Dole, and so many others over many years, going back to Lyndon Johnson, and decades and decades before that. 
   In this Congress, the 106th Congress, things have changed some. What has changed, it seems to me, is we have missed most of the deadlines. There doesn't seem to be a cogent plan by which we will meet the deadlines or meet our responsibilities. I want to show some charts that describe what has happened this year. The red on this calendar shows the number of days the Senate was not in session. As shown, a fair part of January, February, and March, a fair part of a number of months of this year, were days in which we had no session in the Senate. 
   There is some reason for some of that. We have work periods, when Senators go back to their States and meet with their constituents. That is understandable. That has always been the case. However, there needs to be some balance with respect to the number of days we are working here and the amount of time that is available to pass legislation that must be passed. 
   This is the situation as we near the first of October: The Senate has been in session only 115 days this year; only 115 days have we been in session. Of those 115 days, 34 of those days included no votes at all. In most cases, not much was done, perhaps only morning business for most of the day. Of the 115 days in session, there were no votes on 34 of those days. In fact, there were only three Mondays during this entire year in which there were any votes. For practical purposes, we don't have a Monday in the Senate. On the issue of Fridays, there were only six Fridays in this year in which there were votes. 
   What can be concluded from this is we have a Senate that really isn't in session much on Mondays or Fridays. Then the 
   question is, what is left? Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays--except for weeks when the Senate isn't in session at all. That is what results in 115 days in session, 34 of which there weren't any votes. 
   Now we come to the end of this fiscal year with a lot of legislation yet to be completed. Only 2 of the 13 appropriations bills have been signed by President Clinton. That means 11 of them are as of yet incomplete. In September, we have only had votes on one Monday. This is the period of time in which we are trying to finish everything. We have had no votes on Fridays in September. It is difficult to get all of this work done, appropriations bills and other measures that need to get passed, if we are not in session. 
   I mentioned before we have 2 appropriations bills that are complete; 11 of them are, as of yet, incomplete. October 1 is the date by which the President is to have signed all of the appropriations bills. It is the first day of the new fiscal year. What we have is a circumstance where most of the work that needs to be done by that moment is not completed. 
   I serve on the Appropriations Committee. I serve with a very distinguished chairman of that committee, Senator STEVENS. I am not coming to the floor to be critical of Senator STEVENS. I think he does an extraordinary job. I am serving on the agriculture appropriations subcommittee. The chairman of that subcommittee is Senator COCHRAN from Mississippi. I am not here to be critical of Senator COCHRAN. I think he is an extraordinary Senator. I think it is a privilege to work with Senator STEVENS and Senator COCHRAN. I think they do an extraordinary job. They are Republicans; I am a Democrat. I think they are good Senators. 
   I am not here to say they haven't done their work. I am saying this process, the fashion in which the House and the Senate have worked this year, has just not worked at all. It has become tangled in a morass of difficulty that has prevented Members from doing what we need to do. 
   We have discovered someone put bills together that in some cases have not been considered by the Senate; in other cases they have not been the subject of a conference, and marry up various pieces of legislation, bring them to the floor and say: Well, let's just have one vote on this omnibus bill that has two or three different appropriations bills in it. 
   That might sound efficient if you haven't done your work and you reach the end of the fiscal year, but efficiency is not what protecting the interests of all Senators or the interests of all Americans is about. The process by which we are able to debate public issues in this Senate, and by which we are able to get the best of what everyone has to offer, the best of the ideas, and the competition from debate, is a process in which we bring a piece of legislation to the floor, an appropriations bill to the floor, and say, all right, you come from different areas of the country; you come with different philosophies; you come representing different constituencies; now have at this. 
   This is what we have tried to do in the committee. If Members have better ideas, let's hear them. If Members have the votes to convince the majority of the Senate to support their idea, let's see. Just bring these ideas to the floor of the Senate. Have votes on them. In that manner, we develop public policy. Wide open debate is the essence of democracy. That is the way democracy works. 
   An old friend of mine back home used to love politics. He used to say: They don't weigh votes; they count votes. 
   That is the way the Senate should work: Have the debate, have the vote, count it up, and the winner wins. That becomes the process of making public policy. 
   We have a long and distinguished history in this body. I have learned a lot listening to Senator BYRD over the many years, talking about the history of the Senate. His history goes back to the Roman Senate and beyond. One cannot help but serve here and understand there is a tradition, a tradition that we must respect as we conduct our business on behalf of the American people. We are not here by ourselves. We are not standing just in our shoes. We are here because our constituents have said: Represent us in this democracy; go to the Senate and give it the best you have, adding your voice to the votes that come from the hills and valleys of this country, and participate in the making of public policy. 
   The process we are seeing now all too often prevents that from happening. I am on a subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee that I am reading about every day in the newspapers. I am a conferee, in fact. But there has been no conference. 
   Two days ago, I got a call from somebody saying it is going to be brought to the floor of the House and the Senate tomorrow. I said, ``What is?'' They said, ``A conference report.'' I said, ``I am a conferee and there has not been a conference. How can there be a conference report?'' 
   But that is what is happening around here all too often. I think we need to get back on track and decide there is a process we should respect, a process that represents regular order and a process that protects the rights of all Senators to participate in the making of public policy. 
   What is the agenda here? Why are we so passionate about this, talking about this process? Because the process allows everyone in this Chamber to come here and witness for the public policy they want, to try to keep this country ahead. 
   Let me go through a list of them briefly. Some of my colleagues have done so. My colleague from North Dakota, Senator CONRAD, just talked about fiscal policy. The process, if followed the way tradition would have us follow it, would allow us, in a year such as this, to grab ahold of this fiscal policy issue and evaluate what do we do. This is a new time. We now have expected surpluses in our future. What a remarkable change from the understanding that every year we were going to have a deficit and it was going to continue to grow, to mushroom out of control. All of a sudden that is gone. We have a new reality. We have fiscal policy surpluses.  
   I have told audiences from time to time the two enduring truths about political existence in the last 40 years or so in our public lives, the two enduring truths that overshadowed or at least represented a foundation for all of the decisions were: No. 1, we had a cold war with the Soviet Union, and, No. 2, we had budget deficits that just kept growing. Those were the two enduring truths that had an impact on everything else we did. 
   Think of this: Those two truths are now gone. There is no Soviet Union. The cold war is over. And there is no budget deficit. What a remarkable change in a short period. 
   So my colleague came to the floor a few moments ago and talked about fiscal policy given these new truths, the fact we may have budget surpluses in the years ahead. The question then is, What do we do with them? So we need to have a debate about that. Some come to the floor of the Senate and say: We know what to do with expected surpluses. Even before the surpluses exist, let's get rid of these surpluses by providing very large tax cuts and let's make sure the largest tax cuts go to those who have the largest incomes in this country. So they come to the floor with $1 trillion, or $1.3 trillion, in tax cuts over the next 10 years. This is before we even have the surpluses. Economists who can't remember their home telephone numbers tell us they know what is going to happen 3, 5, 7 and 10 years from now. 
   I come down on the side on which my colleague comes down; that is, we ought to be mighty conservative and cautious about this. For the first step, maybe we ought to pay down some of the Federal debt. If you run up the debt during tough times, what greater gift could you give to America's children than to reduce the Federal debt during good times? That is step No. 1. 
   Step No. 2, sure, if there is room, let's provide some tax cuts in a way that invests in opportunities for America's families, working families. Would it not be a nice thing for those people who are reaching up and struggling to afford to be able to send their kids to college to say: The cost of sending 
   your kids to college you can deduct on your income tax; you can deduct the cost of tuition. What a good investment that would be, and what a nice way to have a tax cut in a way that incentivizes families to send their child to school: Reduce the debt, provide some tax cuts in ways that say to working families, we are going to try to help you. 
   Then make some other investments. It is not a circumstance that everything that goes out of here is spent. Some of it is invested. Our future, 10 years, 20, 40, 60 years from now, is going to depend on what we invest in that future today. I mentioned education, but there are more issues than just education. 
   The question of fiscal policy--what do we do, and how do we do it--is a very important question. The way we get to that and have the votes on it and have an expression of what we want to do, what the American people want to do, is have all the ideas here and vote on them. That is awfully inconvenient for some because we have to cast all these votes and some people want to just vote on the things they want and prevent the things other people want. It is inconvenient. That is democracy. Sure, it is inconvenient to give the other person their opportunity to bring their ideas to the floor of the Senate, but that is democracy. Democracy is not always convenient. It is not always efficient. It is so far above any other form of government known to mankind we can hardly describe the difference, but it may be inconvenient. 
   The issue that has been raised today about process is to say that inconvenience is actually designed into this system, to make sure we do not move rapidly, we do not move with haste, to ensure we do not move riding on a wave of passion that will require us or persuade us to do things we will later regret. That is the way the Senate was developed. Nobody ever suggested the way the Senate was going to react to things, or the way the Senate was going to discuss public policy, was going to be efficient. In fact, those framers, Madison, Mason, Franklin, and so many others--Thomas Jefferson, who contributed from abroad when he was serving this country--did not want a system that created a Senate that was efficient so, in an afternoon, you could grab a big public policy and decide you would each get 10 minutes, have a little vote on a couple of amendments, and that was it because we needed it to be convenient for us. 
   No, they created a far different system. This body has been known from time to time as the body in which the great debates of democracy take place. But I fear that is changing because some, I think, do not understand the value of debate. Debate is never a waste of time. Debate is always a contributor to knowledge. Debate, from the best to the least of those who come to public service, contributes in some way to the whole of democracy. 
   I have been to the floor of the Senate many times talking about another issue on the agenda. I just talked about fiscal policy. There are other things I want to get done. One area where my colleague and I may disagree from time to time--some say you should not be repetitious in trying to push your agenda. In some cases I think repetition is necessary. For example, minimum wage. We have a lot of families out there who are working at the bottom of the economic ladder. In fact, a report came out 2 days ago that said we have 3 million people working 40 hours a week who are living in poverty in this country. 
   There are 3 million workers working 40 hours a week, full time, living in poverty. Do you know why? Because they are working right at the bottom of the economic ladder. 
   Who is out there in the hallways, clogging the hallways of the U.S. Capitol, saying: Do you know what my business is on Thursday here in the U.S. Capitol? I am here on behalf of the low-income folks. I am here on behalf of the voiceless, those not too involved in politics because they are struggling just to work, to make the minimum wage, trying to get home and feed their kids. The hallways are not flooded with people representing those folks. These hallways are crowded with people representing the privileged, people representing the largest corporations in America, people representing those who have done very well in this country, at the upper income scales. They have great representation. 
   Good for them. Everybody deserves that in a democracy. But my point is, when it comes time to debate public policy on a range of issues and it comes time to discuss the minimum wage, who stands for those families? The people who work the night shift, the people who work the night shift in the hospital for minimum wages, who are moving the bed pans around and changing the beds and helping people up and out and walking around--who is here speaking for them? The people who are working in the convenience stores at 2 a.m. for a minimum wage, who are trying to raise a family and do not have the skills to get a better job and are trapped in one of these cycles of poverty--who is here speaking for them? 
   The hallways are not crowded, in this Capitol Building, with people paid to represent those at the bottom of the economic ladder. I think from time to time it is important, even if rebuffed once, twice, or six times in a year, to say increasing the minimum wage for those who are struggling at the bottom of the economic ladder is important; if we do not get it the first time, we have a vote the second time; if we don't get it the second time, we have a vote the third time. 
   Yes, that is inconvenient, too, but it seems to me the rules of this system also allow for those who are passionately interested in pushing for those who do not have much voice in this political system. 
   Patients' Bill of Rights is another issue that gets caught in this process. Speaking of process, the Patients' Bill of Rights is the most remarkable piece of legislation. If I can for a moment describe the Patients' Bill of Rights as an issue and describe it through the experiences of people who have been gripped in the vice of a system that does not work for them, a woman who is hiking in the Shenandoah Mountains falls off a 40- or 50-foot cliff, breaks multiple bones, and falls into a coma. She is taken to a hospital in an ambulance, lying on a gurney in a coma with very severe injuries. She miraculously recovers, only to find that her HMO and managed care organization sends her a bill saying: We are not going to cover your emergency room treatment because you did not get prior approval for emergency room treatment. 
   This is a woman hauled into the emergency room in a coma suffering  serious injuries from a massive fall and told: You did not get prior approval for emergency room treatment. 
   Or little Ethan Bedrick; Ethan Bedrick is a young boy. This is a picture of young Ethan. He was told he had a 50-percent chance of walking by age 5. He was born with pretty severe disabilities from cerebral palsy. He had a 50-percent chance of walking by age 5. He needed rehabilitative therapy, and his managed care organization said having a 50-percent chance of walking by age 5 is ``insignificant'' and, therefore, we deny coverage for the therapy. 
   Think of that. It is insignificant for a young boy to have a 50-percent chance of being able to walk and, therefore, the managed care organization says: We deny coverage. 
   Is there a Patients' Bill of Rights that ought to provide rights to Ethan Bedrick, provide rights to the woman who falls off a cliff and is hauled into a hospital unconscious? Or, if I may take one more moment to describe the woman who testified at a hearing Senator HARRY REID and I had in the State of Nevada, a mother who stood up and told us that her son was dead, 16 years old; he had leukemia. 
   At the moment when he needed the treatment that would give him a chance to survive this leukemia, the HMO said no. Only later--much later--did they finally say yes, and it was too late; he was too weak. She held up his colored picture at this hearing and, through tears, she told us about her son. Her son, Chris Roe, died October 12, 1999, on his 16th birthday. I will never forget the moment when his mother, Susan, held up a picture and said: My son looked up at me from his bed and said: Mom, how can they do this to a kid like me? 
   He was denied the treatment that would have given him the opportunity--not a guarantee, but the opportunity--to deal with his cancer, and he died. 
   This young boy was told to fight his cancer and then fight his insurance company at the same time; take on both folks: You go ahead wage this cancer fight, but then you are going to have to fight us to get coverage for the things you need that might give you a chance at life. 
   The question is: Mom, how can they do this to a 16-year-old kid like me? And his mother, through tears, held up this colored picture of this young, 16-year-old boy and asked: How could they have done this? 
   Should Congress pass a Patients' Bill of Rights? What about the process there? The House of Representatives passed a bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights, a real one, and sent it to conference. This Senate has a right to do this. They passed what I call a ``patients' bill of goods,'' an empty vessel, and sent it to conference so the Senate could say: We passed a Patients' Bill of Rights. But we did not.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia is very generous. Let me conclude by saying something I think is important. I came to the floor because the Senator from West Virginia is someone for whom I have great respect. He was talking about the process, the method by which the Senate is supposed to work. He has been here much longer than I have. He knows the history of the Senate far better than I do. I have great respect for that. 
   He did not come to the floor--I listened carefully to his discussion this morning--and I did not come to the floor to be critical of others. It is a tough job running this Senate. I certainly did not come to the floor to say that the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee has not done his job. I happen to think Senator STEVENS is an outstanding Senator, Senator COCHRAN, and so many others with whom I have served. So I do not come here with the purpose of casting aspersions. 
   But I just come to the floor because I fear that what is preventing us from getting to where I want the Senate to get to, and that is to have a full debate, and good, strong open votes on the issues I care passionately about. We are thwarted from doing that. In fact, we have had bills brought to the floor of the Senate and had cloture motions to shut off debate before the debate began, cloture motions to shut off amendments before the first amendment was offered. That thwarts this process. Back home they would say that is throwing a wrench in the crank case. That just shuts it all down. It is not the way it ought to work. 
   I think it is a privilege every day to come to work here. I grew up in a town of 300 people, had a high school class of 9, and never in my life thought I would meet another Senator, I suppose, let alone serve in the Senate. I think it is a privilege every day to come here. 
   But the reason I think it is a privilege is because I bring, as most of my colleagues do, an agenda of passion to make changes that I think will improve this country. I might be wrong in some of it. Maybe so. But I want my day. If I can persuade enough Members of this Senate to vote on the things I care about, then if I win, I win. If I don't, maybe I learned something from the debate. I am willing to lose. But I am not willing to lose the opportunity to have a full debate and a vote on the things that I and the constituents I represent in North Dakota care deeply about. That is the point. I am not willing to lose that opportunity. The process in this Senate increasingly begins to shut those opportunities down. 
   The Senator from West Virginia came the Senate to say, let's not do that. Let's not do it for Republicans or Democrats. Let's not do it out of concern for this Senate, its proud history and its future. Let's not do that. Let's get back to the way we are supposed to debate public policy in this Chamber. 
   I commend the Senator from West Virginia and my colleague, the Senator from Nevada, and others, who have spoken today. I hope we can all work together and get the best of what each can bring to this Chamber in the debate about public policy. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise in support as a cosponsor of S. 3116. The purpose of this legislation is to prevent molasses stuffed with sugar from being allowed into this country. 
   As others have stated, the molasses in question is stuffed with South American sugar in Canada, and then transported into the United States. The sugar is then spun out of this concoction and sold in this country while the molasses is sent right back across the border to be stuffed with more sugar--and the smuggling cycle starts over again. 
   This practice is a blatant circumvention of our tariff quota. The sole purpose of this process is to smuggle excess sugar into the United States, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which will put an end to this loophole.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in recent days we have heard a lot about various proposals that would allow for the reimportation of prescription drugs. Patients pay more for the prescription drugs in the United States than anywhere else in the world. That is just not right. The Senate passed a proposal that Senator JEFFORDS and I authored that would allow for the reimportation of prescription drugs as long as certain steps are taken to ensure safety for American consumers.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, during the first few months of the 106th Congress in early 1999, I introduced a pesticide harmonization bill--S. 394. Today, I am introducing a revised version of that legislation. The need for this legislation has not changed. 
   Last year, I pointed out that when the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement came into effect, part of the understanding on agriculture was that our two nations were going to move rapidly toward the harmonization of pesticide regulations. However, we have entered a new decade--and century, no less--and relatively little progress in harmonization has been accomplished that is meaningful to family farmers. 
   Since this trade agreement took effect, the pace of Canadian spring and durum wheat, and barley exports to the United States have grown from a barely noticeable trickle into annual floods of imported grain into our markets. Over the years, I have described many factors that have produced this unfair trade relationship and unlevel playing field between farmers of our two nations. The failure to achieve harmonization in pesticides between the United States and Canada compounds this ongoing trade problem. 
   Our farmers are concerned that agricultural pesticides that are not available in the United States are being utilized by farmers in Canada to produce wheat, barley, and other agricultural commodities that are subsequently imported and consumed in the United States. They rightfully believe that it is unfair to import commodities produced with agricultural pesticides that are not available to U.S. producers. They believe that it is not in the interests of consumers or producers to allow such imports. However, it is not just a difference in availability of agricultural pesticides between our two countries, but also in the pricing of these chemicals. 
   Just last spring, our farmers were denied the right to bring a pesticide across the border that was cleared for use in our country, but was not available locally because the company who manufactures this product chose not to sell it here. They were selling a more expensive version of the product here. The simple fact is, this company was using our environmental protection  laws as a means to extract a higher price from our farmers even though the cheaper product sold in Canada is just as safe. This simply is not right. 
   I have pointed out, time and time again, the fact is that there are significant differences in prices being paid for essentially the same pesticide by farmers in our two countries. In fact, in a recent survey, farmers in the United States were paying between 117 percent and 193 
   percent more than Canadian farmers for a number of pesticides. This was after adjusting for differences in currency exchange rates at that time. 
   The farmers in my state are simply fed up with what is going on. They see grain flooding across the border, while they are unable to access the more inexpensive production inputs available in our ``free trade'' environment. And I might add, this grain coming into our country has been treated with these products which our farmers are denied access to. This simply must end. 
   As I stated earlier, today, I am introducing a new version of legislation that would take an important step in providing equitable treatment for U.S. farmers in the pricing of agricultural pesticides. And I want to point out what has taken place since introduction of the original pesticide harmonization bill--or maybe I should say--what has not taken place. 
   I wrote the chairman of the Agriculture Committee on more than one occasion requesting hearings about the original version of this legislation, but to no avail. I was disappointed, to say the least. Especially, as I stated, since the need for this legislation has not disappeared. On the contrary, it is still a hot issue along our northern border with Canada. 
   This bill would only deal with agricultural chemicals that are identical or substantially similar. It only deals with pesticides that have already undergone rigorous review processes and whose formulations have been registered and approved for use in both countries by the respective regulatory agencies. 
   The bill would establish a procedure by which states may apply for and receive an Environmental Protection Agency label for agricultural chemicals sold in Canada that are identical or substantially similar to agricultural chemicals used in the United States. Thus, U.S. producers and suppliers could purchase such chemicals in Canada for use in the United States. The need for this bill is created by pesticide companies which use chemical labeling laws to protect their marketing and pricing structures, rather than protecting the public interest. In their selective labeling of identical or substantially similar products across the border they are able to extract unjustified profits from American farmers, and create unlevel pricing fields between our two countries. 
   This bill is one legislative step in the process of full harmonization of pesticides between our two nations. It is designed specifically to address the problem of pricing differentials on chemicals that are currently available in both countries. We need to take this step, so that we can begin the process of creating a level playing field between farmers of our two countries. This bill would make harmonization a reality for those pesticides in which their actual selling price is the only real difference.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was listening to the discussion among my colleagues, Senator CRAIG, Senator BYRD, and Senator DASCHLE was here earlier. I thought it would be useful to discuss the concept that has been discussed. In the end, it does not matter  what is said one way or the other about who is at fault for this or for delaying that. The question people ask at the end of a legislative session is, Are things a little better in this country because those folks met and discussed things in the United States, what works, what does not, what we can do and cannot do? 
   If the answer to that is yes, none of this matters much. But the Senator from West Virginia, in responding to some discussions earlier by the Senator from Idaho, makes a very interesting point. I have not been here nearly as long as the Senator from West Virginia has been. 
   This is a calendar which shows this year, the year 2000. The red days on this calendar are the days the Senate was not in session. We will see the Senate was not in session a fair part of the year. In fact, another chart will show the number of days we have been in session. It is now the end of September, and we have been in session 115 days out of all of this year. Of those 115 days we were in session, on 34 of them, there were no votes at all. So we have been in session 115 days, but on 34 of those days, there have been no votes. 
   There have been only two Mondays in this entire year in which the Senate has voted, and if I may continue with this chart presentation, there have been only six Fridays in all of this year on which the Senate has voted. Out of 13 appropriations bills, only two have been signed into law by the President. In the month of September, when we must try to finish the remaining 11 appropriations bills, we have not had any votes on Mondays, except for possibly today if we have a vote later today. And there have been no votes on Fridays in the month of September. 
   I thought it would be useful to describe what is going on here. Let me read this statement from my friend and colleague, the Senate majority leader, earlier in the year. He said:  
   We were out of town two months and our approval rating went up 11 points. I think I've got this thing figured out.  
   I know Senator LOTT wants this place to work and work well. I mentioned the other day to Senator LOTT that there is a television commercial about these grizzled, leather-faced cowboys on horseback herding cats. It is actually a funny commercial because they even get those cats in a river and try to move them across the river. These big cowboys with these leather coats, the big dusters they wear for storms, are holding these little stray cats. 
   I said to the Senate majority leader: That reminds me a little perhaps of the job you and others have of keeping things moving around here. 
   The Senator from West Virginia makes a very important point, and I want to outline it. We have had plenty of time to get to work to pass this legislation. We just have not been in session in the Senate much of the year. Frankly, most people run for the privilege of serving in the Senate because they have an agenda, too, and they want to offer amendments. They want to offer ideas that come from their constituencies that say: Here is what we think should be done to improve life in this country; here is what we think should be done to deal with education, health care, crime, and a whole range of issues. 
   When there are circumstances like we have seen this year where legislation does not even, in some cases, come to the floor of the Senate, but instead goes right to conference, it says to Senators: You have no right to offer any amendments. That does not make sense. 
   The reason I came over, I say to the Senator from West Virginia, is that I heard the discussion by my colleague from Idaho saying Senator DASCHLE is to blame for all of this. Nonsense. Winston Churchill used to say the greatest thrill in the world is to be shot at and missed. The Senator from Idaho has just given all of us a thrill. But Senator DASCHLE is at fault? 
   Senator DASCHLE does not schedule this Senate. We are not in charge. I wish we were, but we are not in charge. We are the minority party, not the majority party. I hope that will change very soon. 
   What Senator DASCHLE said is clear. In fact, he said it again last week: If I had been majority leader, and I am not, today would be a day in which we take up an appropriations bill and we would be in session until we finish that bill and everybody has a chance to offer amendments. If it takes 24 hours, then we will not get a lot of sleep, but we will finish that bill. 
   Senator DASCHLE said: My preference is to take these bills up individually. I would be willing to do an appropriations bill a day--long days, sure; tough days, absolutely. But he said let's do them. Bring them to the floor. Open them up for amendment. Let's have debates, offer amendments, and then let's vote. Democracy, after all, is about voting. It is not always convenient. 
   The Senator from West Virginia had a reputation for not always making it very convenient for people because he has insisted that appropriations bills be brought to the Senate floor and that they be debated fully and that everybody have the opportunity to bring their amendments to the floor of the Senate, have a debate, and then have a vote. 
   Again, sometimes that is difficult. People want to be here and there and everywhere else on Fridays and Mondays and parts of the week. But the fact is, we are now in September, towards the end of the month, and 11 of the 13 appropriations bills are not yet signed. I am a conferee on at least two of them for which no conference has been held. 
   I might mention to the Senator from West Virginia, I think perhaps you were referring earlier to the Agriculture appropriations bill. The House passed it July 11. The Senate passed it July 20. I am a conferee. There has been no conference. The House has not even appointed its conferees. In today's edition of the CQ Daily Monitor, one of my colleagues is quoted as saying that ``aides'' have worked out a compromise in the Agriculture spending conference report, and it will come to the floor on Wednesday. 
   Now, that is a surprise to those of us who are supposed to be conferees. This is a bill on which there has been no conference, and someone in the majority party is saying aides have worked this all out, and it is going to come to the floor of the Senate on Wednesday. Boy, I tell you, this system is flat out broken. That is not the way this system ought to work. Aides do the work without a conference?

   Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from West Virginia as well. It should never, ever be considered old-fashioned to have the Senate work in a manner in which it was intended to work; that is, to have debates and to have votes. That is not old-fashioned. That is a timeless truth about how democracy ought to work. 
   A timeless truth here is that we will get the best for the American people by soliciting all of the best ideas that come from every corner of this Chamber. Those ideas come from every corner of our country. People come here not for their own sake; they come to represent the people of West Virginia and Maine and California and my State of North Dakota. The development of all of those ideas--through debate, through the offering of amendments, and so on--represents what I think can contribute best to America's well-being.  
   There are so many things that I wanted to do this year that we are not doing. There is so little time left. We have a farm program that does not work. Families out on the land--family farmers are the best in America--are just struggling mightily. The farm program does not work. It ought to be repealed and replaced with one that does. That is not rocket science. Europe does it. We can do it.

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the Senator from West Virginia will recall that he told me a story some long while ago about this desk that I occupy in the Senate. This desk, as do all of these desks, has an interesting history. This desk was the desk of former Senator Robert La Follette from Wisconsin. It was Senator BYRD who informed me of something that happened 91 years ago, I believe, in late May in the year 1909. 
   Senator La Follette was standing at this desk--this desk may not have been in this exact spot, but it was this desk--involved in a filibuster. 
   During those days, this Senate had a lot of aggressive, robust debates. Senator La Follette was a very forceful man with strong feelings, and he stood at this desk engaged in a filibuster. As the story goes, apparently someone sent up a glass of eggnog for him to sip on during the filibuster. He brought that glass of eggnog to his lips and drank then spat and began to scream that he had been poisoned. He thought he had tasted poison in this glass of eggnog. The glass was sent away--I believe this was in 1909--to have it evaluated. They discovered someone had, in fact, put poison in his drink. They never found the culprit. 
   I think of stories such as this one about this Chamber, what a wonderful tradition in the Senate of people who feel so strongly. We should not diminish the role of the Senate as the place of great debates. 
   I served in the House. It is a wonderful institution. There are 435 Members. There they package their debates through the Rules Committee. They say: You get 1 minute, you get 2 minutes, you get 5 minutes. We will entertain these 10 amendments, and that is all. And if you are not on the list, you are not there. That is the way the House works because that is the only way it could work with 435 Members. But the Senate was never designed to work that way. It was never intended to work that way. The Senate was to be the center of the great debates, debates that are unfettered by time, unfettered by restriction. Is that in some ways inefficient? Yes. Is it cumbersome, sometimes inconvenient? Sure. It is all of that. But it is also the hallmark of the center of democracy. We ought not ever dilute that, nor should we ever dilute the opportunity of every single person who comes to sit and at times stand in the Senate to represent his or her constituents to make the strongest case they can make on whatever the issue is that day.

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me try to summarize what brought me to the floor. 
   A colleague arrived on the Senate floor and said the reason we are in the circumstance in which, at nearly the end of a legislative session and only 2 of 13 appropriations bills have been completed by the Congress, and not much of the major legislation we had hopes for in the 106th Congress has been passed, is that Senator DASCHLE is stalling, causing problems, is just not going to wash. 
   It is sheer nonsense to suggest somehow that the minority leader of the Senate is determining the schedule of the Senate. There are times when one has to be repetitious in the Senate. 
   Let me give an example: increasing the minimum wage. When it comes time for increasing the tax benefits for the highest income groups in America, we have people rushing to the floor, standing up and talking about tax cuts. Good for them. If you happen to be in the top one-tenth of 1 percent of the income earners, there are people here coming to the floor of the Senate saying: Let's give you a big tax cut. They won't call it that. They will say it is for the little guy. But just unwrap the package and see what is there. 
   If you are in the top one-tenth of 1 percent of the income earners, good for you. You have great representation in the Senate. At least on a half dozen occasions this year, you had people coming over to vote for big tax cuts for you. 
   But what if you are at the bottom of the economic ladder? What if you are a single mother, working the midnight shift for the minimum wage, trying to make ends meet, trying to pay the rent, trying to buy food and see if there is any way you can scratch out money to have health insurance for your children? What about you? Who is rushing to the Senate floor to say perhaps we ought to provide a small increase in the minimum wage? 
   An increase in the minimum wage doesn't happen very often. Time and time again, we have tried to address the needs by increasing the minimum wage. It hasn't gotten done. We are near the end of the session. Is it repetitious to bring it back up? You bet it is. But some of us intend to be repetitious when it means standing up for the rights of the people at the bottom of the economic ladder who are working hard but who are losing ground because the cost of living is going up and their wages are not. 
   How about the issue of trying to keep guns out of the hands of criminals? Let me describe that problem in this session of the Congress. Most everybody agrees--certainly the law requires--that we prevent criminals from having access to guns. If you have been convicted of a felony, you don't have a right to own a gun. The second amendment doesn't apply to you, but it applies to law-abiding citizens. Criminals have no right to have a gun. 
   The NRA and virtually everybody else has agreed that we ought to have an instant check system where, if somebody wants to buy a gun, there name will be run through a computer check to see if this person is a convicted felon. If in running this check you discover the person has previously been convicted of a felony, that person has no right to a gun. At every gun store in this country, when you go in to buy a gun, that happens. 
   Everybody supports that--the National Rifle Association, Republicans, and Democrats; everybody supports that. But there is a loophole. If you don't go to a gun store but instead go to a Saturday gun show, there is no requirement when you purchase a gun at that Saturday gun show that they run your name through an instant check. 
   A fair number of guns are passing from one hand to another on Saturdays and Sundays at gun shows with no determination of whether the person buying the gun is a felon. So we in the Congress pass a provision that closes that gun show loophole. Is it erratic? Not at all. It is very simple, common sense. It says no matter where you buy a gun, a gun store or a gun show, your name has to be run through an instant check to determine whether you are a convicted felon. If you are not, you can buy the gun. If you are a convicted criminal, you can't because you don't have a right to a gun. That bill passed the Senate by one vote. It went into a piece of legislation and went to conference and never came back out. 
   A week or so ago, an appropriations subcommittee was considering legislation that would have allowed the introduction of an amendment to close that loophole once again because that provision is on a bill that apparently is not going to move in this session. This would have provided an opportunity to offer an amendment to close the gun show loophole. Instead of allowing that, guess what? They took that appropriations subcommittee bill and moved it directly to conference. It never came to the floor of the Senate. Those who would have offered the amendment to close the loophole were never offered the opportunity to do that. That is not the regular process in the Senate, not the way things ought to be done. 
   So there are reasons to insist on some of these issues from time to time. We wish, for example, that on many of these days when we weren't in session, we would have been in session. Perhaps we would have finished most of the appropriations bills. Perhaps we would have been able to reach agreement on issues such as education. 
   We have had a fairly significant debate, over many months in the 106th Congress, on the issue of education. We know that smaller class size means better instruction and better education. We know that 1 teacher with 30 students is less able to teach those students than 1 teacher with 15 students. So we have a proposal to help in that regard by helping school districts and States have the resources to hire more teachers. Yet we are not able to get that 
   completed because there is controversy in this Congress about that issue. 
   There are also schools in this country that are crumbling. Anybody who visits any number of schools will recognize that there are a lot of schools in this country that were built after the Second World War when the folks came back from that war and got married and had families. They built schools in a prodigious quantity all across the country. School after school was built in the fifties, and now many of those schools are 50 years old and in desperate need of repair. 
   Every Republican and Democrat, man or woman, ought to understand that when we send a kid through a schoolroom door, as I have described Rosie Two Bears going through a third grade door the day I was visiting her school, we ought to have some pride in that school, some understanding that every young ``Rosie'' who is walking through the school doors is walking into a classroom that is the best we can provide, that will offer that child the best opportunity for an education we can offer that child. 
   But I have been to schools where 150 kids have 1 water fountain and 2 toilets. I have been to schools where kids are sitting at desks 1 inch apart, and there is no opportunity to plug in computers and get to the Internet because the school is partially condemned and they don't have access to that technology; they don't have a football field, a track, or physical education facilities. I have been to those schools. We can do better than that. There are  ways for us to help school districts modernize, rehabilitate, and rebuild some of those schools, and proposals to do that have largely fallen on deaf ears in this Congress. 
   Prescription drugs: We know what we should do on that issue. We know life-saving drugs only save lives if you can afford to access those drugs. The current Medicare program doesn't provide a prescription drug benefit. 12 percent of our population are senior citizens and they consume one-third of all the prescription drugs. The cost of prescription drugs increased 16 percent last year alone. It is hard when you go to the homes of older Americans or go to meetings and have them come talk to you about the price of prescription drugs and see their eyes fill with tears and their chins begin to quiver as they talk about having diabetes, heart troubles, and other problems. They say they have been to the doctor and the doctor prescribed drugs, but they can't afford them. They ask, ``What shall we do?'' It happens all across the country all the time. We know we should add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights: If any issue ought to be just a slam dunk, it is this issue. Yet we are at the end of this session and can't pass a real Patients' Bill of Rights. The House passed one; it was bipartisan. And then the Senate passed a ``patients' bill of goods''--well, they don't call it that, but that is what it is. It is just an empty vessel to say they have done something. 
   We should pass the Patients' Bill of Rights and make sure that in doctors' offices and in hospital rooms across this country, medical care is administered by the doctors and by skilled medical personnel. 
   I won't recite all the stories. One is sufficient to make the point. 
   A woman fell off a cliff in the Shenandoah mountains and was in a coma. She had multiple broken bones. She was taken to an emergency room on a gurney and unconscious. She was treated and eventually recovered. Her managed care organization said it would not pay for her emergency care because she didn't have prior approval to visit the emergency room. This is a person hauled in on a gurney, unconscious, and she was told she needed prior approval in order to have the emergency room treatment covered by her managed care organization. Examples of that sort of treatment 
   go on and on and on. 
   Patients should have a right to know all of their medical options, not just the cheapest. Patients ought to have a right to get emergency room treatment during emergencies. A patient ought to be able to continue treatment with the same oncologist. If a woman is being treated for breast cancer and her spouse has an employer who changes health care plans, she ought to be able to continue treatment with the same cancer specialist she had been working with for 3 or 5 years. Those are basic rights, in my judgment, which are embodied in the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is so simple and so straightforward and so compelling. Yet this Congress has not been able to get it done. 
   The list goes on. Agriculture sanctions: We have sanctions prohibiting food shipments to so many countries--about a half dozen around the world. We have economic sanctions against them, and those sanctions include a sanction on the shipment of food. President Clinton has relaxed that some; he is the first President to do so, and good for him. But he can't relax it, for example, with respect to Cuba. That is a legislative sanction, and we have to repeal it. 
   We ought not to use food as a weapon in the world. There should be no more sanctions on food shipments anywhere. The same ought to be true with medicine. The Senate has spoken on that by 70 votes. We said let's stop it. We are too big and too good a country to use food as a weapon. We try to hit Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro and we end up hitting poor, sick, hungry people. It ought to stop. 
   Yet we are near the end of this session and we don't seem to be able to do that. 
   It does not wash for anyone to come to this Chamber and say the problem is the minority party. That is nonsense. The problem is we haven't been in session a majority of this year. These red dates are the dates in which we have not been in session. The problem is we have people who do not want to schedule debate on the floor of the Senate on amendments because they do not want to cast votes on those amendments. We ought to change that. Let's decide whatever the amendments are and whatever the policy is and debate it and vote and whoever has the votes wins. In a democracy, you don't weigh votes. You count votes. Whoever ends up with the most votes at the end wins. That, again, is not rocket science. But that is the way democracy ought to work. 
   We have not been in session most of the year, and now we have people coming out suggesting that somehow the minority leader is responsible for the problems of scheduling in this session. It just does not wash. It is just not so. 
   I hope perhaps in the coming 2 weeks that remain in this 106th Congress that we will have some burst of energy, some burst of creativity, and perhaps some industrial strength vitamin B-12 administered to the entire Congress as a whole that would make us decide to do the things we know need doing. 
   As I indicated when I started, at the end of the day, the American people do not care much about who offered amendments and who didn't, and who brought legislation to the floor trying to shut debate off and who didn't. They are interested at the end of the day in whether this 106th Congress met and made much of a difference in their lives and in their families' lives. What people care about is the things they talk about around the supper table: Are my kids going to a good school? If not, what can I do about that? Do I have a good job that has some job security? Do I have a decent income? Am I able to believe that my parents and grandparents will have access to good health care? Do I live in a neighborhood that is safe? 
   All of these are issues that affect American families. All of these are issues that we are working on. And, regrettably, in the 106th Congress we are not working on them in a very effective way because we have not been meeting most of the year. 
   On those critical issues--health care, education, economic security, and a range of other issues--the things that will most affect working families in this country are things that this Congress is not inclined to want to work on, or are not inclined to want to pass. It would be one thing if we couldn't pass legislation addressing these issues because we had votes on these matters and we lost. But often we discover there are other ways to kill something by denying the opportunity to bring up the amendment for a vote. 
   It is interesting. In this Congress, we have had something pretty unusual. We have actually had legislation brought to the floor of the Senate and then cloture motions are filed to shut debate off before the debate even begins. We have had legislation brought to the floor of the Senate with cloture motions designed to shut amendments off before the first amendment was offered. 
   You wonder: How does that work? How does that comport with what the tradition of the Senate should be as a great debating society on which we take on all of the issues and hear all of the viewpoints and then have a vote about the direction in which we think this country should be moving? 
   When I came to the Congress some years ago, one of the older Members of Congress was Claude Pepper, who was then in his eighties--a wonderful Congressman from Florida. He used to talk about the miracle in the U.S. Constitution--the miracle that says every even-numbered year the American people grab the steering wheel and 
   decide which way they want to nudge this country. That is how he described the process of voting. That is the power that the American people have. The American people choose who comes to this Chamber. The rules of this Chamber provide that we do the same as the American people. We take their hopes and we take their aspirations and their thoughts for a better life and we offer them here in terms of public policy. Then we are supposed to vote. That is the bedrock notion of how you conduct democracy. 
   Yet we are all too often getting in this rut of deciding that we don't have time; we don't want to have a vote on this; we want to sidetrack that; we want to hijack this. 
   That is not the way the Senate ought to work.  
   Again, I didn't intend to come to the floor this afternoon, but nor did I want to sit and listen to debate which suggests that the minority leader, or the Democratic caucus, or anybody else for that matter, is at fault for what is taking place. 
   As the Senator from West Virginia indicated, there is perhaps sufficient blame to go around. I don't disagree with that. But I also know that we didn't win the election. I wish we had. We don't control the Senate. I wish we did. 
   But between now and the date we finish in this session of Congress, let me encourage those who make schedules around here to heed the words of the minority leader, Senator DASCHLE. If we have a fair number of appropriations bills remaining and people are worrying about whether we are going to get them done, then what Senator DASCHLE suggests, and I firmly support, is to do one appropriations bill a day. Bring up a bill today. It is Monday. It is 3:30. Let's bring a bill up and debate it and stay here until it is done. That is a sure way of getting the bills done. It is a sure way of providing everybody with an opportunity to be heard. It is also a way perhaps to get the votes on the issues I described that I think this Congress ought to be doing. 
   I assume we will have an interesting debate in the coming days. I hope Congress will be able to finish its work in the next 2 or 3 weeks. I hope that when we finish our work Democrats and Republicans can together say at the conclusion of the 106th Congress that we have done something good for America. But that will not happen unless things change, and unless we take a different tact in the next 3 weeks. There is a list of about 8 or 10 pieces that we ought to do. Bring them to the floor. Let's get them done, and then let's adjourn sine die feeling we have done something good for our country. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are nearing the end of the session of the 106th Congress. I believe we have 13 appropriations bills that we are required to enact and required to be signed into law to provide funding for all of the various things that are done in public policy and by our agencies of Government. 
   Out of the 13 appropriations bills, 2 of them have been signed into law by President Clinton. Now this process is broken. It is quite clear. We have come to the end stage of this session. Most of the appropriations bills are not yet completed. Most of the very difficult and complex issues are as of yet unresolved. I say to my colleagues that all we have to do to resolve all of this is to vote--only vote. 
   I will give you an example of why this process is broken. I serve on the agriculture appropriations subcommittee. We passed a bill in July that appropriates money for agricultural functions. Now, the Senate passed its bill in mid to late July. The House passed its bill on July 11. I am a conferee in a conference between the House and Senate. There has never been a conference. We have never met. There have been no discussions, and no Senator or Congressman has been involved in any way to try to move this legislation forward. Why? I am not sure exactly the reason why. I suspect the reason why is that this issue--this Agriculture appropriations bill--has some very complicated and controversial matters involved in it and some don't want to vote on them. So if you don't want to vote, don't call them up, don't have a conference. Just dig in your heels and stall. That is what happened. 
   One of the controversial issues on that bill--and it is appropriate that it should be on that bill--is the question of whether this country should allow the sale of food to certain countries with whom we have economic sanctions. Our country has had a policy, believe it or not, of saying we will use food as a weapon. 
   We don't like Saddam Hussein, so we impose economic sanctions against him and his country. We impose economic sanctions against the country of Iraq. We impose sanctions against Iran. We impose sanctions against Libya, North Korea, and Cuba. Included in those economic sanctions are provisions that say we will not allow the shipment of food or medicine to your country. That doesn't make any sense to me. We ought never use food as a weapon. We ought never under any condition say that we will prevent the shipment of food to anywhere in the world. This is a policy that takes aim at dictators whom we don't like, and it ends up hitting sick, hungry, and poor people. That makes no sense. 
   So the Senate passed my amendment that is now in conference. The amendment says let us stop using food as a weapon; no more sanctions on food  shipments anywhere in the world. That passed the Senate. It is in conference. We are not meeting in conference. Do you know why? Because some in this Congress do not like that provision. They want to retain sanctions on food. They want to continue to use food as a weapon. They want to prevent us shipping food, for example, to Cuba and other countries. Because they don't have the votes to prevent it if we had a vote on it, they say let's not have a conference. So there is no conference. 
   We are now just days from the end of the session, and the Agriculture appropriations bill is not passed. It is in conference. There is no conference meeting and no House conferees appointed. So there are some who think they will do what they did last year. The Senate passed that same provision last year by 70 votes, and the conference got hijacked by House leaders. When we met, the Senate conferees said we insist on our provisions to stop using food as a weapon. At that moment, there was an adjournment by the House conferees, and it never again met. Why? Because the House conferees would have supported us, and the House leaders wouldn't let them do it. In order to prevent a vote, they adjourned the conference, and it never again met. 
   We come to the end of this session in total chaos in all of these bills because some want to prevent a vote. This is the center for democracy. The process of democracy is to vote, even if it is controversial--vote, and then count them, and the winning side wins. 
   That is what ought to happen here. This isn't rocket science. 
   I say to those putting this schedule together to remember the old days. Did you get a tinker toy set or an erector set when you were a kid? You put it together piece by piece. That is the way this should work. 
   There are 13 bills. There is a sequence by which you pass the bills, put them in conference, have votes, resolve the controversial issues, get them done, get them to the President, and meet the deadline. 
   But I fear what is going to happen in the next week or two is that the same people who tried to hijack this process last year could do it again this year. The losers will be the American public--the American people and family farmers who rely on us to repeal this provision that says let's continue to use food as a weapon. 
   It is immoral. It is wrong for our family farmers. It is immoral for our country, and a terrible thing for our family farmers. It hurts hungry, sick, and poor people around the world. We ought to stop it. 
   I will have more to say about that next week.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as we look ahead, aside from the wrench in the crankcase here in Congress that prevents any kind of movement to get things done, one of the significant challenges for us both now and in the months ahead is this issue of energy. What is happening to energy prices? What is happening to the supply of energy? I want to talk for a minute about where we are. 
   Go back a year, or maybe a year and a half, and the price of oil was $10 a barrel. In fact, in North Dakota it was $6 to $7 a barrel. The price of gasoline at the gas pumps was about 90 cents a gallon. The price of natural gas was about $2 per million cubic feet. 
   Now, fast forward: What has happened is the OPEC countries have cut their production of oil. We have seen a circumstance in this country where the price of oil has spiked up on the spot market to $36 and $37 a barrel. Gasoline is anywhere from $1.50 to $2 a gallon. Natural gas prices have more than doubled from $2 per mcf, and in some cases $5 to $5.50. 
   We have people frightened to death with the reports that home heating fuel costs are spiking way up. Those in my State and others--particularly in the Northeast as they enter what could be a cold winter--are trying to figure out how they, on limited incomes, will pay for home heating fuel that is going to double, and in some cases triple in price. These are significant and serious issues. The question is, What do we do about it? What is causing all of this? And what can we do about it? We start out by understanding that it is complicated. It is not simple. 
   One of the first and most important aspects of understanding this is our country is far too dependent on foreign sources of energy. We are far too dependent especially on the OPEC countries for our oil. When we have to send people from our country to the OPEC countries to beg them to open the faucets and produce more, it has a significant impact on our economy and our future and our economic growth. We ought to understand that this makes us far to vulnerable. We need in the long term to move away from that vulnerability. 
   Second, with respect to consumers, they ask the question: Not only is OPEC cutting back, but why? The answer to that is, yes; OPEC is cutting back. Why? Because it is in their interest and they can do so. But they are also asking: Is somebody profiteering at the gas pumps? They see merger after merger in the energy industry. They see that British Petroleum and Amoco get married. They see Exxon and Mobil decide they are going to get hitched. 
   All of these big companies gather together, and then at a time when we have an energy crisis, we have a circumstance where the largest 14 oil companies show profits of over $10 billion in one quarter--up 112 percent--and those who drive to the gas pumps, those who are buying home heating fuel, and those who are paying for natural gas prices are asking the question: Is somebody profiteering at my expense? 
   As I say, this is a complex issue. But all of these questions need to be answered. The Federal Trade Commission has a current investigation going on. I hope they can wrap that up soon and tell the American people what is happening with respect to prices. 
   The issue of supply and demand in energy is something I want to talk about just for a moment. There has been a lot of discussion in the last few weeks on this issue of energy. We have some people saying in the last 6 to 8 years we have seen a decrease in production. That is causing our problem. We have been talking about energy supplies. Let's talk about the production of oil. Let's take a look at this line of production and what you see going back to about the late 1960s or 1970s. There has been a continual and diminished production. 
   That has happened under Republican administrations and Democratic administrations. That has happened under a series of administrations over many years. You see the line on the chart. There is no change in it at all. There is a systematic reduction in the production of energy. 
   With respect to the consumption of energy, we also see what has happened. In the 1970s, we had this energy scare for a number of reasons. We had a very brief reduction. We had a significant conservation movement in this country to conserve energy. We had 
   some brief reductions. But the fact is, we have begun to trend upward once again in a significant way. You will see that imports are continuing now to increase once again, which makes us much more dependent on foreign source energy. 
   This is important to everybody. I am a Senator who represents the State of North Dakota. It is important to us. When the price of gas at the pump spikes way up, or the price of diesel fuel begins to spike way up, this is what it means to a State such as North Dakota. We have farmers who are heavy users of fuel in order to put the crop in and to get the crop off the field. Higher prices for fuel means real trouble especially at a time when we have collapsed grain prices. It means people living in North Dakota, or other State such as ours, who drive a lot just to get places, that we pay a much heavier burden than others do. Do you know that North Dakotans drive almost twice as much per person as New Yorkers just to get to a grocery store? Why? Because we are a very large State with a sparse population and you have to drive long distances to get to places. 
   I have a friend in New York. They have relatives in New Jersey 50 miles away. I am told they pack an emergency kit in the trunk, put blankets in the car, and plan for 6 months to take a little trip to see their relatives 50 miles away. I don't know if that is true. But on the east coast, you don't travel as much. Populations are near. In North Dakota and Montana and States like those, we have to travel a lot. Therefore, we pay twice as much  for our energy and for our transportation needs. 
   There is a significant interest in what is happening. The consumption is going up. Our production has for 25 years been trending down, and imports are moving up. 
   Here is the consumption by sector on the chart: Transportation, industrial, residential, and commercial. What we see is a significant trend up in transportation. 
   It is interesting as we talk about all of these issues, one of the things happening in the Congress is a consistent resistance in Congress to ask anybody to work on vehicles that are more efficient. We have had these issues called CAFE standards, and I know it is very controversial. Does anybody think it is prudent for this country to resist trying to get more efficient automobiles? It makes sense to begin to continue to apply pressure to say we need more efficiency in our vehicles. We can see what is happening in transportation consumption of energy. Yet this Congress continues to demand we not try to establish some new goals with respect to fuel efficiency. 
   I have not been the biggest cheerleader on these issues because we drive a lot of pickup trucks. We have to make accommodations for that in sparsely populated areas, but we ought to expect the auto industry and others to join in trying to move in a relentless way toward more efficient vehicles and toward trying to provide some balance in this top line. More efficiency will result in less consumption on the transportation side. That is one way to deal with this. 
   We need to respond to this issue, to respond on two sides of this coin; one is production, and one is consumption. I will describe both quickly, especially in the context of the discussion of the last couple of days. 
   Vice President GORE says we ought to consider taking some oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. They call that the SPR. We have over 500 million barrels of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and Vice President GORE says we should take some out to provide stability in oil prices. Frankly, I have not been the biggest fan of moving to SPR anytime quickly. We have had this discussion before--8 or 9 months ago. 
   There is a circumstance today with the intransigence of the OPEC countries in being unwilling to increase production sufficient to provide some short-term balance in energy supply. We could, it seems to me, take half a million barrels a day out of SPR for 6 months, 9 months, 120 days, without dramatically diminishing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and at the same time contribute stability to international supply in a way that brings prices down and provides people the ability to see over this hump. 
   When we get over the heaviest use of supply in this fourth quarter and get into the next year, we will see more production because $35 and $36 a barrel has moved all kinds of rigs into areas where we have not had production before. A year and a half ago, we had zero production rigs drilling for oil in North Dakota; today, we have 20. I am told if there were enough workers, we would probably have 30 rigs in North Dakota. That is just a small amount compared to what is happening all over the world relative to today's oil prices. 
   My point is, what will provide some stability in the next 2, 3, 4 months? We have an economy that is a blessing. This has been the longest sustained economic growth in this country's history. It doesn't take much to tip an economy. We saw that in the early 1990s with some energy price spikes. Now it seems to me we ought to engineer a serious public discussion about the value of using, in a very cautious and conservative way, a portion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--only a very small portion--to come in and provide a cushion for the daily needs, as of yet unmet, that will provide some stability in energy prices. This will then provide, in my judgment, the opportunity to not have to worry quite so much about having these price spikes in energy, tipping this economy out of balance and moving toward a slowdown and a recession. 
   Vice President GORE talks about SPR. I say again, I have not been a big cheerleader for saying let's run into tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Normally, the use of the SPR is for 
   national security interest reasons. We have barrels of oil put away for emergencies. Given the production that exists in OPEC, the amount we are short on a daily basis, and the production we expect to come in around the corner sometime beginning January of next year because of the new rigs, it seems to me we can provide some filler with a small amount of inventory from the SPR in a way that provides stability to this market. In providing stability to the market, we will provide some insurance for this economy. I think that would be very important. 
   We must, however, understand this is a wake-up call for our country. We cannot allow this moment to pass without understanding we are far too dependent on foreign sources of energy. We need more production at home, we need more conservation at home, and less dependence on foreign energy. 
   In production in this country, I have favored some ability to use royalties as well as the Tax Code to provide some stabilization of prices with respect to production. Ten dollars a barrel for oil was too low; we all understood that. When oil went to $10 a barrel, nobody was drilling anymore; $10 a barrel was too low. We need some price stability for that industry; I understand that. 
   Even as we work on price stability and to encourage greater production in this country, we also need to understand the issue of conservation is a critically important issue, because in this consumption line we have to understand part of our balance is a production line that we need to get up, and the other part of our balance is a consumption line that we need to trend down, if we can. 
   We face serious challenges. This is the moment for our country to stop and think a bit about how we get over this short-term problem. I think we ought to have a good discussion about the short-term use of SPR in a very cautious and conservative way to stabilize these markets. This ought to spark a good discussion about conservation and greater fuel efficiencies in our vehicles. It ought to spark a significant discussion about conservation. 
   Even as we do that in the short run, we need to understand in the long run, we can't sustain an industrialized economy--the strongest, biggest economy in the world--the economy with the longest sustained economic growth in the world, we cannot sustain that with the vagaries of production decisions made by oil sheiks in other countries. We are too vulnerable to allow that to happen. 
   I make an additional point on a related issue. A part of the problem of these increasing oil imports--but only a part and really not even the largest part--is what it is doing to our trade deficits. When I talk about challenges we face, aside from the fact that this process around here is broken, and we are not passing appropriations bills when we should, and we are in a state of confusion on how to get this 106th Congress adjourned, there are two larger challenges about which we need to be very concerned. 
   One I just mentioned, and that is the oil issue, the energy issue, and what has happened to energy prices, what might happen to our economy as a result of what is happening in energy prices. The second is our trade deficit. It relates to the energy issue, as well. This is the second challenge to our economic opportunities in the future. Our trade deficit is spiking up, up, up, way up. Importing more oil, obviously, is causing part of this, but it is just part. Our trade deficit is a very serious, abiding, long-term problem. 
   We are now headed toward a yearly merchandise trade deficit that is going to be around $430 billion in the year 2000. In July, the overall trade deficit in goods and services was $31.9 billion. The merchandise deficit was $38.7 billion. That is unsustainable. A $7.5 billion monthly trade deficit with Japan, a $7.6 billion trade deficit with China, a $6.3 billion trade deficit with the European Union, $4.7 billion with Canada, $2.2 billion with Mexico--we can't sustain that. That cannot continue. The merchandise deficit with Japan for the first half of 2000 was nearly $40 billion; with China, $36 billion; Europe, $26 billion; Canada, $23 billion. 
   Not many people seem to care much about this. Nobody talks much about it. But this is a deficit that must be repaid. It regrettably will be repaid in the future with a lower standard of living in this country, and the higher the  deficit, the more difficulty we will have to respond to this obligation. 
   This results from a wide range of things. It results from China, Japan, Europe, Canada, Mexico--which have the largest bilateral trade deficits--deciding they should sell more to us than they are willing to buy from us. This cannot continue. 
   Even Alan Greenspan, with whom I have had substantial disagreements for a long period of time, says something has to give; this trade deficit is unsustainable. 
   I was intending to speak at greater length about our trade deficit, but I will save that for a later time. Suffice it to say that if this trade deficit continues to spike up, we could very well see it undermine confidence in the U.S. dollar and we could see the dollar begin falling on international currency markets. That could cause all kinds of problems for our country's economy. 
   There are two challenges we must meet--dealing with an energy policy both short term and long term that makes sense, and the challenge of dealing with a trade policy that begins to straighten out this trade mess. 
   I know other colleagues have things they want to talk about. I will come back later to talk about the specific trade issues we have with China and Japan and Canada and Europe. But it is my hope to end where I began today. It is my hope, in the next 2 weeks or so when the 106th Congress is expected to adjourn, that we can decide to bring the issues I have discussed to the floor for a vote. If someone believes we should keep using food as a weapon, good for them. They are dead wrong, but they have a right to think that. Everybody has a right to be wrong. 
   The point is, if 75 percent of the Senate and 75 percent of the House believes we ought to stop using food as a weapon and stop holding our farmers hostage by preventing them from shipping food to other countries, and stop hurting poor and sick and hungry people in Cuba and Iran and Libya and other places, if you believe that, then let us have a conference and cast a vote to stop it, as the Senate has done with over 70 percent of its Members. But those who bottle this up and try to hijack it by saying, ``We are not going to allow you to vote on this,'' that is not the way the system is supposed to work. If they try to do that in a dozen or so areas--where we have already passed legislation but they are trying not to have a conference and are trying to hijack the process--this place is going to slow way down in a big hurry. 
   Let me ask for cooperation on the part of the majority leader, the majority party, and my colleagues on my side and let's get this done. Let's do it right. 
   Another thing, we can't end this session without dealing with the issue of the minimum wage for the people at the lowest rung of the ladder in this country. We have an obligation to do that. That has been kicking around like a Ping-Pong ball for months. 
   We can't end this session without passing a Patients' Bill of Rights. Of course we ought to do that. That just makes sense. There are the votes to do that, in my judgment. It passed the House. We have the votes in the Senate. If we get it back up, we will win it by one vote. 
   There are a series of important things we should do, we ought to do--things the American people should expect us to do--and we only have a couple of weeks. I say to the people who run this place: Let's go back to regular order. If you don't like a provision, fine, try to kill it. But at least give us a vote on it. We will see, how the American public feels about it, how our colleagues feel about it. The way they are killing things these days is by putting them in a closet someplace and hoping nobody will see. It is happening to the issue of reimportation of prescription drugs, to the issue of food as a weapon in international sanctions. Frankly, that is the wrong way to legislate. If you have the votes, beat us. If you do not have the votes, give us the chance to win on the floor of the Senate and House as well on these important issues.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada is very generous. I must say the two things I came to talk about today are the energy problems that we have that are abiding and serious and that have a huge impact, not only on the State of North Dakota and the citizens I represent, but an impact on all Americans. And also the trade deficit, which has a similar impact on an agricultural State such as the State I represent. These are big issues, big challenges. Unfortunately, they are going unresolved. 
   There is the old story about a Cherokee Indian chief who is reputed to have said at one point:  
   The success of a rain dance depends a lot on the timing.  
   That was tongue in cheek, I expect, but that is true also with Congress and what it is willing to address and not willing to address, what it is willing to bring out here and sink its teeth into and what it wants to put in a closet and pretend doesn't exist. 
   These are big issues. We deal with a lot of small issues every day as well, but these are big issues and we have to deal with these issues. These issues will affect the economic lives of millions of small businessmen and women. It will affect the economic future of kids coming out of school, and they want a job and they need a good, growing economy to get a job. 
   These issues are the kinds of things that can tip a growing economy over into a recession, or something worse. That is why it is important. When you see storm clouds gather on the horizon, you pay attention to them. These are storm clouds on the horizon. Things are good now. This is a blessing. We have a great economy. You wouldn't rather be anywhere than here because we have a wonderful economy and things are very good in a lot of areas of this country, but these are storm clouds and our job is to anticipate and respond to things that we know are going to have a significant impact on the future of this country--energy and trade. We better get busy. We better respond to these issues. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. If I might respond, Mr. President, the folks in this country who are now worried sick about what is happening to energy prices are people such as senior citizens who know they are going to pay a home heating fuel bill that is multiples of what they paid last year. They are living on fixed incomes and do not have the money. They are saying: How do I do this? These are people who are living on fixed incomes, who drive up to the gas pump and now discover it costs a significant amount of money to fill their gas tank. Or small truckers--I just make this final point. 
   Mike and Jenny Mellick from Fargo, ND, called me. They operate seven trucks. It is a small company, a man and wife trying to run an operation with seven tractor-trailer rigs that haul loads across the country. They said the increase in fuel costs is devastating to them and they are worried about losing their business. 
   This is having repercussions all across this country. This could tip the economy. We have to get ahead of this and say we need more production and more conservation and we need to care about these folks who are being dislocated by the significant energy crisis we face. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I mentioned earlier about the Vice President's proposal. I have not been a big cheerleader to move to SPR. By the same token, SPR is 570 million barrels of stored reserves. If we take half a million barrels a day, we could for 90 or 120 days, which is what we need at this point to get back into a supply equilibrium, provide some significant stability in energy prices just by taking a very small portion. So we take a very small fraction of the SPR and with it provide stability to oil prices. 
   We need to work on the longer issues as well. There is merit in having this debate and discussion. The Vice President has raised a very important issue. Good for him. We have a short-term issue, intermediate issues, and long-term issues. In the short term, we ought to take a look at this issue. Maybe half a million barrels a day will be the catalyst to provide the stability we want in oil prices at this moment in order to get to the next intersection, which I think after the first of the year is an intersection of much more production. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Mississippi yielding to me. I wanted to propound a series of questions. 
   First of all, let me say that I respect the difficult job the majority leader has. As we come to the end of the 106th Congress and try to put all the pieces together and make them fit, and so on, it is a difficult job. 
   One specific piece of legislation that is very important to me--as are many others--is the Agriculture appropriations bill. 
   I come from a farm State. This is a critically important piece of legislation. 
   The House of Representatives passed an Agriculture appropriations bill on July 11. The Senate passed one on July 20. It is now September 22. I was appointed a conferee for this appropriations conference. I am on the subcommittee, and there has been no appropriations conference at all. We are toward the end of this legislative session, and I worry about the regular process. 
   Will we have an appropriations conference? 
   The reason I am asking this question is, as the majority leader knows, there are some very controversial things in this legislation. I understand there are, because the Senate by a majority vote said we want them. One of those controversial issues is a policy that says: Let us stop using food as a weapon. We want to abolish sanctions on food shipments all around the world. It is controversial. 
   Some don't want to do that. Some want to continue to use food sanctions against Cuba and other countries. I don't. Seventy Members of the Senate voted not to do it. We want to abolish that approach. That is one. 
   The other controversial issue is--Senator JEFFORDS and I offered the amendment on the reimportation of prescription drugs approved by the FDA. That was controversial. 
   The reason I am asking the question of the majority leader is, yesterday someone from the news media called me and said another Member of the Senate indicated that next week the Agriculture appropriations bill will be coming to the floor of the Senate. This Senator asked: How will that happen? He said: By magic. 
   By magic? I am a conferee. If there is a conference report on the Agriculture appropriations bill being brought to the floor of the Senate, it is not coming from a conference I was ever invited to attend. 
   These are very important issues. 
   I haven't mentioned the issue of crop loss and quality loss on crops in North Dakota and across the country where farmers have been devastated by disease and quality loss in their crops. We want to focus on that in this bill as well. 
   I will not give a speech. But I want to ask the majority leader: Can he tell me anything about this conference or anything about this ``magic'' that one Member of the Senate suggested was going to happen? Do we expect to have a conference with the House on Agriculture appropriations? And will those of us who are conferees and who come from farm States and have an abiding interest in doing the right thing have the opportunity to pursue these policies and get votes on them?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for one further point, I have consulted with the senior Senator from Mississippi, Mr. COCHRAN, someone for whom I have great regard. He has done a wonderful job as chairman of that subcommittee. He indicated, pretty much as the majority leader did, that the House didn't appoint conferees. The House passed the agriculture appropriations bill on July 11. 
   It may be a stretch, but I think sometimes there are teams around here, and the team kind of gets together to talk about how they are going to do something. When teams huddle up, they do not call both a pass play and run play; they normally call one play. It may be a stretch on my part, but I figured there is a team that has huddled up and said: You know the play. We are not going to call on agriculture because we have a couple of things we don't want to have people vote on, and we are not going to have a conference. 
   That is the only explanation I can have for being a conferee 
   and never having a conference. I guess the easiest choice is the obvious choice. Let the House and the Senate vote on these controversial issues. Both of them that I mentioned would have passed by 75 percent of the House and the Senate easily. 
   The reason the Senator from Mississippi, the majority leader, knows I have a little bit of tension about this is, last year we had the same issue on sanctions and food shipments. The same issue went through the Senate with 70 votes and went into conference. I was a conferee. The first order of business in the conference was to say: We insist on the Senate's position. Let's stop using food as a weapon. Let's stop having embargoes on food shipments. 
   The Senate voted. The Senate conferees insisted on their position, and the conference was disbanded and never met again, because the House conferees were prepared to support us and the House leadership said: No. We are going to disband the conference and bring the conference report to the floor that we haven't had a chance to work on. 
   My great concern is, that might happen again this year and maybe there has been no play called yet. But I hope that, really soon the majority leader will tell them that the easiest play for these controversial issues is to bring them back, and let's have votes in the House and Senate. I am willing to lose the votes if, after we count them, I am on the wrong end. But we won't lose on either of these issues. 
   I finally say to the majority leader, it is true that we have suffered, and his State has suffered droughts and floods. We have had fires in my State and devastating quality losses on top of floods. We need to put a piece in this agriculture appropriations bill in response to those disasters as well. That is another significant part of it. 
   I want to work with the majority leader. But my great concern is that there won't be a conference. If the majority leader is telling me he thinks there will be, I hope he will consult with the Speaker of the House. We both served in the House. I think it is unusual to have a bill passed on July 11, and now on September 22 they haven't appointed conferees.

   Mr. DORGAN. Things will slow down a lot if we have a process that tries to partition people off from this. These are important issues, and they are not done at the end of the session; they probably should have been done long ago. As we get to the end of the session, I am asking we have conferences. 
   To the extent you are talking to the Speaker, I hope you will encourage them: Appoint conferees, get to conference, and get the business done. That is all I am asking today. I expect to be at a conference next week. 
   Somebody in this Senate said yesterday to a member of the press--I assume it is probably printed today--that the conference report was going to come to the Senate floor by ``magic.'' Well, that is a magic carpet that will surprise a lot of Members, I suppose, and will cause a lot of problems. If the Senator will support us in regular order in having a conference in which we can all participate, that is what we expect to be the case in the Senate.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one of the things Americans like least about Congress is the way we wrangle over things we don't agree about instead of acting on things we can agree about. 
   The estate tax is a case in point. There is wide agreement in the Senate that we should act to eliminate the burden of the estate tax on family farms and businesses. We could accomplish that this year--this week in fact--with little fuss or ado. 
   I propose that we do just that, and save for later the parts of the estate tax that we don't agree on. We should not hold the family farms and businesses of this nation hostage to the heirs of multi-billion-dollar investment fortunes. We can address that problem right now so let's do it. 
   We often forget in this country that a family is an economic unit as well as a social unit. This nation was built upon an economy of family-based farms and businesses. That is why the values of family--a commitment to community, a loyalty to place, a sense of tradition passing through the generations--were an important part of the economy in the formative days of our republic. 
   Those values weakened as the economy became national and corporate. They have weakened further still as the economy has become global, and the cold calculus of the global marketplace has displaced considerations of family and community in our economic life. 
   In this setting it is crucial that we strive to keep the family farms and businesses that we have, and to encourage new ones. Family-based enterprise  provides a counterweight to the centrifugal forces of the global economy. It can help to anchor the market in values and concerns that the large impersonal corporation does not share, and we should encourage this form of enterprise whenever we can. 
   Certainly the Federal Government never should force the sale of such an enterprise just to pay an estate tax. That does not happen often today. But not often is still too often. It should never happen, and that is why I am introducing a bill today to make sure it doesn't. 
   Under this bill, the estate tax on farms and businesses under active family management would phase out over 6 years, until by 2006 it would be gone completely. 
   This bill is different from the one that passed this Chamber earlier this year in one key respect: It applies onto family farms and businesses passed along to the next generation. It does not apply to the heirs of multi-billion dollar investment fortunes and the like. There was a strange disconnect in the debate over that earlier bill. Virtually all the talk from proponents was about family farms and businesses. Yet the bulk of the actual belief of their bill would have gone to the heirs of investment fortunes instead. 
   That is why many of us voted against the bill. The walk didn't match the talk. And that is why I am proposing today that, for once, we move forward on what we do agree on instead of wrangling continuously, for political advantage, over what we don't. Large stock fortunes are not the same as family farms and businesses. They raise a different set of questions where the estate tax is concerned, and we ought to deal with those questions separately and at a later time. 
   This is not the place to debate the merits of the estate tax as it applies to large fortunes as opposed to operating farms and businesses. I will just note briefly a few of the reasons why many of us could not support the previous bill. 
   For one thing, the tax was enacted out of the conviction that those who have benefited most from our democracy in the past ought to contribute to its security and well-being in the future. That was true back in 1916 and it is equally true today. To repeal the estate tax completely would shift the burden of paying for the Federal Government even more onto the working men and women of this country. That is not fair. 
   Second, the estate tax encourages people with large fortunes to make significant contributions to charity. If we are going to rely less on government in addressing our social problems, and more on the efforts of individuals and private nonprofit organizations, then we must not dry up a prime source of funding for these efforts. 
   Third, the estate tax encourages the work ethic, as it applies to estates other than family-based farms and businesses. Those who might otherwise be able to live on inherited fortunes occasionally have to some useful work instead. 
   I know that there is disagreement on these points. They deserve an honest debate. But as I said, we should not hold family based farms and businesses hostage to that debate. We can agree that help for these family based enterprises is the first priority of estate tax reform. We can agree that no family farm or family business should have to be sold to pay an estate tax. 
   So let's do that now and save the rest for another day.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, for all the talk about taxes in this chamber, we often overlook one of the worst burdens of the current tax system. I'm talking about the monumental hassle that taxpayers face to file their tax returns each year. 
   It is simply inexcusable that Congress has made it so expensive and complex for Americans to fulfill this basic civic duty. Taxpayers will probably spend somewhere around three billion hours and at least $75 billion next year in the effort to meet their federal income tax obligations. It's no wonder they barrage congressional offices with letters each spring imploring us to simplify the Tax Code. 
   They are right. Each little provision in the tax code has a justification, but together they add up to a big headache for the American taxpayer. We can't blame the IRS for the misery endured this past year or in the years ahead. There's no way to truly simplify tax day unless Congress changes the underlying law. 
   That's why I'm pleased to be joined by Senators GREGG and DURBIN in introducing a tax reform proposal that we call the ``Fair and Simple Shortcut Tax'' (FASST) plan. Our plan would give most taxpayers the opportunity to pay their federal income taxes without having to prepare a tax return if they so choose. Some thirty countries already enable their citizens to pay their federal taxes in this way. We believe tax simplification along these lines can work in this country, too. Our approach would also be less costly than other major tax simplification plans that have been proposed in Congress in the past several years. 
   Our bill is based on a principle that both sides of the aisle generally are eager to espouse--namely, choice. The bill would allow taxpayers to choose to pay their taxes without complexity, paperwork and hassle. Those who prefer to use the current system, with its complexity and expenses, could do so if they wanted. But if they want something simpler, they could choose that instead. 
   Under FASST, most taxpayers could forget about filing a federal tax return on April 15th. Instead, their entire income tax liability would be withheld at work. There would be no more deciphering statements from mutual funds, no more frantic search for records and receipts, and no last minute dash to the Post Office in order to meet the midnight deadline. According to Treasury Department officials who have studied it, the FASST plan would give up to 70 million Americans the opportunity to elect the no-return option. 
   Specifically, under the FASST plan, most taxpayers could choose the no-filing option by filling out a slightly modified W-4 form at work. Using tables prepared by the IRS, their employers would determine the employee's exact tax obligation at a single rate of 15 percent on 
   wages--after several major adjustments--and withhold that amount. This amount would satisfy the taxpayer's entire federal income tax obligation for the year, absent some unforeseeable changes in circumstances or fraud. 
   The FASST plan would be available for couples earning up to $100,000 in wages and no more than $5,000 in other income such as interest, dividends or capital gains. In the case of individual taxpayers, the wage and non-wage income limits would be $50,000 and $2,500, respectively. Popular deductions would continue under this plan: the standard deduction, personal exemptions, the child care credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, along with a deduction for home mortgage interest expenses and property taxes. Our bill would include critical savings incentives for average Americans by exempting up to $5,000 of all interest, dividends and capital gains income from taxation for couples, $2,500 for singles. Moreover, savings contributions made through employers would be excluded from the wage calculations in the beginning. 
   Consider some of the advantages of this hassle-free plan: 
   No taxpayers would lose. If a taxpayer prefers to file an ordinary return, he or she would still have that choice, and no one would be forced to lose a tax deduction that he or she wants to keep. 
   Wages would be taxed at a single, low rate of 15 percent. 
   A deduction for home mortgage interest expenses, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and other popular parts of our current tax code would be preserved. Other major tax reform plans would eliminate those deductions, which many people count on. 
   The alternative minimum tax, AMT and the marriage penalty would be eliminated. 
   Compliance costs for taxpayers and government alike would fall. If 70 million Americans chose the FASST option, hundreds of millions of dollars now spent on paper pushing could be used in more productive ways. 
   Those taxpayers who continued to file under the old system would get relief too. The plan would reduce the marriage penalty by making the standard deduction for married couples double the amount available for single filers. Also, it would virtually eliminate the complicated AMT for most sole proprietors, farmers and other small businesses by exempting the first $1 million in self-employment income from the AMT calculations. This legislation also would provide a 50 percent credit for up to $1,000 in expenses that businesses might incur implementing the FASST plan. In addition, it would grant taxpayers who continue to use the current system a 50 percent tax credit for up to $200 in tax preparer expenses, provided they file their returns electronically. Finally, the bill would offer individuals a substantial incentive for savings and investment by exempting up to $500 of dividend and interest income, $1,000 for couples. 
   Mr. President, millions of Americans in this country are tired of spending countless hours wading through complex forms and instruction books. Our bill is both simple and fair, and it gives most taxpayers the choice to avoid the annual nightmare that the federal tax system has become. 
   In testimony before a Senate subcommittee earlier this year, IRS Commissioner Rossotti testified that it's ``unquestionable that this bill provides significant tax simplification.'' Imagine how much better life would be if April 15th were just another day. Under the FASST plan, for millions of Americans, that could be true. We urge our colleagues to support this important legislation, which we think will go a long way toward eliminating the burden of ``tax day'' for tens of millions of taxpayers in the future.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to talk today about the issue of prescription drugs. Some of my colleagues have already talked about this issue at some length. Let me add to that. 
   In January of this year, on a cold, snowy day, a group of North Dakota  senior citizens and I drove from North Dakota to Canada. It was not much of a drive, as a matter of fact, from Pembina, ND, to Emerson, Canada. We went to Canada to allow these senior citizens to purchase prescription drugs in Emerson, because the same drug that is marketed in Canada--in the same bottle, made by the same company--is sold in most cases for a fraction of the price for which it is sold in the United States. 
   I want to illustrate that, if I may. I ask unanimous consent to use, on the floor of the Senate, two pill bottles. These bottles are for a medicine called Zocor. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-dorgan-nd-2-20000920</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DORGAN. The bottles are slightly different, one is bigger than the other, but Zocor is sold both in Canada and the United States. Zocor is one of a number of cholesterol-lowering drugs. In fact, Dan Reeves, coach of the Atlanta Falcons, has an advertisement saying he takes a similar drug to lower his cholesterol following some heart problems he had. 
   In any event, Zocor is an FDA-approved drug produced by the same company, often in the same FDA-approved plant. Yet, this bottle of Zocor is sold in Winnipeg, Canada, for $1.82 per caplet. But if you are an American who is using Zocor to lower your cholesterol, you pay $3.82 per tablet. Again, if you buy it in Canada, it is $1.82 per tablet. But in the United States, the same tablet, by the same company, is not $1.82, but $3.82. 
   The Senate just finished yesterday a debate about normal trade relations. This used to be called most-favored-nation status. Do you know what the situation is with respect to prescription drug prices? We have least-favored-customer status for the American consumer. Why do I say this? Because prescription drug prices here are higher than anywhere else in the world. Why should the American consumer pay prices that are 10 times, or 5 times, or triple or double the price paid by everyone else in the world for the same prescription drugs made in the same plants by the same companies? 
   The answer is that U.S. consumers should not be least favored consumers as they are forced to be by the pharmaceutical drug industry. We can change that. How can we change it? We can change it by allowing our pharmacists and our distributors to be able to access the same FDA-approved prescription drug in Canada or in other countries--sold by the same company and produced in an FDA-inspected plant--at a lower price and pass the savings along to their customers. If we did that, the pharmaceutical industry would be required to reprice their prescription drugs in this country and reduce their prices. 
   I want to talk about Sylvia Miller. Sylvia Miller is one of the senior citizens who went to Canada with me. She is from Fargo, ND. A columnist in Fargo wrote a piece about Sylvia Miller. Let me just acquaint you with Sylvia Miller by reading from this piece:  
   Sylvia Miller isn't one to complain, but few people would blame her if she chose to complain just a little bit....... Sylvia knows that life isn't always easy, that people struggle with the lows and look forward to the highs....... She's had her share of dark days in her 70 years of life on this earth. 
   The 1980s were a pretty rough decade for her. She beat breast cancer in 1981, then lung cancer eight years later. She's a tough lady.  
   This article says she and her husband lived most of their lives in Durbin and then moved to Fargo in 1987, after ``we were 
   flooded out by water coming cross country--the basement filled up nearly to the ceiling.'' 
   Sylvia went with me to Emerson, Canada, 5 miles across the border, because she wanted to buy her prescription drugs at a better price. This article says Sylvia is a pleasant person. I know that because I know Sylvia. It also says she leads a disciplined life. She has to. She has diabetes. She also has asthma, and she has a heart that could be stronger. She tests her blood sugar level several times a day, eats wisely and at the right times, and the article goes on to say she gives herself shots four times a day, mixing three different insulins, uses two different inhalers for lungs which function below normal capacity, and she requires seven different prescription drugs every month. Last year, she received $4,700 from Social Security, and her prescription drug bill was more than $4,900. She says: Things don't quite add up, do they? 
   On our trip to Canada, I stood with Sylvia and the others in this little one-room drugstore in Emerson, Canada. The exact same prescription drugs you can buy in this tiny drugstore are sold 5 miles south, in Pembina, ND, or 120 miles south in Fargo, ND. The difference is not in the pill--it is the same pill, same color, same shape, made in the same plant, marketed by the same company. The difference? Price. Americans are the least favored consumers. They pay the highest prices. 
   So a group of senior citizens who pay too much for prescription drugs--such as Sylvia, who gets $4,700 on Social Security and has a $4,900 prescription drug bill--are trying to get a better price for the drugs they need to lead a good life by traveling to Canada. 
   These senior citizens should not have to load up in a van on a cold winter morning and drive to Canada. The Customs Service will allow individuals to bring back from Canada a small amount of prescription drugs for their personal use. But there is a Federal law that says a pharmacist from Grand Forks, ND, or Montana or Vermont, can't go to Canada and access that same drug and come back and pass the savings along to their customers. Federal law says you can't do that. We aim to change that Federal law. 
   The Senate has already passed our proposal. Senator JEFFORDS, Senator GORTON, Senator WELLSTONE and I, and a range of others have worked to pass this plan in the Senate. Our proposal says: Let's allow U.S. pharmacists and distributors to go to other countries and access the identical prescription drugs, approved by the FDA, at a lower price, bring them back, and pass the savings along to the American consumer. 
   Of course, if we get this plan signed into law, what will happen is that the pharmaceutical industry will be required to reprice these drugs in this country. 
   Now, guess what. The pharmaceutical industry is spending a fortune to try to defeat this proposal. It is in a conference committee. I am one of the conferees. The conference isn't even meeting. Why isn't it meeting? Because people have heartburn over this proposal, and they want to kill it. 
   The pharmaceutical industry said the 11 former Food and Drug Administration Commissioners have come out in opposition to the proposal. Well, yesterday, I showed a letter that we received from David Kessler, the former Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration under Presidents Bush and Clinton. I want to tell my colleagues what he says:  
   The Senate bill which allows only the importation of FDA approved drugs, manufactured in approved FDA facilities, and for which the chain of custody has been maintained, addresses my fundamental concerns.  
   He is not opposing what we are trying to do. This is a former FDA Commissioner. 
   Dr. Kessler says further:  
   I believe the importation of these products could be done without causing a greater health risk to the American consumers than currently exists.  
   We need to give the FDA some additional resources to make sure we do not have counterfeit drugs imported. The pharmaceutical industry says this is an issue of safety. It is not. Here is an FDA Commissioner who says this can be done safely as long as you have safeguards. The pharmaceutical industry says this debate is about safety. They know better than that. It is about profits. Whose profits? Their profits. 
   Donna Shalala, who is the Secretary of Health and Human Services, has also written us a letter. She has indicated she believes that the Senate approach is an approach that can work. Secretary Shalala has said: ``With respect to the three amendments now in conference''--one of which is the Jeffords-Dorgan amendment I am talking about that was passed by the Senate--``we believe the Jeffords amendment represents a promising approach'' that can be effective if Congress provides new and efficient resources--which we intend to do--to the FDA. 
   So the head of the Department of Health and Human Services says this can be done safely as well, as long as we provide additional resources to the FDA. 
   But, again, today, for those who are trying to kill this proposal, I would like to offer another challenge. Of  course, no one has ever accepted the challenge, but I am interested in finding just one Member of Congress--one man or woman serving in the Senate or in the House out of 535 of us--to stand up on the floor of the Senate or House and say: I believe the American consumer should be treated as the least favored consumer by the pharmaceutical industry. I support that. I believe it, and I think we ought to leave it the way it is. 
   I want one Member of Congress to stand up and say that. I want one Member of Congress to stand up and say: With respect to Zocor, a prescription drug to lower cholesterol, I believe that Americans ought to have to pay $3.82 per tablet for the same medicine for which the pharmaceutical industry will charge the Canadians only $1.82 per tablet. A similar discount is provided to the Italians, the Germans, and the English, and the Swedes, and the rest of the countries, because the big drug companies are charging Americans the highest prices in the world. 
   I am not asking for the Moon here. I am only asking for one Member of Congress to stand up and support the pharmaceutical industry's pricing policies. And no one will. Because they want to kill this under the cover of darkness. They want to kill this 
   by not having a conference, and by dropping it during some closed meeting in some crevice of this Capitol Building. 
   This is not an issue without names and faces and consequences. Sylvia Miller went to Canada with me to purchase prescription drugs at a much lower price, as did other senior citizens. But it ought not have to be that way. There is no reason anybody ought to have to go anywhere else in order to access the same prescription drug for half the price they pay in the United States. 
   That is unfair to the U.S. consumer. We can change it. And we can change it without compromising safety. We can change it, and should, and will. 
   Let me mention a word about the prescription drug industry. I happen to think we benefit mightily from much of what they do. When they develop a new prescription drug, good for them. But much of the new work in prescription drug development is coming from public investment through the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere. We are making substantial taxpayer-funded investments in research. Much of that research is then taken by the pharmaceutical industry and used to produce new medicines, for which they charge higher prices to the American consumer than anyone else in the world. That is not fair. 
   I want the pharmaceutical industry to be profitable, but profiting in ways that are unfair to the U.S. consumer should not be allowed. 
   The pharmaceutical industry has said--and incidentally, they have sent people all around North Dakota to newspapers and TV stations with this message--that if what Senator DORGAN wants to do gets done, there will be less research done on new medicines. 
   Interesting point. The pharmaceutical industry spends more money for research in Europe than it does in the United States, by just a bit. In other words, more research is done by that industry in Europe than in the United States. They say: If we charge less in the United States, somehow we will do less research. Yet they charge less in Europe and do more research there. And they charge more for prescription drugs in this country than in any country in Europe and do slightly less research. If their argument had any validity at all why is that the case? 
   To those in the pharmaceutical industry, I understand that you have a responsibility to your stockholders. I understand that. You have the responsibility to earn a decent profit. I understand that. Yet the Wall Street Journal says that the pharmaceutical industry has profits that are ``the envy of the corporate world.'' 
   We am not talking about price controls with the Senate proposal. We are simply saying if the global economy is good for the pharmaceutical industry--and every other industry in this world--then why is the global economy not able to work for Sylvia Miller? Why can't Sylvia Miller's pharmacist go to Winnipeg, Canada, and purchase Zocor, and bring it back and sell it at a price that is much less than is now charged in this country? 
   The pharmaceutical industry will say: Gee, some of these countries have price controls. That is true. Some of these countries--many of them--say: All you can charge for prescription drugs is your cost plus a profit. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one of the inconveniences of the global economy is that you have advantages and disadvantages, and you have to live with both. When you move products around in a global economy--and the pharmaceutical industry certainly does--you get the advantages of importing lower-priced compounds and chemicals with which to make prescription drugs. So the big drug companies benefit from the global economy. But one of the inconveniences of the global economy is that the conditions that exist in the country you are purchasing from comes with that 
   product. 
   Today, if I were to go up to my colleagues--and I will not--and turn over their necktie, I would find some of them are wearing a necktie made in China. So I say to them: If you are wearing a necktie made in China, governed by a Communist government, no doubt, when you purchased the necktie, you were contributing to the salary of the Communist leader of China. Do you feel comfortable with that necktie? 
   But, of course, no one set out to give comfort to any government anywhere. They simply bought a necktie. That is why, when the pharmaceutical industry says, ``if you are able to access the lower priced drug in Canada, you are importing some sort of price controls,'' I say nonsense. All you are doing is taking advantage of the global economy, the buying and selling of goods back and forth across borders. 
   Yes, it is inconvenient that some countries--in fact, many countries--do have price controls. But if pharmacists were able to access products in other countries at a lower price, why should they be prevented from moving them into this country? The Senate plan would allow this with complete safeguards, only for medicines that are approved by the FDA, only those medicines 
   that are manufactured in an FDA-approved plant. Additional resources to the FDA would allow you to make certain you are not moving counterfeit products in and out of this country. With safeguards such as these in place, former FDA Commissioner David Kessler, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, and others say it is perfectly appropriate and perfectly acceptable to give consumers, such as Sylvia Miller, the opportunity to have lower priced drugs in this country. 
   I will finish by asking this: Is there any Member of the House or Senate who believes the U.S. consumer should be the least favored consumer in international trade on prescription drugs? Does anybody stand up in support of this? I fail to see one, in all my time discussing this over the last year and a half, who will stand up and say: Let me be the first to say I support the highest prices for American consumers on prescription drugs. No one will do that because they don't dare do it publicly. They understand how unfair this pricing scheme is. 
   That is what Senator JEFFORDS and I, and Senators GORTON and WELLSTONE and many others, are intending to change. The Senate has passed our proposal by a wide margin. It is now in conference. Those who have the strings to pull want to dump it and kill it by not having a conference convened. I happen to be a conferee. I intend to be at a conference at some point and fight for this proposal. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the legislation we will vote on after lunch contains a provision that will name a Federal courthouse in Grand Forks, ND. A Federal building in Grand Forks, ND, will be named the Judge Ronald N. Davies Federal Building. I want to describe to my colleagues something about Judge Ronald Davies. 
   Some of my colleagues may have had the opportunity to visit the Norman Rockwell exhibit at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in downtown Washington, DC. Among the many examples of Americana in the Gallery is a famous painting of a little African American girl, hair in pigtails, head held high, being escorted into a school by U.S. marshals. It was the result of a ruling by an unassuming Federal judge, a son of North Dakota, that allowed this Nation to take one large step forward in expanding America's dream for all Americans. 
   Forty-three years ago this month, on September 7, 1957, a Federal judge from North Dakota was asked to go to Arkansas to sit as a Federal judge and render a decision on a case involving civil rights. Surrounded by security guards because of threats on his life, Judge Ronald Davies carefully weighed the facts and the law and then issued an order that the New York Times  later said was a landmark decision in civil rights, ordering the integration of the Little Rock public schools. 
   Most people will not know the name of Ron Davies, but Judge Davies is one of North Dakota's proudest sons. He was made a Federal judge by the appointment of President Eisenhower in 1955. While on temporary assignment in Arkansas, he issued the decision that would become one of the landmark decisions on the issue of civil rights. 
   He required the integration of the schools in Little Rock. 
   Judge Davies was not a tall man. In fact, he was just over 5 feet--about 5 foot 1, 5 foot 2--but he will certainly be remembered as a giant in the history of civil rights and integration. Despite threats on his life and National Guardsmen guarding the doors, this man sat in a courthouse and rendered the pivotal decision that will echo throughout this Nation's history. He replied, ``I was only doing my job,'' when asked about that decision. He was unassuming and unwilling to be in the national spotlight. In fact one news program called him an ``obscure judge.'' He agreed. He said, ``We judges are obscure and should be.'' 
   Back then, he was also called ``the stranger in Little Rock.'' But he was no stranger to justice and no stranger to decency and no stranger to common sense. Men such as Judge Davies should be remembered. I think it is appropriate that we recognize this Federal judge with the fiery spirit, a man with an unerring sense of duty who went to Little Rock in a very difficult circumstance and did his job. 
   When schoolchildren and citizens and visitors pass through the door of the Federal building in Grand Forks, ND, they will be reminded of the courage Judge Davies showed America as he sat and did his job in those difficult times in Little Rock. It was a turning point in our Nation's history. 
   I can think of no better way to celebrate the life of Judge Davies, and also the important achievements his decision 43 years ago this month have rendered this country, than to put his name on the Federal building in Grand Forks, ND. So when this legislation becomes law later this year, that Federal building will be named the ``Ronald N. Davies Federal Building and United States Courthouse.''

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am joining with my colleagues Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator DASCHLE, and others today to introduce the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000. This legislation seeks to address some of the unintended consequences the Balanced Budget Act, BBA, of 1997 is having on access to Medicare services vital to older Americans. The BBA has had a particularly serious impact on rural health care providers, and I am pleased that the legislation we are introducing today acknowledges the special needs of rural America. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I supported the Balanced Budget Act when it was enacted by Congress in 1997 with strong bipartisan support. Prior to the passage of this law, Medicare was projected to be insolvent within two years (by 2001), so it was imperative that we took action to extend Medicare's financial health and to constrain its rate of growth to a more sustainable level. Thanks in part to this law, we have a flourishing economy in most parts of the country and the Medicare trust fund is projected to be solvent until 2025. 
   But in some respects, the Balanced Budget Act was successful beyond our wildest expectations in reducing Medicare program costs. The Congressional Budget Office originally estimated that Medicare spending would be reduced by $112 billion over five years, but instead, the reduction in spending growth has been nearly double that amount. This unexpected result is having real consequences for Medicare beneficiaries and health care providers, and Congress simply must take action to address these problems before adjourning this year. 
   Congress took a step in the right direction towards addressing the problems facing Medicare providers by enacting the Balanced Budget Refinement Act, BBRA, of 1999. Unfortunately, however, there is growing evidence that the negative changes resulting from the BBA have not been adequately addressed by the BBRA. Moreover, the impacts continue to disproportionately affect rural health care providers and the quality of care rural Medicare beneficiaries receive. 
   Part of the problem facing rural providers is simply demographics: My home state of North Dakota is the second oldest in the nation, and our overall population is shrinking. In fact, in six of North Dakota's ``frontier'' counties, there were 20 or fewer births for the entire county for the entire year of 1997. Admissions to rural hospitals have dropped by a drastic 60 percent in the last two decades, and those patients who do remain tend to be older and sicker. This means that rural hospitals tend to be disproportionately dependent upon Medicare reimbursement, to the extent that Medicare accounts for 85 percent of their revenue. Obviously, given this reality, changes in Medicare reimbursement have a tremendous impact on the financial health of rural hospitals. 
   Another part of the problem is that Medicare has historically reimbursed urban health care providers at a higher rate than their rural counterparts. Of course, some of this difference can be explained by regional differences in the cost of health care and variations in the health status of older Americans. But this isn't the whole explanation. Even after adjusting for these factors, a report by health care economists found that, for example, Medicare's per beneficiary spending was about $8,000 in Miami, but only $3,500 in Minneapolis. When average Medicare payments for the same procedure are compared, the disparities in payment in different areas of the country are dramatic. For example, Medicare pays $6,588 for the treatment of simple pneumonia in the District of Columbia, but only $3,383 in North Dakota. In my opinion, this difference is largely explained by a Medicare reimbursement system that is skewed in favor of urban areas. For the most part, the BBA further perpetuates this inequity, despite efforts by some of us to address this concern. 
   There are a few areas of the Balanced Budget Act and BBRA that I think warrant further scrutiny and action, and these areas are addressed in the legislation being introduced today. The first is hospital payments, particularly for outpatient services. A recent analysis by a health policy research firm estimates that the BBA would reduce Medicare payments to North Dakota hospitals by $163.8 million between FY 1998 and FY2002. The BBRA passed last year restores only $16 million of those reductions. So even with BBRA refinements, North Dakota hospitals face a loss of $147.8 million in revenues. Outpatient services are a particularly critical component of care in many North Dakota hospitals: 40 percent of the hospitals in my state get more than half of their revenues from outpatient services. Senator DASCHLE and MOYNIHAN's legislation will address the problems faced by rural hospitals by, among other things, providing a full inflation increase in Medicare payments to all hospitals in 2001 and 2002 and holding rural hospitals permanently harmless from the outpatient prospective payment system. 
   This legislation also addresses the issue of home health reimbursement. Nearly 70 percent of the home health agencies in my home state are hospital-based, so the changes in home-health reimbursement are having a domino effect on North Dakota's hospitals. I am concerned that the Health Care Financing Administration's, HCFA, proposed rule for the new home health Prospective Payment System, PPS, does not take account of the smaller size of rural home health agencies and the higher fixed costs per visit. And, HCFA did not take sufficient account of the greater travel cost per visit in rural areas, and the higher incidence of chronic illness in rural communities. Today's legislation would address this concern by providing a 10 percent increase in rural home health payments for the next two years and repealing the 15 percent cut in home health reimbursement scheduled to take place on October 1, 2001. 
   This legislation also proposes other changes I think are worth further mention, including a further delay in the arbitrary caps on the amount of physical, speech, and occupational therapy Medicare beneficiaries can receive, and a 10 percent increase in the base payment rate for hospice care, which hasn't been increased in over a decade. 
   Finally, while all of the provisions of this bill will together help to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries can continue to rely on the quality care they need and expect, this legislation includes a number of changes that will also make Medicare an even better deal. In particular, this bill will expand Medicare's emphasis on preventive medicine by adding such benefits as coverage for glaucoma screening, counseling for smoking cessation, and nutrition therapy. The bill will also eliminate the current three-year time limit on Medicare's coverage of immunosuppressive drugs, the expensive medicines that transplant recipients need to keep their bodies from rejecting their new organs or tissue. 
   In short, the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000 addresses many of the needs and concerns of Medicare beneficiaries and health care providers. I hope this legislation will help lay the framework for the enactment of bipartisan legislation to address these issues before the 106th Congress goes home.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, several months ago, the House of Representatives voted 237 to 197 to grant Permanent Normal Trade Relations to China. Before passing that legislation, however, the House added provisions that will require this and future Administrations to step up efforts to enforce China's compliance with its trade agreements and with internationally-recognized human rights norms. 
   Today the Senate will vote on whether we too will approve granting PNTR to China. That vote is on the limited question of whether to make permanent the favorable trade treatment that the United States has afforded to China one year at a time for the past 20 years--just that, and only that. The only difference in this upcoming vote and past votes on normal trade relations for China is: Shall normal trade relations be permanent, as they are with virtually every one of our other trading partners? 
   I have voted for normal trade relations in the past because China is a country of 1.3 billion people that is certain to play an important role in our future. The question is, will that role be a positive or negative one? 
   I happen to think that involvement with China is preferable to non-involvement. And I think on balance that the movement of China towards more freedom for its citizens and a market-based economy is much more likely to occur through normal trade relations than through estrangement. 
   While it is a close call, I have concluded that it is in our best interests to accord China Permanent Normal Trade Relations, because the legislation also establishes a commission to monitor human rights and labor issues in China and includes provisions that will ensure better enforcement of our trade agreements. 
   I would like to explain my reasoning. 
   I am mindful that there are some actions by China that give us pause. Threats directed at Taiwan, the transfer of missile technology to rogue states, and the abuse of human rights inside China are all reasons for concern. But I have seen almost no evidence that there has been any connection between Chinese behavior and Congress' annual review of China's trade status. On the other hand, there is evidence that the engagement with China by Western democracies has led to some improvement in a number of areas. It is my hope that those improvements will continue and be enhanced with Permanent Normal Trade Relations and China's accession to the WTO. 
   I am under no illusion that granting PNTR to China and allowing it to join the WTO will lead China inexorably toward democratization, better human rights and economic liberalization. However, I find it notable that China's security services, and conservative members of the military and Communist Party feel threatened by those developments. They are leading the opposition to President Zhang Zhemin and Premier Zhu Rongji's efforts to restructure China's economy and join the WTO precisely because they fear it will weaken the Communist Party's absolute hold on power. 
   The Dalai Lama and many of China's leading democracy and human rights advocates support Permanent Normal Trade Relations. They believe that the closer the economic relationship between the U.S. and China, the better the U.S. will be able to monitor human rights conditions in China and the more effectively the U.S. will be able to push for political reforms. However, other human rights advocates, including Harry Wu, believe granting China PNTR will weaken America's ability to influence China's human rights. That is why it is so important that the PNTR legislation establish a commission to monitor the human rights and labor situation in China and suggest ways we can intensify human-rights pressure on Beijing. 
   Most of the farm groups and business groups from my state believe PNTR and the implementation of the U.S.-China Bilateral Trade Agreement will result in a significant rise in U.S. exports to China. I hope that is true. But I fear they will be disappointed. Most impartial studies have concluded that the gains are likely to be modest. Furthermore, I am concerned by comments which were made by China's lead trade negotiator that China has conceded only a ``theoretical'' opportunity for the U.S. to export grain or meat to China. This makes me wonder whether China has any real intention of opening its markets as contemplated in the bilateral agreement. That is why it is so important that the PNTR bill includes provisions that will require the administration to step up its efforts to ensure that China complies with its trade agreements. 
   The systemic trade problems we are experiencing with China and many other countries, including Japan, Europe, and Canada, have little to do with this debate about Normal Trade Relations and a lot to do with our willingness to give concessional trade advantages to shrewd, tough, international competitors at the expense of American producers. Frankly, I am tired of it. 
   The recent U.S.-China Bilateral Trade Agreement was hailed as a giant step forward. In fact, it comes up far short of what our producers ought to be expecting in such agreements. If we were given a vote on that agreement, I would likely vote no, and tell our negotiators to go back and try again. 
   Our negotiators should have done better. It is outrageous that they signed an agreement that allows China, which already has a $70 billion merchandise trade surplus with the United States, to protect its producers with tariffs on American goods that are two to ten times higher than the tariffs we charge on Chinese goods. There is no excuse for that. But that circumstance  is not unique to China. It exists in our trade relations with Japan, with the European Union, with Canada, and others. We now have a mushrooming merchandise trade deficit that is running at an annual $400 billion-plus level. It is unsustainable and dangerous for our country. 
   We must begin to negotiate trade agreements with our trading partners that are tough, no nonsense agreements. We should develop rules of fair trade that give American workers and American businesses a fair opportunity to compete. 
   Regrettably most of our trade policies reward those corporations that want to produce where it's cheap and sell back into our marketplace. That is a recipe for weakening our economy and it must stop. 
   So, I voted for Normal Trade Relations with China previously, and I intend to vote to make it permanent, provided that we also require this and future Administrations to dramatically step up efforts to enforce China's compliance with its trade agreements and with internationally-recognized human rights norms. 
   However, I want it to be clear that, if we accord Permanent Normal Trade Relations to China and we discover that they are not in fact complying with the terms of the bilateral agreement we negotiated with them or that they are retreating rather than progressing on the issue of human rights for Chinese citizens, then I believe we must reserve the right to revoke China's Normal Trade Relations status.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the subcommittee chairman, Senator CAMPBELL, in bringing this hybrid bill to the Senate floor. The process by which we have arrived here today is one which I hope we will not replicate on other appropriations bills for the remainder of the year. I will not belabor the point about the process. It is unfortunate that the Senate was unable to enact its will on this legislation when it initially was reported out of the full Appropriations Committee on July 20. This is not a reflection on the chairman--he produced a bill in a short period of time acting on the instructions he was given. I cannot fault him for this. In fact, I congratulate him for many of the good decisions which were made on the substance of this legislation, but the fact remains that the Senate was not well-served by this process. 
   The conference report before us today provides $15.6 billion in discretionary budget authority for high priority law enforcement, trade enforcement and good government programs. It is approximately $1.1 billion above the level of funding approved by the Appropriations Committee in July. It is also $1.9 billion above last year's enacted level. Yet is remains $900 million below the President's request. This is one of the main problems with the underlying bill. While funds were added for a number of administration priorities, the bill remains deficient in a few areas, primarily regarding IRS staffing and counter-terrorism programs. I have received assurances that additional funds will be provided for a number of these deficiencies in later appropriations bills. Former President Reagan used to say, ``Trust, but verify.'' I trust my colleagues and look forward to verifying that additional funds will be found. 
   In many ways, however, this conference report is a good bill. Compared to the bill that was reported out of the Appropriations Committee, many of the problems with that bill have been resolved. Objectionable language regarding guns has been removed. Many agencies are fully funded at the requested level. The Customs Service's computer modernization program is well funded at $130 million. A good first step has been made to reduce the court house construction backlog. 
   This bill represents a responsible and balanced piece of legislation. I want to note that it has been a pleasure working with Senator CAMPBELL on this legislation. He and his staff have been professional and diligent in representing our interests and assisting us in formulating this legislation. I also want to take this opportunity to thank his staff, Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin,  and Lula Edwards for their hard work and cooperation in crafting this bill. I also wish to note the work of my staff, Chip Walgren, Steve Monteiro, and Nicole Kroetsch, on this legislation. 
   As the chairman noted, this bill funds base operations for the Treasury Department, its agencies and other general government operations. It maintains current operating levels in most instances and annualizes the costs of FTE, full time equivalent, increases made in last year's bill. It is designed to limit, as best we can, undue impacts on personnel. We have tried to avoid funding cuts which would require reductions in FTE after we increased FTE levels in fiscal year 2000. 
   Within the constraints imposed by our allocation, we have attempted to accommodate Members' requests where possible. However, our allocation also means that no Member received everything he or she requested. I would note that we received requests from over 75 individual Members to include funding for programs they consider of importance to their State or the Nation. 
   I must note that there were a number of deficiencies in this bill when it was reported out of the committee. While I did not participate in the drafting of the conference report, I am pleased that many of those deficiencies have been addressed in this legislation. 
   One of my major concerns is funding for the Customs Service Automated Commercial Environment, known as ACE. The original Senate bill had no funds for Customs' new and crucial computer improvement program. The existing system is the over-worked backbone of our trade flow system. It has been experiencing an ever increasing rate of failures and brownouts. Our trade volume has doubled over the last ten years. Based on the rate of growth in trade from 1996 to 1999, Customs anticipates an increase of over 50 percent in the number of entries by the year 2005. 
   This is an antiquated system which is becoming increasingly expensive to operate. We need to fund ACE now. The House has provided $105 million for ACE and I am pleased that the conference report includes $130 million for this crucial program.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in the IRS Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, we mandated specific goals for the IRS to meet in terms of taxpayer assistance and IRS performance. However, we continue to deny the IRS the resources it needs to meet these mandated goals. This is an administration concern, and it is my concern as well. We must do better by the IRS--if not on this bill--then in subsequent legislation. It is important that we maintain the concept and provision of ``service'' by the Internal Revenue Service. 
   I am pleased we were able to fund the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign at last year's level of $185 million. While this is still $10 million less than requested by the administration, it represents a continued commitment to getting the message to our young people that drugs can kill. To date we have appropriated over $500 million for the media campaign--with mixed results. We had two hearings this year on the campaign where many of these concerns were raised. While it remains a somewhat controversial program, I will continue to work with the chairman and others ensure that the campaign bears identifiable and quantifiable results. 
   Finally, I am pleased that the conference report fully funds the administration's requests for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to enforce existing gun laws. We fully fund the request to expand existing ballistics identification activities and to expand the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, YCGII, program into 12 additional cities. Also, the objectionable gun preference provision--inserted in the original Senate bill without debate--has been dropped. This was a wise action and I congratulate the chairman and others for taking this step. 
   Again, while I strongly protest the process by which this conference report was drafted, in most respects--this is a responsible bill. It goes far to meeting our commitments to law enforcement and our Federal employees. I am committed to working with Senators STEVENS and BYRD and the leadership to find additional funds for the IRS and counterterrorism on subsequent legislation. 
   Mr. President, briefly, the statements made by the Senator from Colorado, Mr. CAMPBELL, are accurate statements. He has done an outstanding job. I am very pleased to work with him. We worked closely together on this legislation. 
   He knows I feel somewhat aggrieved by the process. This bill has not followed the normal course in coming from the full Appropriations Committee to the floor of the Senate. It was taken in an unusual circumstance. It was put into conference, and now a conference report comes to the floor. There are Senators who perhaps would have offered amendments on the floor who were precluded from doing so. That really should not be the case. 
   This is not a good process. That is not Senator CAMPBELL's fault. The Senator from Colorado is someone who did what was required of him with respect to the leadership decision. I hope we will not have this approach used in future bills. I will have more to say about the Agriculture appropriations bill which is supposed to be in conference now but on which there is no conference. I will speak more about that at a later moment. 
   My sense is much of what is in this bill is on target. We are about $900 million below the budget request. We made progress in a whole range of areas. I was very concerned about the program called the ACE Program, the computer modernization program at the Customs Department, known as ACE--Automated Commercial Environment. 
   The fact is the system for keeping track of what is coming in and going out of this country in trade, the system used by the Customs Service is simply melting down. We need to modernize that system. This program designed to do that was not funded in some of the earlier versions. The bill that is now on the floor does begin that funding with $130 million, a pretty robust amount of funding. For that I am most appreciative. 
   This legislation is still short with respect to the Internal Revenue Service needs, with respect to some counterterrorism appropriations, with respect to an account called unanticipated needs. The chairman of the full committee has indicated to me that while this is the conference we are dealing with and we have to take action on this conference report, he anticipates being able to respond to those deficiencies in another circumstance. We will probably have an omnibus appropriations bill. The chairman of the full committee has indicated the deficiencies that exist will be responded to in some omnibus bill at the end. 
   We will have to wait and see if that happens, but I expect perhaps this conference report was held for some period of time and certainly would be held at the White House. There is some discussion of a potential veto unless the holes are filled, especially with respect to enforcement capabilities at the Internal Revenue Service. 
   I say that only because there are more and more sophisticated schemes being used by some of the largest corporate taxpayers about which the Secretary of the Treasury has talked a great deal. They do need enforcement capability to penetrate some of those schemes that are used to avoid paying a fair share of taxes. 
   Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin, and Lula Edwards on the majority side, and Chip Walgren, Steve Monteiro, and Nicole Koretsch spent a lot of time on this bill. As is the case with the legislative branch appropriations bill, this bill, the Treasury-general government appropriations bill, much credit must go to a lot of 
   people who worked a lot of hours to make sure we funded these agencies properly. 
   I wanted to make those points and say I do not like this process. It has produced a bill that is pretty good in almost all respects except for a handful of things that need some remedy. The chairman of the full committee has told me, and I think he has told the White House and others, that he intends to respond to those deficiencies in some other venue as we go along in the appropriations process, and I appreciate that. 
   As we work to finish our remaining appropriations bills, it is my fervent hope that we can do this in the regular order. Bills passed by the full Appropriations Committee in the Senate should be brought to the Senate floor for debate and amendment, and then we send them to conference. When we have debate and amend a bill in the Senate, as we did with the Agriculture appropriations bill, which is critically important--it has my amendment that gets rid of sanctions on the shipments of agricultural products and stops using food and medicine as a weapon. The Senate voted for it by a wide margin. 
   It has the amendment Senator JEFFORDS and I, Senator GORTON and others offered on reimportation of prescription drugs which would force the repricing of prescription drugs in this country. We adopted that. 
   The House passed their bill the early part of July. We passed ours mid to late July. I am a conferee, and there has not been a conference. My expectation is there will never be a conference because they do not want to have a conference on something that controversial. Either one of those put to a separate vote in the Senate and the House will pass by 70 percent. I am worried this process will be used to hijack that bill.  
   I serve notice that I intend to inquire of the majority leader later this afternoon when he comes to the floor or tomorrow at some great length saying, we lost the issue last year and were hijacked to stop using food and medicine as a weapon. They adjourned the conference and never reconvened. It looks as if they are fixing to not convene a conference this year. That is not the way we should expect the Senate to do its business. I am sorry to get off on that for a moment. 
   Again, I appreciate the good work of Senator CAMPBELL and look forward to not only proceeding with what is in this bill, which I think is good work, but also remedying a half dozen or so areas that I think come up short of what we need to do, and I think the chairman of the full committee has said we need to do that.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there are a number of important national provisions contained within the conference report. One provision, however, is both of national importance as well as of importance to the people of North Dakota. I am especially proud that the bill names the Federal Building and United States Courthouse in Grand Forks, ND after Judge Ronald N. Davies. 
   The late Judge Davies is one of North Dakota's proudest sons. While he grew up in Grand Forks, he is also claimed by Fargo. It was while serving as a judge in Fargo that President Eisenhower appointed him to the Federal bench in 1955. While not a household name, Judge Davies has gone down in history as the judge who ordered Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus to integrate the Little Rock public schools 43 years ago this month. It is only fitting that the Federal building in his hometown--constructed the year he was born--bear his name. 
   Some of my colleagues may have had the opportunity to visit the Norman Rockwell exhibit at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in downtown Washington. Among the many examples of Americana is the famous Rockwell painting of a little African-American girl, hair in pigtails, head held high, being escorted to school by U.S. Marshals. The painting puts a human face on an important turning point in our Nation's history. It was the result of the ruling by this modest and unassuming son of North Dakota that our Nation took one more step toward expanding the American dream to all Americans.

   Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, I will not object, but I want to make a comment to the majority leader. 
   This H-1B visa bill is important to all of us. It is important to those on the Democratic side of the aisle as well. We recognize that our economy is experiencing substantial and sustained growth, unparalleled growth, and to keep that on track we have to ensure our high-tech industry has the employees it needs. 
   I was at a company in California some while ago and the president of the company said we have 2,000 open positions for engineers right now that we can't fill. There is not any way for us to fill them--2,000 jobs, engineers we need and we can't get. So we understand this issue. We want it to be resolved. 
   I must say, the Democratic leader is not here today. On his behalf, I would mention to you that with regard to the  discussions that you and he have had about the potential for five amendments on a side--he was fairly optimistic about being able to clear that. We think that can be resolved. We hope it can be resolved on next Tuesday. It is our understanding the Republican leader was amenable in those discussions to an agreement that would allow five amendments on each side related to H-1B or to technology-related job training, education, and access. 
   It is also our understanding the Republican leader was amenable to our Democratic leader, or his designee, offering a Latino fairness amendment and a Liberian adjustment amendment. 
   I want to make a comment on his behalf that support of relief for immigrants who have fled wars in Haiti, El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, and to other longtime residents who have been in the United States since before 1986 is important to ensure fairness in the immigration system. If we do this, we will immediately increase the size of the legal workforce and also alleviate the shortage of low-skilled workers, and we will keep families together. 
   We believe our offer is reasonable. We hope we can work out an agreement. I think the discussions we have had about the five amendments on each side is something that should give us some hope that we will be able to resolve this soon and certainly before this Congress adjourns. 
   It is a very important issue. You want to address it. We want to address it. We believe we should find a way to connect here and reach agreement to do so.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield further under my reservation, as he knows, it is even difficult to agree to five amendments. We are willing to do that. The Democratic leader wants this bill done. I want it done. My colleagues want it done. We risk ending this session not doing something that we know should be done. We need to do this H-1B bill, and we need to increase the number of these visas. 
   Let me also respond to the point the Senator from Mississippi made a moment ago. The Senator from Mississippi pointed out that if we bring additional people in to fill jobs here, which makes sense--I much prefer they come in and fill jobs in this country rather than have the company move their operations to India or some other country--it makes sense also not to move all of those jobs into the same part of the country. Because information technology now allows us to do this work anyplace in the country, what about targeting some areas of the country where we have had outmigration, where we have lost population? That is what the Senator from Mississippi said. I think it makes eminent good sense. I hope we can work on at least a piece of that. 
   I will not object. Again I say it is our intention to get this legislation passed. We think the proposal offered in the last couple of days makes sense. We think we can probably clear that in the manner previously discussed between Senator DASCHLE and Senator LOTT.

Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate to discuss the fiscal policy questions that are ricocheting around this Chamber, and the House as well, about what the future will hold with respect to tax cuts, budget surpluses and/or deficits, investments in education, the possibility of reducing Federal indebtedness, and other spending. I want to talk about that because we now have a discussion in this town about the potential for big recurring budget surpluses every single year. 
   It was not too many years ago in Washington, DC, that we had the leading economists in the country saying the 1990s would be a decade of anemic economic growth. We had very large budget deficits, the country was not doing well, and the economists said for the next decade this economy is going to grow very slowly. 
   The economists did not know what they were talking about then. That is not unusual. I always thought there should be some sort of standard by which we measure economists and evaluate whether what they say has any validity in terms of what we experience. Of course, we have no such yardsticks, so these economists keep on talking and people keep on listening. That is why I am here today: What do we expect in the future, and what should we do in this country as a reasonable response to those expectations. 
   I want to for a moment talk about the early 1990s and recall where we were. The unified budget deficit in 1992 was $290 billion and rising--$290 billion just for that year and rising. Now we have a surplus in the year 2000. Economists said we would have continual, larger and larger deficits. That was wrong. We now have a surplus. 
   Economic growth: Then it averaged 2.8 percent. We were apparently at the end of, or beginning to see the end of, a recession. Economic growth averaged 2.8 percent annually for the previous 12 years, and it looked as if we were finally ending a recession. Since 1993, economic growth has averaged 3.9 percent a year. 
   Jobs: From 1988 to 1992, we had a difficult period, one of the worst in history in terms of the creation of new  jobs. The economy did not produce many new jobs. From 1993 to date, over 22 million new jobs have been created in this country. 
   Unemployment: It averaged 7.1 percent in the 12 years prior to 1993. Today it is at 4.1 percent on average, the lowest level in 30 years. 
   Home ownership fell from 1981 to 1992. Now it is the highest in history. 
   Median family income fell by about $1,800 from 1988 to 1992, adjusted for inflation. It has increased by over $5,000 since 1993. 
   Real wages fell 4.3 percent in 12 years; real wages are up 6.5 percent since 1993. 
   Welfare rolls increased 22 percent from 1981 to 1992; since then it has decreased by 53 percent. 
   The Dow Jones was 3,000 in 1992. It is 11,000 now. 
   The point is that this has been a very interesting time. Economists predicted this would not happen, but it did. Our economy is growing in a very robust fashion, and a lot of people are claiming credit for it. Probably everybody deserves a bit of the credit. 
   The 1993 Economic Reform Act that was passed by Congress, which reduced the deficit and which made tough choices, was a signal moment in this country's fiscal policy history. It dramatically changed what happened in this country. We had the courage to do what was right. It was politically difficult to do. In fact, my party paid a price for it in the next election. Guess what. It put this country back on track, away from the growing deficits toward economic growth and toward opportunity. 
   It is the year 2000, and we have had a remarkable 7 years. Now we are told by the same economists who predicted anemic growth for that decade that in the next decade we will have nothing but ever larger increasing budget surpluses. 
   Should we believe them? Is that the basis on which we should develop our future fiscal policy for this country? I do not think so. Because we are inebriated by the sound of 10 years of surpluses, we have politicians walking all around the political landscape saying: What we should do now is pass bills that call for massive tax cuts; lock it in, they say; put it in law; let's provide $1 trillion or $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. 
   It is very unwise, in my judgment, to do that. We do not know that we will have sustained economic growth. We do not know whether there will or will not be a recession 2, 3, or 5 years from now. 
   We don't know what the future holds. We would be very wise to be cautious in how we handle this issue of future surpluses. 
   We face some really critical choices. Those choices can provide both risk and opportunity: The risk of slipping back into big deficits, which no one in this country wants, and the opportunity to move forward and build on our recent economic successes. Those are the risks: Are we going to move backwards or forwards? 
   I am not here on the floor of the Senate to say one side is all wrong and the other side is all right on this issue, but I will say this. Those who say the only agenda in fiscal policy is to begin cutting taxes right now, and cut taxes deeply, and cut taxes for those who have the most income in this country, risk slipping us right back into big deficits, putting us right back into the same old deficit ditch. That is the last place this country ought to want to be. 
   How much budget surplus is there really? Even if all the things the economists say might happen, how much real budget surplus do we have? There have been some interesting pieces written in the last few weeks about this. There was a wonderful piece written by David Broder, a very respected columnist, in the Washington Post. There was an op-ed piece written by Paul Krugman, an economist, in the New York Times. There was a good piece in the U.S. News & World Report. They raised these questions, which we should raise here in Congress. 
   How much surplus do we really have to use, if we are honest about where we are headed and what we are doing? Let's look at it. CBO says, $4.6 trillion in surplus over the next 10 years. I come from a town of 300 people and a high school class of 9. It is really hard for me to grasp what a trillion dollars might be. In fact, it is hard for me to grasp a billion or a million dollars--but trillions of dollars, $4.6 trillion. So people hear that word, and it is as if they have taken a big bottle of Jack Daniels and started slugging it down. All of a sudden they are talking about all kinds of wild, irresponsible plans they have because we have $4.6 trillion in surplus. 
   But, of course, we do not have $4.6 trillion in surplus. What we have, in fact, if you take the Social Security trust funds away, is $2.2 trillion in surplus. But we really do not have $2.2 trillion in surplus. If you take the Medicare trust fund away--and everybody says they want to have a lockbox; and I assume you would want to lock a box with something in it--so you take that away, then you have $1.8 trillion available. 
   And then you must adjust that figure for realistic spending, that is, how much money we are going to spend. The budget caps suggest that we will actually reduce Federal spending in domestic discretionary accounts in this country. However, we will have a population that is increasing and some inflation. And we are not going to say, with respect to law enforcement and education, and all the other essential functions of Government, that we are going to actually spend less next year than we are spending this year. That is not realistic. So adjusting for some realistic investment that makes this a good country to live in--building roads and teaching kids, providing for our common defense, all the things that make us a good country--then you have $1.2 trillion left. 
   Then using some of the money for extending the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, which all of us know we must do because people are growing older and living better lives, you have $700 billion left. That is the surplus. 
   This analysis, incidentally, comes from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. They say, the real budget surplus is not $4.6 trillion or $2.2 trillion. The real budget surplus is probably about $700 billion. 
   So then how do you reconcile people coming to the floor of the Senate telling us they want to cut taxes by $1.3 trillion or more? 
   The only way you reconcile that puts us right back in the same deficit ditch that we have been in before. 
   Here is another analysis that comes from the Brookings Institution. This one says--using the exact same analysis but different elements of it--we do not have a $700 billion surplus, we have only about a $350 billion surplus--about $35 billion a year. That is the real surplus. They made some different calculations. I will not go through them all. 
   But the point is this: Under either of these analyses--confirmed and also discussed in the Paul Krugman piece, the David Broder piece, and others--under either of these analyses, we do not have trillions of dollars in surplus. I wish we did, but we do not. It would be terribly unwise for this country to decide to lock into law very large tax cuts--the biggest benefits of those cuts going to the wealthiest citizens in this country--at a time when it will result in large deficits in the future. We would be very smart to be very cautious as we approach this. 
   This is from Paul Krugman, who I believe is a really interesting thinker. He wrote an op-ed piece in the New York Times:  
   The most likely prospect is that those big surpluses won't materialize. And when the chickens that didn't hatch come home to roost, we will rue the days when, misled by sloppy accounting and rosy scenarios, we gave away the national nest egg.  
   His point is a very important one. I am going to talk about it in a moment. But what are our priorities if we are realistic about what we are going to do and what we think will happen? Our priorities ought to be to pay down the Federal debt first and foremost. If in bad economic times you increase the Federal debt, in good economic times you ought to reduce the Federal debt. That is the import of what Paul Krugman was saying, among other things. 
   Here is another piece from U.S. News & World Report:  
   Still, the same lack of understanding about the budget is evident today as we head into the crucial weeks of the campaign with big budget numbers and big political promises. If we get it wrong again, we could head back to those awful years--decades of apparently insuperable deficits, slow growth, and recurrent recessions. 
   All of us could relate to the numbers better if we could knock off a few zeros from the trillions being discussed. Most American families with a lot of debt would know what  to do with a windfall. They'd instinctively feel better if they used the money to redeem loans, freeing themselves from long-term obligations and insecurity, and I suggest the same principle should apply to the country, which is in exactly the same position.  
   The point is this. With all the opportunities we have ahead of us if, in fact, we have budget surpluses, those will be lower than generally expected. And of all the opportunities ahead of us, the first choice and first claim, in my judgment, ought to be to reduce the Federal debt. 
   We have a lot of proposals out there. There is one by Governor Bush where he talks about very substantial tax cuts. Frankly, I do not support them. It is not that I do not support providing some targeted tax cuts. Working families deserve some help in this area. But we cannot come around here with $1 trillion or $1.4 trillion in tax cuts, given what we expect the real surplus to be. It would put us right back in the same deficit ditch, right back in the same ditch. 
   What we need to do in this political debate is to see if we can't, as Republicans and Democrats, understand that when we respond to this question of the fiscal policy of this country, and what the future might hold, that we be reasonably conservative and cautious, and protect ourselves from retreating back to the same policies we had previously. 
   We are all responsible for those policies. There is not a set of fingerprints that lays the responsibility at one door with respect to what happened in this country. But we all ought to be responsible, as well, to say we are not going to let it happen again. In my judgment, we can do that now by saying to those who are campaigning for office--both for this Chamber and the other body, and also for the Presidency--let's have a real discussion about what the real surplus might be, and then evaluate what our priorities are with respect to that. 
   Now, the tax cuts, I am not going to talk about them so much. The tax cuts that are being proposed around here are terrible. In almost every case they provide the biggest benefits to those who need them least. I know people will say: Well, that is all the same old class warfare. It is not class warfare. The bottom 60 percent of the population, earning incomes up to $40,000, get $227 a year; and the top 1 percent get $46,000 each. That is not tax class warfare, that is just a tax cut that should not happen. 
   The question is, What should we do now? In my judgment, what we should do is establish a set of priorities, both in this Presidential campaign and in the campaigns for the Congress--the Senate and the House--and say, the priorities for using the actual budget surplus, which is much lower than the trillions of dollars being kicked around by some, is to, No. 1, pay down the Federal debt; No. 2, ensure the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare--we have a responsibility to do that--No. 3, address this country's urgent needs, and that means making some investments that we need in education, and other areas; and, no. 4, provide targeted tax relief for working families. All of these represent the priorities in the order that I see them. Others may see them differently. 
   I think it is important, before we start down this road, to address this question of whether the trillions of dollars people are kicking around as expected future surpluses are going to be real. The answer is, with almost all thoughtful economists responding to it, to say, no, these are not real; the surplus is going to be much, much smaller than that. That ought to temper our desire and demand and appetite for these huge tax cuts being proposed that will result in very large future deficits. 
   The single best thing we could do for this country and its children and our future is to begin paying down the Federal debt with the actual surpluses that will come in future years. It is the single most important way of strengthening this country's economy. 
   I seldom ever quote Alan Greenspan because we have such disagreements on monetary policy, but I will break that rule today. He came to Congress, the Senate Select Committee on Aging, and said:  
   ..... there are limited fiscal resources in this country and that until we have strong evidence that there is a major structural increase in the surplus, that trying to commit it to various different program[s] or even tax cuts, I think, is unwise.  
   His point is, we ought to use the surplus to reduce indebtedness. We have a nearly $5.7 trillion Federal debt. If during bad times, during tough times, this country had to run up its debt in order to make ends meet, then during good times the greatest gift we could offer to America's children is to say we will reduce that indebtedness. It is not just a gift to children, it also happens to be the best way to assure long-term economic growth. 
   I will make one additional point as we begin discussing fiscal policy and tax issues. My presentation here will not dim the appetite of those who come to the floor and say: I don't care about numbers. I don't care about philosophy. I was elected to Congress for one thing, and I am going to propose tax cuts until my last breath. I am going to propose tax cuts because those are the only two words I know. I don't care about how it all adds up or subtracts or how it all works out. Good for them. But they are the kind of people who steer this country into the deficit ditch, and I, for one, am not going to be a part of it. 
   I would say to them this: To the extent that we have some ability--and I think there is some ability, even though we are going to have smaller surpluses--to provide tax cuts, I would like tax cuts to go not just to the people who have benefited most from this economy. We have, after all, one-half of the world's billionaires in the United States; good for us--but when we talk about tax cuts, I would much sooner see scarce resources go to working families. They are the ones who need them most. 
   It is interesting. Every time someone talks about a tax cut around here, they only talk about income taxes. Here are the taxes we collect in this country. This big red piece of the pie is payroll taxes. Those at the lowest end of the economic ladder pay a payroll tax that is the same tax as those at the highest end. Nobody wants to talk about these payroll taxes. These are the ones that have increased very substantially in recent years. So when we talk about tax cuts, maybe we could talk about trying to help those who are paying payroll taxes as well, rather than just those who are paying income taxes. 
   Nearly 100 percent of the bottom fifth of our population are paying more in payroll taxes than income taxes. In fact, even the middle fifth, those making between $43,000 and $65,000 a year, 80 percent of them are paying more in payroll taxes than in income taxes. Yet every time you hear somebody saying let's cut taxes, all they want to talk about is income taxes because that means their tax cut proposal is going to benefit those with the most income. What about a tax cut proposal that says we are going to 
   offset some of the burden of those folks who are going to work every day for the minimum wage and are paying a heavy payroll tax. How about giving them a little relief. 
   So when the next time comes that we in Congress are talking about tax cuts, I am going to bring some of these charts out and ask: Does this not count, the pie chart that shows payroll taxes? Does it not count that the income earners at the lowest end of the scale are paying these things and it doesn't matter somehow? They don't deserve any help? That is just a tax that we won't talk about. That is not fair. It is not the way to do business. 
   I think the warnings--perhaps the small craft warnings at this point, but major warnings later--by some good economists are saying: Watch out what you are doing here, talking about $4 trillion of tax cuts or $4 trillion of surplus or a $2.2 trillion surplus or a $1.5 trillion tax cut; watch what you are doing here and be careful, because this is not going to materialize, and if you do what you are talking about doing, it will pose significant dangers to the American economy. 
   The best way to assure economic growth and opportunity in this country's future is to decide that if we have surpluses--and I hope we do--we will commit first and foremost those budget surpluses to reducing our country's indebtedness. Again, if in tough times you run up the debt, in good times this country ought to be able to pay it down. That is the greatest gift to America's children, and that is also the surest way to long-term economic health, growth, and opportunities.  
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   September 15, 1999: 
   Larry Gene Ashbrook, 47, Fort Worth, TX; Kristi Beckel, 14, Fort Worth, TX; Mackersher Beckford, 22, Miami, FL; Shawn C. Brown, 23, Fort Worth, TX; Sydney R. Browning, 36, Fort Worth, TX; Keith Brunson, 28, Miami, FL; Gary Burgin, 51, Cincinnati, OH; Ralph Burgin, 58, Cincinnati, OH; Jorge DelRio, 36, Miami, FL; Joseph D. Ennis, 14, Fort Worth, TX; Cassandra Griffin, 14, Fort Worth, TX; Leardis Lane, 59, Chicago, IL; Omar Martinez, 32, Miami, FL; Jerry Lee Miller, 63, Salt Lake City, UT; Ali Panjwani, 32, San Antonio, TX; Lamar Price, 34, Detroit, MI; Justin M. Ray, 17, Fort Worth, TX; Calvin D. Sangrey, 45, Seattle, WA; Lawrence Venson, 21, Washington, DC; Unidentified Male, 45, Sacramento, CA. 
   Today is the one-year anniversary of a horrific shooting in Fort Worth, Texas. On this day one year ago, a gunman burst into the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary during a youth rally. Seven of the people whose names I just read were shot and killed and seven were wounded by a man they did not know. The gunman stormed into the church, cursed their religion, and shot multiple rounds of gunfire before he turned the gun on himself. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Nevada, Senator REID, and I were discussing some dialog that had taken place on the floor of the Senate earlier today, and we wanted to visit a bit about the issue of a prescription drug benefit for the Medicare program. 
   We are in session in this 106th Congress perhaps only another 4 or 5 weeks at the outset, and much is left to be done prior to the adjournment of this Congress. 
   One of the issues that most people think is very important to the American people is for this Congress to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. Almost everyone in this country now understands that the price of prescription drugs is moving up very quickly. Last year, the price of prescription drugs increased very rapidly. In fact, the cost of prescription drugs last year alone, because of increased utilization, price inflation and other things, increased 16 percent. 
   The senior citizens in this country are 12 percent of our country's population but consume one-third of all the prescription drugs in America. Senior citizens are at a point in their lives where they have reached declining and diminished income years and they are least able, in many cases, to be able to afford to pay increasing prescription drug prices. 
   There are a range of issues with prescription drugs. I talked about some of these in this Chamber before. There are wild price variations. The same drug in the same bottle made by the same company is being sold in Canada for a tenth of the price that it is sold to a consumer in the United States. 
   The other day I held up two pill bottles of medicine on the floor of the Senate--exact same medicine, made by the same company, put in the same bottle, shipped to two different pharmacies, one in the U.S. and one in Canada. One was priced three times higher than the other. Guess which. The U.S. consumer was asked to pay three times more than the Canadian consumer for the same prescription drug. That is one issue. 
   There is a second issue changing or altering the Medicare program to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. There is no question that if the Medicare program were being written today instead of the  early 1960s it would include a benefit for prescription drugs. Many of the lifesaving prescription drugs that are now available were not available then. 
   We clearly should add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. We have proposed, the President has proposed, and the Vice President has proposed a plan that would provide an optional and an affordable prescription drug benefit available to senior citizens to try to help them cover the cost of their needed prescription drugs. 
   Earlier today we had Members of the Senate talk about this being a big Government scheme. It is no more a scheme than the Medicare program. The Medicare program is not a scheme at all. It is something this Congress did over the objections of those who always object to anything that is new. We have a few in this Chamber. It has been done for two centuries. No matter what it is, they say: We object. 
   The Medicare program was developed in the early 1960s at a time when one-half of the senior citizens in America had no health care coverage at all. We proposed a Medicare program. Now 99 percent of the senior citizens have health care coverage. 
   Do you know of any insurance companies that are going around America saying: You know what we would like to do is provide unlimited health care insurance to people who have reached the retirement years? We think it is going to be a good business proposition to find those who are in their 60s, 70s, and 80s and provide health insurance because we think that is really going to be profitable. It is not the case. 
   That is why 40 years ago half the senior citizens couldn't afford to buy health insurance. That is why there was a need for the Medicare program. We not only have a Medicare program, and one that works, but we now need to improve it by offering a prescription drug benefit. When we do, the same tired, hollow voices of the past emerge in this Chamber to say: You know what they are proposing is some sort of Government scheme. 
   It is not a scheme. It is not a scheme at all. It is an attempt to strengthen a program that every senior citizen in this country knows is valuable to them and their neighbors. That is what this is. 
   Most Members of the Senate understand that we ought to do this. Some who understand it ought to be done, don't want to do it through the Medicare program and are proposing we provide some stimulus for the private insurance companies to offer some sort of prescription drug benefit. But the private insurance companies come to our office and say: We won't be able to offer this benefit; we would be required to charge senior citizens $1,100 for $1,000 worth of benefit for prescription drugs. They say: We are not going to offer it; it doesn't add up; we won't do it. That is what the U.S. executives say. 
   I am happy to bring out a chart, as I did the other day, to quote the head of the Health Insurance Association and others who say it won't work--I am talking about the plan proposed by the majority party--it doesn't work at all. But to have them come to the floor of the Senate calling our desire to add an optional prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program some sort of Government scheme doesn't wash. We are trying to do something that we think is thoughtful, we think is necessary, and we think most senior citizens will take advantage of on an optional basis because they understand the price of prescription drugs continues its relentless increase year after year after year. 
   We have people who have never supported the Medicare program. They don't talk about it, but they have never supported it, never liked it. It is the same people who don't like to add a prescription drug benefit to the program. They say: Gee, we have financial problems with Medicare. 
   Do you know what our problems are with Medicare and Social Security? Our problems are success. People are living longer. In the year 1900, people in this country were expected to live to be 48 years of age; a century later, people are expected to live to almost 78 years of age. In one century, we have increased the life expectancy nearly 30 years. That is success. 
   Does that put some strains on the Medicare program and Social Security program because people are living longer? Yes. But of course that strain is born of success. This isn't something to be concerned about; it is something to be proud of. People are living longer and better lives, and part of that is because of the Medicare program. We ought to improve that program by adding the prescription drug benefit to that program now, in this Congress, in the remaining 4 weeks. 
   I am happy to yield to my colleague from the State of Nevada.

   Mr. DORGAN. I say to my colleague from Nevada, we do not have an answer, except I presume it is probably fairly simple: It is about profits. The companies that manufacture prescription drugs have a manufacturing plant, and they produce those drugs in the plant, and they put them in a bottle and put a piece of cotton on top, and they seal it up, and they ship it off. They will ship a bottle to Grand Forks, ND; they will ship a bottle to Reno, NV; and 
   they will ship a bottle to Pittsburgh, PA. Then they will ship a bottle to Winnipeg, Canada, and into Brussels or Paris, and they price it. 
   They say the U.S. consumers will pay the highest prices of anybody in the world for the same pill in the same bottle; we will charge the American consumer triple, in some cases 10 times, what we charge others. Why? Because they can. Why? Because they want to. 
   The pharmaceutical industry has profits the Wall Street Journal says are the ``envy of the world.'' I want them to succeed. I appreciate the work in developing new drugs. But a lot of work in the development of new drugs is publicly funded by us, through the National Institutes of Health and other scientific research. 
   I want them to be successful. I don't, however, want a pricing policy that says to the U.S. consumer, you pay the highest prices for drugs of anybody in the world. It is not fair. And too many of our consumers--especially senior citizens--have reached that stage in life where, with a diminished income, they cannot afford it. 
   One of the results of the unfairness of all of this and one of the results of not having a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program is this: Three women who suffer from breast cancer are all seeing the same doctor and the doctor prescribes tamoxifen. Two of the women say: I can't possibly afford it; I have no money. The third, who can, says: I will purchase my dose of tamoxifen, and we will divide it into three, and we will each take a third of a dose. 
   Or the woman, a senior citizen in Dickinson, the doctor testified before a hearing, suffered breast cancer, had a mastectomy. The doctor said: Here's the prescription drug you must take in order to reduce your chances of a recurrence of breast cancer. The woman said: Doctor, I can't possibly do that; I can't possibly afford that prescription drug. I will just take my chances with the recurrence of breast cancer. 
   The point is that senior citizens across this country understand, because their doctor has told them the drugs they need to try to deal with their disease and try to improve their lives, all too often they cannot afford it. 
   In hearing after hearing I have held, I have heard from senior citizens who say: My druggist is in my grocery store. The pharmacy is in the back of the store. When I go to the grocery store, I must go to the back of the  store first because that is where I buy my prescription drug. Only then do I know how much I have left for food. 
   In State after State, I heard that message. It is not unusual. 
   That is why this is such an important issue, both with respect to international pricing and the unfairness of asking the American consumer to pay the highest prices in the world for these prescription drugs, but also in terms of whether we add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. 
   We have proposed that. What has happened is we have people dragging their feet here in the Congress. While they don't want to be against it, they understand we should do it; neither do they really want to do it in the Medicare program, because they have never believed that was a very good program and it was a program pretty much resisted by those would resist everything, as I said.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, some weeks ago I was attending a meeting in North Dakota dealing with farm issues. An elderly woman came to the meeting. She sat quietly, said nothing. At the end of the meeting, after everyone else had pretty much left, we had shaken hands with a number of them, she came over to me. She was very quiet. She grabbed my arm and she said:  
   I just want to talk to you for a moment about prescription drug prices.  
   I am guessing she was in her mid to late seventies. She said she had serious health problems and she just couldn't afford to buy the prescription drugs her doctor said she needed. 
   As she began talking about this, her eyes began brimming with tears and then tears began running down her cheeks and her chin began to quiver and this woman began to cry about this issue, saying:  
   I just can't afford to buy the prescription drugs my doctor says I need.  
   This repeats itself all over this country. If it is no longer a question of whether we ought to do this--and perhaps that is the case because we hear almost everyone saying we ought to do this--then the question remaining is: How do we do it?  
   We say we have a program that works. The Medicare program works. It has worked for nearly four decades. We know nearly 99 percent of America's senior citizens are covered by that Medicare program. And we say let's provide an optional prescription drug benefit that senior citizens, with a small copayment, can access. 
   Others say let's not do that. That is big government. Medicare is big government, they say. They say what we want to do is have the private insurance companies somehow write policies that would provide prescription drug coverage. 
   Is that big insurance? If one is big government, are they saying we don't want big government, we want big insurance to do this? 
   But if it is big insurance--and it is--let's hear what the insurance folks have to say about it. My colleague just mentioned it. Here is a chart. 
   Mr. Charles Kahn, President of the Health Insurance Association of America, says:  
   We continue to believe the concept of the so-called drug-only private insurance simply would not work in practice.  
   It simply would not work in practice. 
   I have had two CEOs of health insurance companies come to my office and say to me: Senator, those who are proposing a prescription drug benefit by private insurance company policy, I want to tell you as a President of a company, it will not work. We will not offer such a policy. And if we did, we would have to charge $1,100 for a policy that pays $1,000 worth of benefits. 
   That is Charles Kahn, again, from the Health Insurance Association of America. 
   Private drug-insurance policies are doomed from the start. The idea sounds good, but it cannot succeed in the real world.  
   I don't know of an insurance company that would offer a drug-only policy like that or even consider it.  
   That is from the insurance industry itself. Let me just for a moment ask this question. 
   If the insurance industry would have been able to offer a policy for prescription drugs that was affordable and practical and usable, would they not already have done so? Ask yourself: If in 1960 it would have been profitable for health insurance companies to say, Our marketing strategy is to try to find the oldest Americans, those who are nearest the time when they will have a maximum call for needs in the health care industry, to find those people and see if we can insure them--if that were the case, would there have been a need for the Medicare program? No, there would not have. 
   Of course, that is not the case. In the private sector, these companies are after profits. How do you find profits in health insurance? Find some young, strapping man or woman who is 20 years old, healthy as a horse, is not going to get sick for 40 years, and sell them a health insurance policy and not have them see a doctor in 40 years, and all the premium is profit. Good for them, good for the company, and good for the healthy person. 
   But they do not make money by seeking out someone who is 70 years old and probably 5 or 10 years away from the serious illness that is going to have a claim on that health insurance policy, and that is why, in 1960, senior citizens could not afford to buy health insurance. Half of American senior citizens did not have it. The Federal Government said, we have to do something about it. Even when there were those who were pulling the rope uphill, trying to do the positive things, we had people here with their foot stuck in the ground saying: No, we will not go; no, it will not work; it is big government; no, it is a scheme. 
   We have such people on every single issue in this Chamber. There is a story about the old codger, 85 years old, who was interviewed by a radio announcer. The radio announcer said to him: You must have seen a lot of changes in your life, old timer. The guy said: Yep, and I've been against every one. 
   We know people like that. There are a lot of them in politics. I can tell you about people who are against everything new. Then, of course, we do it because it is important to do it; it makes life in this country better. 
   About 10 years later, guess what. They said: Yes, I started that; I was for that. Of course, they were not. 
   This is not about Republicans or Democrats at this moment. There is no Republican way or Democratic way to get sick; you just get sick. There is no Democratic or Republican way to put together a program like that. 
   My point is there are some, Governor Bush and others, who have a proposition with respect to prescription drugs that will not work because those on whom they rely to offer a policy say they cannot offer it; it will not work; it cannot be done. 
   If that is the case, and if they believe, as we do, that we ought to put a prescription drug plan in the Medicare program, then I say join us and help us and work with us over the next 4 weeks and get this done. 
   The question is not whether, it is how, and the answer to the how is here. You cannot do it the way you say you want to do it. You cannot pretend to the American people you have a plan that will work when the industry you say will do it says it is unworkable. 
   I did not come here to cast aspersions on anybody or any group. This is one of those issues of perhaps three or four at the end of this 106th Congress that we owe to the American people to do, and the only way we are going to get this done is if those who say they favor a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program will stop coming to the floor and calling the Medicare program some giant Government scheme. Those who do that understand they are calling a program that has worked for 40 years, that has made life better for a lot of folks in this country, a scheme. 
   Let's work together. Let's decide we will embrace those things we know will work and help people. That is why I am pleased 
   the Senator from Nevada has joined me today. 
   I will not go on at length, but the other issue--and at some point I want to visit with the Senator from Nevada about the other issue--is a Patients' Bill of Rights. We held a hearing in his State on that issue. Sometime I want to talk on the floor of the Senate about that hearing. That is another health issue we ought to do in this 4-week period. We owe it to the American people to do it. It is so important.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator is right. I end by saying this is not about politics; it is about solutions to real problems. We understand this is a problem. Prescription drug prices are too high. They are going up too rapidly. Senior citizens cannot afford them. 
   We have a serious problem in this country in this area. We understand we have a responsibility to do something about it. What? There are two choices. One does not work, and one we know will. This is not rocket science. We know what works. All we need to do is get enough votes in this Congress to decide we will do what works to put a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program which is available to senior citizens across this country. Six or eight weeks from now, it can be done. We will have it in the Medicare program, and there will be a lot of senior citizens advantaged because of it. 
   We will have more to say about this, but because others wanted to come to the floor today and talk about schemes and other things, I thought it was important--and the Senator from Nevada did as well--to provide the perspective about what this issue is. 
   A lot of people speak with a lot of authority. Some are not always right but never in doubt. Some old codger said to me one day: There are a lot of smart people in Washington and some ain't so smart; it's hard to tell the difference. 
   He is right about that. The currency in Congress is a good idea to address a  real problem that needs addressing. We have a real problem that needs addressing now, and a good idea to address this problem of prescription drugs is to put in the Medicare program an optional program which is affordable, with a small copay that will give senior citizens who need it an opportunity to get the prescription drugs they need to improve their lives. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   September 11, 1999: 
   Terry Baines, 21, Houston, TX; 
   Rodrigo Barrera, 23, Chicago, IL; 
   Armida Enriquez-Sotelo, 30, Denver, CO; 
   Kris Frazier, 26, Oakland, CA; 
   Jose Frezzia, 44, Miami, FL; 
   Anthony Harris, 25, Chicago, IL; 
   Camiela Hinds, 36, Nashville, TN; 
   Rendell Hamilton, 23, Detroit, MI; 
   Jose McDuffie, 34, Philadelphia, PA; 
   Joseph Mendoza, 17, Houston, TX; 
   Mickey Peace, Dallas, TX; 
   Maurice Jackson, 24, Oklahoma City, OK; 
   Jose Monge-Rodriguez, 31, Denver, CO; 
   James K. Nelson, 56, Seattle, WA; 
   Hugh Rollins, San Francisco, CA; 
   James Thorne, 46, Philadelphia, PA; 
   Unidentified Male, 25, Newark, NJ; 
   Unidentified Male, Newark, NJ; 
   Unidentified Male, San Francisco, CA; 
   Unidentified Male, 45, York, PA. 
   One of the gun violence victims I mentioned, 56-year-old James Nelson of Seattle, was shot in the chest and killed one year ago today when he went into his kitchen to investigate a noise he heard outside. James was shot through his kitchen window and died on the floor while trying to call for help. 
   Another victim, 30-year-old Armida Enriquez-Sotelo of Denver, was shot and killed one year ago today by her estranged husband during an argument before he turned the gun on himself. 
   Following are other victims of gun violence who died one year ago this weekend. 
   September 9, 2000: 
   Carlos Amador, 33, Dallas, TX; 
   Lionel Glover, 23, Chicago, IL; 
   Annie Goodman, 73, Miami, FL; 
   Marlys Harper, 28, Elkhart, IN; 
   Michael Hooten, 34, Atlanta, GA; 
   Michael L. Murphy, Jr., 19, Chicago, IL; 
   Courtney Smith, 45, Houston, TX; 
   Harold Waytus, 79, St. Louis, MO; 
   Richard Williams, 43, Chicago, IL; 
   Robert Young, 32, Baltimore, MD; 
   Unidentified Male, 16, San Jose, CA. 
   September 10, 2000: 
   Donald Burford, 51, Dallas, TX; 
   Daniel Delarge, 21, Philadelphia, PA; 
   Curly Faulkner, 22, Memphis, TN; 
   Mardio House, 26, Baltimore, MD; 
   Evon Morgan, 48, Dallas, TX; 
   Brian Robinson, 32, New Orleans, LA; 
   Anthony Sanders, 24, Chicago, IL; 
   Gholam Sohelinia, 48, Nashville, TN; 
   Frank Walsh, 41, Philadelphia, PA; 
   Cory L. Ward, 23, Gary, IN; 
   Tavaris Williams, 22, Baltimore, MD; 
   Unidentified Male, 42, Nashville, TN. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to commend the chairman and ranking minority member of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee for including $43.617 million for Solar and Renewable Energy activities, and to discuss briefly a renewable energy project in my home state of North Dakota. 
   One of the most abundant sources of energy in the Upper Great Plains region is wind. My State of North Dakota ranks first in wind power production potential, and the Department of Energy has said that North Dakota alone could capture enough wind energy to supply 36 percent of the power needs of the lower 48 States. Not only does wind offer a clean and inexpensive form of energy, it also could provide our rural residents with an important source of income. DOE estimates that a 1,000-acre farm could earn as much as $80,000 per year in wind royalties. 
   One wind energy initiative of particular interest to me is being conducted on the Turtle Mountain Chippewa Reservation by the Center for New Growth and Economic Development at the Turtle Mountain Community College. I had hoped that the Committee would have designated $1 million for this project, but the Subcommittee's current allocation was not at a level to accommodate funding for new start-up projects in the renewable energy accounts. 
   I recognize that it is difficult to speculate about what the final budget allocation for this bill might allow, but I would ask the chairman and the ranking minority member to consider designating $1 million for this project in conference should additional funds for the programs under the Subcommittee's jurisdiction become available.

   Mr. DORGAN. Yes, the Senator's understanding is correct. The Center for New Growth and Economic Development will work with Turtle Mountain Community College to develop a curriculum on ``windsmithing'' so that others can learn the trade of wind energy. The Turtle Mountain Chippewa Reservation is located in the middle of a natural wind tunnel so this is a natural place to develop expertise relating to wind energy.

   Mr. DORGAN. Will the minority leader yield for a moment? I would like to say I am very interested in the lockbox. I am also interested in making sure there is something in the box before it is locked. We have $1.3 trillion in tax cut proposals around here for surpluses that don't yet exist. So when these are offered, I think some of us would like the opportunity to offer amendments. That is the point the Senator from South Dakota makes, and a very appropriate point.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, some long while ago I was at a meeting in North Dakota, and I was talking about senior citizen issues and health care, and a range of things, and I used a statistic. I told the senior citizens who were at the meeting that there are two men for every woman over the age of 80 in the United States. And an older fellow rose from his chair and leaned forward on his cane and said to me: Young man, that is one of the most useless statistics I have ever heard. 
   I thought about that for a while. There are a lot of useless statistics used in all kinds of different venues. In this discussion about trade, there will certainly be plenty of statistics used. Perhaps plenty of them will be useless. But I do want to talk about some trade statistics today because we are now debating the motion to proceed to the bill that would make normal trade relations with China permanent. 
   I think there are a lot of wonderful things going on in this country. All of us should count our blessings that we live in a country that is doing so well. The economy is growing, growing rapidly; we have unprecedented economic growth and opportunity. It is a great time. Unemployment is down, way down. Inflation is down, way down. Crime is down. Home ownership is up. 
   You could look at all of the data. Productivity is up, up, way up. All of the data shows that this country is doing very well. All of us need to be thankful for that. 
   But there are some storm clouds on the horizon in one area, and that is in the area of international trade. And we should not ignore them. 
   This is not about Republicans and Democrats. It is about a public policy area this country must address. If we don't address it in a thoughtful way, we will not continue this kind of economic opportunity and growth. 
   Here is a chart that describes what is happening in trade. This is the merchandise trade deficit for this country; that is, the trade in goods. I have not included the trade in services, only the trade in merchandise goods. This is essentially manufacturing. We eliminated the red ink in the budget. The budget deficits are gone. But the trade deficits are going up, way up. This year especially. In June, the monthly merchandise trade deficit increased to $36.8 billion. The deficit for the first half of this year was $216 billion. That means that at the end of this year we will probably have a $430 billion merchandise trade deficit. We are buying from abroad $1.2 billion a day in goods more than we are selling abroad, and that can't continue forever. 
   With whom are these deficits? Well, for the first half of the year 2000, the merchandise deficit that we have with Mexico is nearly $12 billion; with Canada, $22.6 billion and increasing dramatically. With the European Union, it is a dramatic increase from $16 billion for the first half of last year to $26 billion this year. With China, it has increased from $29 billion to $36 billion. 
   These are not yearly figures. These are 6-month figures, January through June. So this is equal to a $72 billion annual trade deficit with the country of China. With Japan, this is almost unforgivable, year after year, forever, we have had these huge budget deficits with Japan. Now they are totaling nearly $80 billion a year. 
   What is happening is wrong. I am not a classic ``protectionist,'' as the press would describe some of those involved in this debate. I believe we need to expand international trade. I believe we ought to be open for competition and be required to compete. But I also believe the trade ought to be fair; the rules of trade ought to be fair. Globalization attends to it some requirement that we have global rules, not only global markets. 
   What is happening here, with Japan and China and, yes, others, is they are selling into our marketplace at a record pace in a whole range of areas, yet we are not able to access opportunities in their marketplace. I wonder how many Americans know what the tariff would be on a pound of U.S. beef that is shipped to Japan today? Do you want to ship a T-bone steak that comes from a ranch in North Dakota to Tokyo? What do you think the tariff would be on a T-bone steak going to Tokyo? I will tell you what it is. It is over 40 percent, a tariff of over 40 percent on American beef going into Japan. That is after we have negotiated an agreement with Japan. That shows the failure of our negotiations. A country that has an $80 billion trade surplus with us is allowed to have a greater than 40-percent tariff on American beef going to them. Obviously, there is something fundamentally wrong with the way we negotiate trade agreements. 
   We recently negotiated a trade agreement with China, a big, old country with 1.2 billion people. One can't help but stand on the Great Wall of China and look at those mountains, at the country, and express wonder at who they are and where they have been, their rich history, and what they will be tomorrow. What an interesting country. But we have a $72 billion merchandise trade deficit with China. We just negotiated an agreement that is a bad agreement. Let's take automobiles as one example: China has 1.2 billion potential drivers, as soon as they all reach driving age, and we want to sell American cars to some of them. So here is what we said when we negotiated the agreement: This is what we will do. You have a $72 billion trade surplus with us, or we have a big deficit with you. So we will negotiate a bilateral agreement with you where we will have a 2.5-percent tariff on any Chinese 
   automobiles you want to send to us, and we will have a 25-percent tariff on any automobiles we send into China. In other words, after the negotiation is done, we will agree that we  will accept a tariff imposed by China that is 10 times higher on U.S. automobiles than will be imposed by the United States on vehicles from China. 
   Ask somebody, how on Earth can that happen? Was somebody drinking heavily while they negotiated? How can one possibly agree to something that is that unfair? I could go on and on. It will serve no purpose, except to say that these numbers ought to demonstrate that while things are doing well in this country and while we are blessed with a wonderful economy, these storm clouds with respect to the trade imbalance need to be attended to. We need better trade agreements, and we need more attention to trade agreements that require elements of fair trade between our country and Japan, between us and the Chinese, between us and Europe, and between us and Canada. 
   Last month, The Wall Street Journal had a piece ``Will the Trade Gap Lower the Boom?'' It notes that our trade gap is now about 4.2 percent of our overall economy, and it goes on to say that:  
   A percentage that high would scare the green eyeshades right off the analysts in many industrialized nations.  
   We don't hear a whisper about it--not here, not around the country, very seldom in the press. This is a very unusual story. It also says:  
   But there is a disaster scenario that ..... gets more likely with each breath that fills the trade deficit balloon. ..... On average, the current account gap hits its limit at 4.2 percent of GDP, exactly where the U.S. finds itself today. ..... Confidence in our economy could collapse before the rest of the world is firmly back on its feet.  
   The point is there is something wrong here, and Congress cannot ignore it. That is why Senator STEVENS, Senator BYRD, and I created in legislation a trade deficit review commission. It has finished its meetings and is now developing recommendations to policymakers both in the administration and Congress, on how to deal with this issue. 
   I have supported normal trade relations with China in the past. But, the issue for me isn't shall we make it permanent or not. Shall we have NTR with China? Of course, we should. The issue is: Are we going to do something about these deficits? Does anybody think having a $72 billion deficit with China is normal? Is that a normal trade relationship? Of course, it is not. It is abnormal. It is a perversion. How about Japan? Is this a normal trade relationship, having an $80 billion deficit with the country of Japan? That is not normal. It is abnormal. We, as a country, need to understand and say to China and Japan and others, the European Union, that we are all for expanded trade. We have been the leader in expanding trade. But we are also going to be the leader in standing up for our economic interests and demanding that the rules of trade be fair rules. 
   The first 25 years after the Second World War we could compete with anybody around the world with one hand tied behind our back. It was no problem at all. That was when our trade policy was just flat out foreign policy. The second 25 years, we have seen tougher economic competitors. Countries have developed with strong economies. They have become shrewd economic competitors. Every one of these countries have a managed trade economy in which they say: We will not allow what the United States allows. We will not ever allow the kind of run up of a trade deficit that the United States will allow. 
   We do it because we don't pay attention to it. We have this philosophy that somehow it will all right itself at some point in the future. It will not right itself without action by the Congress and the administration to say we are the leaders in free, expanded and fair trade, and we insist the rules of trade be fair. 
   I come to the floor during this discussion about China PNTR to say that there are other elements, in many ways bigger issues, to this trade debate that we must be attentive to and we must do so soon. 
   While there is a lot of good news--and we will hear a great deal of it during the campaigns by Republicans and Democrats, claiming credit for this, that, and the other thing--but I hope we will all claim credit for the responsibility to begin solving these problems. During good times, it seems to me, is the opportunity to look down the road and see where the storm clouds develop and figure out how to respond to them. We must, it seems to me, decide that it is a significant issue and it is in the interest of all citizens in this country that Congress begin to tackle this issue in a way that reduces these trade deficits, continues to expand our trade opportunities, but puts us on a better footing with our trading partners.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday I spoke briefly about the agenda that confronts this Congress in the next 5 weeks. This is literally a sprint to the finish. Much of what we will discuss and debate are the most important issues people worry about and are talking about around the supper table. They talk about the issues that affect them every day: Are our kids going to good schools? Are we proud of the schools we send our kids to? Do I have a good job? Does it provide retirement benefits, insurance, security? Will grandma and grandpa have adequate health care when they have serious health problems? Is our neighborhood a safe one in which to live? Can we afford the prescription drugs that the doctor prescribes and says we need to maintain a healthy lifestyle and to control a disease we may have? 
   All of these things are the things that interest families who discuss what their lives are like these days and how they can be improved. 
   I want to talk about the agenda and the issues with which we have to deal before this Congress adjourns. Before I do, as a way of introducing that, let me tell you about a television story that appeared on KFYR Television in Bismarck, ND, about 2 to 3 weeks ago. KFYR Television News did a piece about my Uncle Harold. My Uncle Harold, from Dickinson, ND, is now 80 years old, and he is a runner. There are not very many 80-year-old runners, so the television news did a story about him. The story showed him running down the street, with the gold medals he has won, and doing various things. 
   Here is the story about my uncle. About 6 or 7 years ago, he and my aunt went to the Prairie Rose Games in Fargo, ND, where they have events for everybody in different age brackets. They decided to enter the bowling event because they bowl. Harold also saw that they had races for people who are 70 and above, so he decided to enter one at about age 71. He had never run before, but he decided to enter three races at the Prairie Rose Games, and he won all three easily. He said, ``You know, I never knew I could run like that.'' So he started running. He went to Minnesota to run, and then to South Dakota, and Arizona. 
   Pretty soon, Uncle Harold started specializing. Now he runs in the 400 meter and 800 meter events. So I have this uncle who just turned 80 running in races all over the country. He now has 45 gold medals. My aunt thinks he has had a stroke. She thinks it is as goofy as the devil that this 80-year-old man is running. Yet he discovered he is the fastest around in his age bracket. He is going to try out for the Senior Olympics and go one more time. He took fifth out of 200-some runners the last time. Now that he is 80 and at the bottom of a new age bracket, he thinks he will get a gold medal in the Olympics. My uncle is a fisherman, so I don't know whether this is true, but he said he runs the 400 meter race in 79 seconds. I run a little as well. One of these days I will figure out whether I can run it in 79 seconds. 
   I should mention one other thing about Uncle Harold. He also golfs, and he is the strangest golfer I have ever golfed with. I went golfing with my uncle a couple of years ago. He takes a bag and only takes four or five clubs. He hits the ball and, because he is always in training for the Senior Olympics, he sprints on a dead run to the ball. It is a strange looking thing to see a guy who was 78 years old at the time hit a ball and go on a dead run to find out where it rested and then hit it again. In the meantime, my wife and I were driving a cart, and this 78-year-old man is sprinting on the golf course. I have since decided I should never  drive a cart when golfing with my uncle. 
   The point is, here is this 80-year-old guy jogging 3 miles a day, getting ready to try to qualify to go again to the National Senior Olympics. That is pretty remarkable when you think about it. Thirty years ago, that would not have happened. Usually, when you are 80, you find a chair someplace and relax. But these days people are living longer, healthier lives. My uncle, for example, is training for the Olympics. That is the result of a lot of things: lifestyle changes, nutrition changes, cultural changes, better health care, Medicare. A whole series of things are happening in this country that are pretty remarkable. That really all relates to the agenda that we have in the next 5 weeks in this Congress. 
   Americans are living longer, living better, at a time when we are so blessed in this country. We have an agenda in the Congress that will have an impact on people's lives. Yes, for my uncle, but for everybody's aunts, uncles, brothers, and sisters--the agenda of health care and education and other things that mean so much to people's lives. 
   Let me talk for a minute about what we need to do and why. First of all, one of the advancements that allows people to live longer and healthier lives is the increase in the use of prescription drugs. There are so many illnesses and diseases for which, 35 years ago when Medicare was developed by this Congress, there were no medicines. But now there are miracle drugs, prescription medicines. We have decided that it is important to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. Why? Because being able to afford the right prescription drugs can allow people to lead healthier lives and treat illnesses and stay out of a hospital, which is horribly expensive. It is, in the long run, a bargain for the American people to say let's have a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program. 
   Now, some say, well, we cannot afford it. The fact is that it will cost a lot more if we don't have it. People will get sick and go to hospitals and it will cost more. The issue of affordability applies more to senior citizens than to the Government. The reason we need this benefit is that too many senior citizens know they need a medicine, but they can't afford to buy it. 
   A doctor in Dickinson, ND, testified at a hearing I held in Dickinson. He said he prescribed a drug to a senior citizen who had a mastectomy in order to treat her breast cancer. The doctor said to his patient: This is the drug I am going to prescribe for you because it will reduce the chances of a recurrence of your cancer. She said: What does it cost? He told her and she said: Doctor, I can't afford to take that drug. I will just have to take my chances. 
   At every hearing I have held, I have heard testimony from people who say: We go to the back of the grocery store where the pharmacy is first because we have to buy our prescription drugs first; only then, will we know how much money we have left over to buy food. 
   Spending on prescription drugs increased 16 percent last year in this country. Sixteen percent. Some of that is increased utilization and some is increased prices. But too many senior citizens know they need a prescription drug, and they can't afford it. We need to do two things: put on pressure to bring drug prices down and, No. 2, add an affordable, universal, voluntary prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. 
   Mr. President, with your permission, I want to show a couple of pill bottles. I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to do that.

   Mr. DORGAN. I will speak about the prices charged for prescription drugs in this country versus the prices charged elsewhere in the world for the identical medicine. 
   These two bottles are slightly different but they contain the same pill. Both bottles are for a wonderful drug called Zocor, which is used to lower cholesterol in patients. It is a medication that a lot of people use. I commend all those who did the research to create these kind of drugs. But to those who decided the prices that ought to be charged for these medications to various citizens around the world, I don't say good job. 
   Let me describe what has happened. 
   In both bottles are the same pill, in the same dosage, made by the same company, perhaps made in the same manufacturing plant, approved by the FDA. Once the medicine is approved by the FDA, the FDA approves the manufacturing plants, and the company produces the drug for sale. This bottle they sent to Canada. They say to the Canadians: Do you want to buy some Zocor? It will lower your cholesterol. It is $1.82 per tablet. 
   This other bottle they sent to Grand Forks or Minot, ND, or anywhere else in the U.S. To Americans they say: Do you want to buy some Zocor? Well, you will have to pay $3.82 per tablet. $1.82 and $3.82, why the difference? That is something we ought to ask the drug companies. 
   I have taken a group of senior citizens to Canada to a little drugstore in Emerson, Manitoba. I stood in that one-room pharmacy, and I saw the prices charged there. I have seen the prices charged for the same medications in North Dakota. I know the drugstores on Main Streets in North Dakota are not charging higher prices because they want to overcharge. They are simply having to pay the drug companies an inflated price far above that which is charged in Canada, England, Germany, Italy, France, and in virtually every other country in the world because the pharmaceutical manufacturers impose that charge on them. This is not the fault of Main Street drugstores. 
   Again, I ask the question--I have asked this many times--is there anyone in the Senate who wants to stand up and say: Count me in on supporting these prices; I really believe it is fair and right to charge the American consumer $3.82 for the exact same pill for which a Canadian is charged $1.82? Is there one Senator willing to say this? There hasn't been one in the last six weeks that I have asked this question. If there is not any Senator willing to stand up and say this, then will all of them join us to try to change this situation so that the American consumer who needs to purchase prescription drugs receives a fair price? 
   The amendment that we passed in the Senate is now in conference. I am one of the conferees. What we are saying with this legislation is that pharmacists and drug wholesalers have the same right to reimport prescription drugs into this country that the drug companies already have, provided that the imported medications are FDA-approved and made in FDA-approved plants. It is very simple. We need to do that before this session of Congress ends. 
   The prescription drug companies are working overtime, of course, to kill this provision. They say the issue is safety. It is not. It is profits. That is what the issue is--profits, not safety. These are pills made in FDA-approved plants. These are medicines approved by the FDA with a chain of custody that can be traced from the manufacturing plant to the drugstores. There is no safety issue at all. 
   Adding a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare Program and enacting legislation that we passed on the floor with the bipartisan support of Senator JEFFORDS, Senator GORTON, myself, and many others who have worked on this are two things Congress must do before adjourning this year. 
   The other thing we need to do is pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I want to talk a few minutes about that today because we have Patients' Bill of Rights legislation that is in conference. 
   What is the Patients' Bill of Rights? This legislation says let's even up the odds a little bit between people who are sick and their insurance companies. Let's even up the odds a little bit. 
   In some cases what has been happening is that a person's medical care has become a function of their insurance company's profit. All too often doctors are not the ones making the decision about what kind of care is provided to a patient. It is an accountant in some insurance office thousands of miles away. 
   Yesterday, I mentioned a young boy in Nevada. I want to mention him again because it seems to me that he illustrates, as with so many others, the problem. A young man named Christopher Roe died October 12 last year. His mother came to a hearing that  Senator REID and I co-chaired in Nevada. He died on October 12, 1999, on his 16th birthday. The official cause of his death was leukemia. But his mother tells us that the real reason he died was that his health care plan denied him the investigational chemotherapy drug that he needed. He needed a shot, a chance, and the bureaucracy of the managed care organization never gave him that chance. They just took forever to get to that point. 
   Christopher Roe died, and Christopher Roe's mother came to our hearing. She held up a large picture of Christopher. She wept as she told us about her son who from his sickbed looked up at her, and said, ``Mom, I just don't understand how they could do this to a kid?'' Good question? Christopher died. 
   Or let me share another example. A woman fell off a cliff in the Shenandoah mountains. She was hauled into an emergency room unconscious with broken bones. She was treated. After a difficult period, she survived, and was then told by her managed care organization that they wouldn't cover her emergency room treatment because she didn't get prior approval. She was hauled in on a gurney unconscious, but the managed care organization said: You did not get prior approval for emergency room treatment. 
   That is the kind of thing that is happening all too often in this country. 
   Or, perhaps a better way to describe it is with the story of Ethan Bedrick, a young boy born with cerebral palsy resulting from a complicated delivery who was told that he had only a 50-percent chance of being able to walk by age 5. The managed care organization denied him the therapy he needed because they said a 50-percent chance of a young boy being able to walk by age 5 was insignificant. They considered it insignificant that a young boy had a 50-percent chance of being able to walk with the right kind of therapy. 
   Is there a reason to question those who are making health care decisions in the sterile offices of managed care organizations 1,000 miles away from where the doctor is seeing the patient and describing the medical treatment that is necessary for the patient's care? Yes. That is why I wanted to make this point. 
   We had a debate on patients' care in the Senate a while back. We lost by one vote, effectively, because there were some Members missing. We may have turned the tide in the Senate based on that vote, in which case the Presiding Officer may very well have broken the tie. But a substitute Patients' Bill of Rights was offered by our colleague, Senator NICKLES, when we offered the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Dr. Greg Ganske, a Republican Member of the U.S. House, wrote a letter to all of us about that substitute. In fact, the local papers described the substitute that the Senate passed as the Patients' Bill of Rights. It was not a Patients' Bill of Rights. It was a ``patients' bill of goods.'' But the Senate passed it, and the papers wrote exactly what those who supported it had hoped they would: The Senate passed a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Dr. GANSKE, a Republican Member of Congress, said this Senate legislation virtually eliminates any meaningful remedy for most working Americans and their families against death and injury caused by HMOs. 
   That is not a Democrat speaking. That is a Republican Member of the U.S. House, Dr. GANSKE. 
   Let me describe the legal analysis he sent around to every Member of the Senate:  
   ......The measure would appear to undo State law remedies for medical injuries caused by managed care companies treatment decisions and delays. 
   ......In the name of patient protection the Senate legislation appears to eliminate virtually any meaningful remedy for most working Americans and their families. 
   ......A vehicle for protecting managed care companies from various forms of legal liability under current law. 
   Viewed in this light, the congressional passage of the Senate bill would be worse than were Congress to enact no measure at all.  
   I raise this because this is not a Democrat being critical of a Republican proposal. It is a Republican Member of Congress saying that the proposal passed by the Senate was worthless, just worthless. 
   This is not partisan criticism, it is Dr. GANSKE, a Republican Member of Congress, saying what the majority of the Senate claimed was a real Patients' Bill of Rights was worthless. 
   Now we could, and should, and I hope will pass a real Patients' Bill of Rights. There is a commercial being run in a northeastern State on behalf of a Member of the Senate who voted for our Patients' Bill of Rights, the Norwood-Dingell Patients' Bill of Rights that was passed on a bipartisan basis by the House. A Member of the Senate who voted for that--a Republican; there were only a very few--is running a commercial paid for by the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee that says this Senator voted for a real Patients' Bill of Rights--meaning ours. 
   It is fascinating to me that we now have a circumstance where the Republican Campaign Committee is saying that the Patients' Bill of Rights we proposed was the ``real one.'' We will have more to say about that and have a more aggressive debate about that in the days ahead. 
   My expectation is that there will be a tie vote when another vote occurs--and it will happen again; we fully intend it to happen again. Fortunately, we will have a Vice President to break that tie. The Patients' Bill of Rights issue is very important. 
   Let me mention a couple of other issues, and then I will conclude. 
   We also have a responsibility to deal with the farm crisis and we have not done so very well. We have a farm bill that doesn't work. The Freedom to Farm bill does not work. It has been a failure since it was enacted in 1996. The promise was: Produce what you want; we will sell it overseas and get rid of the farm program and things will be better off. 
   Since that time, prices have collapsed and family farmers have had an awful time trying to make ends meet. In most cases, they are receiving far less now in real terms than they received during the Great Depression for their product. These are not people who are slothful. These are not people who aren't being productive. They are economic all-stars. They produce in prodigious quantity the food the world needs so desperately. Yet the market says: By the way, your food has no value. 
   While people climb trees to pick leaves to eat in countries around the world where there is not enough food, family farmers driving a 2-ton truck to a country elevator are told by the grain trader: Your food has no value. 
   Something is wrong with that. What really has no value is the current farm program. It doesn't work. It is long past time to fix it. We are within three or four votes of doing that. I encourage help from the other side to give us the votes needed to pass a farm program that provides real assistance for family farmers. 
   While we are on the subject of freedom, those who wrote the Freedom to Farm bill--I didn't, and I voted against it--should understand there is something called the freedom to sell. The freedom to sell means if you want to give family farmers the 
   freedom to produce whatever, let's also give them the freedom to sell their products in markets such as Iran, Iraq, Cuba, North Korea, and others that have been off limits to them because this country has imposed economic sanctions against countries whose behavior we don't like. I am fine with economic sanctions. Slap them with sanctions. But don't ever include food as a part of those sanctions. Using food as a weapon is unbecoming to this country. A country as big and as good and as powerful and as important as this country ought never use food as a weapon. 
   The freedom to sell is a pretty important principle which we ought to care a bit about. There is an amendment that I put in the appropriations bill now in conference, and I know there are a couple of House leaders who are intending to try to kill that as we get to conference. I am hoping with the bipartisan support we received in the Senate that we will prevail on this issue. 
   Finally, one of the other important issues we face as we wrap up this Congress is trying to do something to strengthen the education system in our country. We have the opportunity to do that. It is just that we have all of this bickering back and forth. We have things that we know need to be done. Everybody here understands that if you are in a classroom of 15 people, there is more learning going on than if there is a classroom with 1 teacher and 30 kids. Class size matters. We have  proposals to reduce class size which will dramatically improve education. 
   We also understand you cannot learn in schools that are in functional disrepair. No wonder there is disrepair in the schools. They were built 50 or 60 years ago, after World War II, when we had soldiers coming back, having families, and building schools for their children all across the country. Many of these schools are still in use today and are in desperate need of repair and remodeling. If anyone doubts that, take a trip to the Ojibwa school on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation or the Cannon Ball Elementary School, south of Bismarck, ND. Take a look at those schools and ask yourself whether those schools need help. 
   The third grader who walks through the classroom door in the Cannon Ball School ought to be able to expect the same opportunity for a good education as all kids in this country. Yet these children don't have the same opportunity. We know that. Yet legislation to improve and modernize our schools languish in this Senate because some people don't believe it is important, or some people believe they cannot do it because if they did, somebody would declare victory for a public policy that makes sense. 
   Let's declare victory for a little common sense in all of these areas: Education, health care, agriculture. There are so many areas. The agenda in this Congress is the agenda we establish. If we are a Congress of underachievers, that is our fault, not something we blame on anybody else. 
   I wish I were in the majority here, but I am not. The majority establishes a schedule; we don't. I accept that. We have a right, and insist on the right, between now and the 5 weeks when this Congress wraps up its business, to try to bring to the floor of the Senate once again a real Patients' Bill of Rights and have another vote. We have a right to try to push these policies to get them done. We have a right to try to push education policies that we think will enhance and improve education in this country. We have a right to try to push policies that say we want to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. We have a right to insist that the American consumer pay prices for prescription drugs that are fair--not the highest prices of anyone in the entire world. 
   We have a right to address all of those issues, and we should. There is time. It is just a matter of will. Will the Members of the Senate who do the scheduling, who plan the agenda, exhibit the will to do what is right in the final 5 weeks and pass this kind of legislation? 
   As I said when I started, when people sit down at the dinner table and talk about their lives, they are talking about things that matter to them. All of the things I have talked about are things that matter to them: Are our kids going to good schools? Do grandpa and grandma have the opportunity to get decent health care when they are sick? Are the neighborhoods safe? Do I have a decent job? Does it pay well? Does it have security? All of those are things that are important to the American people. All of those are things they should expect this Congress to address in the coming 5 weeks. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague, the Senator from Wyoming, said we have a lot to do. He is certainly correct, we have a lot to do in about a 5-week sprint to the end of this 106th Congress. 
   I think all of us aspired to come to this Chamber because we want to get things done for the American people. We want this country to be successful and to grow and prosper. We want to address real problems. 
   My hope is that we can find ways, between the political aisles, where Republicans and Democrats can agree that there are things that need to be done in this country and that we can do them together. I think that would be a refreshing thing for the American people to see. 
   In the final 5 or 6 weeks of this Congress, we could probably take some advice from the Robert Frost poem, ``Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening,'' where Robert Frost says:  
   The woods are lovely, dark, and deep, 
   But I have promises to keep, 
   And miles to go before I sleep, 
   And miles to go before I sleep.  
   We have miles to go before we put this 106th Congress to bed. 
   What are these issues that we must deal with before we finally adjourn this Congress?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I take a few moments following this cloture vote to talk about the appropriations bill and a couple of related matters to that bill that are to be brought to the Senate floor. We are completing the last week of the legislative session before the August break. When we come back following the August break, we will have a number of weeks in September and a couple of weeks in October, perhaps, at which time the 106th Congress will be history. 
   We will have an election in early November, something that the late Congressman Claude Pepper, a wonderful public servant, used to call one of the miracles of democracy. He said: Every even numbered year, our Constitution provides that the American people grab the steering wheel and decide in which direction this country moves. He said it was one of the miracles of democracy. Indeed it is. We are headed toward an election. That will affect the Senate schedule. That means it is likely the Senate will complete its work, the Congress will complete its work, in the 106th Congress by the middle of October. 
   As we look to that moment, we have a lot of work to do between now and then. We have appropriations bills to complete. After all that, one of the fundamental responsibilities we have is to provide for the funding of things we do together in government. We build our roads together. It doesn't make sense for each family to build their own road to the supermarket. It is called government. We come together and build a system of roads. We come together to build schools and maintain and operate schools in which the American people can send their children. It doesn't make sense for each and every person to build their own school. So we have roads and schools. Then we hire a police force. We hire folks who will serve in the Armed Forces to defend our liberty and freedom. 
   All of these things we do, and much more, as a part of our governing process. I am proud of much of what we do. Much of what we have accomplished in this country is a result of the ingenuity of people in the private sector, in the market system, competing, the genius of those who are willing to take risks and use ideas to build new products and create new markets; on the other side, in the public sector, the vision that has been exhibited by some who have served this country for many years to do the right things in the public sector, to do together what we should do to provide for our common defense and build our schools, build roads, and do those things that we know also make this a better country. 
   One of the pieces of legislation we are intending to bring to the floor very soon is the Treasury-Postal appropriations subcommittee bill. That is through the full Appropriations Committee in the Senate. It is legislation that will be, I hope, debated next on the Senate floor. The bill is through the full Appropriations Committee and includes funding for a wide range of things we do in this country. 
   One of the larger portions of the bill is the funding for the Customs Service. The Customs Service is a very important element. Given the expanding nature of world trade, with the amount of commerce and goods and services moving in and out of our country and across our borders, the Customs Service provides an ever increasing important service to our country. 
   We fund the Internal Revenue Service which collects the revenue by which we fund most of the government services we have in this country. One of the areas of this legislation is the national youth antidrug media campaign. That campaign in the drug czar's office is now about 3 years old, and the Congress has been working on that diligently, as well. 
   We have a number of issues in this legislation that are very important, that are timely, and that we need to get to the floor of the Senate to debate and try to make some decisions about them. 
   Let me comment for a moment about a couple of issues that no doubt will be brought to the Senate floor on this bill. I will talk about why these issues are important and what I think will happen with these issues. In the House of Representatives, when they wrote the legislation dealing with Treasury and general government in that subcommittee, that legislation included some amendments dealing with the subject of Cuba and the sanctions with respect to food and medicine that exist with respect to Cuba. 
   I want to talk just a bit about that because those provisions are included in the House bill. We will undoubtedly have amendments on that same subject in the Senate bill. There will be a defense of germaneness on those amendments. I will offer one of those amendments. I believe my colleagues Senator DODD, Senator ROBERTS, perhaps Senator BAUCUS, and others will offer similar amendments. I want to describe why this is an important issue and why the Senate should consider these amendments, especially inasmuch as these types of amendments are in the House bill coming over for consideration in conference. 
   There are some bad actors internationally who run governments in a way that is well outside the norm of international behavior. We understand that. Saddam Hussein is one of those leaders. There are others. We have watched the behavior and the activities of countries such as Cuba, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, and others, and view with alarm some of the things that are happening. 
   Cuba is a country that is run, with a Communist government, by Fidel Castro. North Korea is a relatively closed society run by a Communist government, a Communist dictator. Iran is a different kind of country, run by a group of folks who seem to operate--at least they have for some while--outside the norms of international behavior, engaged in an attempt to acquire sophisticated missile technology. I suspect they and others on the list would love to acquire nuclear weapons. These are countries that have demonstrated by their behavior, by their actions, that they are operating outside the norms of what we consider acceptable behavior. I am talking now about the international community, the community of nations. 
   So what do we do? What we do is we say to Saddam Hussein: We are going to impose economic sanctions on your country. These sanctions, in the form of either sanctions or an embargo, are an attempt to choke your economy and cause you economic pain. They cause you to understand when you operate outside the norms of international behavior, when you are attempting to acquire nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, and biological weapons with which you can threaten your neighbors, we care about that and we intend to do something about that. We and other countries have imposed sanctions against the country of Iraq. 
   We have had an embargo against the country of Cuba for some 40 years. It is a small country 90 miles off the tip of Florida. We have had an embargo for some 40 years against the country of Cuba, preventing goods from being shipped to Cuba, preventing Cuban goods from coming into our country, essentially trying to shut down their economy with that embargo. We have had similar sanctions against North Korea and Iran. 
   One of the mistakes this country has made--and a very serious mistake--is deciding we will include food and medicine as a part of our economic sanctions. We should not have done that. This country should never have done that. This country is bigger and better than that. We should never use food as a weapon. 
   We produce food in such abundant quality--the best quality food in the world. We have farmers today who are out driving a tractor in some field somewhere, planting a seed and raising crops with great hope they will be able to make a living on their family farm. We produce such wonderful quality food in such abundance, and then we say to countries whose behavior we don't like: By the way, we are going to slap you with economic sanctions. We are going to put our fist around your economic throat, and included in that, we are going to prevent the movement of food in and out of your country. 
   I am all for economic sanctions. There is not any reason to make life better for Saddam Hussein. He ought to pay a price for his behavior. But this country is shortsighted to believe that using food as a weapon is an advancement in public policy for us. It is not. First, it hurts our farmers who are prevented from moving food through the international markets. Second, it takes 
   aim at a dictator and ends up  hitting hungry people. That is not the best of what this country has to offer. 
   So we have a very simple proposition--those of us who care about this issue. We say let's stop using food as a weapon; let us, as Americans, decide we shall never use food as a mechanism to try to punish others. We understand that Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro have never missed a meal. They have never missed breakfast, they have never missed dinner, never missed supper. They eat well. When we use food as a weapon, it is only poor people, sick people, and hungry people who pay a price; and of course, our farmers here in America also pay a price. 
   So last year we had a debate about this. My colleague Senator ASHCROFT, I, Senators DODD, ROBERTS, BAUCUS--a range of people--have offered amendments. Last year we had a vote, and 70 Senators said: No, we shall not any longer ever use food as a weapon. Let us lift the sanctions on food and medicine; 70 percent of the Senate said let's stop it. 
   I cannot speak for all 70, but I will speak for myself to say it is immoral to have a public policy that uses food as a weapon. It is immoral to punish hungry, sick, and poor people around the world because we are angry at dictators. Seventy percent of the Senate said: Let's stop. Let's change the sanctions. We can continue some of the economic sanctions. We are not making a judgment about using economic sanctions to punish dictators or punish countries whose behavior is outside the international norm. We are saying, however, we should not any longer use food or medicine as a weapon or as part of the sanctions. 
   So 70 percent of the Senate voted. It was on the Senate agricultural appropriations bill, and off we marched to conference. I was one of the conferees. One of the first acts of conference between the House and Senate was my offering an amendment insisting that the Senate retain its position. In other words, we were saying as a group of Senators who were conferees: We insist on our provision, lifting the sanctions on food and medicine. 
   I offered the amendment in the conference. We had a vote of the Senate conferees, and my amendment carried. Therefore, the Senators at this conference with the House Members said: We insist on the provision. We insist on our policy of removing food and medicine as part of our economic sanctions. 
   Guess what. A Member of the House moved that the conference adjourn. We adjourned. It was late one morning, and we never, ever returned to conference. Do you know why? Because the House leaders, the House leadership, did not like that provision and they intended to kill it. They knew they could not kill it with their conferees. If there were a vote on it in the conference, they would lose. If there were a vote on it on the floor of the House, they would lose. So the only way they could win was to hijack that conference, adjourn it, never come back into session, and throw the ingredients of that bill into a broader bill, and we never saw the light of day on our policy. 
   The result is we are back on the floor right now and this country still has in place a policy of using food and medicine as part of our economic sanctions. It is wrong. It is wrong. 
   Following that conference last year, I had the opportunity to go to Cuba. I have traveled some, in various parts of the world, and have seen that what we produce in such abundance, the world needs so desperately. The winds of hunger blow every minute, every hour, and every day all across this world. So many people die of hunger, malnutrition, and hunger-related causes, and so many of them are children--every single day. 
   I went to Cuba. What I saw was a country in collapse. It is a beautiful country with wonderful people. The city of Havana is a beautiful city, but in utter collapse. There are gorgeous buildings designed in the 1940s and 1950s by some of the best architects--beautiful architecture, in total disrepair. The city is collapsing. The Cuban economy is in collapse. There is no question about that. 
   I visited a hospital, and I saw a young boy lying in a coma. His mother was seated by his bedside holding his hand. This was in an intensive care ward of a Cuban hospital. This young boy in intensive care was not hooked up to any wires. There was no fancy gadgetry, no fancy equipment, no beeping that you hear in intensive care--the beeping of equipment--no, none of that. He was lying on his bed with his mother holding his hand. 
   I asked the doctor, Do you not have equipment with which to monitor this young boy? He had a head injury and was in a coma. He said, Oh, no; they didn't have any of that equipment. They didn't even have any rudimentary equipment with which to make a diagnosis. Intensive care was to lay this boy in a room. They told me they were out of 250 different kinds of medicine in that hospital. 
   My point is this. The Cuban people do not deserve Fidel Castro--that is for sure. They deserve a free and open country, a free and open economy; they deserve the liberties we have and the freedom we have. But 40 years of an embargo, and especially 40 years preventing the movement of food and medicine back and forth, surely makes no sense. 
   It has not hurt Mr. Castro. It has hurt the poor people of Cuba and the hungry people of Cuba. It is time to change that policy. A year ago we tried it. Seventy percent of the Senate voted for it, and it has not happened. 
   This is what we have done this year: I offered an amendment, with Senator GORTON from the State of Washington, on the Agriculture appropriations bill that lifts the sanctions on food and medicine and also let's us do one other thing. It prevents any future President from ever including food and medicine as part of economic sanctions unless they come to the Senate and get a vote and the Senate says: Yes, we ought to do that. 
   We do two things: We lift the sanctions on food and medicine that exist with those countries that are subject to our economic sanctions, and we prevent future Presidents from imposing sanctions and using food as a weapon. That is in the Agriculture appropriations bill which came to the floor of the Senate. The Senate passed that bill. My amendment is in it. We will go to conference. 
   The only way we can lose that issue is if the House leaders hijack it once again. There is a member of the leadership of the House, whom I shall not name, who makes it his cause to derail us. He believes we ought to use food as a weapon, especially with respect to Cuba. He believes we ought not change the policy and will do everything he can to stop us. 
   My colleague in the House who has been working on this passed some legislation that was negotiated with the House leadership, but it turns out the legislation, when one looks at the language, is a step backward, not a step forward. 
   We will go to conference on the Agriculture appropriations bill with my amendment in it, and I say to those who might pay attention to the Senate record from the House side, if the House leaders expect to hijack this once again this year, they are in for a long session because there is a group of us--Republicans and Democrats--who insist this country change its policy. This policy is wrongheaded and it must change. 
   Yes, we have some people in the Senate who are still fighting the cold war. We have people in the Senate--not very many, I admit--but we have a few people in the Senate who do not want this changed, but 70 percent of the Senate want this changed. At some point, if they get a full vote in the House and we have a full vote in the Senate, 70 percent of the Congress will say: Let's change this foolish policy. This policy is not the best of this country. This policy is wrong, and we aim to change it. 
   Now we bring this bill to the floor of the Senate. We had a cloture vote on the motion to proceed today, and the Treasury-Postal bill will come to the floor at some point. As I indicated, in addition to the description of the amendment I offered to the Agriculture appropriations bill on the floor of the Senate dealing with sanctions on Cuba, a couple Members of the House applied some amendments, which were successful, to the Treasury-general government bill which means when our bill comes to the floor of the Senate, it will also attract these amendments. That is fine with me. Having them in two places is better than having them in one place. Perhaps one conference will be successful in changing this policy.  
   My colleagues in the House added a piece of legislation, for example, dealing with travel in Cuba saying that no funds will be used to enforce the restrictions on travel to Cuba. I prefer to do it a different way. Who is going to believe it makes sense to travel to Cuba if it is still illegal but they just will not enforce it? If we change travel, let's change travel. Let's not say you shall not enforce something that remains illegal. Let's say the travel restrictions are lifted. Period. End of story. 
   I hope my colleague who intends to offer that amendment in the Senate will consider doing that. We have other amendments as well, and I intend to offer an amendment dealing with food and medicine 
   sanctions on Cuba on the Treasury-Postal bill when it is brought to the floor of the Senate. 
   There is another issue I wish to talk about briefly that relates in some measure to this bill, but especially to the issue of the Customs Service and our borders and the issue of international trade. I am going to talk in a bit about our trade problem because we have the largest trade deficit in the history of humankind. 
   There is a lot right with this country. There is a lot going on to give us reason to say thanks and hosanna. We have a wonderful economy. It is producing new jobs and new opportunity. All of the indices are right: unemployment is down; home ownership is up; inflation is way down. All the things one expects to happen in a good economy have been happening. 
   Some parts of the country are left behind, such as rural areas. We have a farm program that is a debacle, and we cannot get anybody to even hold a hearing to change the farm program, but that is another story. 
   There are some areas that have not kept pace with the prosperity. We need to continue to fight to write a better farm program and make sure those rural areas share in the full economic prosperity of America. 
   There is a lot right in this country. This is a good economy. It is producing unprecedented opportunities. 
   The one set of storm clouds above the horizon, however, is in international trade. We have a huge trade deficit. Our merchandise trade deficit was nearly $350 billion in 1999, and is projected to exceed $400 billion this year. Put another way: We are buying $1 billion more in goods from overseas than we are selling each and every day, 7 days a week. 
   Some say: Does that matter? Is it important? Gee, our economy is doing well. How on Earth can you make the case we should care about this? 
   You can live in a suburb someplace and have a wonderful home with a huge Cadillac in the driveway and have all the evidence of affluence, but if it is all borrowed, you are in trouble. On the borrowing side, we have made a lot of progress dealing with Federal budget deficits. In fact, we have eliminated the Federal budget deficits, and good for us, but the deficits on the trade side have continued to mushroom, and we must get a handle on that as well and deal with our trade imbalance. 
   What causes the trade imbalance, and what relevance does it have to this bill? In this bill, we fund the Customs Service, and the Customs Service evaluates what comes in, what goes out, and they try to assist in the flow of goods moving back and forth across our borders. 
   The fact is, they have an old, antiquated computer system to take care of all of that and it is melting down. With expanded trade coming in and going out, we need a new system. The Customs Service has proposed a new system to accommodate and facilitate their needs. We need to fund it. It is very important we fund this system. It is called the Automated Commercial Environment or ACE system. We need to keep it operational, and we need to build it and make it work. 
   In 1 day, the Customs Service processes $8.8 billion in exports and imports. They have to keep track of it all: $8.8 billion in daily exports and imports; and 1.3 million passengers and 350,000 vehicles moving back and forth across our borders. Think of that. This is the agency that has the responsibility of keeping track of all of it--whose vehicle, when did it come in, when did it go out, who is coming in, who is leaving our country, what are the goods coming in, what kind of tariffs exists on those goods, who is sending them, who is receiving them. 
   All of that is part of what we have to keep track of in terms of movement across our border. The current system that keeps track of all of that is nearly two decades old, and running at near capacity. It is the single most important resource in collecting duties and enforcing Customs laws and regulations. 
   This system has been experiencing brownouts over the past months that have brought the Customs operation at these border ports, in some cases, to a dead halt. 
   Over 40 percent of the Customs stations are using work stations that are unreliable, are obsolete operating systems, and are no longer supported by a vendor. 
   Trade volume has doubled in 10 years. The rate of growth in trade is astronomical. The Customs Service anticipates an increase of over 50 percent in the number of entries by 2005. That means the current system just can't and will not handle it. 
   So we have a responsibility to do something about that. If anybody wonders whether all this trade is important, and keeping track of it is important, as I said, look at the trade deficit and look at what is happening in this country. 
   From the standpoint of policy--I was talking about the system that keeps track of it--but from the standpoint of policy, we also have to make significant changes. We will not make them in this bill because this isn't where we do that, but you can't help but look at what is happening in our country and understand that our own trade policy does not work. It just does not work. 
   We have a huge and growing trade deficit with China--growing rapidly--of nearly $70 billion a year. We have a large abiding trade deficit with Japan that has gone on forever--$50 to $70 billion a year. 
   This Congress, without my vote--because I voted against it--passed something called NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. It was billed as a nirvana. What a wonderful thing, we were told, if we can do a trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. What a great hemispheric trade agreement, and how wonderful it would be for our country. 
   In fact, a couple of economists teamed together and said: If you just pass NAFTA, you will get 300,000 new jobs in the United States. The problem is, there is never accountability for economists. Economists say anything, any time, to anybody, and nobody ever goes back to check. 
   The field of economics is psychology pumped up with helium and portrayed as a profession. I say that having taught economics a couple years in college, but I have overcome that to do other things. 
   But economists told us, if we pass NAFTA, it will be a wonderful thing for our country. Well, this Congress passed NAFTA. I didn't vote for it. Guess what. We had a trade surplus with Mexico. We have now turned a trade surplus with Mexico into a significant deficit with the country of Mexico. 
   They said, by the way, if we pass NAFTA, the products that will come in from Mexico will be products produced by low-skilled labor. Not true. The products that are coming in from Mexico are the product of higher-skilled labor, principally automobiles, automobile parts, and electronics. Those are the three largest imports into the United States from Mexico. 
   So the economists were wrong. I would love to have them come back and parade around, and say: I said NAFTA would work, but I apologize. We had a trade surplus with Mexico. Now it is a fairly large deficit. We had a trade deficit with Canada, and we doubled the deficit. I want one person to stand up in the Senate and say: This is real progress. Doubling the deficit with Canada, and turning a surplus into a deficit with Mexico--hooray for us. That is real progress. I want just one inebriated soul to tell me here in Washington, DC, that this makes sense. Of course it does not make sense. 
   It did not work. So we have trade policy challenges dealing 
   with Mexico, Canada, and NAFTA. We have policy differences dealing with our big trade deficit with China. We are going to have other struggles and challenges  dealing with the recurring deficit that goes on forever with Japan. 
   It might be useful--I know people get tired of me talking about this--but it might be useful to describe our diminished expectations in this county and why we are in such trouble on trade. 
   About 10 years ago--we have always had a struggle with Japan--we were having, at that time, an agreement negotiated on the issue of American beef going to Japan. We were not getting enough beef into Japan. At that point, it cost about $30 a pound to buy a T-bone steak in Tokyo. Why? Because there was not enough beef. So you keep the supply low, the demand and price go up, and a T-bone steak costs a lot of money in Tokyo. 
   We wanted to get American beef into Japan. After all, we buy all their cars, VCRs and television sets. Maybe they should buy American beef. So we sent our best negotiators, and they negotiated. Our negotiators were hard nosed. It only took them a couple of days to lose. They sat at the table, and they negotiated and negotiated. And guess what they negotiated? They had a press conference and said: We have a victory. We have a beef agreement with Japan. What a wonderful deal. You would have thought they had just won the Olympics because they celebrated. And everybody said: Gosh, what a great deal. 
   Here is the agreement. You get more American beef into Japan. Yes, you do. And we did. 
   Ten or 11 years after the beef agreement with Japan, the tariff on American steak or American ground beef or American beef going to Japan today is 40 percent on a pound of beef. Can you imagine that? What would people think if you told them: In the United States, we only have a 40 percent tariff on your product coming into our country? They would say: What kind of nonsense is that? That is not free trade. Yet we celebrated the fact that we had an agreement with Japan that takes us to a 50 percent tariff, which is reduced over time, but snaps back up if we get more beef into Japan. We celebrated that. 
   This is the goofiest set of priorities I have ever heard. We ought to learn to negotiate trade agreements that are in this country's interests. 
   I have threatened, from time to time, to introduce a piece of legislation in Congress that says: When our trade negotiators go to negotiate, they must wear a jersey that says ``USA,'' just so that they can look down, from time to time, and see who they are negotiating for. ``I am from the United States. I have the United States's best interests at heart. When we negotiate with you, Japan, China, Mexico, Canada, or others, we insist on fair trade.'' 
   Yes, our producers will compete. We are not afraid of competition. But we are not going to compete with one hand tied behind our back. Our negotiators negotiated GATT with Europe, and they said to the Europeans: You know what--my colleague, Senator CONRAD, talks about this a lot--we will have a deal with you. You can have 6, 8, or 10 times greater subsidies on your sales of grain to other countries than we will have. And we will have a deal where we will agree to limit our support payments to family farmers to a fraction of what yours are. So once we have done that, we have tied both of our hands behind our back, and then said let's go ahead and compete. 
   That is what our negotiators have done virtually every time they have negotiated a trade agreement. They did it in GATT to family farmers and did it with Japan to our ranchers. I should say, our ranchers were pleased with the agreement with Japan. I would say to them: How can you be pleased? How can you call that success? It is because they have such low expectations in our trade negotiations. We give away everything. We expect little, get almost nothing, and then we are so pleased. 
   When you have roughly $1 billion a day in the merchandise trade imbalance, it is time to wonder whether your policy is working. When you have a $1-billion-a-day deficit--every single day--in merchandise trade, it is time to ask whether this is a policy that works. The answer is no. 
   I think it would behoove this Congress to say: Good for all the wonderful things that are happening in this country. Everybody deserves a little credit for all of that. Good for all the good things happening in our economy. But it is important for all of us to look at the storm clouds as well, and evaluate what is wrong, and try to fix that. If we did that, it would behoove us to bring to the floor of the Senate a debate and full discussion about America's trade policy. 
   Every time I come and talk about this issue, there is someone watching or someone listening, or somebody later will say: That guy sounds like a protectionist. There is this caricature: You are either for free trade or you are some isolationist, xenophobic stooge. You are either for free trade or you don't get it. You either see the horizon or you are nearsighted. That is the way it all works. 
   Even the largest newspapers do that. Try to get an op-ed piece in the Washington Post on trade issues. If you happen to believe we ought to stand up for our economic interests in trade, you can't do it. 
   It is not my intention to say this country should not be a leader in expanding trade. This country ought to be a leader in promoting an expanded free and fair opportunity for international trade. This country ought to be a leader. We ought to expect that other countries would be involved in saying the things that we fought for for 75 to 100 years. This country will be part of the discussions about trade. 
   We had people dying in the streets in this country, fighting for the right to organize in labor unions, fighting for the right to create labor unions. We had people die on the streets of America. 
   Some will say: We can avoid all that, having labor unions, having to worry about dumping chemicals into the water and the air, having to have a safe workplace, having to be prohibited from hiring kids; we can avoid all of that. We have debated it for 75 or 100 years in this country. We have made a lot of progress. We can avoid it all by moving our plant to some other Third World country where they don't have those inconveniences, where you can hire 12-year-old kids and work them 12 hours a day and pay them 12 cents an hour and everybody calls it free trade. 
   This country has a responsibility also to lead on the issues of what are the fair rules for international trade--not protectionism, what are the fair rules for trade that establish fair competition. That is something this country has a responsibility to be involved with as well. 
   Talking about trade in the context of the Customs Service and our responsibility to keep track of what is happening around the world, it is true that my frustration from time to time boils over on the issue. I come to the floor and talk about it without much effect because there are not sufficient votes in the Senate to require a very robust debate on trade policy. It is coming. We ought to make it happen. 
   If I can digress--because I have the time this morning, and I don't see anyone else waiting to speak--I want to mention something that happened some years ago that made a profound impact on me. I mentioned a moment ago that we struggled in this country to establish the right to form labor unions and establish collective bargaining. There are plenty of countries where, if you try to form labor unions, try to get workers together to see if they can't get a better deal, they can be thrown in jail. As I said, we had people who died in the streets in this country fighting for that opportunity. We now understand the consequences of that. We have labor unions, and we have management and labor, collective bargaining. It is a better country because of that. There are some areas of the world where we don't have the opportunity to do that. People who try to demonstrate for those rights are thrown in jail. 
   Let me describe something that happened in Congress a long while ago related to that point. We had a fellow who spoke to a joint session of Congress. Normally, a speaker to a joint session of Congress is a President. The pageantry is quite wonderful when there is a joint session. It is normally in the House Chamber because that is the larger Chamber. The Senators come in and are seated in the House Chamber, Cabinet officials come in, the Supreme Court comes in. The American people see this. That is when the network television cameras come on. 
   Then the Doorkeeper says: Mr. Speaker, the President of the United  States. And the President marches in and gives a State of the Union speech. 
   We occasionally have other speakers who are invited to give an address to a joint session of Congress. On rare occasions, it has been a head of state. Many will remember other circumstances: General Douglas MacArthur coming back from Korea, when he was relieved of his command by President Truman, was invited to address a joint session of Congress; Winston Churchill addressed a joint session of Congress. 
   One day about 10 or 12 years ago, I was a Member of the U.S. House, it was a joint session of Congress. In the back of the room, the Doorkeeper announced the visitor. The Doorkeeper said: Mr. Speaker, Lech Walesa from Poland. And this fellow walked in, a rather short man with a mustache. He had red cheeks and probably a few extra pounds, an ordinary looking fellow who walked into the Chamber of the House, walked up to the microphone. The joint 
   session stood and applauded and didn't stop. This applause continued to create waves, and it went on for some minutes. Then this man began to speak. Most of us, of course, knew the history. But in a very powerful way this ordinary man told an extraordinary tale. 
   He said 10 years before, he was in a shipyard in Gdansk, Poland on a Saturday leading a strike for workers to be able to chart their own destiny, leading a strike for a free labor movement in Poland against a Communist government. On that day, he had already been fired from his job as an electrician at a shipyard for his activities to fight for a free labor movement in Poland. The Communist government had him fired from his shipyard. So this unemployed electrician, on a Saturday morning, was leading a strike, leading a parade inside this shipyard for a free labor movement. He was grabbed by some Communist thugs and beaten and beaten badly. As they beat him, they took him to the edge of the shipyard, hoisted him up and unceremoniously dumped him over the barbed-wire fence outside the shipyard face down in the dirt. He lay there bleeding, wondering what to do next. 
   Of course, we know what he did next. Ten years later, he was introduced to a joint session of Congress as the President of the country of Poland. This man went to the microphone and said the following to us: We didn't have any guns; the Communists had all the guns. We didn't have any bullets; the Communists had all the bullets. We were armed only with an idea. 
   What he did next that Saturday morning, from lying on the ground bleeding from the beating he had received from the Communist agents of that Government of Poland, the history books record. He pulled himself back up and climbed back over the fence and climbed back into the shipyard. 
   This unemployed electrician showed up in the Chamber of the U.S. House to speak to a joint session of Congress 10 years later as the President of his country--not a diplomat, not a politician, not an intellectual, not a scholar, an unemployed electrician who showed up in this country 10 years later as the President of his country. 
   He said: We didn't break a windowpane in Poland. We didn't have guns. We didn't have bullets. We were armed with an idea and that idea simply was that free people ought to be free to choose their own destiny. 
   I have never forgotten that moment, understanding the power of ideas and understanding that common people can do uncommon things. Ordinary people can do extraordinary things. Wondering where did Lech Walesa get the courage to pull himself up that Saturday morning in a shipyard in Gdansk, an unemployed electrician, believing so strongly in the need to provoke change in this Communist country that this man and his followers toppled a Communist government and lit the fuse, caused a spark that lit the fuse that began to topple Communist governments all through Eastern Europe. That is the power of an idea. 
   What are the ideas that exist in this country that will make a better America and create a better future? We know from our history that in two centuries, a series of ideas by some remarkable men and women have created the best country in the world. It is the freest. I know there are a lot of blemishes, but there is no country that has freedoms like ours. There is no country that has accomplished what we have accomplished in every area. Find an area where we have had difficulty, we have confronted it. We have had difficult times, but we have solved the issues. We survived a civil war. We survived a great depression. When you think of what this country has done, it is quite remarkable. 
   We stand today at the edge of a new century, the year 2000, with a lot of challenges in front of us. Some say we are just sort of content to be where we are and to kind of nick around the edges. No person, no country, no organization ever does well by resting. 
   There are challenges in front of us. We have talked about some of them. Some of them will be in this legislation when we bring it to the floor. Some will be in other legislation. I was on the floor yesterday and Senator DURBIN, who is on the floor at the moment, talked about the challenge of making our health care system work; the challenge of passing a Patients' Bill of Rights, and one that is a real Patients' Bill of Rights; the challenge of putting a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program. Those are ideas--ideas with power and resonance, ideas which ought to relate to the public policy this Congress embraces. I talked, a little bit ago, about trade policy, the idea that we need to change trade policy to make it a policy that is effective for our country, to reduce the trade deficits and continue to expand markets, and to have fair rules of trade. 
   There are so many things we need to do. Yesterday, I showed some of the challenges that we ought to address now in the coming weeks. For instance, gun safety. This is a wonderful country, but when you read the newspapers and read of the killings, and then you understand that we have a right to own weapons--and nobody is changing that right; it is a constitutional right. But we have said it makes sense for us to keep guns out of the hands of convicted felons. How do we do that? 
   We have a computer base with the names of felons on it. When you want to buy a gun, your name has to be run against the computer base. At the gun store, they run your name to find out if you are a convicted felon. If you are, you don't get a gun. But guess what. You can go to a gun show on a Saturday someplace and buy a gun or a weapon, and nobody is going to run your name through an instant check. 
   We say let's close that loophole. Are those who don't want to close it saying they don't want to keep guns out of their hands? I hope not. So join us in fixing this problem. That is an idea. That has some power. How many Americans will that save? How many children will it save by keeping the gun out of the hands of a convicted felon? We are not talking about law-abiding citizens. We are not going to disadvantage them. Let's keep guns out of the hands of convicted felons. Close the gun show loophole. It is a simple idea; yet one we can't get through the Congress because people are blocking the door on this issue. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights: We talked about that yesterday. We talked about putting a drug benefit in the Medicare program. We talked about school modernization. I will conclude by talking for a moment about school modernization. 
   Our future is education. I have told my colleagues many times about walking into the late-Congressman Claude Pepper's office and seeing two pictures, both autographed, behind his chair. One was a picture of Orville and Wilbur Wright making the first airplane flight. It was autographed by Orville Wright, saying, ``To Congressman Pepper, with deep admiration, Orville Wright.'' 
   Then, the first person to stand on the Moon, Neil Armstrong, gave him an autographed picture. I thought to myself, this is really something. Here is a living American who has an autographed picture of the first person to leave the ground in powered flight, and also the person who flew all the way to the Moon. What was the in between? What was the difference between just leaving the ground and arriving on the Moon? Education, schools, learning; it is our future--allowing every young boy and girl in this country to become the very best they can be; universal education, saying that every young boy or girl, no matter what their background or circumstances are, can walk through a schoolroom door and be  whatever they want to be in life, universal opportunity in education. 
   In the middle part of this past century, those who came back fighting for liberty in the Second World War, fighting for freedom, built schools all across our country as they went to school on the GI bill, got married, and had children. They built schools all 
   across America. Now those schools, in many cases, are 45, 50 years old and in desperate need of repair and renovation. This country, as good as it is, can send our kids to the schoolroom doors of the best schools in the world. And we should. That ought to be our policy. So before this Congress ends, let's embrace our ideas and policies of saying let's modernize our schools, renovate our schools, and connect our schools to the Internet. Let's reduce the size of classes and make sure every student has the opportunity to go through a schoolroom door that we as parents are proud of. Let's make sure we keep the finest teachers, the best teachers in our classrooms and pay them a fair wage. These are ideas that we have that we can't get through this Congress. It doesn't make any sense to me. 
   So we are prepared to bring the Treasury-general government appropriations bill to the floor. In that legislation there will be several of the ideas I have talked about, and other appropriations bills, and other pieces of legislation. We will continue to pound away at this Congress to say: Accept some of these ideas. Accept some progress. Join us. This isn't partisan. Our kids and our schools don't represent a partisan issue. Keeping guns out of the hands of felons surely can't be a Republican or Democratic issue. Surely, every American should embrace that goal. Putting the prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program so senior citizens who have reached their declining income years have the opportunity and can afford to buy life-saving drugs surely can't be a Republican or Democratic approach. There can't be differences here in terms of goals. So let's resolve to join together to meet these goals, to do our work and embrace ideas--yes, big ideas--that recognize, yes, this country is doing very well in a lot of areas, but we are at the first stage of a new century, and we need to embrace new ideas to advance this country's interests and prepare for this country's future. Nowhere is that preparation more necessary than with our children and our schools. 
   Mr. President, I have spoken at some length. I know others on the floor have comments about these and other issues. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was listening to some of the discussion this morning before the Senate broke for the party lunches. I was especially interested in a couple of presentations about the progress some think the Senate has made in this Congress, and about why they believe the Senate is not making progress today or this week. 
   It reminds me of the story of the fly that landed on the nose of an ox. The ox, with the fly on its nose, went out for the entire day and plowed in the field. They came back to the village at night, and the villagers began applauding. The fly, still on the nose of the ox, took a deep bow and said to the villagers: We've been plowing. 
   That is sort of what I heard this morning--we've been plowing--when, in fact, this Senate, as all of us know, has not done the work we should have been doing for the American people. 
   I thought it would be interesting to describe what the agenda should have been and what we have done. 
   I will talk about some of the issues with which most Americans believe the Congress should be dealing: Common sense gun safety. For those who might be listening, I'm not talking about gun control; this is not in any way going to abridge people's Second Amendment right to own guns. This legislation will, however, close a loophole in the law that allows people to purchase guns at gun shows without having to get an instant check. 
   If you buy a gun in this country in a gun store, you must have your name run through an instant check system  to find out whether you are a felon. That makes good sense. We should not sell guns to felons. The instant check system helps identify if someone trying to buy a gun at a gun store has been previously convicted of a felony and therefore should not be sold a weapon. 
   But guess what? Go to a gun show on a Saturday somewhere and you can buy a gun without an instant check being done. This does not make any sense. We want to close that loophole. We do not want to be selling guns at a gun show to a convicted felon. Yet we cannot get this common sense piece of legislation enacted in this Congress because it is considered radical or extreme by some. It is a very simple proposition: Close the gun show loophole to prevent felons from buying guns. We should get that done. 
   Or what about the Patients' Bill of Rights? Every day 14,000 patients are denied needed medicines; 10,000 are denied needed tests and procedures in this country. But we cannot pass a decent Patients' Bill of Rights because, in this Congress, we have people who stand with the big insurance companies rather than standing with patients. 
   I know it is inconvenient to some to hear about specific patients who have been denied needed care by their HMOs. I have talked about these patients at great length in the past because these folks are what the Patients' Bill of Rights is all about. It is about the woman who fell off a 40-foot cliff while she was hiking in the Shenandoah Mountains. She fell 40 feet, broke several bones and was hauled unconscious into a hospital emergency room on a gurney. After surviving her life-threatening injuries, she was told by her managed care organization that it would not cover her medical care in the emergency room because she didn't have prior approval to go to the emergency room. This is a woman who was hauled into the emergency room unconscious. That is the sort of thing people are confronting these days. 
   Senator REID and I had a hearing in Nevada on this subject. At that hearing, a woman stood up and talked about her son. Her son is dead now. He died last October at 16 years of age. He was battling cancer and needed a special kind of chemotherapy to give him a chance to save his life. Unfortunately, his insurance company denied him this care. He not only had to battle cancer, but he also had to battle the insurance company that wouldn't cover the care he needed. His mother held up a very large picture of her son at the hearing and, with tears in her eyes, she cried as she told us: As my son lay dying, he looked up at me and said, Mom, I just don't understand how they could do this to a kid. 
   Kids who are battling cancer ought not have to battle the insurance companies or HMOs. Yet that is what is happening too often in this country. We propose to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights that is very simple. It says every patient in this country has a right to know all of his or her options for medical treatment, not just the cheapest option. It says that if you have an emergency and go to an emergency room, you have a right to care in that emergency room. It says that if you have cancer and your employer or your spouse's employer changes health plans, you have a right to continue seeing the oncologist who has been helping you to fight that cancer. But we can't get a Patients' Bill of Rights enacted because when it comes time to say who you stand with--the patients who ought to have certain rights or the big insurance companies that in too many cases have denied those rights--too many Senators say: We stand with the insurance companies. 
   The last time we debated this issue on the floor, about a month ago, my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator NICKLES, offered an amendment that he called a Patients' Bill of Rights. He accomplished his purpose, I suspect, because the next day the paper said the Senate passed a Patients' Bill of Rights. However, what the Senate really passed was a ``patients' bill of goods,'' not a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I thought it interesting that Dr. GANSKE, a Republican Congressman, wrote this letter:  
   Heaven forbid that any member of Congress would ever vote on a bill they haven't had time to read! Heaven really forbid that a member would vote on a bill that their staff hasn't seen! 
   Yet, that is exactly what happened two weeks ago on the floor of the Senate when the Nickles HMO amendment was brought up for a vote. 
   People are just now beginning to realize what was in that legislation. To help you understand the fundamental flaws of the Nickles bill, I am including a copy of an analysis of the Senate's patient's bill of rights that was added to the FY 2001 Labor/HHS legislation. 
   This Senate legislation eliminates virtually any meaningful remedy for most working Americans and their families against death and injury caused by HMOs.  
   This is Dr. GANSKE, a Republican Congressman, making this reference to the Nickles bill. He then includes a rather lengthy analysis. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print Dr. GANSKE's letter and the analysis in the RECORD.

   Mr. DORGAN. We cannot get a real Patients' Bill of Rights passed. How about a Medicare prescription drug benefit? Well, we are not able to get that done either. We have been busy providing tax cuts, an estate tax repeal and a change in the marriage tax penalty. The head of OMB said yesterday that, under the recent tax proposals passed by the majority party, the top 1 percent of the income earners in this country will get more tax cuts than the bottom 80 percent combined. 
   This explains why the upper income folks, those with the largest estates and the highest incomes, rally around these tax cut proposals. There should really be no difference between the parties on the estate tax. Those of us in the minority believe we ought to repeal the estate tax for family farms and small businesses and allow a reasonable accumulation of wealth for a family. We said if you have up to $4 million, you should pay no estate tax. For a family farmer or small business, you can have assets up to $8 million and pay no estate tax at all. But that wasn't good enough for the majority. The majority party said, we must also fight to eliminate the tax burden on the estates of the Donald Trumps of America who will die with half a billion or a billion or several billion dollars. At what price? What else could we do with the money that the majority wants to use to relieve the tax burden on the wealthiest estates in America? 
   Perhaps we could use it to reduce the Federal debt. It seems to me that is probably a better priority than providing a tax cut for the estates of billionaires. Or we could use the money for a prescription drug benefit for Medicare, perhaps for school modernization, or to hire more teachers to lower class sizes. There are a whole series of proposals that might represent a better alternative than deciding we must use this revenue to relieve the tax burden on the largest estates in this country. 
   Is a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program important? It is quite clear that if we were creating the Medicare program today, we would provide coverage for prescription drugs through Medicare. Senior citizens make up twelve percent of our population, but they consume one-third of all the prescription drugs used in this country. They reach a period in their life where they need to maintain their health, and miracle drugs that did not exist 30 years ago now exist to extend their lives. In the 20th century, we increased the life expectancy in America  by 30 years. A part of the reason for that is better nutrition, better living conditions, better education about healthy living, but part of the reason is also miracle drugs. 
   It is not unusual for a senior citizen to be taking two, four, five, and in some cases, ten or twelve different prescription drugs to deal with their health challenges. Those prescription drugs are enormously costly. The price is increasing every year. Last year, spending on prescription drugs in America increased 16 percent in 1 year. The year before the increase was about the same. Many senior citizens just can't afford these expenses. 
   I have held hearings through the Democratic Policy Committee in five or six States on this subject. I have had senior citizen after senior citizen tell me that, when going shopping, they first must go to the pharmacy in the back of the grocery store to purchase their prescription drugs. Only after they have bought their medications do they know how much money they have left to purchase food. It is a common story all across the country. So should we add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program? Of course, we should. Will we? We won't do it unless we get some cooperation from a majority party that believes this is not a priority for the country. 
   We believe it is. We have a plan that will provide a prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries in a way that is cost-effective, in a way that will tend to push down the prices of prescription drugs and provide an opportunity for coverage for senior citizens who elect to have this benefit. That ought to be part of the agenda in this Congress, but we can't get it done. 
   Or what about school modernization? This country has had such a wonderful 20th century, especially the last half of the century following the Second World War. Those who fought for America's freedom in World War II came back to this country, and began careers, got married, had children. They built schools all over America 50 years ago. Many of those schools are now in disrepair. These schools need renovation or replacement. 
   Not only are many of these schools desperately in need of modernization and renovation, but there is also a need to reduce class sizes from 28 or more, in some classes, down to 18 kids or fewer. 
   We know the quality of education is better when there are smaller class sizes. We know it is better for kids' education when they are going through the door of a modern schoolroom that all of us can be proud of. As I have said many times--and if it is tiresome to people, it doesn't matter to me--it is hard to go to the Cannon Ball Elementary School in North Dakota and have a third grader such as Rosie Two Bears say: Mr. Senator, will you build us a new school? That school has 150 students, one water fountain, and two bathrooms. Some of the classrooms have to be evacuated periodically because of raw sewage seeping up through the floors. Part of the building is 90 years old and has largely been condemned. 
   Are we proud of sending that young girl through that classroom door? I don't think so. We can do better. Perhaps that is more important than providing relief from the estate tax burden of somebody who dies with $1 billion. Instead of being able to leave only $600 million to their heirs, they get to leave all of the $1 billion because the majority party says that is their priority. Their priority is to give tax cuts to the top 1 percent of the American income earners that are more than the tax cuts we are going to give to all of the bottom 80 percent. That is their priority. My point is that we ought to be focusing on other priorities. 
   So this morning when we had people shuffle over to the floor of the Senate and talk about what a wonderful job this Congress has done and how we are stalled now because the Democrats somehow don't want to do anything, I just had to come over here and correct the record. One of the things hanging up work today is that there are people who have been nominated as Federal judges whose nominations have been before the Senate for 3 years without having been brought to the floor for a vote. We would like that to happen. That is considered unreasonable. 
   I say to those who think this Congress has a wonderful record that this is a Congress of underachievers. We have a little time left. We have this week and September and the first week of October. This is what we have to do. We have a Patients' Bill of Rights that we ought to pass. We have gun safety legislation that we ought to pass. We ought to close the gun show loophole. We ought to pass an increase in the minimum wage. The fact is, those working at the bottom rung of the economic ladder in this country have lost ground. Everybody here is so worried about providing tax breaks to the top income earners. What about providing some help to those at the bottom of the economic scale? These people get up and get dressed and have breakfast in the morning and go out and work hard, and they are trying to raise a family on a minimum wage that has not kept pace with inflation. We ought to do something about that. 
   We ought to provide a Medicare drug benefit. We can do that to address the needs of our senior citizens who are now struggling with health problems and just to make ends meet, only to discover that, in their twilight years, the medicines they need to make life better are financially out of reach for them. 
   Last week, we passed a piece of legislation that says maybe we ought to be able to access the more reasonable prescription drug prices on exactly the same prescription drugs that exist in Canada and elsewhere. The same companies produce the same pill, put it in the same bottle, and they sell it for a third of the price up in Winnipeg, Canada, or, for that matter, in virtually any other country in which they sell these drugs. 
   Last week, I suggested that I would like to see just one Senator stand up--in fact, I renew the challenge to anybody who wants to come to the floor--on the floor of the Senate and say that it is fair for American consumers to pay significantly more for the same exact drug than consumers in other countries. I will give any Senator who wants to do this the pill bottles; I held up 
   several last week. The bottle of the prescription drug sold in the U.S. costs $3.82 a pill and the same drug in the same bottle, made by the same company, in the same manufacturing plant, sold in Canada costs only $1.82 a pill. The U.S. consumer pays $3.82 and the Canadian consumer pays $1.82. I want to see a Senator, just one Senator, stand up and hold these bottles and say, yes, this is fair to my constituents and, yes, this price inequity is something we ought to support. Of course, no one will because nobody believes that is fair. That is another issue that we have to address. We were able to get some legislation through the Senate and, of course, the pharmaceutical industry has indicated that it fully intends to kill that in conference. We will see. 
   So there is a lot left for this Senate to do. We have, at the end of this week, a break for the two national conventions, and then in September and October we will see the end of the 106th Congress. All legislation introduced between January of last year and now will eventually die, unless it is passed by this Congress, and we will have to start over again next year. So the questions of whether this is an effective Congress and whether this Congress creates a record any of us can be proud of are going to be answered in the next few months. Are we able to address the issues that the American people care about? Will the majority party stop obstructing on these issues? Will they decide a Patients' Bill of Rights should be passed by Congress? If so, let's do it soon. Will we be able to address the issue of reasonable gun safety measures, increasing the minimum wage, adding a drug benefit for Medicare, and school modernization? Those and other issues, it seems to me, are central to an agenda that will strengthen and improve this country. We will see in the coming days exactly what the 106th Congress decides it wants to leave as its legacy. 
   One of the great things about this democracy of ours is that the majority rules. That is certainly true in the Senate. They control the schedule. That is why we are now in morning business in the afternoon. Only in the Senate can you be in morning business in the afternoon, I guess. But we are not debating an appropriations bill, and we should be. There aren't enough people wanting to bring judges to the floor for confirmation and so on.  
   The point is this: The majority party has a choice to decide which of these issues and how many of them they want this Congress to adopt. I hope it will decide very soon that it chooses to join us and say these are the issues that matter to the American people, and these are the issues the 106th Congress shall embrace in the final weeks of this Congress. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to oppose the amendment offered by my colleague and friend from Arizona, Senator MCCAIN. I want to talk about a number of things that have been discussed about sugar, the sugar program, in this amendment. 
   First, let me talk about ``free trade.'' There is not free trade in sugar around the world. It is not the case that the price that is described as the world price for sugar represents a free trade price. It is a fact that most sugar that is bought and sold around the world is bought and sold on contracts between countries. The quantity of sugar that is produced above that is sold on the dump market for dump market prices, but most sugar is traded or sold between countries on contract. So the price that is quoted as the world price for sugar is not the world price for sugar at all. That is a myth. That is No. 1. 
   No. 2, the issue of who is getting a subsidy; is someone getting a large subsidy? There aren't any subsidies. This is not a program that has a subsidy. This is not a program in which the taxpayer is taxed and money comes to the Federal Government and money is given to a producer. There are no payments to producers. There are no subsidies. That is the second point. 
   There are forces that have wanted to abolish the sugar program for some long while. The sugar program is not a program that gives a payment to a producer. It does create a circumstance of balance between production and imports in order to achieve a domestic price that provides stability for consumers and stability for producers. Some don't like that. Who are they? Well, they call themselves the Coalition for Sugar Reform. Who or what is the Coalition for Sugar Reform? Anyone can guess that. The American Bakers Association, the National Confectioners Association, the Biscuit and Cracker Manufacturers Association, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association, the Independent Bakers Association. 
   Let's look at these groups. The price of sugar has dropped 30 percent since last summer, to a 22-year low. The price of sugar has dropped by a third. Anyone who listens to me should ask themselves, have I purchased a candy bar lately? If so, did I see a reduction in the cost of the candy bar? Did I buy a can of soda? If so, was it cheaper than it used to be? The answer, clearly, is no. Sugar prices have dropped by 30 percent. Chocolate and candy prices are up by 6 percent. Cookies, cakes, and other bakery products are up by 7 to 8 percent. Cereal and ice cream prices are up by 9 percent. Buy just a bag of sugar at the store and see whether it costs 30 percent less. 
   Let's figure out where sugar comes from. It comes from a family farm in the Red River Valley of North Dakota. This family raises sugar beets. They buy a tractor, they buy other equipment with which to plant the seeds; then they buy fuel, they buy fertilizer, they get up in the mornings and gas up the tractor and go break the ground. They do the things farmers do. They take all the risks. They do all the work. And then they hope. They hope something doesn't happen to the crop. They hope it doesn't get burned out, flooded out, or have disease. If all of those hopes are realized, maybe at the end of the year they get a crop--maybe. 
   After risking all their money and working all year, if they get a crop, then maybe they get a crop that has a price above the cost of production. But maybe not. 
   Some say: It doesn't matter who is producing these things; we really don't care--talking about the organizations, the Coalition for Sugar Reform--we don't care where it comes from; we just want to get the world price for sugar, the dump price for sugar. 
   What is the result of that? The result means devastation of family farms in many parts of this country--those families who are out there trying to earn a living as best they can, whose fortune, whose future is based on events around the globe over which they have no control and whom these organizations would like 
   to link to the world dump price for sugar. They can't make it. They wouldn't make it. 
   We have to ask the question, Is it reasonable for us in this country to decide we want to do a couple of things at once? One, provide stable prices for sugar for the American consumer. We  have done that. U.S. retail prices for sugar are virtually unchanged for more than a decade. How many prices exist on the grocery store shelf where we can say that price is largely unchanged for an entire decade? Not very many. Sugar, we can. 
   Why is it we have price stability for consumers? It has not always been that way. We have seen times when the price of sugar has spiked up, up, way up. The sugar program has provided stability of price for the consumer. At the same time, it has tried to provide some basic stability of price for the producer that takes the risk of producing. Some don't like that. They say producers don't matter much here. They do matter. They are part of the economic backbone of this country. They are the salt of the Earth. The folks who are out there trying to make a living on America's family farmers--and yes, I say to those questions, yes, they are family farmers. If you doubt it, come with me and I will take you to a few. We will drive in the yard, see the equipment, talk to the family. These are family farmers producing sugar beets. 
   On another point about how well they do, the cost of production for sugar in this country is well below the cost of production in the world average. In fact, we have the lowest cost of beet sugar producers in the world. Yet they couldn't compete against dumped sugar at dump sugar prices. Should they have to compete in a global economy against dump sugar prices? The answer is no, of course not. 
   We ought to be willing to stand up for this country's producers. I am not at all embarrassed, and I will never be embarrassed, for standing up for the economic interests of America's producers, to say to them, you deserve an opportunity to have a fair return. That is what this program is all about. 
   In my judgment, this amendment ought to be tabled by this Senate. I believe it will be tabled. I have a series of charts, but I think my colleague from North Dakota, Senator CONRAD, and Senator BREAUX and Senator CRAIG and others have used the charts. They show prices. They show what has happened to our producers--a devastating price collapse. 
   Let me make one other parenthetical point. It seems to me, if you are going to start dealing with farm issues, the last thing you would want to do is go to one part of the farm program that historically has worked pretty well. We have had some problems with it in recent months for a number of reasons. Historically, this program has been the one part of the farm program that has worked. It seems to me you would not go to that one and take that apart. Make the rest of them work as well. But I think it is interesting that the same people who are the Coalition for Sugar Reform, they have one common ingredient in the things they produce--grains, oilseed, dairy and sugar. In every circumstance, the return for these commodities to the people who produce them--the people who get up in the morning, do all the work, do the chores, spend the day in the field, harvest the crops, and take all the risks--in every circumstance, we have seen a substantial decline: Wheat, corn, soybean prices less than half what they were 4 years ago; milk prices a little more than half what they were a year ago; sugar prices down by a third. 
   That is not, in my judgment, what this Congress, what this Senate ought to be expecting to have happen for our producers. I hope we will decide today, by an overwhelming margin, to table this amendment. 
   Let me end as I began. I have great respect for the Senator from Arizona and others who may feel the way he does. I do not in any way suggest what he is doing is something he does not believe passionately about. But I believe very strongly this amendment ought to be tabled. This Congress ought to be about the business of strengthening the sugar program and making that sugar program work as it has worked for so many years, not taking it apart. This is not a circumstance where our farmers are competing in free trade. There is not free trade in sugar. It is not a circumstance where farmers are getting a subsidy. There is no subsidy paid to sugar producers. It is a circumstance where this is a program that deserves the support of the Senate this afternoon. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from New Mexico and also to the Senators from Texas and Arizona that it is my intention, having offered this amendment, to ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment after I have had a chance to discuss exactly what the Senator from New Mexico just described--new events that have occurred that have been quite disastrous in my State and some others that are now occurring in a significant region of the country dealing with drought. 
   My point is to say this about this amendment--and some of my colleagues will want to reinforce it. We have an agricultural disaster, not with respect to the collapse of commodity prices but with respect to floods and drought that have destroyed a significant number of crops in various parts of our country. 
   If I might, with my colleagues' consent, show a picture of a fellow standing in front of about 300 acres of soybeans. As you can see, it is of course nothing but water. These soybeans are gone. It is the result of a June 12 and June 13 deluge of rain that fell in the Red River Valley, somewhere in the neighborhood of 16 to 19 inches of rain in a period of about 36 hours. 
   Let me say that again. 
   In the Red River Valley, on dead flat land, 16 to 19 inches of rain fell in some areas in about 36 hours. Then on June 19, in Cass County, and in Richland County, and several other areas of the State, in a 6-hour period a group of thunderstorms came together and dumped 8 to 9 inches of rain in a very short period of time. The result was fields as far as the eye could see that looked exactly like this, with crops planted that are devastated and destroyed. In fact, in the Red River Valley area, both in the northern and the southern part of the valley, about 1.7 million acres of crops were lost or significantly damaged as a result of those two devastating events. 
   We also have a significant drought that is occurring right now in the southern part of our country. As you know, crops are burning up at an accelerated pace. We have a disaster occurring for farmers in other parts of the country. 
   Let me again say it is my intention to seek consent to withdraw the amendment. I offered the amendment for the purpose of saying to the Congress that, yes, in fact, new events have occurred beginning on June 12 and 13 in our State when 18 to 19 inches of rain fell in about 36 hours, devastating a million and three-quarters acres of crop land. New events are occurring this week, and occurred last week, and I assume in the weeks ahead, with respect to the crops in the southern region of the United States. 
   I think we will have to address this issue. I think somehow we have to find a way to provide some assistance to those family farmers whose crops have been destroyed by a natural disaster. 
   Some will say perhaps there was some money provided earlier in the year in an agriculture bill for family farmers. That of course is true, and it dealt with the issue of collapsed grain prices. That reimbursement had to do with the collapse of market prices for commodities. There is, however, a circumstance in our country today, given the new laws in recent years, in which we don't have a disaster program available to try to provide some assistance when these disasters occur. 
   I offered the amendment for the purpose of discussing it, as will my colleague. 
   At this point, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from Wisconsin, and others, including the Senator from Alaska and my colleagues who have agreed to a compromise. 
   The history of disaster aid in this Congress is well over a century old. This is not a new issue. For well over a century, Congress has dealt with the issue of disasters that have occurred in some parts of this country. 
   I am proud of supporting disaster aid for areas of this country that suffer earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, and tornadoes. In the case of the fires that recently ravaged and injured so many people and their property in New Mexico, I am proud to say that I wanted us to help them, and we did. I am proud to say I helped the folks in Los Angeles who were flattened by earthquakes, and the folks in Texas who have been injured by drought. 
   It is one of those areas of public spending where I say it is the best this country has to offer. When a region of this country, when its people are flat on their backs from causes that they could not control, this Congress extends its hand and says to them: You are not alone. We want to help you. We have a long tradition of doing that, and I am proud of that tradition. 
   In North Dakota, as my colleague indicated, late one night in June, several thunderstorms converged together and then did not move. In a State that gets 17 inches of rainfall in a year, in one spot they received 18 to 20 inches in 36 hours. Think of that. About a week and a half later, the Red River Valley, land that is dead flat, flat as a table top, received 8 inches of rain in 6 hours. They were flooded. Up to 1.7 million acres of farmland that people planted in the spring with the sweat of their brow and risked their money to plant were either destroyed or severely damaged.  
   We ask Congress to recognize that this, too, is a natural disaster for those producers and people who live in those areas. That is what this is about. None of us in this Chamber should ever be bashful about saying there are people in need in this country, and when that need exists because of causes they did not control or could not control--fires, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods--then we should respond. 
   It represents the very best impulse, in my judgment, of this body. That is what this debate is about. From our standpoint, it is especially about family farmers. As I said earlier today, they are some of the best in this country. They risk their money. They hope for a good crop. So many things are beyond their control. Then they discover that late one night a hailstorm comes through, and the crops are devastated; or a flood inundates their crops; or a drought dries them up; or the insects come and eat them out; or disease comes and their crop is gone. That is what this is about. 
   Mr. President, those tonight who worked for a solution to add some emergency funding to this piece of legislation have done those in need in this country a service. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Agriculture Diversity Project, which is administered by the Red River Trade Council through the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service. The Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee has funded this program in the past, and I want to thank the Chairman and the Ranking Minority of the Agriculture Appropriations Committee for their support. 
   As my colleagues know, one of the areas of economy that has not shared in the current economic boom is agriculture. The farmers and those who live and operate businesses in rural America are struggling financially to maintain not only a reasonable standard of living, but also the preservation of a rural lifestyle. They are desperate to find ways that will allow them to stay and to make a living in rural America. 
   The Agriculture Diversification Project now underway seeks to add value to existing crop production, establish high value crop alternatives to those crops traditionally grown in the region, develop processing facilities, and create markets for both new crops and the value added products. One added dimension to the program in Fiscal Year 2001 will be an Internet-based information resource for farmers and other rural residents intended for those who are interested in a sustainable rural economy through entrepreneurship, product development, and marketing. This new aspect of the project will demand additional resources above what the Subcommittee provided in this bill. I hope that we might be able to provide at least $500,000 for this project--which is the level of funding that the House provided in its bill.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate passed by a margin of 74-21 the Jeffords-Dorgan amendment to allow for importation of FDA-approved prescription medicines by licensed pharmacists and drug wholesalers. This amendment addresses a very important issue for American consumers, especially for senior citizens who must pay for their medicines out of their own pockets. The same medications sold in the United States are also sold in Canada and other countries, often at substantially lower prices. This amendment has the potential to save American consumers millions of dollars by giving them access to their medicines at these lower prices at their local pharmacies.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I join my many colleagues here in the Senate today expressing my sympathies to the Coverdell family and telling them our thoughts and prayers are with them during this difficult time. A poet once said:  
   There is no joy life gives like that it takes away.  
   I expect the Coverdell family and all who loved PAUL and understand the hurt and anguish at his passing, today know well what that verse means. 
   This is an unusual place, this Senate. There are 100 of us, men and women from all parts of the country. We have days where we have pretty aggressive debates and fights about public policy. PAUL COVERDELL was in the middle of many of those. I never heard PAUL COVERDELL say a mean word to anyone in the Senate. I told him one day at the end of a rather lengthy debate in which I was on the other side and the vote was called and we were standing in the well:  
   You and I don't agree on this issue, but you are a very good Senator.  
   We served in different political parties. We, in many cases, believed differently about issues. But PAUL COVERDELL was a very good Senator and served this country well. 
   The important part about PAUL was, though he felt great passion about public policy and the issues he brought to the floor of the Senate, again, he never uttered a mean word about anyone in debate. You can always disagree in this country without being disagreeable. PAUL COVERDELL demonstrated that every day in his pursuit of the public policy he believed was important for this country. 
   We are so busy and our schedules have us on our way here and there and everywhere all week, and then often to our respective homes in the 50 States on weekends, so it is hard to get to know each other very well. But each day, as we move around in this Capitol, all of us in the Senate exchange greetings and words, occasionally a story or two. Last week, I was in the elevator with Senator COVERDELL. We laughed a bit about his being compared, from time to time, in his presentation, to George Bush. I always used to kid him about that, that sometimes he had a cadence that reminded me of the ex-President. 
   He sort of kidded me and said someone told him he was doing Dana Carvey who was doing George Bush, so he was two steps away from the impression. We laughed about that. 
   Last Friday, as we were having a long series of votes, towards the end of the votes I visited with Senator COVERDELL because Georgia has been a State hardest hit by drought. I told him we had been hit so severely with respect to floods. On behalf of our farmers, I was trying to see if we could put together a piece of legislation that would deal with crops that had been flooded out, destroyed by flood, and crops in Georgia and elsewhere that were being destroyed by drought. On Friday morning, PAUL indicated he wanted to join me in an amendment to this bill, the Agriculture appropriations bill that is being considered in the Senate, to provide some assistance for family farmers who were victims of the drought that was occurring in his State and throughout the South. 
   He was always available to talk about public policy and what was happening; always especially available and concerned to talk about the people of his State of Georgia. I wanted to come today to say the Senate will miss PAUL COVERDELL. He was not only a good Senator, but he served this country very well. He was a friend to all of us. My thoughts and prayers go to his wife and his family. We say thank you to his memory. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the legislation offered by the Senator from Vermont. But before I speak on that let me just mention to the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from Wisconsin who have brought this bill to the floor, I am a member of their subcommittee on appropriations. I certainly respect the work they have done. They do an outstanding job, they and their staffs, putting together the Agriculture appropriations bill. It is not an easy bill to construct and to bring to the floor. 
   One amendment that I will offer at a later time will deal with the disaster now facing farmers who have flooded lands and especially those farmers whose crops are burning up day after day in the deep South. 
   Last Friday morning, as we were taking a series of votes, I talked with Senator COVERDELL. He and I were prepared to offer an amendment to assist farmers dealing with flooded lands in my part of the country and drought-stricken lands in Georgia. Georgia is the hardest hit State with drought  problems, and family farmers there are suffering substantially. Senator COVERDELL intended to join me in offering an amendment offering them some emergency assistance. I will want to address this issue on this legislation. I will certainly talk with the chairman and the ranking member to do so in a way that relates to the needs of the Senate, but especially in a way that meets the needs of those family farmers who, through no fault of theirs but through natural disasters, have seen their crops disappear and are suffering some very significant problems. 
   I will save further discussion of this problem for a later time in this debate. 
   With regard to the amendment offered by the Senator from Vermont, I strongly support this amendment. Several bills have been introduced in Congress on this subject. I introduced a piece of similar legislation along with Senator WELLSTONE and Senator SNOWE. I am also pleased to join as a cosponsor of the legislation authored by the Senator from Vermont. 
   All of these bills relate to the same issue. That issue is very important and one we should address. The reason it is being addressed here and now is that the House of Representatives has already addressed it on its Agriculture appropriations bill, and it is important that the Senate also weigh in on this issue. The Senator from Vermont certainly has a right, and is protected with respect to germaneness, to offer this amendment to this bill. 
   Let me describe the issue before us in terms that people can better understand, using a couple of different medicines as examples. 
   I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to use these medicine bottles in my presentation.

   Mr. DORGAN. I have here bottles of 3 different prescription drugs that are ranked among the top 20 in the United States in the number of prescriptions filled and sales volume. All of these drugs, incidentally, are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
   I have here the actual bottles for these medicines. This one happens to be Zoloft, which is used to treat depression. The company that produces these pills and puts them in different size bottles then sells them all around the world. It is exactly the same medicine produced by the same company, sold in different places. Buy it, for example, in Emerson, Canada, and you will pay $1.28 for a pill. Buy it 5 miles south of there in Pembina, ND, and you will not pay $1.28 for the same pill. Instead you will pay $2.34. It is the same pill in the same bottle, made by the same company in the same manufacturing plant. The only thing different is the price. The pill costs $1.28 in Canada, and $2.34 for an American consumer. 
   Or what about Zocor? Zocor is a very popular prescription drug. Pick up any Newsweek or Time magazine and see the multipage ads for this drug. I have here two bottles of Zocor made by the same company, with the identical manufacturing process. One bottle is sent to Canada where it costs $1.82 per tablet; the other is sent to a U.S. consumer who is charged $3.82: $1.82 for someone living in Winnipeg, $3.82 for someone living in Montpelier. 
   Norvasc is a prescription drug that is used to lower blood pressure. The bottles are almost identical--again, both bottles 
   are by the same manufacturer, and contain the same pill. Norvasc costs the Canadian consumer 90 cents. It costs the U.S. consumer $1.25 per pill. 
   Or to look at this price disparity another way, the cost of a 1-month supply of Zocor--the same pill, by the same company, in the same bottle--is $54 when it is sent to a Canadian. When it is sent to an American, it costs $114. 
   Or Zoloft--again the same pill, by the same company, made in the same manufacturing plant--costs the Canadian $38 for a 1-month supply; the American pays $70. 
   Norvasc costs Canadians $27 for a one month supply and the same quantity costs Americans $37. I can show you medicine where the price inequity is 10 to 1. 
   The question our constituents in the States of Vermont, North Dakota, Minnesota, and Washington ask is: How can this be justified? This is the same product. If this is a global economy, why must I go to Canada to try to buy a prescription drug that was manufactured in the United States in the first place in order to buy it for half the price? That is what Americans all across this country are asking. 
   The companies that produce these medicines are able to access all of the ingredients they need to produce prescription drugs from all around the world in order to get the lowest prices. If the pharmaceutical manufacturers are able to benefit from the global economy, why then can the consumer not also access that same drug made in a plant approved by the FDA when it is being sold in Winnipeg for half the price? 
   What is the answer to that? Many of us believe American consumers should be able to also benefit from the global economy. My colleague from the State of Washington, Mr. GORTON, has sponsored his own legislation to address this issue and he is also a cosponsor of this amendment. All of us have to respond to our constituents. 
   This is not just a Canada-United States issue. Americans pay higher prices than anywhere else in the world. How much more do we pay? If Americans pay an average of $1 for a pharmaceutical product, that same product has a much lower average cost in every other industrialized nation. We pay $1; the Canadians pay 64 cents. We pay $1; the English pay 65 cents. We pay $1; the Swedes pay 68 cents. We pay $1; the Italians pay 51 cents. We are charged the highest prices for prescription drugs of any country in the world. The American people ask the question: Why? 
   Senior citizens are 12 percent of our population, but they consume one-third of the prescription drugs in America. I come from a State with a lot of senior citizens. They have reached the years of their lives where, in most cases, they are no longer working and are living on a fixed income. Last year, they saw, as all Americans did, prescription drug spending in this country go up 16 percent in 1 year. Part of that is price inflation, part is driven by increased utilization. Nonetheless, older Americans saw a 16-percent increase in prescription drug spending in this country in 1 year. 
   Those of us who have held hearings on this issue and who have heard from senior citizens know what they say. They tell us they are forced to go to the back of the grocery store first, where the pharmacy is, to buy their prescription medicines because only then will they know how much money they have left to pay for food. Only then will they know whether they are going to get to eat after they have purchased their prescription drugs. 
   This is an issue for all Americans, not just senior citizens, but it is an especially acute problem for senior citizens. 
   In January on one cold, snowy day, I traveled with a group of North Dakota senior citizens to Emerson, Canada. 
   First we visited the doctor's office--because it is required in Canada--where the North Dakotans who wanted to buy prescription drugs in the Canadian pharmacy showed the doctor their prescription from a U.S. doctor, and the Canadian doctor wrote a prescription for them. Then we went to a very small, one-room pharmacy just off the main street of Emerson, Canada, a tiny little town of not more than 300 or 400 people. Emerson is 5 miles north of the North Dakota border. 
   I stood in that pharmacy and I watched the North Dakota senior citizens purchase their prescription drugs, and I saw how much money they were saving on the prescription drugs they were buying. 
   As is often the case, senior citizens will take 2, 3, 4, or 8 different prescription drugs. It is not at all unusual to see that. 
   I watched these North Dakotans compare what they were paying in the United States to what they were paying at this little one-room pharmacy in Emerson, Canada. It was staggering. 
   They asked me the question: Why do we have to come to Canada to do this? Why can't our pharmacists come up here and access this same supply of drugs and pass the savings along to us? 
   The answer is that there is a Federal law in this country that says that only the manufacturer can import prescription drugs into the United States. 
   The amendment we are considering, offered by the Senator from Vermont,  proposes to change that. He does not propose to do so in any way that would jeopardize the safety of medicines that are available in this country. He does not propose to in any way suggest that we should not maintain the chain of custody needed to assure a safe supply of prescription drugs. 
   But he does propose that we amend that law and replace it with a system that assures the safety of the medicine supply, while allowing pharmacists and drug wholesalers to go to Canada and go to other countries and access that same prescription drug, provided that it was produced in a plant that was approved by the FDA. This amendment assures not only the safety of the manufacturing process but also the chain of custody of the supply. In this way we will allow U.S. consumers the full flow and benefit of the global economy. 
   Why can't American pharmacists and drug wholesalers shop globally for prescription drugs, provided it is the same pill, put in the same bottle, manufactured by the same company in a plant that is approved by the FDA? 
   The answer is that they ought to be able to do that. There is no excuse any longer for preventing them from doing that. 
   Zocor, Prilosec, Zoloft, Vasotec, Norvasc, Cardizem--you can go right on down the list of the medicines most frequently used by senior citizens and compare what they cost here with what they cost in Canada and Mexico. Then ask the question: Why? Why are we in America charged so much more for the identical prescription drug? 
   The answer is simple: It is because the big drug companies can do it here. The pharmaceutical industry charges what the market will bear in the United States. The U.S. consumers are prevented from being a global consumer. 
   Let me say this about the pharmaceutical industry. I want them to do well. I support them on a range of things. I want them to be profitable, and I want them to be able to do substantial research. I do not wish them ill. I applaud them and thank them for the research they do to create lifesaving, miracle drugs. They only do part of the research, of course. A substantial part is also done through the National Institutes of Health, through publicly funded research. And we are dramatically increasing our investment in NIH. 
   But some will say to the Senator from Vermont: What you are doing will dramatically reduce research and development by the drug companies. These prices are what support research and development. 
   Hogwash. Nonsense. The fact is, a larger percentage of the 
   research and development is done by the drug companies in Europe than is done in the United States. Let me say that again. More research and development is done in Europe than in the United States. And that comes from the pharmaceutical industry's own figures. 
   Take a look at the billions and billions of dollars the drug industry spends on promotion and compare that to what they spend on research and development. 
   In fact, if you pick up a weekly magazine, such as Newsweek, you will see the multipage ads for prescription medicine. They are spending billions of dollars on direct-to-consumer advertising. They are going directly to the consumer and saying: We want you to go to your doctor to demand that he or she write a prescription for this medication for you. 
   That just started a few years ago. It is now rampant. Doctors will tell you that patients come to their offices, saying: I read about this medicine in an ad in Newsweek. I want you to prescribe that. That is what is happening. 
   Billions of dollars are spent to try to induce consumers to demand medicine that can only be given to them by a doctor who believes it is necessary. 
   While all of this is going on, the Senator from Vermont offers a piece of legislation that I fully support. If I were writing the legislation offered by the Senator from Vermont, I would prefer that it not leave out the provision that allows personal use importation. I hope at some point we can allow for that. 
   But I just say this. I know that literally $60 or $70 million has been spent by the pharmaceutical industry because it is scared stiff that we are going to pass this legislation. 
   In fact, in the Washington Post the pharmaceutical industry has been running a full-page ad for the last several days. I do not know what a full-page ad costs in the Washington Post, but I know it is not cheap. How many citizens, who support our bill, have the ability to go to the Washington Post and buy a full-page ad? 
   This full-page ad is just totally bogus. It says: One of these pills is a counterfeit. Can you guess which one? Congress is about to permit wholesale importation of drugs from Mexico and Canada. The personal health of American consumers is unquestionably at risk. Counterfeit prescription drugs will inevitably make their way across our borders and into our medicine cabinets. Counterfeit prescription drugs can kill. Counterfeit prescription drugs have killed. 
   This is from the pharmaceutical industry, which wants to scare people into believing the legislation that we are now debating is somehow bad for our country's consumers. That is totally bogus. We are proposing an amendment that assures the safety of the drug supply but finally assures the American consumer that they can access drugs that are priced reasonably. 
   If someone in another country is paying half the price or a third or a tenth of the price being charged the American consumer for the same drug that is produced in a manufacturing plant approved by the FDA, why can't the American consumer have access to those drugs in a global economy? 
   The answer is: They ought to be able to do it.

   Mr. DORGAN. Yes. The sponsor is Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. The drug industry obviously wants to keep things as they are. 
   Let me just make one additional point. It is not my intention to have the American people go to another country for their prescription drugs. It is my intention to force the pharmaceutical industry to reprice their drugs here in the United States. If our pharmacists and our drug wholesalers are able to access the same drugs at a much lesser price in Canada or England or elsewhere, and bring them back and sell them at a savings to our consumers, it will force the industry to reprice their drugs in this country. 
   That is my goal. It is not my goal to put people in minivans and send them outside this country to access prescription drugs. I want pressures brought through the global economy to equalize prescription drug prices in this country vis-a-vis what they are being sold at in other countries. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there is nothing worse than losing an argument you are not having. We had four or five opponents talk about this legislation, and they were making arguments about a bill that doesn't exist. So they win. What is the argument? Listen carefully and you will hear the scare tactics, suggesting that somehow in an old garage with a dirt floor on a dusty street somewhere in Haiti, someone is going to produce a counterfeit drug and ship it to the U.S. We should not do that, they say. Well, I agree. But that has nothing to do with this legislation. They are winning an argument we are not having. 
   This legislation establishes very strict controls and pertains only to prescription drugs that are produced in manufacturing plants approved by the FDA, with strict FDA oversight and proof of FDA approval on all imported medicines. Only licensed pharmacists and wholesalers can import the medicine for resale, and there is lab testing to screen out counterfeits. That is what this is about. Risk? This isn't about risk. 
   One of our colleagues said what we need is more insurance coverage for prescription drugs. Well, I agree that we need to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare to help our senior citizens pay for their medications. 
   But we also need lower prices for prescription drugs. There is a famous football coach who is on television just about every night in an advertisement for a drug called Zocor. He is one of America's better professional football coaches and, I gather, a wonderful man. He says that Zocor reduces his cholesterol. I am sure it does; it is a wonderful drug. Zocor is advertised widely on television. If you buy it in the United States it is $3.82 per tablet. If you buy it in Canada--the same pill by the same company--it is $1.82 per tablet. 
   I ask anybody who spoke today in opposition to this amendment, how does one justify that? Do you support it? Do you think it is right? Do you want to tell the American consumer we have a global economy for everyone except for them? The compounds and chemicals used in this pill can be accessed globally by the companies that produce it, and that is fine. But the global economy isn't for you, American consumers. The drug companies can price their products any way they want here in the United States, and the American consumer has no business accessing them at a lower price anywhere outside the United States. 
   I ask all those who oppose this, do you support this pricing strategy--$1.82 for the person in Winnipeg, Canada, and $3.82 for the U.S. consumer? 
   The Senator from Vermont offers a very simple piece of legislation. The amendment allows for the importation only of products approved for sale in the United States by the FDA and manufactured in FDA-approved plants. 
   At a hearing before the HELP committee earlier this year, Dr. Christopher Rhodes, a professor of applied pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Rhode Island, who has 30 years of experience on the development and evaluation of drug products, said this:  
   It is my considered professional opinion that the process of using re-imported prescription drugs in the United States need not place the American public at any increased risk of ineffective or dangerous products.  
   I understand what is at work here. The pharmaceutical industry wants to protect what they have. They have a pretty good deal. They can price their products at whatever price they want. But this is about fair prices for American consumers. I heard a colleague say: If we don't price products like this in the U.S., there won't be research and development for new drugs. 
   Oh, really? Every European country receives lower prices for the same drugs. Yet a larger percentage of research and development on prescription drugs takes place in Europe than in the 
   United States. Explain that. 
   This is a good piece of legislation. I hope my colleagues will see it for what it is. It doesn't pose any risk. It says to the American consumers that they have rights as well.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, while some Members of the Senate are conversing about the schedule, I want to take a moment and comment today on a couple of items that have appeared in today's newspapers related to a very important matter that we will be addressing soon. The first item appeared in the Wall Street Journal:  
   ``Drug benefit costs for large employers are expected to jump 22.5 percent for employees and 23.4 percent for retirees over the next year,'' according to a survey of 61 companies.  
   Drug costs are expected to jump 22.5 percent in a single year for employees and employers. 
   The second item is a full-page ad that appeared in the Washington Post today. This ad is sponsored by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. It says:  
   One of these pills is a counterfeit. Can you guess which one?  
   And then it says:  
   Congress is about to permit the wholesale importation of drugs from Mexico and Canada. The personal health of American consumers is unquestionably at risk. Counterfeit prescription drugs will inevitably make their way across our borders and into our medicine cabinets. Counterfeit prescription drugs can kill. Counterfeit drugs have killed.  
   This is from the big pharmaceutical manufacturers. What they are alleging is that it would be unsafe to allow those in this country who want to go to Canada to access a supply of prescription drugs from a drugstore in Winnipeg that was originally made in the United States, in a plant inspected by  the Food and Drug Administration, and then put in a bottle and sent to a pharmacy in Canada. 
   It would not be unsafe. It would be cheaper, but not unsafe. Here is the issue. This is a global economy, we are told, and the pharmaceutical industry certainly benefits from that global economy. They buy their chemicals all around the world to get the best prices, and they should. They use these chemicals to produce wonderful, life-saving medicines. Then they ship that medicine all around the world. They ship it to Pembina, ND, and to Emerson, Manitoba in Canada. Those two communities are about 5 miles apart. For the same medicine, produced in the same manufacturing plant by the same company, in the same dosage strength, put in the same bottle, the manufacturers will charge the U.S. consumer triple, double, or quadruple the price charged the Canadian consumer. 
   The question is this: Why should an American citizen have to go to Canada to buy a drug that was produced in the United States in order to find that they will save 50 to 70 percent on the price of that same drug? The answer is that they should not have to go to Canada to do that. There ought to be fairer pricing of prescription drugs in this country. 
   There is a little sweetheart law on the books in this country that needs to be amended. This law says that the only entity that can re-import prescription drugs into the United States is its manufacturer. So when a pharmaceutical manufacturer makes a drug in the United States and ships it to Canada for sale at a fraction of the price--and that is because Canada won't allow them to sell it at the price at which they sell it in the United States--they are able to say to pharmacists and drug wholesalers in the United States that they can't go to Canada and buy it and bring it back and pass the savings along to their customers. Even though it is 
   the same drug, made in a plant in the United States, and the plant is approved by the FDA, they can't bring it back from Canada. Why? Because a law in this country prevents that. Talk about a sweetheart deal. 
   Some of us want to amend that law. Some Republicans and Democrats have come together on legislation to allow pharmacists and drug wholesalers to import FDA-approved medicines. So in response, the pharmaceutical industry spent a fortune putting full-page ads in newspapers today, saying this is about ``counterfeit medicine'' that will kill people. What a sack of lies. There is no counterfeit medicine problem here. We are talking about the importation of prescription drugs in this country only in instances where the chain of custody has been assured and guaranteed. 
   This is the most profitable industry in the world, and I understand that it wants to protect its profits. I think the drug companies do a lot of wonderful things. But I don't think it is wonderful when they tell senior citizens in this country--all citizens, for that matter, but especially senior citizens--we have a life-saving drug, but you will pay double the price of what we charge anywhere else in the world. That is not fair. But it happens all the time. 
   What we ought to do is decide that if this is a global economy, it is a global economy for senior citizens and for pharmacists, as long as we assure the chain of custody and resolve the issue of safety. 
   A pharmacist in Grand Forks, ND, cannot go to Winnipeg, Canada, to buy the same pill, in the same bottle, made in the same manufacturing plant, and bring it back and pass the savings along to senior citizens. Senior citizens are 12 percent of our population, yet they use one-third of all the prescription drugs in this country. They have reached their retirement years, the years in which their incomes are limited, and they discover that they must pay the highest prices for prescription drugs of any group of consumers in the world. That is not fair. 
   Miracle drugs only perform miracles if you can afford to take them. Life-saving drugs only save lives if you can afford to access those drugs. I have had hearings all across this country, and I have heard identical testimony in every State. Senior citizens tell me: When I go to the grocery store, I must first go to the pharmacy at the back of the store to buy my prescription drugs because only then will I know how much money I have left to pay for food. Only then will I know how much money I have left with which to eat. 
   That is happening all across this country. The folks in the pharmaceutical industry want to continue to charge U.S. consumers double, triple, or quadruple the prices they impose upon citizens of other countries. That is not fair. We ought to change it. 
   In the appropriations bill when it was considered by the House, the House enacted two amendments to essentially prevent the FDA from enforcing the current law. 
   In the Senate, there will be an amendment offered by one of my Republican colleagues, myself, and others. The Senate amendment would also allow pharmacists and drug wholesalers to import prescription drugs that were produced in the United States, in plants that are approved by the FDA, but it includes provisions to ensure this is done in a safe manner. We hope enough Members of the Senate will agree so that we will be able to get this done in the coming days. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the bill to authorize the Williston Water Transmission Line. Williston is a small town of 13,000 located in the Northwest corner of North Dakota about twenty miles East of the Montana state line. Williston is located along the Missouri River not far from where the Fort Union Trading Post existed from 1828-1867. Today the fur trading post is a tourist attraction, and agriculture and oil productions are the main industries in the Williston area. 
   Mr. President, prior to construction of the existing Williston Water Treatment Plant, Williston obtained water to meet its municipal needs from the Missouri River. With the construction of the Garrison Dam and the creation of Lake Sakakawea in 1954, Williston is in the delta area of Lake Sakakawea and had to relocate its water intake and water treatment plant approximately five miles upstream to its present location. The Corps and Williston funded the construction of a large diameter transmission line to convey the entire water supply from the water treatment plant to the city of Williston. 
   All of the water treated by the water treatment plant must flow through this single existing transmission line to reach Williston. In the 1970's and early 80's, siltation covered the existing intake valves for the city's water supply, requiring the construction of two new intake valves. The lake is currently silting twice as fast as the original Corps estimate. Mr. President, in the spring of 1998, a leak in the transmission line caused by the saturated soil forced the city to forgo any supply of water for five and a half days. The lack of accessibility, unstable soil conditions and high ground water along the route make the line's reliability a significant concern. Williston must now construct a new water transmission line on higher ground. 
   This bill will authorize the construction of a new water transmission line to Williston. Because the old line has been damaged by the construction of the Garrison Dam, this authorization is appropriate and essential. Mr. President, I would like to commend the residents of Williston who have worked so hard for so long to resolve this problem. They have been tireless in their efforts to fix this problem--a problem caused by the Federal government. 
   Mr. President, I join with Senator CONRAD and look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure the citizens of Williston have a reliable water transmission line.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I, too, would like to join my distinguished colleague from West Virginia in addressing the Clean Coal Technology program. I would also like to commend the Chairman of the Interior Subcommittee, Senator GORTON, and of course the Ranking Member, Senator BYRD for their work relating to the Clean Coal Technology Demonstration program. 
   Mr. President, I share the optimism of the leaders of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee with respects to the innovations that could be made with further clean coal technology projects. I specifically want to draw attention to one area in which I think that there is great potential--lignite energy development. In my state of North Dakota, the lignite industry provides a low-cost, reliable energy source for more than 2 million people in the upper Midwest. This industry 
   directly employs 3,000 people in North Dakota and has great potential to increase the efficiency of coal-fired power plants while reducing the emissions with the application of new coal technologies. 
   Mr. President, because of the importance of lignite coal, I would urge the Department of Energy to specifically explore the development of low-rank coals, coals containing high-sodium, and mine-mouth applications and concepts in any new round of Clean Coal Technology projects. I also believe, and I would hope the Department would agree, too, that preference should be given to those states that have lignite research and development programs requiring public and private collaboration. This kind of work should be aspects of the study that the Committee report requires of the Department.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, when I entered the Chamber a few moments ago, one of our colleagues was speaking, and he, as I best understood it, came out in favor of love, in favor of marriage, and in opposition to taxing death. And I thought to myself, that is an interesting bit of debate. 
   But one has to look at the public policies being espoused by those who are describing those positions to understand exactly how much they favor love and marriage and exactly how much they want to do with respect to our public laws and our Tax Code dealing with the taxing of death. 
   So I thought maybe I could just, for a couple minutes, comment on that. And then I want to talk about the various tax penalties and about an amendment that I am going to offer today. 
   In the Wall Street Journal of today, there is an op-ed piece written by Mr. George Soros, one of the more noted American financiers. He is chairman of the Soros Fund Management. I have no idea what Mr. Soros is worth, but suffice it to say that Mr. Soros is one of the more successful American entrepreneurs and financial gurus. He has made a substantial amount of money, and has been known as a very successful businessman. Here is what he writes in the Wall Street Journal of today. Mr. George Soros writes:  
   Supporters of repealing the estate tax say the legislation would save family farms and businesses and lift a terrible and unfair burden. I happen to be fortunate enough to be eligible for the tax benefits of this legislation, and so I wish I could convince myself to believe the proponents' rhetoric. Unfortunately, it just isn't so. The truth is that repealing the estate tax would give a huge tax windfall to the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. It would provide an average tax cut of  more than $7 million to taxpayers who inherit estates worth more than $10 million.  
   His last paragraph, in an op-ed piece I would commend to those who might want to get the Wall Street Journal today:  
   So I say to the Republican leaders of Congress, thanks for thinking of me--but no thanks. Please keep the estate tax in place, and use the proceeds where it will really count: to better the lives not of people who have already realized the American dream but of people still seeking to achieve it.  
   That is from George Soros. 
   As you know, there was not a disagreement about whether to repeal the estate tax in a way that would protect the passage of family farms and small businesses from parents to children. There was no debate about that. 
   We proposed a piece of legislation that would have provided up to $8 million of value in a family farm or a small business--neither of which, incidentally, would be very small if they reached that $8 million mark--but they could be passed without one penny of estate tax from parents to children. 
   We proposed repealing the estate tax on the transfer of almost all small businesses and family farms in this country. That is what we proposed. The other side said: No, that is not enough. What we want you to do is repeal the estate tax for the largest estates in America, those worth hundreds of millions of dollars, those worth billions of dollars. 
   They said: No, we want to provide the 400 wealthiest families in America, according to Forbes magazine, up to $250 billion in tax cuts, by removing the estate tax on the wealthiest estates in America. 
   Now comes one of America's preeminent financiers, who has made a fair amount of that money, saying: Thanks, but no thanks. That would not be a fair way to do it. 
   I think it is important, not only as we talk about the repeal of the estate tax, which we just had a significant debate on, and now talking about the marriage tax penalty and trying to provide some relief there, to talk about who is going to benefit from these proposals. Who will benefit? 
   Repealing the estate tax on the largest estates in this country--a country in which our economy has done so well and so many Americans have done so well; a country in which one-half of the world's billionaires live--repealing the estate tax burden on the largest estates worth hundreds of millions and billions of dollars, is obviously a tax break for the very wealthiest Americans. 
   Instead of using the money for that kind of tax relief, what about some tax relief for the people who go to work every day and pay a payroll tax on minimum income? What about the folks who could use a middle-income tax cut by perhaps having a tax credit for the tuition they are paying to send their kids to college? Or perhaps what about using that money to reduce the Federal debt? 
   What about using that money to put a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program? 
   There are a whole series of alternatives one might consider in evaluating how we might want to use this money. I come down in favor of using some of it to reduce the Federal debt. What greater gift to America's children than to reduce our Federal debt during good times. If, during tough times, we run up the Federal debt because we must, then during good times let's pay down the Federal debt. That should be a priority use of funds that are available. 
   We had a debate this week about the estate tax. The majority party said: We demand that the estate tax be repealed in its entirety. 
   We said: No, what we think we should do is repeal the estate tax for a modest amount of income, accumulation of income over the lifetime of a family, and we proposed up to $4 million. That is more than modest and more than most families will ever see. We proposed an $8 million exemption for the passage of a small business and a family farm. 
   The majority party said: That is not enough. We insist on more relief. We insist on relief for the biggest estates in America. 
   That is where we disagreed. That is why at the end of this we have a bill that passed the Senate that will certainly be vetoed by the President, and the veto will certainly be sustained by the Senate. 
   Now the question is the marriage tax penalty. There is no disagreement in this Chamber about the marriage tax penalty. We should eliminate it. Let me give an example of what is done with the marriage tax penalty. This is very simple, but it illustrates the problem. 
   A husband and wife making $35,000 each have a combined income of $70,000. In the present circumstance, if they filed as single taxpayers and they were unmarried, they would pay about $8,407 combined in income taxes. But because they are married and file a joint return, they pay $9,532. Therefore, because they are married, these two individuals pay about $1,125 more in taxes. That is called the marriage penalty. We should eliminate that, of course. Let's do that. 
   The majority party has offered a piece of legislation that in this circumstance would give $443 worth of relief. The couple had a $1,125 penalty, and they only give $443 in relief. We have offered a proposal that says let's eliminate the marriage tax penalty simply, effectively, and completely. 
   How would we do that? We would say to these people: File your income return as you choose, as married filing jointly or as individuals. You choose. You can file separately or jointly. 
   It will eliminate all of the marriage tax penalty. That is what we propose. 
   If I might use one additional chart that shows the difference, we allow all married couples to file separately or jointly. They make the decision. They can make the decision that would abolish any marriage tax penalty that exists in their circumstance. That is not true of the plan offered by the majority. If we eliminate all marriage penalty taxes for taxpayers earning $100,000 or less, if we reduce all penalties from $100,000 to $150,000; why don't we do it all the way up to people who are making $10 million or $20 million? 
   The reason is this distribution chart. As is the case with the estate tax repeal and now with the marriage tax penalty, most of the benefit of this proposal will go to a very small percent of the taxpayers. Nearly 80 percent of the benefit of the majority party's proposal to reduce the marriage tax penalty will accrue to the top 20 percent of taxpayers, and the bottom 80 percent of the taxpayers will get less than one-fourth of the benefit. That is the problem, once again. 
   I think there is substantial agreement in this Chamber about goals. If our goal is to eliminate the estate tax for the passage of small businesses and family farms, let's do that. We can do that together. We have proposed that. Join us. Don't continue to insist that we eliminate the estates tax for the largest estates in the country. There is a better use for those revenues. 
   If the proposition is, let's eliminate the marriage tax penalty, we say fine. Join us. Do it the simple way. Allow people to file either as individuals, separately, or as married couples filing jointly. Their choice. That will eliminate all of the marriage tax penalty. 
   The majority plan only eliminates about three categories of marriage tax penalty when, in fact, there are more than 60. We say, on these issues, while we philosophically agree on part of them, let's join together and do this. 
   Of course, what we have discovered is there are some who would much prefer to have a political issue than to have legislation passed. The result is, they want to send it to the White House and have the President veto it. 
   We could have had at the end of this week a very substantial exemption of the estate tax so that almost no small business or family farm would ever have been ensnared in the web of the estate tax. Why aren't we doing that? Because the majority party insisted on passing a complete repeal of the estate tax which was going to cost a substantial amount of money in a manner that would give the largest estates the biggest tax benefit. That is not fair and not the right thing to do. 
   I hope as we finish this reconciliation bill and move to other appropriations bills and also deal now in July, and especially September and October, with a range of these issues, that we find a way to pass legislation that represents the best of what both political parties have to offer. Instead of getting the best of both, we often get the worst of each because there is so much energy fighting each other's proposals that we  forget that there is philosophical agreement. 
   Yes, there is a marriage tax penalty. Yes, we ought to take action to remove it and eliminate it. There is no reason at all that we couldn't do it together. There is more common interest here than most people think. I hope in the coming weeks we can find ways that we can bridge the gap across the political aisle in the Senate and send the President some good legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will explain what this amendment is. 
   If on the floor of the Senate we are discussing a reconciliation bill that carries reductions in taxation, especially, in this circumstance, the elimination of the marriage tax penalty, I want to have considered several other pieces of tax law that I think are long overdue for consideration. This particular amendment combines four ideas. 
   One, we have a current problem with virtually all farmers in this country who are receiving income from their conservation reserve program acres. The Internal Revenue Service has now decided that income is from self-employment and therefore subject to self-employment tax. That is one of the goofiest interpretations of tax law I have ever heard, but nonetheless that is the IRS's position. They have the opportunity to make it stick unless we tell them that is not what we intended; that is not the way the law ought to be read. That is not the way Congress intended it, so we will legislate to tell the IRS how they ought to view this issue. 
   It is clear that the conservation reserve program, for which the Federal Government gives payments to farmers for the retirement of certain acreage into conservation, is not self-employment income and therefore subject to self-employment taxes. Yet that is exactly the way the IRS has ruled. All farmers across this country are going to get caught in this web. We must fix it. That is one provision. 
   The second is a provision that applies to expensing opportunities for small business. Under current law, small businesses can generally expense or immediately deduct up to $20,000 of the cost of equipment and other items. This maximum amount will increase to $25,000 over the next several years. I propose that we allow, under those expensing provisions, opportunities for small businesses to fix up their storefronts on Main Streets. Many of our small towns desperately need reinvestment in the storefronts on Main Street. They are 50, 60, 70 years old. Yet when they do that these days, small businesses find they must depreciate the costs of those investments over 39 years for tax purposes. They ought to be able to expense that under the expensing provisions. My proposal would allow that to happen. 
   The third proposal in this amendment fixes a problem with the issue of capital gains exclusions. If you are in a town someplace and you sell a home, you know there is an exclusion of up to $500,000 on all capital gains on the sale of that home. If you go out of town 15 miles and run a family farm someplace, your house has zero value except that value to which it inures to the farm you are farming. So if you sell that house, you sell it for almost nothing. The only value that home has is the ability for somebody to live in that home and operate farm equipment around that farmstead. 
   The fact is, when farmers sell their home and their home quarter, they are not able to take advantage of the capital gains exclusion that the folks in town are taking advantage of when they sell their home. 
   I would fix that in this legislation, as well, to give farmers that opportunity. 
   Fourth, my amendment provides for the full deductibility immediately of  health insurance costs for the self-employed. There is no excuse in this country to have a business on one side of Main Street be able to deduct only a fraction of their health insurance costs as a business expense and a corporation across the street that can deduct 100 percent of that as a business expense. That is not fair. Both parties have been working to try to bridge that gap. All of us have talked about that--Republicans and Democrats--for some long while. We are making progress in closing the gap. Well, let's not just make progress, let's just close it and say self-employed will be treated exactly the same as large corporations. If you have health insurance costs for your employees in a business, it is a business expense and it ought to be fully deductible, and it ought to be fully deductible right now. 
   Those are the four provisions I have offered to this reconciliation bill, and I hope for its consideration next week. 
   As I conclude, we are not talking about tax issues. We have, according to economists, some good years ahead of us. The best economists in this country can't see beyond a few months. God bless them, and I don't mean to speak ill of them when I talk about economists this way. As I have said, I actually taught economics for a couple of years in college, but I was able to overcome that experience and go on to other things. 
   Economists can't see very far into the future. They just can't. Adam Smith, one of the great economists, of course, in modern history, they say, used to get lost walking home; he could not find his home. God bless his memory as well. We are told now by economists today--the best in the country--that the next 10 years is likely to bring unprecedented economic growth, with 10 years of surpluses. I don't have any idea whether that will be the case. I hope it is. It would be terrific. But I don't know, nor do economists. 
   The year before the last recession in this country, 35 of the 40 leading economists predicted the next year would be a year of continued economic growth. So 35 of the 40 leading economists had no idea what would happen in the next year. The same is true with respect to the future that we now discuss. We don't know what is going to happen. If we are fortunate enough to have continued, recurring budget surpluses, then we ought to begin this discussion about tax reductions. Yes, I think there is room for some tax cuts, but the question is, What kind and who benefits from them? 
   We ought to begin the discussion about tax cuts relative to other issues: Reducing the Federal debt, providing a prescription drug program under Medicare, and a range of other needs in this country, including our investment in education, which represents our real future. We can do all of these things this month and in September and in the first half of October, before this Congress finishes its work. 
   I think, in many ways, there are more common interests among Members of the Senate than most people realize. We can accomplish a lot of things together, and we ought to do more of that in the coming months. I hope to work on this range of issues. We are talking about the estate tax and the marriage tax penalty which, combined in the second 10 years, cost about $1 trillion in lost revenue. We have to evaluate this relative to other needs and interests--the needs, especially, of working families. It is true that we have had a wonderful economy and a robust bit of economic growth. But it is also true that some people have not benefited so much in this economy. We need to worry about them as well. 
   Having said all of that, I look forward to the coming several months. I know this is an election year, a political year. But this country has much to be thankful for, and there is much to be 
   gained by having an aggressive, robust debate about the future, the projected surplus, about our tax system, the needs in the Medicare program, prescription drug prices, and a whole range of issues that are important to most families. 
   When they sit around their supper tables in this country, families are asking these basic questions: What kind of a job do I have? What kind of income do I get paid? Do I have security in my job? What kind of health care do I have for my kids? Do my parents get adequate health care? Do we live in a safe neighborhood? What about the issue of crime? All of those issues are important. Do we send our kids to a good school? When our kids walk through the door of the school, are we proud of the classroom and the teachers? Are we committing enough resources to make sure the kids are getting the best education they can get? 
   Those are the issues that people are concerned about and that ought to be the center of our discussion in the coming 3 and a half or 4 months, before America makes political choices once again in this election. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I sat here in wonder at the description just offered by a couple of Senators about this proposal to repeal the estate tax. It is a proposal that is dressed with language saying that this is to help family farmers and small businesses. Yet when you remove the disguise, what you have are people pulling uphill a bag of goodies for the largest estates and the wealthiest people in this country. Clarence Darrow, at the end of his life and long career in law, once said, ``I have long suffered from being misunderstood.'' Then he said, ``I may have suffered more had I been understood.'' This proposal by the Republicans is going to suffer by being understood in this debate and by the American people. Let's understand what it is. First of all, we all agree that we ought to essentially repeal the estate tax for small businesses and family farms. We all agree on that. In fact, as the Senator from New York said, the New York Times article today says:  
   Two prominent experts in estate taxes said yesterday that the Democrats were offering a much better deal to small business owners and farmers, because the relief under their bill would be immediate and the estate tax would be eliminated for nearly all of them. 
   ``The fact is that the Democrats are making the better offer''--and I am a Republican saying that--``said Sanford Schlesinger of the law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays, and Handler of New York.''  
   What the Democrats offer is a much better deal. It repeals the estate tax for all family farms and small businesses. Put that offer on the table. We repeal it more quickly. What is left is that the Republicans have decided they insist on repealing the estate tax for the wealthiest families in this country--$300 billion to $400 billion for additional tax relief for the wealthiest estates here in America. That is what they insist upon. 
   What else could we do with this? They insist that money be used to give tax relief to the wealthiest in this country. Well, we could probably reduce the Federal debt. Would that be better than giving tax relief to somebody who dies and leaves a $1 billion estate? The heirs will only get $700 million or $800 million, and there will be money paid on an estate tax on the estate. Perhaps that money could be used to reduce the Federal debt. Would that be a gift to America's children? I think so. 
   Perhaps it can go to the prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program. How about using the money for that? Would that be more important than easing the tax burdens on the largest estates in the country? I believe so. 
   A series of things that would be a better use of those funds ought to be debated today. A USA Today editorial says:  
   But behind the caterwauling about the death tax, the truth is quite different. Most people will never be affected by inheritance taxes: 98 percent of all estates aren't big enough to be liable. Even among the elite 2 percent, very few are farmers and small business folks. But there are better ways to spend $50 million a year than handing it to the heirs of the wealthiest people in the country. Take your pick: Middle class tax cut, improved health benefits for seniors, or paying down the national debt, for starters.  
   Those are the choices. The Republican side of the aisle says, no, let's not just repeal the estate tax on small business and family farms, let's repeal it on the wealthiest estates in America and claim that what we are trying to do is protect farmers and small business people. 
   Well, I don't think they appreciate being used that way. Farmers and small business people don't appreciate being used by 
   someone who wants to take the $300 billion or $400 billion in tax relief that will accrue to the wealthiest American families and be  told that somehow this is really for farmers and small businesses. 
   The New York Times article today says something else:  
   There is one reason that the American Farm Bureau Federation and the NFIB, National Federation of Independent Business, are not supporting the Democratic plan. Despite the fact that it is better for family farmers and small business, one reason may be that leading the call for the repeal of the tax, the two organizations representing merchants and farmers have done little to tell their members about the Democratic plan. Interviews this week with a half dozen people whom the two organizations offered as spokespeople on the estate tax showed that only one of them had any awareness or understanding of the Democratic plan.  
   Here you have two organizations--the American Farm Bureau Federation and the NFIB--running around Washington saying they represent farmers and family businesses, and they are supporting the wrong program. They are supporting a repeal proposal that is less advantageous for family farmers and small businesses. And they tell their folks back home that they are doing their business. Nonsense. You have two competing plans. Both of them would repeal the estate tax for family farms and small businesses. But the Republican plan says we must go further and we must give $300 billion to $400 billion in additional tax cuts in the next 10 years and make sure those tax cuts go to the wealthiest estates in America. 
   We say that is not the right set of priorities for this country. I have heard this out-of-breath discussion. The folks who talk about disguising public policy and debate around here are absolutely correct. You can't disguise what you are doing here in terms of a large tax cut for the wealthiest American estates by saying this goes to family farmers and small business. It doesn't. 
   The proposal we offer is the one that will exempt family farms and small business. 
   The proposal they offer is the one that will give hundreds of billions of dollars to the largest estates in America--$250 billion in tax benefits to the 400 wealthiest families in America. 
   Is that the priority? It is for them. It is not for us. 
   There are other needs and interests: prescription drugs for Medicare; as I have mentioned, paying down the Federal debt; tax relief for middle-income families. There are so many things that are so important that we could do in public policy here today. Instead, we are debating a plan that says, let us at this time and in this place provide the largest tax cut in history to the wealthiest estates in America. 
   That doesn't make sense, no matter how you debate it.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I begin by complimenting Senator SLADE GORTON and Senator ROBERT BYRD, the chairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee that brings this legislation to the floor. The Interior appropriations bill is a very important piece of legislation, but it faces the classic problem of trying to meet unlimited needs with limited resources. Senator GORTON and Senator BYRD had a very difficult task, but they have done quite a remarkable job and have certainly earned my compliments and I hope the compliments of my colleagues for the job they have done. 
   I wish to speak for a few moments, however, about a very difficult problem that is encountered by a group of Americans who suffer some of the highest unemployment rates, some of the most difficult health problems, and the most difficult challenges of any Americans. I'm speaking of Native Americans. 
   We have in North Dakota four Indian reservations. I frequently visit these reservations and meet with the tribal chairs, men, women, and children who live there. The conditions in some cases on these reservations are very much like those of a Third World country. The unmet health care needs are devastating. 
   The unemployment rates in some cases are as high as 50, 60, and 70 percent because these areas are so remote and there are simply no jobs. And the quality of education regrettably is not up to the standards it should be. 
   As I talk about these problems today, I want to point out that this bill, for the first time, makes some significant steps in the right direction. This is an important moment. This appropriations bill does make some important progress in dealing with the issues of Indian health care and Indian education. 
   Yet there is so much left to do. The people in America who live in Indian country have the highest rates of poverty in our country. Over 30 percent of Native Americans live in poverty. The unemployment rate on Indian reservations in North Dakota averages 55 percent. Compare that to the unemployment rate of around 4 percent in the United States as a whole. 
   To help address the problems that Native Americans face, President Clinton recommended a $1.2 billion increase, government-wide, for priority health care, education, economic development, and other infrastructure needs in Indian country. I am particularly pleased about the President's recommendations in some key areas, including the $300 million he proposed for BIA school replacement and repair. This is $167 million more than the current level, the largest ever single year investment in BIA school infrastructure. The President's budget also proposes a $200 million, or 10-percent, increase in the Indian health services budget. 
   The increased funding levels in the Senate bill, even though they represent significant progress under difficult circumstances, still fall significantly short of both the President's budget request and what we need to do. Unfortunately, the House-passed Interior bill is far, far worse. We are going to fall short once again of meeting the actual needs of Native Americans. 
   Let me talk for a moment about the health care needs in Indian country. A Native American living on the reservation is 12 times more likely to have diabetes than the average American--not double or triple or quadruple but 12 times more likely to have diabetes--and 3 times more likely to die from diabetes. An American Indian is five times more likely to die from tuberculosis, four times more likely to die from chronic liver disease, 3 times more likely to die in an accident, especially an automobile accident, and nearly twice as likely to commit suicide. 
   I recently visited the Indian Health Service hospital in Fort Yates, ND. I have here a picture of that hospital. It has been around for a long while. It doesn't have an emergency room. The folks who use that hospital don't have access to an operating room, and they therefore can't deliver babies because they don't have an operating room. The emergency room is in the midst of the waiting rooms, so when an emergency occurs, everyone in the waiting room has to clear out. It is not visible in this picture, but there is a little old trailer house where the dentist practices. The 1 dentist practicing in that trailer serves 5,000 people. 
   Now this dentist is no doubt providing the best service that he can given the circumstances he has to work in, but just imagine the kind of dental care that is provided by 1 dentist for 5,000 people. Do you think that dentist is constructing difficult bridges or other complicated treatments for teeth that are in trouble, or is he more likely pulling teeth? This is at Fort Yates, ND, on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. 
   The current funding for the Indian Health Service is about 43 percent less per capita than health care spending for the U.S. population generally. The Indian Health Service spends about $1,400 per patient, compared to the national per capita amount per patient of $3,200. 
   Let me also talk for a moment about education on the reservations. Again, I appreciate the leadership of Senator GORTON 
   and Senator BYRD in providing $276 million for BIA school replacement and repair in this coming fiscal year. 
   The Federal government has a trust responsibility to provide an education  to Indian children. This is not a luxury or some discretionary choice. We have a trust responsibility to Indian children, just as we have a responsibility to provide for an education for the children of our military personnel residing on or near military bases. The Federal government runs the Department of Defense school system. We also have a trust responsibility to run the school system through the BIA. We have not done that very well. We are woefully short of the funds that are needed to keep these schools up to standard. Even with the funding increases in the Senate bill, there will continue to be a nearly $700 million backlog in repair and replacement of BIA schools. 
   The GAO says the schools that are serving these Indian children are among the poorest schools in the Nation. Yes, that is among all schools, even those in the inner-cities, where they also have a lot of problems. But the worst school facilities in the Nation are those on the Indian reservations. 
   This is a picture of a school on the Turtle Mountain Reservation. This happens to be the Ojibwa Indian School. This is a fundamentally unsafe school, as many health and safety investigations have found. One day, my fear is that something awful will happen at that school and people will say, How did that happen? It will happen because nobody paid attention to the warnings. 
   This is a picture of the fire escape. Notice, it is a wooden fire escape, which is rather unusual--a fire escape made of wood. This is clearly a fire code violation. 
   The children of the Ojibwa school are attending classes in trailers that have been constructed because the main school building is over 100 years old and has been condemned. So the kids are now put in the mobile units and are required to scurry back and forth, up and down these stairs, in the dead of winter in North Dakota, with temperatures at 30 below zero and with the wind blowing. The people who have inspected these facilities from time to time have found all kinds of problems with them. This wooden fire escape is simply one of many. 
   This is a picture of the plumbing at the school in Marty, SD, the Marty Indian School. Take a look at that plumbing. See if you want to take a drink of the water from those pipes. Or take a look at this rusted radiator. Not exactly the modern radiator needed to keep the students warm in the dead of a South Dakota winter. 
   Or, to return to another picture of the Ojibwa school, where the ground beneath the gymnasium is giving way. For safety purposes they have put up plywood, and that plywood is all that separates children from danger as the ground gives way under the corner of the gymnasium. 
   We have to do much better than this. We can and should do better than this. We have a responsibility to these kids. I have come to the floor many times and talked about these needs. I know I am repetitive, and I know people say that they have heard it all before. But frankly, a lot of these people don't have much of a voice in this appropriations process. 
   A little third grader, Rosie Two Bears, once asked me: Mr. Senator, are you going to build me a new school? I realize I can't build Rosie a new school even though she desperately needs one. She goes to a school that is terribly inadequate. Rosie goes to a school with sewer gas coming up through the floors of one classroom, which they had to evacuate once or twice a week. She goes to a school in which there are 150 students with 1 water fountain and 2 toilets, a school with no playground. 
   The fact is, we can do better than that. This bill makes some significant improvements in health and education. For that, I commend all the folks involved. On the Appropriations Committee, I tried to make even more improvements, and I'm glad I was able to do that marginally in the area of tribal college funding. However, I come to the floor to say we have to do better. 
   The superintendent of the Wahpeton Indian school, Joyce Burr, told me a while ago about a little girl attending that school. Many of these kids are sent to that school from around the country, and they come from troubled backgrounds, many without much of a family or home to go back to. Joyce told me the little girl came to her near Christmastime, when the school was going to close during the 2 week holiday at Christmas and the children would be sent back to their reservations, to their families. This little girl, a third or fourth grader, went to the superintendent and said: I would like to stay over at the school during the Christmas break. I know the school isn't going to be opened, but I promise if you let me stay here I won't eat very much. 
   She had no place to go, so she was asking if she could stay at the school all alone over the Christmas break, promising, ``If you let me do that I won't eat much.'' We must do much better for these children. 
   On the other end of the education spectrum, with respect to tribal colleges, I want to say we are starting to make some progress there, for which I am very grateful. The tribal colleges represent an extension of educational opportunity and a way out of poverty. I went to a tribal college graduation once and met the oldest graduate in the graduating class. She was 42 or 43 years old, with four children, whose husband had left her. She was cleaning the toilets and the hallways at the tribal college and decided she was going to try and improve her lot in life by attending the college. 
   The day I was there, she graduated. I can hardly describe the smile on her face that day. This woman decided, with grim determination: I am going to graduate from this college. I know I am cleaning the hallways and bathrooms, but I want to do more than that. Through grit and determination, the help of relatives and scholarships, and because the tribal college was right there, guess what--the day I showed up to give the graduation speech, this proud woman graduated from college. Good for her. 
   Or the instance of Loretta. Loretta had dropped out of school. She was an unwed teenaged mother. Now she is a doctor, a Ph.D., a real expert on education who eventually went on to teach at a tribal college for awhile. She did that by herself, but she did it because we put in place a system of tribal colleges that give people like Loretta the opportunity to go to school and get a college education. That is why tribal colleges are so important. Frankly, we contribute only about half as much per student at tribal colleges as we do to other colleges around the rest of the country. We need to do better than that. I am pleased to say this piece of legislation starts down that road. 
   Let me conclude where I began. I am here because I am pleased we are making progress. These are important, critical issues. We cannot ignore the circumstances that exist on Indian reservations. It is easy enough for some people to say that this is the way Indians want to live. That is not the case at all. These are Americans who are beset by poverty, lack of opportunity, lack of jobs, a bad health care system, and a crumbling education system that we must improve. I believe we are taking the first steps in this legislation to do that. For that, I commend my colleagues who brought this bill to the floor --Senator GORTON and Senator BYRD. 
   I say to them, I will be back again next year, as we continue our work in the Appropriations Committee, saying that we have done a lot, we have made some first important steps and thanks for that. But let's continue to try to address these education and health care needs on our reservations for Indian Americans. Let's try to do even more in the coming fiscal year. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will comment briefly on the remarks made by the majority leader a few moments ago on the subject of the estate tax. 
   First of all, the question of repealing the estate tax or changing the estate tax is an important issue, but it is not an issue that is important to the exclusion of all other issues. The majority leader takes the position that the estate tax ought to be repealed completely so those in this country who die and leave $100 million in assets or $500 million in assets or $1 billion in assets, who now pay some estate tax, will be tax free. That is what ``repeal'' means. 
   I happen to believe we ought to change the estate tax to provide a significant exemption so that no small business and no family farm gets caught in the estate tax. I don't want people to try to leave the family farm or the small business to their children, only to discover there will be a crippling estate tax to pay. So I say, let's get rid of that situation. Let's provide an exemption--$8, $10 million--that takes care of the vast majority of cases. 
   But how about those folks who leave half a billion dollars or $1 billion? Do we really want to repeal the estate tax on that kind of estate? There are other and competing needs for the revenue involved. For example, we could pay down the Federal debt; we could provide a larger tax credit for college tuition; we could invest in elementary and secondary education; we could provide tax relief to middle-income families rather than to the wealthiest estates in the country. 
   I happen to believe we should change the estate tax, but I don't believe we ought to repeal the estate tax for the largest estates. 
   The majority leader says the problem is with the Democratic side of the Senate. No, the problem is that yesterday the majority leader came to the floor of the Senate and tried to pass the repeal of the estate tax by unanimous consent. No debate, no discussion, no amendments, $750 billion of tax cuts in the second decade after repeal--$750 billion in tax cuts by unanimous consent, without any debate, and without any amendments. That is what he tried to do yesterday. We objected to that. 
   Yesterday we proposed that he bring up this measure under a regular order. The majority leader objected to that. Democratic leaders proposed that the majority leader bring the bill up and allow 6, 8, or 10 amendments, with time agreements. But the majority leader has objected to that. 
   His position is: I want my way or no way. I want to bring it up and repeal all of the estate tax, which would mean generous tax cuts for the wealthiest estates in this country. If we don't do it his way, we were told, we won't have an opportunity to offer any amendments. That is the majority leader's position. The people elected to the Senate on this side of the aisle will not be able to offer amendments. He says in effect, ``We have an idea, we intend to push that idea, we demand a vote on that idea, and, by the way, you, Senators, don't have any right to offer amendments.'' 
   That is the majority leader's position. That is not a position that is acceptable to me. It is not the way the Senate ought to work. There is something called a regular order.

   Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Illinois is correct.  
   Let me correct something I said a moment ago. The majority leader yesterday tried to bring up H-1B legislation, not the estate tax. I was mistaken about that. I should have known better. I was on the floor at that time, as a matter of fact. 
   But it is true that the majority leader wants to bring up the estate tax and say to half of the Members of the Senate: You don't have a right to offer amendments, and if you don't like it, tough luck. That is what the issue is about. 
   The Senator from Illinois asked the question, Shouldn't this proposed repeal be measured against other priorities, and shouldn't this suggest what is important in the Senate? It sure does. There is not the time or the energy or the inspiration on the part of those who control the agenda in the Senate to have a real debate about protecting people against HMOs, and to try to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. No, there is not time for that. Can we work to put a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program? No, not quite enough time for that either. In fact, the other side understands that is an important issue, so they have cobbled together a goofy proposal that says OK, the senior citizens are having trouble affording prescription drugs, so let's give a subsidy to the insurance companies. Even the insurance companies see through that. They have come to my office--and I assume to the Senator's office--and said: We will not be able to offer a prescription drug plan. We would have to charge $1,200 for a plan that has $1,000 in benefits. 
   The point the Senator from Illinois makes is we have other priorities. Those other priorities somehow don't get to the floor of the Senate because the big priority at the moment is to give an estate tax repeal to the largest estates in the country. 
   As I said, I think we ought to provide a significant exemption so that every family farm and every small business can be transferred to the kids upon the death of the parents, with no estate tax at all--none, zero. However, when a billionaire or someone with $500 million in assets dies and there is an estate, is it not unreasonable to have some transfer here, some estate tax, in order to use those resources for other purposes, such as reducing the Federal debt, providing middle income tax relief--a whole range of urgent needs? Is that not a reasonable thing? That is what we ought to measure this against.

   Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator from Illinois, it is exactly as he states. With the wonderful economy we have had and the surpluses that are expected, there is a certain amount of revenue available. The priority, for the majority side, is to repeal the estate tax, including that top half of the estate tax that applies to the wealthiest estates in the country. If we follow this priority, that will crowd out the ability to do other things. 
   This is a question of making judgments about what is important, what is the priority of this Congress. Should we provide a prescription drug benefit for Medicare? Should this Congress make the investments in education that we should make? Should this Congress decide we should pay down the Federal debt? Should this Congress decide college tuition should trigger an increased tax credit that helps kids go to college? These are all priorities, and there are more of them that we ought to measure against this proposal to repeal the estate tax for the largest estates in the country. 
   As I said, it is a matter of priorities, and it is also a matter of will. What do we have time to do in the Senate? We are told by the majority leader that we do not have enough time to deal with Patients' Bill of Rights, prescription drugs for Medicare, the minimum wage, closing the gun show loophole. We do not have time for those things, we are told, but we have plenty of time for the things the majority wants to do. We have plenty of time to decide to repeal the estate tax completely, including repeal for the largest estates in the country. Do my colleagues know what that will do on average to an estate above $20 million? It will provide about a $12 million tax cut for the estate.

   Mr. DORGAN. I respectfully say that the Senator from Oklahoma is not accurate when he says that his side is willing to entertain amendments; I do not see a problem here; let's bring it on and have amendments and a discussion. That is exactly what the majority leader has denied. That is exactly what the majority leader said he will not allow to happen on the floor of the Senate. 
   If the Senator from Oklahoma is speaking for the majority leader on this issue, I say get the Democratic leader on the line, make an agreement, and let's have this issue on the floor where some amendments can be offered and votes taken, and we will see how people feel about the estate tax. 
   The Senator from Oklahoma is not accurate in leaving the impression that this has been a reasonable circumstance here and they are willing to entertain all kinds of amendments. That is not the case at all. In fact, our side has offered a reasonable number of amendments with time agreements, and the majority leader has said no, and that is the fact.

   Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, there is nothing partisan in my intent to correct the impression left by the Senator from Oklahoma. I was simply saying that proposals have been made on the specific number of amendments and time agreements by our side and the majority leader has rejected them. 
   The Senator from Oklahoma seemed to suggest they are willing to entertain this, that, and the other thing; they are very reasonable; they will accept amendments. I was simply trying to correct a misimpression. I did not intend to be partisan. 
   This is an important issue. There are differences in how we view the issue. I happen to think we should change the estate tax so no small business or family farm ever gets caught in its web. We can do that. An $8 million or $10 million exemption would mean that virtually no family farm or small business ever would get caught in the web of the estate tax. But I do not happen to believe we should totally exempt the largest estates in this country from the estate tax. That is the difference. 
   Let's debate that difference and have amendments on the choices and make judgments as a Senate. It is not my intent ever to be partisan about this issue, but I want the right information to be given, and the right information is that we offered limited amendments and limited time agreements, and they were rejected.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from South Dakota yielding. Since the Senator from New Hampshire wants to discuss the meaning of the term ``relevant,'' as the Senator from New Hampshire knows, the rules of the Senate have words that are used and interpreted in very narrow and unique ways. The term ``relevant'' has a very narrow meaning here in the Senate by which we make a judgment about which amendments might be in order. But the term ``relevant'' is not related to common sense, in the Senate at least. 
   Let me give an example. On the issue we were talking about this morning, the estate tax repeal proposed by our friends on the other side of the aisle, the Forbes 400 wealthiest Americans would benefit to the tune of $250 billion in 10 years. Now, if one says, as they propose, let's give a $250 billion tax exemption to the 400 wealthiest Americans as identified in Forbes magazine, and if we say, we have another idea for that tax repeal--instead of giving that tax relief to the 400 wealthiest Americans, let us instead give it to middle-income families with an enlarged tax credit for tuition so they can send their kids to college; or let us widen the 15-percent bracket to enable more families to take advantage of that low rate; or let us enact a prescription drug benefit for people who need prescription drug coverage--in short, if we propose a different way to use that revenue that in our view would be more effective and more important, we are told that is not relevant. You can't offer that, we hear. That is not relevant. 
   Of course it is relevant. My colleague just talked about common sense. Someone once described common sense as genius dressed in work clothes. There is no common sense on the issue of 
   relevancy with respect to the Senate rules. Yet that is exactly the shield behind which they want to hide on these issues. 
   We have a right to offer amendments. We have a right to offer amendments that relate to the subject at hand. The proposal by the majority side is to prevent us from that opportunity. Our reaction to that is, ``Nonsense.'' We have a right to do that. We have an absolute right to do that, as Members of the Senate.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the discussion by the Senator from Delaware. This is an issue brought to the floor of the Senate by those folks who believe that the estate tax ought to be repealed over the next 10 years--that it ought to be phased in and repealed completely. 
    They call it a death tax. 
   There are some things we agree with and other things on which we don't agree. Let me discuss an area of agreement. I think most Members of Congress believe the estate tax ought to be reformed in a manner that prevents a small business or family farm that is being passed from the parents to the children from having some sort of crippling estate tax apply to that transfer. I think almost all Members agree that should not happen. We want to encourage the transfer of a family farm and a small business to the children. We want to encourage parents giving their family farm or small business to their children to operate and keep that small business open. To do that, we ought to provide a specific exemption for family farms and small businesses. We provide such an exemption now in current law, but it is not high enough. We ought to make it high enough so no family farm or small business gets caught in this web. 
   I propose $10 million. In fact, I cosponsored a piece of legislation authored by the Senator from Oklahoma a couple of years ago that had a $10 million ceiling in it with respect to the estate tax applied to a family farm or small business. We can increase the exemption so as to make sure no one has to worry about the interruption of the operation of a farm or small business. That is not rocket science. We can do that. 
   That is not the issue here. We want to offer an amendment to do that. If we ever get the estate tax repeal bill on the floor, we will offer an amendment that would say, ``Let's not repeal it; let's instead provide a substantial increase in the exemption so family farms and small businesses are not hit with an estate tax.'' So that question is off the table. 
   The question now is, will some sort of estate tax remain? In the newspaper this morning there is a story about a fellow worth about $900 million, a big investor-type from New York. I will not use his name. He is using his personal money to spend $20 million on television advertising between now and the November election on the issue of education, particularly the issue of vouchers with respect to education. 
   It is his right to do that. Here is a person who amassed a fortune of $900 million, according to the newspaper, a terrific amount of money. He is just short of a billionaire. If that person at some point should die--and of course, everyone does--and that person's son or daughter gets an inheritance of $500 million because of the estate tax, who will stand on the floor and say shame on Congress for taking away part of that estate through an estate tax. 
   The question is, Are there some in this country at the upper scale of income and wealth whom we should expect to be able to pay an estate tax? They have lived in this wonderful country, enjoyed the bounty of being an American, been able to become a millionaire, a billionaire. The wealthiest 400 people, according to Forbes magazine, would get a $250 billion tax windfall in estate tax reductions under the proposal for complete repeal. There were 309 billionaires in the United States in 1999. More than one half of the billionaires in the world live in the United States. That is not a bad thing. That is a good thing. That is wonderful. What a great economy. What a great place to live and work and invest. 
   However, we have in this country a tax on estates. The majority has proposed eliminating the tax altogether, repealing it completely. According to the Treasury Department, when fully phased in, in the second 10 years, this would reduce federal revenues by $750 billion. We on the other hand have proposed to make changes in the estate tax to provide a sufficient exemption so that no family farm or small business is caught in the web of estate taxes. But we also believe that we ought to retain the revenue from some of the largest estates currently taxed in order to evaluate other possible uses for that revenue. 
   Incidentally, the motion to proceed to this is a debate about proceeding to this or something else. Is total repeal of the estate tax the only thing that represents a priority in Congress? How else might we use this money, $250 billion, that under the present proposal would go to the wealthiest 400 people in our country? How else might we use that $250 billion? What about giving it to working families in the form of a tax break, an increased tax credit for college tuition to help parents send their kids to school? 
   That seems reasonable to me. Or what about the possibility of using part of it to help pay down the Federal debt? During tough times, if we have run the Federal debt up to $5.7 trillion, how about during good times paying it down again? Perhaps we could use part of this revenue to pay down the debt. Or what about the proposition to use part of this revenue to provide a prescription drug benefit for those who are on Medicare? Those Americans who reach their senior years and have the lowest incomes of their lives are now discovering that the miracle drugs they need to extend and improve their lives are not available to them all too often because they cannot afford them. The drugs are priced out of reach. 
   Senior citizens have told me in hearings that when they go to the grocery store they go to the back of the store first because that is where they sell the prescription drugs. That is where the pharmacy is. They must go to the back of the grocery store to buy their prescription drugs to deal with their diabetes and their heart trouble and arthritis because only then will they know, after they have paid for the prescription drugs they need, only then will they know how much money they have to buy food. Only then will they know how much money they have left to eat. 
   What about using some of that estate tax revenue to provide a prescription drug benefit for the Medicare program rather than $250 billion for the richest 400 Americans? 
   The majority party has said: We intend to demand the repeal of the estate tax by bringing a bill to the floor, and we don't want to mess around with your amendments. In fact, the narrow crevice here in the Senate on relevancy would say it is not relevant for my colleague, the Senator from Illinois, to offer an amendment and say we are debating the repeal of $250 billion of tax obligation to the wealthiest 400 Americans, so I have another idea on what we ought to do with that $250 billion. I propose we use it to provide a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program. It would only require part of that revenue. But that is his idea.  
   Under the narrow rules of the Senate, the majority says that is not relevant. We are not within the relevancy rules of the Senate, so we have no right to offer that idea. We have no right to offer that amendment. 
   We will and should have a longer and expanded debate about this issue. If we have the opportunity to offer amendments and have up-or-down votes on issues, we will have an opportunity to take away, forever, the proposition that small businesses or family farms are going to be caught with an estate tax. We will offer an amendment that provides a threshold beyond which no family farms or small businesses will be ever threatened by an estate tax. 
   That is not going to be the issue. The issue is much narrower than that. It is, Should we give up the revenue derived from an estate tax applied to the wealthiest estates in America? Should we give up revenue that could be used for other things, including reducing the Federal debt, providing middle-income tax relief, providing prescription drug benefits, or other urgent needs, or should we only decide our priority for the $250 billion is to relieve the tax burden on the estate of the wealthiest Americans? That is the question. 
   The question we are dealing with this morning is a motion to proceed to this issue. Proceed to what? Proceed to the estate tax repeal. Shall we proceed to debate the estate tax repeal? I have another idea. How about proceeding to debate the issue of prescription drugs in the Medicare program? 
   That is a bigger priority for me at the moment. Let's get that done. We have a very limited time between now and the middle of October when this Congress will complete its work. Let's proceed to do a Patients' Bill of Rights that gives real protection to patients in the health care system. Let's enact one that would say to a patient: You have a right to understand every option for your medical treatment--not just the cheapest --every option for your medical treatment; you have a right to that. 
   Some say we have debated that. Yes, we debated it and passed a patients' bill of goods, not a Patients' Bill of Rights. It is a hollow vessel. Let's get that back to the floor. Let's have a vigorous and aggressive debate. Let's have a discussion about the issues we have raised. 
   Let's have a discussion about the woman who was hiking in the Shenandoah mountains and fell off a 40-foot cliff and was taken to an emergency room with a concussion in a coma and multiple broken bones. After substantial medical treatment, she survived, only to be told by her HMO: We are not going to cover your emergency room treatment because you did not get prior approval to go to the emergency room. 
   This is a woman who was hauled in on a gurney in a coma and did not have prior approval for emergency room treatment. Let's talk about that. 
   Let's talk about a young boy named Ethan whose physical therapy was cut off. He was born with cerebral palsy, and it was judged by a managed care physician, or a managed care accountant, perhaps, that he had only a 50-percent chance of walking by age 5 and that was ``insignificant": Therefore, the HMO said, we won't cover the rehabilitation therapy. Think about that. A 50-percent chance of walking by age 5 for young Ethan was deemed ``insignificant'' and so the HMO wouldn't cover his rehabilitation therapy. Let's talk about that. 
   Pass a motion to proceed to a Patients' Bill of Rights, and we will talk about these cases and these issues. 
   Let's talk about the young boy who died at the age 16. Senator REID and I had a hearing in Nevada. The young boy's mother told the tragic story. As she took her seat, she was crying and was holding aloft a large color picture of her 16-year-old son who had died, having been denied the treatment he needed to fight his cancer by the managed care organization. She said with tears in her eyes, holding a picture of her son aloft: My son looked at me and said: Mom, how can they do this to a kid? 
   Let's have a motion to proceed to talk about those issues. That is a priority with me. 
   This question of a motion to proceed is a question about what is important, what are our priorities. I say bring a Patients' Bill of Rights and have an aggressive, full debate. That issue has been in conference, and the conference has not moved a bit. The last time I mentioned that one of my colleagues protested: Oh, we have made a lot of progress. Month after month there has been no progress at all. When I heard that, I told him at least glaciers move an inch or two a year. There is no evidence that conference is alive. On a Patients' Bill of Rights, nothing is happening. 
   But, boy, take the estate tax repeal, just give some people around here a whiff of providing some big tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans and, all of a sudden, it is as if they had an industrial strength Vitamin B-12 shot. There is nothing but scurrying around this Chamber. Boy, are they excited. 
   We are excited about some other things. In fact, there are plenty of ideas for middle-income-tax relief. If we want to talk about tax cuts, we should be cautious because economists really do not have the foggiest idea what is going to happen 2, 4, 6, 10 years from now. They just do not know. We have been through a period in which we think this economy will never go into reverse; we think the business cycle has been repealed. It has not. We are 
   going to go through periods of contraction, and we are going to continue to have economic conditions that we cannot predict. So we ought to be cautious about predictions of large, unrelenting surpluses. 
   Nonetheless, if we have surpluses in the future that are as generous as now predicted, it is perfectly reasonable for us to be talking about some targeted tax cuts that will make a real difference in the lives of people. There are plenty of such areas; repealing the estate tax for the wealthiest Americans does not rank high among them. 
   Yes, getting rid of the estate tax for family farms and small business does rank high. We are prepared to offer that amendment. If our amendment is adopted, we are not going to have the interruption of a family farm or small business when it passes from parents to children. 
   As I indicated earlier, there are 309 billionaires in this country. More than one-half of the billionaires--that is with a B--more than one-half of the billionaires in the world live in the United States. Good for us and good for them. I am as delighted as I can be with all that success. Many of them believe as I do that their estate ought to bear some estate tax when they die, and that estate tax, which we now receive, can be used for some other productive investments. 
   Some have an idea--incidentally, I have worked on it some as well. My colleague from Nebraska has worked on a proposal called KidSave, which would invest in supplementary savings accounts for children. In fact, we could develop a proposal which I have worked on that would in which the largest estates bearing an estate tax would help provide a modest pool of savings for every baby born in this country who then could access those savings upon, for example, the completion of high school. 
   What a wonderful incentive it would be to say to people that if they pay attention and do their homework and graduate from high school, a reward will be waiting for them. There are all kinds of ideas. But the only idea that moves around this Chamber is an idea on that side of the aisle that says we must repeal the entire estate tax and we must do it through a vote on this issue in this Chamber and we must do it by denying the minority the opportunity to offer any significant amendments.

   Mr. DORGAN. I think the Senator from California is right. I was thinking also about the alternatives. We have had a lot of discussion and will have, I assume, a great deal more discussion on the ability to pass a family farm on to the children, and I certainly support that. 
   I want to have an exemption that will prevent the estate tax from snaring in its web the passage of the family farm from parents to children. 
   I will say to my friends who raise these issues, if you want to help family farmers, we have an amendment that will enable you to do that. But then you go further and say: We want to provide the richest 400 people in America a $250 billion tax break during the second 10 years. That is triple the amount of money each year that we now spend on the farm program. 
   We have this Freedom to Farm bill which is just devastating family farmers. Grain prices have collapsed. They have been collapsed for a long time. Perhaps we could take just a third of the amount of money they want to give in tax relief to the wealthiest estates in America--just a third of it--and say: Let's have a farm program that really keeps family farmers on the farm. It is not a priority for some. See, that is the problem. 
   It would be nice, for example--just in terms of what people think priorities are--if we could all go to an auction sale at some point. Arlo Schmidt, an auctioneer in North Dakota --he is a wonderful auctioneer--told me about a young boy about 8 years old who came up and grabbed him by the leg at the end of an auction sale. 
   This boy was the son of a farmer whose machinery and land were being sold. This little boy grabbed the auctioneer around his thigh and, with tears in his eyes, looked up at him, pointed at him, and said: You sold my dad's tractor. This little boy was very angry. He said: You sold my dad's tractor. Arlo said: I patted him on the shoulder and tried to calm him down a little bit. This was after the action was over. His dad's equipment was gone, and so on. 
   The little boy had none of this calming. The little boy, with tears in his eyes, said: I wanted to drive that tractor when I got big. 
   The point is, we have a lot of things happening in this country that relate to family values and our economy and to what kind of country we are. One of them I care a lot about, because I come from a farm State, is the health of our family farmers and their ability to make a decent living. 
   For those who would come to the Senate and say, let's get rid of the entire estate tax, I would say, regarding the wealthiest estates in our country, for you to flex your muscles and exert your energy to lift the burden of the estate tax from estates worth $1 billion, I do not understand it. 
   I do not understand it when we have so many other needs, such as the need for income tax relief for middle-income families --not the wealthy estates--the need to enact a family farm program so the farmers have a decent chance to make a living, the need to adopt a Patients' Bill of Rights, the need to include a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program--and do it soon. There are so many needs, and what you have done is elevate the need for lifting the burden of the estate tax on the largest estates in our country, saying: That is job No. 1. That is our priority.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois is correct. 
   Let me give you another piece of information. The largest 374 estates would get an average tax cut of $12.8 million. The largest 1,062 of the estates in this country--about five-hundredths of 1 percent of the estates--would get an estimated average tax cut of $7 million each. 
   The point isn't to say that having made money in this country is wrong or you should be penalized for it. That is not my point. My point is not that. This is a wonderful place in which some people do very well. Many of them who do very well do so because they work day and night. They have a certain genius --and good for them. There are others, however, as all of us know, who are fortunate to inherit a substantial amount of money --and good for them as well. 
   But our proposition is simple enough; that on those largest estates in this country--I am talking about the very largest estates--should there not be the retention of some basic estate tax to create some revenue that can be used then to invest in the future of this country, invest in its children, invest in its family farmers, invest in our senior citizens? Because we now receive that revenue. If we decide to repeal that revenue, the question is, measured against what? Is this the most important, or are there other areas that are more important? That is what we ought to be discussing. 
   That is why the motion to proceed, I think, is the place to discuss this. We have on a postcloture motion a number of hours within which we can discuss this issue. I hope my colleagues will also take some time. 
   I know it is popular to say: You know something, this is a death tax. The reason they say that is they have pollsters who poll the words, and they have discovered that if they use the words ``death tax,'' it is a kind of pejorative that allows people to believe: Well, OK, let's repeal the death tax.  
   It is much more than that. It is a tax on a decedent's estate that applies at certain levels and at certain times. I would agree with the majority party, if they say the exemption isn't high enough. It should be much, much higher. We want to make it much higher. But I would not agree, and do not agree, if they say: Let us repeal the estate tax burden on the largest estates in this country. 
   Again, let me say that there are many who have amassed very substantial estates who believe we should not repeal the estate tax burden. Incidentally, a substantial amount of charitable giving in this country is stimulated by the presence of an estate tax. I would not use that to justify its presence, but I would say that one additional result of a total repeal for the largest estates will, I think, have a very significant impact on foundations and charities in this country. 
   But we are going to have a very substantial discussion as we move along. This is a very important issue dealing with a lot of revenue. I must say, it is interesting that the issue is brought to the floor of the Senate without even going to the Finance Committee. I would expect the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee would express great concern about that. This is an issue that has just bypassed the Finance Committee, just being brought right to the floor of the Senate, with no hearings, no discussions, no markup in the Finance Committee. 
   It is also a circumstance where the majority leader has indicated he wants to bring this up, but he does not want people to offer amendments really. And if they are to offer amendments, he wants them to be relevant with respect to the decision of relevancy in the Senate, not with respect to what is relevant or nonrelevant about the subjects that are on the floor of the Senate. 
   For example, if the proposal is to substantially cut revenue by exempting the largest estates in this country from any estate tax burden, if that is the proposal, it would not be relevant in the Senate to say: I have another idea. Why don't we retain the tax burden on the largest estates, exempt the tax burden on the other estates, and then, instead of costing the extra $50 or $60 billion for the first 10 years and substantially move over the next 10 years, let's use that difference to provide a middle-income tax break, or let's use that difference to provide a larger tax credit for college tuition to send your children to college. Let's use that difference to provide a benefit of prescription drugs in the Medicare program. Let's use that difference to pay down the Federal debt that now exists at around $5.7 trillion--all of those ideas would be out of order and considered, under the arcane Senate rules, as nonrelevant.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the facts are not very evident with respect to this debate in most cases. 
   I thought it would be useful to quote from an interesting publication, the ``Farm and Ranch Guide''--it is a well-known publication to most farmers and ranchers--an article by Alan Guebert, ``A Tax Break for the Rich Courtesy of Family Farmers'' is its title. 
   He points out that in 1997, according to Internal Revenue Service data, 1.9 percent of the more than 2 million Americans who died paid any estate tax at all; only 1.9 percent paid any estate tax at all.  
   As skinny as that slice was, an even skinnier 2,400 estates paid almost 50 percent of all estate taxes......  
   His point was, there are not many estates that are subject to an estate tax. I believe we ought to enact a generous exemption for family farms and small businesses so that no family farms or small businesses will be caught in the web of an estate tax. 
   It is not as if this is a riveting debate, of course. The estate tax is a complicated issue. It can be highly emotional. As we see in the Senate today, it is not going to keep people glued to their seats. 
   I suggest, however, the purpose of taxation is to pay for things we do in this country together. We build roads together because it doesn't make sense for each of us to build a road separately. We build schools because it makes sense that we do that together. We provide for a common defense. It requires taxes to pay for all this. It is what we do as Americans. 
   I probably shouldn't name particular cities, but go mail a letter in some cities around the world and see how quickly that letter moves. Go drive on some roads in rural Honduras and see how well your tires hold up. Go take a look at some of the services in other parts of the world and then evaluate what your tax dollar buys in this country. That is part of our investment in America. Some say that the payment of taxes is something we don't like very much--I think all of us share that feeling--so let's relieve that burden. They come to the floor with a plan. The plan is in writing and says, what we want to do is relieve the burden of the estate tax. 
   We say: That's all right. Let us relieve the burden so that nobody of ordinary means is going to have to pay an estate tax. 
   They say: No, that is not what we mean. Our idea is more than that. Our idea is, we want to remove the estate tax from everybody, including the largest estates in the country. So they say: our idea is to reduce the amount of revenue the Government has and to do it by relieving the burden of the estates tax on the largest estates. 
   We say: Well, that is an idea, but here is another idea. If we are talking about $250 billion in 10 years of tax relief, why go just to 400 of the wealthiest Americans? Why not provide some of that to the rest of the American folks? 
   How about to working families? How about some relief from the high payroll taxes people pay? How about some more relief from the cost of sending kids to college?  
   We have some ideas. But we are told: Your ideas don't matter. We are going to deal only with our own ideas, and those are ones that would benefit the upper-income folks. But we want to put clothes on it to disguise it a little because we know it doesn't sell very well to talk about providing tax relief to billionaires. We are going to disguise it to make it look different and call it tax relief for family farmers and small businesses. 
   But we support such relief. Let's do that right now. In fact, perhaps the Senator from Nevada could put forth a unanimous consent request. We can legislate like they do--don't go to the committees, don't have markups; just bring it to the floor and put forth a unanimous consent request. They have done that on the estate tax. Yesterday, they did it on the H-1B proposal. Perhaps we can say we support eliminating the estate tax for small businesses and family farmers and do it their way. That is not a good way to legislate, but let's try that. Then we can get that off the table so all that remains is the question, Are we going to provide a very substantial amount of tax relief to those 400 or so estates that represent the largest accumulation of wealth in the country? If that is the priority, what is it measured against--against the other priorities? Is it the most appropriate? Is it the most logical thing to do? Or are there other uses of that revenue that would make more sense for this country? 
   In summary, that is something that I think will be subject to a substantial amount of debate in the coming weeks. I wish to close where I began and say that there is a profound difference that exists between many of us and the majority party on the subject of whether the largest estates in this country should be relieved of the burden of paying an estate tax. I think there is a better use for those funds than tax relief for billionaires. On the other hand, there is no difference between us on whether we ought to make a quantum leap and provide a very significant exemption for the transfer of family farms or small businesses. And for a dramatic and substantial increase in the unified exemption from the current roughly $675,000 level, I would support taking that to the $4 million level for a husband and wife. I think we can do that. There certainly should be agreement on that. We can take that step, and what is left is an idea to relieve the rest of the burden by some of the majority, and other ideas that we would have for the use of those funds, including middle-income tax relief. Let's have that debate. It seems to me that would be the simple way of proceeding. 
   I wanted to make some of those points. I appreciate my colleagues who are also going to make some points in the postcloture discussion. Then we should have this debate, with amendments. I think time agreements could be developed, and I think at the end of the debate we would see where the votes are in the Senate on this issue. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was interested in the discussion offered by the Senator from Illinois. In fact, I was interested in the discussion earlier by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. KYL, who was complaining about some comments I made earlier in the day. 
   As I understand the Senator from Illinois, he indicated 
   earlier--and I did earlier today as well--that he would support an amendment that would effectively say we will repeal the estate tax for all small businesses and family farms up to $8 million. So there is no disagreement in this Chamber on that. We will repeal the estate tax for those estates up to $8 million. The difference is the majority party says that is not enough. We want to repeal the estate tax for estates over $8 million as well. 
   The Senator from Illinois seems to be saying, as I said this morning, that the loss of revenue by repealing the estate tax for the wealthiest estates in this country is something that ought to be measured against other alternatives, such as providing a tax cut for middle-income people, for example, or a range of investments that might be made to strengthen this country. 
   The Senator from Arizona, I noted, was saying: Well, people who think like that are big-spending liberals. 
   Who are the real big spenders? They are the folks who say: You know, we ought to spend money by deciding that a $1 billion estate should be relieved of the burden of having any estate tax at all, and decide that relieving an estate tax burden from the largest estates in this country is more important than investment in education, it is more important than a middle-income tax cut, it is more important than paying down the Federal debt. 
   Who are the big spenders, I ask the Senator from Illinois?

   Mr. DORGAN. Isn't it a fact, more than reforming the estate tax, that the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from North Dakota and others would say let's effectively repeal the estate tax for estates up to $8 million for small businesses or family farms? In fact, the Senator from Illinois is saying let's repeal the estate tax to that level. But he doesn't want to go the next step as proposed by the majority party of saying no, that is important to do, but let's do something that is even more important. Let's make sure the repeal of the estate tax burden applies to people who leave estates of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
   Is that a priority? It seems to me that it ought to be measured against a range of other things that we ought to do. 
   I just make the point that I always smile a little when I hear these pejoratives about big spenders. It is sort of yesterday's news. It so happens that folks standing on this side of this Chamber are the ones who cast the tough votes that put this country back on track of getting rid of the burgeoning Federal deficits a few years ago when there was well over $300 billion in Federal deficits, and now, of course, to balance the budget. We cast the tough votes to do that. I don't need to hear much from people about who the big spenders are. We put this country back on track. 
   There are those who insist the largest estates in America should be relieved of their estate tax burdens and are suggesting that those of us who believe there are other alternatives that might be more appropriate--more middle-income tax relief, or other things--are called big spenders. I think that is yesterday's language in a wornout discussion.

   Mr. DORGAN. I am a little uncomfortable with the discussion here. The discussion is: Under what conditions will the majority leader allow us to consider this bill? I understand that amendments are inconvenient, but the rules of the Senate allow people to be elected to the Senate and offer amendments and consider legislation. 
   The unanimous consent request offered by the majority leader was to take up this bill and pass it without any discussion or any amendments. Now there is a negotiation here saying: Maybe I will allow it to be brought to the floor if the Senator from Nevada would, on behalf of his side, agree to no more than five amendments. 
   The fact is, it seems to me if we fretted a little less about what someone might do when they bring something to the floor and started working through it, it would probably take a whole lot less time. 
   I happen to be supportive of the H-1B legislation, but I am not very supportive of some notion of anybody in the Senate saying: Here are the conditions under which we will consider it--and only these conditions--and if you don't like it, we won't consider it. 
   I hope the Senator from Nevada--if the majority leader insists on his unanimous consent request--will make a unanimous consent request following that similar to the one suggested by the Senator from Massachusetts, a unanimous consent request to bring the issue to the floor under the regular order at this time.

   Mr. DORGAN. I want to make it clear that funding to assure the timely and accurate processing of Medicare claims also is a high priority for me and the beneficiaries in my state. 
   I am concerned that HCFA projects a 3.5 percent increase in claims volume next year and yet our budget flatlined funding for Medicare contractors. However, I am even more concerned that the House has cut the Medicare contractor budget by $79 million from current levels. The Senate, at the very least, must assure that this important program is not cut. Additionally, I would like to work with Senator CRAIG to secure additional funding for the Medicare contractors, if funds become available.

   Mr. DORGAN. I think it should be noted that operation Allied Force demonstrated that our nation is short jamming assets for even one major war. An ``EB'' version of the B-52 would be a cost-effective solution to the problem, since the aircraft are already paid for. As a matter of fact, I understand that during Operation Allied Force, General Wesley Clark asked if any other platforms could be equipped with offensive electronic gear to augment the over-tasked EA-6Bs against Serbia's air defense system, and that an ``EB-52'' variant was under consideration. That concept warrants full consideration, as a supplement to the EA-6B aircraft now in service with the Navy.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I had intended to speak about this amendment. But I am compelled to speak about the point that the Senator from Connecticut discussed at the start of his comments because it is so important, and it is timely. 
   At this moment, I understand there are meetings going on right now somewhere in this building by a small group of people who are dealing with a piece of legislation that was cobbled together around 3 o'clock in the morning a couple of days ago dealing with the issue of imposing sanctions on food and medicine around the world, and whether that will be added to the supplemental bill that will be considered perhaps later today or tomorrow. If that is added, in my judgment, it is going to cause significant trouble. 
   Here is why: The House leaders have done what I am reminded of as the ``Moon walk''. You know the Moon walk Michael Jackson used to do. It looked like he was walking forward, but he was actually going backward. That is what they have done with respect to this issue of sanctions. 
   Senator DODD from Connecticut, myself, and others are saying we ought to end the use of sanctions on food and medicine anywhere in the world where it exists. This country has imposed sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine. It is wrong. When we take aim at dictators, we hit poor people and hungry people and sick people. It is not the best of what America stands for. 
   We ought to end all sanctions on food and medicine. Yet what was done in the House of Representatives 2 days ago, in my judgment, comes up far short. In fact, in some areas, it loses ground. 
   I want to point out an article in the Washington Post. I will come later with the legislation itself. But the Washington Post describes this legislator from Florida who opposes eliminating sanctions. She said the agreement will make it as difficult as possible for such sales to take place with respect to Cuba. Why? Because they prohibit private financing of the sale of food to Cuba. What is that about? It has nothing to do with good or common sense. They are not trying to get rid of sanctions. It has everything to do with the irrational notion about Cuba, and that if we can somehow restrict the food and medicine going to Cuba, we will enhance America's foreign policy. It is crazy. It doesn't make any sense at all. 
   Here is where we have sanctions: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, and Sudan. These countries are countries that our Government has decided are not behaving properly. I support slapping them with economic sanctions. I do not support including food and medicine in those sanctions. 
   I do not support using food as a weapon. We are trying very hard to get rid of this practice of using food as a weapon. Seventy Senators voted last year to stop using food as a weapon. 
   We have a provision in the Senate agriculture appropriations committee bill that will come to the floor of the Senate within several weeks that includes an approach that will eliminate the use of food and medicine as part of our sanctions. 
   I think we ought not give up here. We ought to fight on behalf of our family farmers and others to say that we want to abolish the use of sanctions that include food and medicine. 
   The proposition that was cobbled together over in the House at 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the morning by some people who really do not want to do this, have made it seem as if they have made progress in this area. But, in fact, they have lost ground in a couple of cases, and especially with respect to Cuba in a couple of other circumstances. There will be no U.S. sales of food to Cuba. Canadian farmers can sell to Cuba. European farmers can sell to 
   Cuba. Venezuelan farmers can sell to Cuba. 
   Seventy Members of the Senate said we ought to get rid of sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine--yes, to all countries, including Cuba. But now we have cobbled together a deal sometime early in the morning by a group of people who are going to apparently put it on a supplemental bill so we will have a circumstance where we don't solve this problem. The proposal that fails to solve this problem was not debated in the House. It was not debated in the Senate. But it was concocted at 3 a.m. in the morning and apparently was stuck on a supplemental appropriations bill. It is the wrong way to do it. 
   I just talked to a farm group that supports this. When I asked them a question about it, they admitted they had not read the language. They read the paper, I guess. The implication was that I was impeding the efforts to remove sanctions. 
   Another major farm group has just come out in opposition to it, saying this doesn't solve the problem; let's fight to solve the problem. The problem is that we include medicine and food as part of our sanctions. 
   The solution is that this country should not include food and medicine in sanctions that we impose on these countries. We should not use food as a weapon. 
   It is a very simple proposition. Seventy Senators have already weighed in in the Senate saying let's stop it. If they would allow a vote in the House, they would get 70 percent in the House of Representatives as well. 
   I hope we will not decide to cave in on this issue. Let's not make the perfect the enemy of the good. But let us at least continue to fight. We have some more months in this legislative session. We have a provision coming to the floor of the Senate in about 3 weeks that includes a real effort to stop using food and medicine as part of our sanctions. Let's fight for that. Let's not let a couple of people who run the other body decide for us at 3 a.m. in the morning what we were going to do in this circumstance. 
   Let's stand up and fight for family farmers, and let's fight for the moral principles that this country ought to hold dear. We should not use food and medicine as a weapon any longer. This is not about Republicans and Democrats. 
   Both administrations in recent years have used this approach, and they were wrong. 
   The Senate was right last year with 70 votes that said let us stop it. 
   And what was put together over in the House is now billed as some sort of a compromise. It is not a compromise at all. It falls far short of what we ought to expect. Those of us who are clearheaded enough believe we should not use food and medicine as part of economic sanctions in this country.

</TEXT>

<DOCNO>106-dorgan-nd-3-20000629</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me begin by describing this amendment and why I have offered it to this bill. 
   Let me also say that the amendment is not subject to a point of order. This amendment deals with the Patients' Bill of Rights. Quite simply, it says that when this Congress enacts patient protection legislation, we should protect all 161 million Americans enrolled in private health insurance plans. 
   Many of us have been attempting to get this Congress to pass a meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights, and so far, we have not been successful in doing so. 
   As most Americans know at this point, more and more of the American people are being herded into HMOs and managed care organizations which has jeopardized the quality of health care they receive. Too often these days, decisions about their health care are being made not by doctors but by some accountant in an HMO or in a managed care organization 1,000 miles away. 
   We have all heard stories on the floor of this Senate about the problems patients experience when their health care is viewed as a function of someone's profit and loss, not of his or her 
   health care needs. 
   We proposed a Patients' Bill of Rights to address these problems. It is rather simple legislation. It says that: 
   Patients should have the right to know all of their medical options--not just the cheapest medical options. That ought to be a fundamental right. 
   Patients ought to have the right to choose the doctor they want for the care they need, including specialty care when they need it. That ought to be a right of patients who believe they are covered with a health care policy. 
   Patients ought to have the right to emergency room treatment and emergency room care wherever and whenever they need it. 
   Patients ought to have a right to a fair and speedy process to resolve disputes with their health care plan. And they ought to be able to hold their health care plan accountable if its decision results in injury or death. 
   The Senate passed a piece of legislation last year that was called the Patients' Bill of Rights. Some of us called it a patients' bill of goods because it was a relatively empty shell. 
   The House passed a Patients' Bill of Rights that is a good bill. It is a bipartisan bill sponsored by Republican Congressman Norwood and Democratic Congressman Dingell. It passed by a 275-151 vote. 
   Since that time, the Senate appointed a set of conferees on October 15, and the House appointed its conferees on November 3. It wasn't until the end of February that there was a meeting of the conference committee. As I said previously, the conference committee isn't making much progress. 
   In this amendment, we deal with only one aspect of the Patients' Bill of Rights and that is the question of the number of Americans that a bill of rights should cover. If a Patients' Bill of Rights is enacted by this Congress, we propose with this amendment that Congress will cover all of the American people with private health insurance, rather than just the 48 million Americans proposed to be covered in the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights. We believe the Patients' Bill of Rights should cover all 161 million Americans in private health insurance plans, including the 75 million people whose employers provide coverage through an HMO or private insurance. Unfortunately, these folks are not covered in the Republican plan. The 15 million people with individual policies are not covered in the majority party's plan. The 23 million State and local government employees are not covered in the majority party's plan. 
   We propose that when and if Congress passes a Patients' Bill of Rights, that all 161 million Americans are covered by those provisions. Very simple. 
   We understand from the previous vote held a couple of weeks ago that the majority in the Senate do not want to pass our Patients' Bill of Rights. We understand that. They voted against it. But how about at least passing a part of our Patients' Bill of Rights, the part that says everybody ought to be covered? That is what I offer today as an amendment. 
   Senator REID and I held a hearing in his home state of Nevada on the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. At the hearing we had a mother come, the mother of Christopher Thomas Roe. She stood up and told us about her son. He died October 12 of last year. It was his 16th birthday. The official cause of Christopher's death was leukemia, but the real reason he died is because he was denied the kind of opportunity for patient care that he needed to give him a chance to live. He was diagnosed with leukemia, but he had to fight cancer and his HMO at the same time. It is one thing to tell a kid you have to fight a dreaded disease, you have to battle cancer. It is quite another thing to tell that young child and his family: Take on cancer and, by the way, take on your insurance company as well. That is not a fair fight. That is never a fair fight. 
   The Roe family was told that the kind of treatment he needed to send his cancer into remission was experimental. The family immediately appealed the health plan's decision. The review, which was supposed to take 48 hours during a very critical period of this young boy's life, took 10 days. As the appeal dragged on, Christopher's condition worsened. And as Chris's doctor had known, the traditional chemotherapy did not work. 
   At the hearing, Chris's mother, Susan, held up a very large picture of Christopher, about the size of this chart. It was a picture of a strapping, bright-eyed, 16-year-old boy. Susan told Senator REID and I, with tears in her eyes, how Chris turned to her one day not long before he died and said: Mom, I just don't understand how they could do this to a kid. 
   This is a 16-year-old boy who died who wanted that extra chance to be cured but whose insurance company said no, no, no. And he died. 
   We all know the stories. There is the woman who fell off a 40-foot cliff in the Shenandoah Mountains. She was hauled into an emergency room unconscious with broken bones and all kinds of physical problems. She survived and was later told by her insurance plan: We will not cover your treatment because you didn't have prior approval to get emergency room care. 
   Or how about this young child, born with a horrible cleft lip? It is hard to look at. Dr. GREG GANSKE, a Member of the House of Representatives in the Republican Party who supports this legislation, says in his practice that it is often not considered a ``medical necessity'' to fix this kind of problem. Let me show you how a child with this condition looks when he 
   receives proper medical intervention by a skilled surgeon. Is there a difference? How can anyone look at these two pictures and say fixing this condition is not a ``medical necessity''? 
   The point we are making with this amendment is very simple. Managed care organizations hold the future of too many patients in the palm of their  hands. Decisions are not being made by doctors in doctor's offices. Too often, they are made in accountants' offices 500 or 1,000 miles away. We are saying that it is wrong to make medical decisions a function of profit and loss. This country can do better than that. This ought to be a slam dunk. The legislation that provides real protection, a meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights, ought to get 100 votes in the Senate. But we can't get any movement on this at all from the conference committee charged with working out the differences between the House and Senate bills. 
   I know a few of the conferees and the chairman of the conference committee were saying we have made great progress. I describe that progress in glacial terms. At least glaciers move an inch or two a year. It is hard to see that this conference moves at all. 
   We are only asking today to say with this amendment that if we are going to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights, let's not create a hollow vessel. Let's create a Patients' Bill of Rights that provides real protection for 161 million Americans, not inadequate protection for 48 million Americans. If we are going to do this, let's do it right. 
   That is the amendment. We will have a chance to vote on it. We understand that the majority of the Senate decided they didn't want a real Patients' Bill of Rights. They wouldn't vote for the entire package, the one that provides protection for young kids such as Christopher, who are fighting leukemia, or for young people born with this severe cleft lip deformity. So all we ask is that whatever we are going to do with respect to patients' rights that we apply it to all Americans. Everyone ought to have the right and the opportunity to expect decent health care coverage if they have an insurance policy. What about a Patients' Bill of Rights for all Americans? 
   I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me answer the question of the Senator from Massachusetts. The Senator from Oklahoma took a long while to say no.  Their proposal does not cover the 161 million Americans. It is essentially the same proposal we have seen previously. It falls far short of covering the majority of the American people who our proposal would cover.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I have listened to this discussion, and it is pretty interesting. It seems to me that if you don't want to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights--perhaps for the reason the Senator from Wyoming suggested, which is that the Federal Government ought not to have any involvement in this issue--then just say so. Don't come out here and describe an alternative as if it is doing something that it is not really doing. 
   According to my colleague, we have a 258-page amendment. It kind of reminds me of the ``Honey, I shrunk the plan'' approach, this suggestion that what we should go back to covering 48 million people rather than 161 million people. 
   The Senator from Tennessee talked earlier about emergency room care and a number of the patient protections we have proposed. I hope he will respond to my inquiry. Is it not the case that the emergency room care provisions in the Senator from Oklahoma's amendment applies only to about 48 million people. Isn't it so that two out of three people will not be covered with the kind of protection the Senator suggested was covered in their proposal? It seems to me it would be a much better approach to simply say we don't support a Patients' Bill of Rights.

   Mr. DORGAN. I understand the Senator's answer, which is that the substitute offered by Senator NICKLES provides coverage for only about 48 million Americans. It is the same approach they have used previously. 
   One can suggest that all of these protections I am proposing are covered elsewhere. If that is the case, why does the Senator object? 
   The Senator from Oklahoma seems irritated we have raised this issue again. Let me tell you what Congressman NORWOOD, a Republican serving in the House who is a sponsor of the House legislation, said on May 25, and I quote: I am here to say the time's up on the conference committee. We have waited 8 months for this conference committee to approve a compromise bill. Senate Republicans have yet to even offer a compromise liability proposal. They have only demanded that the House conferees abandon their position. 
   This is a Republican saying the time is up on the conference committee. 
   Let me also point out that the Senate passed, in my judgment, a poor piece of legislation. It has the right title but it doesn't include the right provisions. The House passed a good piece of legislation, but the House leadership appointed conferees to the conference that voted against the House bill. Their conferees voted against the House bill. So the conference isn't even on the level. 
   If month after month after month goes by and you don't want to have a Patients' Bill of Rights because you don't believe the Federal Government ought to be involved in this, just tell the patients that. Say to the patients: We don't believe Congress ought to do this. You should go ahead and fight cancer and fight your HMO at the same time. Go ahead and do that. 
   The fact is, we can do better. The proposal we are offering today is very simple. We believe that a Patients' Bill of Rights establishing basic rights that patients ought to be able to expect in dealing with their insurance company is a proposal that ought to get 100 votes in this Congress. 
   There are some who say, when asked the question, Whose side are you on?  Let us stand with the insurance companies. 
   We believe Members ought to stand with the patients. There is a genuine and serious problem in this country with patients not getting the treatment they expect, need, or deserve. Patients find themselves having to fight cancer and their insurance company. That is not fair. 
   The question is whether this Congress will do something about it. The question is not whether this Congress will pass a national health care plan. That is nonsense. That is not what is being debated. I see more shuffle and tap dances going on around here on this debate. The fact is, if you want to pass a good Patients' Bill of Rights, do what the House did. Understand that Dr. NORWOOD, a Republican Congressman, knows what he is talking about. This conference hasn't moved. This conference isn't accomplishing anything. That is why we have offered this amendment. 
   I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DORGAN. All right, Mr. President. Let me take the 5 minutes at this point and close debate. 
   Mr. President, this has been an interesting discussion, but it has not been about what is on the floor today. We have had now a debate about the 1993 Clinton health plan. We have also had a discussion about ``Hillary care.'' If you have the interest in debating that, hire a hall, get your own audience, speak until you are exhausted, and have a good time. But those are not the subjects on the floor today. We are debating the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Some people do not want to debate that. They certainly do not want to talk about the facts, but this is what we are talking about: The Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Dr. GREG GANSKE, a Republican Congressman from Iowa, was just on the floor of the Senate and he indicated that the 258-page missive that is now offered as a substitute will in fact weaken HMO laws in the following States: California, Texas, Georgia, Washington, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arizona, and Missouri. That is not from me; it is from Dr. GANSKE, a Republican Congressman. 
   By the way, let me read something Dr. GANSKE said some time ago in a discussion about all of these issues. He said:  
   Let me give my colleagues one example out of many of a health plan's definition of medically necessary services. This is from the contractual language of one of the HMOs that some of you probably belong to: ``Medical necessity means the shortest, least expensive or least intense level of treatment, care or service rendered or supply provided, as determined by us.'' 
   Contracts like this demonstrate that some health plans are manipulating the definition of medical necessity to deny appropriate patient care by arbitrarily linking it to saving money, not to the patients' medical needs.  
   Some of my colleagues say we are playing politics with this issue? Why don't you tell that to some of these kids. 
   Dr. GANSKE described this child I show you a picture of, a child born with a severe cleft lip. Fifty percent of the medical professionals in Dr. GANSKE's field report that they have been told that correcting this kind of condition is not a medical necessity. 
   So tell that to the kids. Tell it to this young child, that it is not a medical necessity to correct this condition. 
   Dr. GANSKE also shared with us what a young child looks like who was born with this deformity--but who has it corrected by the right kind of surgery. Let me show you another picture of this child with the condition corrected. Does anybody want to tell this child it was not worth it? 
   Or maybe you want to talk to Ethan Bedrick. Tell Ethan that this is just  politics. Ethan was born during a complicated delivery that resulted in severe cerebral palsy and impaired motor function in his limbs. When he was 14 months old, Ethan's insurance company abruptly curtailed his physical therapy, citing the fact that he had only a 50-percent chance of being able to walk by age 5. 
   So talk to Ethan about this. You think this is politics? Talk to Ethan. A 50-percent chance of being able to walk by age 5 was deemed, quote, ``insignificant,'' and therefore you don't get the 
   medical help you need. And some people say: Well, it doesn't matter. Apparently, you don't deserve it. 
   That is not the way health care ought to be delivered in this country. People ought to have basic rights. That is why we call this a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   The question, at the end of the day, is: With whom do you stand? 
   Do you stand with the managed care companies that have developed contracts such as this, that say, ``Medical necessity means the shortest, least expensive, or least intensive level of treatment, care, or service as determined by us,'' which means that this young child is told: Tough luck? 
   Or do you stand with the patients and decide that maybe we ought to do something, as a country, that responds to real problems and pass a real Patients' Bill of Rights? 
   A fellow once told me, in my little hometown: You never ought to buy something from somebody who is out of breath. There is a breathless quality to some of the discussion I have heard tonight. We raise the issue of a Patients' Bill of Rights, and instead we hear a discussion about the 1993 health care plan. Then we have a substitute that is 258 pages that kills a lot of trees for nothing. You don't need to take up 258 pages to offer an empty plan. Offer one page, and say: We don't support a Patients' Bill of Rights. Just be honest about it. But do not try to fool the American people any longer. 
   It is true we have had a few votes on this. It is also true that there is a conference committee that is supposed to be working. But it is also true, as Dr. Norwood and other Republican Congressmen said, that the time is up and the conference committee has not done a thing. 
   No one ever accuses the Congress of speeding. I understand that.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I support the legislation dealing with the issue of suicide. It is very important. 
   Many, many years ago, early one morning I came to an office and found a coworker had taken his life. It was, of course, a morning I will remember the rest of my life, finding a coworker and a friend who had, over the nighttime hours, taken his life. 
   I suppose only those who have been acquainted with that circumstance can barely imagine the kind of horrors that persuade someone to take their own life. I think anything we can do as a country in public policy to reach out and say to those who are visited by those emotional difficulties, those pressures and internal problems that persuade them to consider taking their life, anything we can do to reach out to them to say, here is some help, we ought to be able to do that. 
   This amendment is very small. Incrementally, it will be helpful. 
   I appreciate the work of Senator WELLSTONE and Senator REID. I think someday--we may never know the name--adding these resources will help someone who is ravaged by these emotional difficulties and can be prevented from taking their own life, and we will be rewarded for having paid attention to this issue.

I am just curious whether our colleague, the Senator from Texas, came to the floor to make a point of order when it had to do with defense. I don't know the answer to that. I am curious. It seems to me if 
   there is a consistent point of order against the deployment of this technique, one wouldn't just make it on education issues, which, of course, to you, me, and others is very important. It is some of the most important spending we do. It is some of the most important investments we make in the country. 
   I ask the question, Does the Senator know whether a similar point of order was made by our colleague when it had to do with the Defense Department last year?

   Mr. DORGAN. If I might ask another question, the point here is this bill deals with the effort the Federal Government makes to respond to the education needs in this country. Most of education funding, of course, comes from State and local governments. We provide some funding in a range of areas. We provide assistance in VA, health care, and a range of other issues. This is a very important piece of legislation that invests prominently in the lives of the people of this country. 
   The technique that is being objected to is not a new technique; it has been employed before. That is the point I was making. Is it a good technique? I don't know. You could find other ways to adequately fund these needed programs. Some in this Chamber may not want to fund these programs. They may think they are not a priority perhaps. This is not a new technique. But apparently when it comes to funding for VA, health care, and education, we have people come to the floor to make a point of order.

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, today Governor Schafer, from my State of North Dakota, has made a request of President Clinton in the form of a disaster declaration request as a result of substantial damage that has occurred in North Dakota from some huge storms that have rumbled across our State in recent weeks. About a week ago, late in the afternoon, in the Fargo-Moorhead region of North Dakota-Minnesota, huge thunderstorms rolled across the northern plains and dumped 7 to 8 inches of rain on that flat land in the Red River Valley in a matter of 8 hours--7 to 8 inches of rain in 8 hours. This occurred only a week after some regions just 80 to 90 miles North of there received 17 to 18 inches of rain in a very short period of time: 24 to 36 hours. There was an enormous quantity of rain. 
   These two storm events occurred in the Red River Valley, which is as flat as a table top. There is not a hill in sight. The result was dramatic sheet flooding in every direction. I recently took a tour of some affected regions in northeastern North Dakota--Grand Forks County and Walsh County and other areas, and small communities like Langdon, Mekinock, and a range of other communities. Communities in the region were hit with more moisture than anyone had ever seen in their lifetime in such a short period of time. 
   As a result, flat fields were totally inundated with water. Roads and railroad lines were washed away. There was one area I traversed in which they had a box culvert that weighed about 2 to 3 tons. The force of the water--which, incidentally, totally inundated these fields--washed out a 2-ton box culvert, and nobody could find it. It was gone. How does one lose a 2-ton box culvert? Yet it was gone. 
   It is hard to imagine these flooding events unless one sees them personally. We have had two of them in two weeks in the eastern part of North Dakota, and they have been devastating. As a result, the Governor has made a disaster declaration request of the President, a request which I fully support and upon which I hope the President will act with dispatch this week. FEMA is continuing in both of these areas--northeastern North Dakota and also the Fargo region--to do their damage assessments. Sufficient work has been done on the damage assessments for us to know we are going to require some Federal assistance. 
   Some people say: Why is there Federal help available in the form of disaster assistance? Precisely because there are some events which occur--floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, and so on--that are so large and so significant and cause so much damage that State and local governments cannot possibly deal with the resulting damage. 
   That is why the rest of the country says: You have had some trouble, let us give you a helping hand. That is what happened during the 1997 floods from the Red River in the Red River Valley which most everyone will remember. That is what happened with the Los Angeles earthquake. That is what happened when the Southern United States experienced substantial tornado and hurricane damage. 
   We regret we have to come again with a request for disaster assistance, but we do. It is not of our making. It is an act of nature that is quite unusual. I have not, in all of my life, seen a circumstance where, in a period of 24 to 36 hours, we had 17 to 18 inches of rainfall in a very small area. We are a semiarid State. We get 17 inches of rain in a year in North Dakota on average. Yet a week ago today, Fargo and Moorhead received 7 to 8 inches of rain in a matter of 8 hours and, as I said, 90 miles north of there, they received 17 to 18 inches in some parts in a matter of 24 to 36 hours. One can imagine the devastation that causes. 
   We are trying to wrap up a supplemental appropriations bill probably by tomorrow evening. The hope is that it gets filed tomorrow evening. Both sides want to get it to the President for his signature by the end of this week. It will be attached to the military construction bill. 
   I am working with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to make certain these flood events are mentioned in the context of that supplemental bill. I expect FEMA already has the resources with which to deal with this, if and when the President declares a disaster. 
   I wanted to bring to my colleagues' attention the request the Governor of North Dakota has made. My expectation is the President will move quickly to respond to it, and my concern is that we do everything we can not only to deal with the issue of infrastructure damage to public buildings, and there is substantial damage in those areas--roads, buildings, water and sewage systems--but also that we are able to be helpful to family farmers, many of whom have lost virtually all of their crops, crops they dutifully planted this spring with such great hope and now have been completely decimated by these sheet floods. 
   My colleagues and I who come from this region of the country will continue to work on all of these issues. We are joined by our colleagues from the State of Minnesota because all this occurs on the North Dakota-Minnesota border.

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I want to talk about the issue 
   of energy supplies and the debate over energy. I noticed today a number of Senators came to the floor of the Senate, and they waved their arms and raised their voices a bit and railed about energy: Lord, we should know what is going on here, they say. We have the OPEC cartel, yes, but we also have an administration that does not have an energy policy, and woe is us. 
   This is not brain surgery. This is not complicated at all. We have a cartel called OPEC that controls a substantial amount of the oil that is exported to this country, and they decided to decrease production. When they did, prices began to go up. 
   More than that, we also have the largest oil companies in this country and around the world merging. Exxon, Amoco, BP, are all merging. We have larger oil companies and a circumstance of a cartel supplier, and now people who go to the gas pumps are paying higher and higher energy prices. 
   I do not hear any discussion about whether the energy companies may have played a role in this. Does anybody understand how, when you get larger, you also have the opportunity to manipulate prices? I think you do. 
   Is a major part of this problem the OPEC cartel? You bet your life it is. But I think another part of this problem is we do not understand pricing policies of energy companies that have become larger and larger. We need to know that. That is why I fully support the Federal Trade Commission's investigation, and why I believe the Justice Department ought to be part of the same investigation. 
   I find it interesting, as the oil companies become larger and continue to oppose ethanol production, Congress has still not done nearly enough to promote the kind of energy supplies that are renewable--wind energy and others. We ought to get, in my judgment, a wake-up call from these oil prices that we are held hostage by the OPEC cartel. We are a growing economy and  produce and use a substantial amount of energy, but we are far too dependent on OPEC countries. 
   If one looks at production of energy, it does not matter who is in the White House--a Republican or Democratic administration--we see that same line, and the line is not going up, it is marginally going down. We need an energy policy that is a Republican and Democratic energy policy, not one about which one side continues to wave and rail about the other side. We need a bipartisan energy strategy that recognizes this country should not be beholden to an OPEC cartel for its energy supplies. Not to do so means we put ourselves at risk, we put our economies at risk, and put the American people at risk when, in some cases, they cannot purchase the energy they need.

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I want to talk about the subject that is going to be front and center in the Congress this week, the issue of a prescription drug benefit and Medicare. There are stories in today's papers--the Washington Post, the New York Times, and others--in which the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee is quoted as saying that there is a belief that his party, meaning Congressional Republicans, need to do something on the issue of prescription drugs. He says, ``It's a great issue--no question it polls well.'' 
   Another member from the other side of the aisle said: ``We're going to use the marketplace pressure to solve the problem, which is much better than the government program.'' 
   In other words, the majority party feels they have to bring a bill to the floor addressing the need for prescription drug coverage because the issue polls well. So they are going to bring an illusory bill to the floor of the House this week that requires private insurance companies to offer an insurance policy that helps people pay for their prescription drugs. The catch is that the insurance companies say they cannot offer such a policy. Officials from two companies have come to my office and told me that, to offer a policy with $1,000 in benefits, it would cost $1,200. 
   I come from a rural State. In rural States, a recent study shows that rural Medicare beneficiaries pay 25 percent more out-of-their own pockets for prescription drugs than do urban beneficiaries. Of course, rural areas are shrinking. Many have seen the movie ``Four Weddings and a Funeral.'' In rural areas of my State, ministers tell me they have four funerals for every wedding because the population is getting older and the younger people are moving out. 
   And those senior citizens living in rural areas are the ones who are paying the highest prices for prescription drugs. 
   And many of them cannot afford the drugs they need. They have heart trouble, diabetes, and a range of other problems. Their doctors say: You need to take this miracle medicine, this life-saving drug, to help you live a better life. And they say to their doctors: I can't afford it. 
   We need to do two things. First, we need to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program, and second, we need to put downward pressure on drug prices. 
   I thought I might, with my colleagues' consent, show on the floor of the Senate a couple of pill bottles that illustrate part of the problem. Here are two bottles for a prescription drug called Zocor used to lower cholesterol. This is the same tablet, in the same strength, made by the same company, probably made in the same manufacturing plant. If you buy Zocor in Canada, it costs $1.82 per pill. But if you buy the same drug--the same pill, made by the same company--in the United States, it costs $3.82 per pill. 
   Let me say that again. If you are a Canadian, you pay $1.82 for Zocor; if you are an American, you pay $3.82, more than twice as much. Why? Because the big drug manufacturers have decided they want to charge the American consumer more than twice as much. 
   One other example, if I might. Here are bottles of Zoloft. Zoloft is a common prescription drug used to fight depression. If you buy this medication in Canada--the same pill, in the same strength, by the same drug company--it costs $1.28 per pill. But if you buy it in North Dakota, it costs $2.34 per pill. The Canadian pays $1.28; the American pays $2.34, 83 percent more. 
   I have other examples, but I think you get the point: American consumers pay the highest prices in the world for their prescription drugs. These are the prices that our current marketplace have achieved. Why should an American citizen have to go to Canada to buy a drug that was produced in the United States in order to pay half the price that is charged in the United States? The answer is that they should not have to do that. 
   I think these examples illustrate why, when those on the other side of the aisle say ``we're going to use the marketplace pressure to solve the problem,'' this marketplace approach just is not going to work. We need a real prescription drug benefit added to the Medicare program. What we do not need is an illusion of a benefit where we tell private insurance companies to sell a policy they say they can't underwrite and won't sell. 
   That is not good public policy. Maybe the polls show that Medicare prescription drug coverage is a popular issue, but you do not solve a problem, no matter how popular an issue, by coming up with a solution that does not work. 
   We need to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program in a way that is sensible and thoughtful and workable. And, second, as we do that, we need to put some downward pressure on prescription drug prices. 
   It is not fair, right, or reasonable that the American consumer ought to pay double the price for the same drug, put in the same bottle, manufactured by the same company. That is not fair. The common medications that senior citizens so often need--to treat their heart problems, diabetes, arthritis, and so many other difficulties--have been increasing in cost at a dramatic rate. 
   I am not talking about creating price controls, but we need to do something to put some downward pressure on prices. One thing we should do is pass legislation that I have introduced, along with Senator SNOWE, Senator WELLSTONE and others, that will allow American consumers to have access to these drugs from anywhere in the world, as long as they are FDA-approved with safe manufacturing standards. This legislation, the International Prescription Drug Parity Act, will allow Americans to access these drugs from anywhere in the world at a lower price. 
   If we eliminate the legal obstacles that currently exist and allow pharmacists to purchase these medications from other countries on behalf of their American customers, the pharmaceutical industry will be forced to re-price their drugs in this country. 
   In short, I wanted to come to the floor to make the point that we must put a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program, but we must do it in a way that works. We should not do this just so some will be able to go home to their states and say: We passed prescription drug coverage, didn't we? That might provide some self-satisfaction but it does nothing for the millions of Medicare beneficiaries who need prescription drug coverage. And finally, as we develop this legislation, we need to acknowledge that drug pricing is unfair in this country and do something to put some downward pressure on prescription drug prices.

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   June 26, 1999: 
   Kevin S. Bonner, 28, Chicago, IL; 
   Danny R. Davis, 35, Chicago, IL;

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, here in Washington, DC, administrations come and go, Members of Congress and their staff pass through at an increasing pace. It often seems that many of the people that we know are on their way to someplace else. 
   With all this change, we cherish the points of stability in our lives, and among these are the professional staff members who have been with us for the long haul. These are the people who could have gone elsewhere and earned more money, but they chose to stay and work in public service. They are the silent heroes here in Congress. They keep the process moving; their invisible stamp is upon all our work in public policy. We depend upon them more than we like to say. 
   Lucy Calautti is one of those key staff members who makes things happen here in the United States Senate. 
   Lucy has worked with me for over 25 years, first in my role as an elected State official in our State Capitol in North Dakota, then in the U.S. House of Representatives and now the U.S. Senate. During much of that time she has been my Chief of Staff. 
   Lucy goes about her work with an energy, focus, and high-spirited competence that people who deal with her have come to know well. For me, Lucy has been a treasure. I have had the great luxury of knowing that when I leave the office to travel to North Dakota, the work here will continue to be directed by a real leader. 
   Lucy is a true original. She is practical and idealistic, a patriot and an ardent advocate of women's rights. When she graduated from high school in Queens, New York in the 1960s, she went right into the Navy to serve her country. That was not exactly the most popular thing to do back then. When she left the service she came to North Dakota and enrolled in North Dakota State University to get her Masters degree. 
   I hired Lucy in 1974, and during all of those years she has brought passion and conviction to her work. No problem has been too small or too big. If it concerned the people of North Dakota and our country, then Lucy would tackle it until it got resolved. 
   One of Lucy's passions has been Major League Baseball. For years she and her husband, Kent, have taken a weekend or two in February to catch a part of Spring training in Florida. It's true she has suffered over the years as an ardent New York Mets fan. But for years I have watched the autographed baseballs on her desk form a rising pyramid in their plastic cases. I had a sense where this stack was heading. 
   And now, not surprisingly, Lucy is going to leave my office this week to become the head of Government Relations for Major League Baseball. I am sad, but I am happy, too. America's national pastime is gaining a tireless advocate here in Washington. No one deserves this opportunity more than Lucy, and no one could do a better job. 
   Such passages are common here in Washington, but that does not make them any easier. I just wanted to take a few moments to express my appreciation to Lucy Calautti, on behalf of all the people of my state, for a job well done. We wish her well.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to be offering an amendment to the pending appropriations bill that I want to talk about this morning. 
   I commend the chairman, Senator SPECTER, and the ranking member, Senator HARKIN, for their work to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health. As all of us know, Congress is on track toward doubling the funding for important health research and investigation through the NIH. That is critically important to this country. 
   I am one of those who has been supportive of doubling the funding for the National Institutes of Health. The NIH is trying to unlock the mystery of many of the diseases that ravage the  bodies of people who are suffering from Parkinson's disease, cancer, heart disease, and so many other diseases that afflict the American people and people around the globe. The type of research that is taking place at the National Institutes of Health is exciting and vibrant and paying big dividends. 
   I thought I would mention, as I start, something I saw one day at the NIH called the healing garden. This was an exhibit out at the NIH campus where they had a series of plants growing in this aquarium-like device called the healing garden. I asked the folks at NIH for an explanation, and they told me about it. 
   They said a lot of people think modern medicines, especially the medicines that are developed through research at NIH to respond to the challenges of treating diseases, come from chemicals. But they told me that a lot of medicines come from natural substances we find all over the Earth. They were displaying some of those substances in this healing garden. 
   I want to describe a couple of the things they were displaying because it is interesting. NIH is gathering from around the world 50,000 to 60,000 different species of plants, shrubs, and trees and testing and evaluating what kind of properties they have to heal and treat diseases. 
   The common aspirin comes from the bark of a willow tree. The Chinese knew that a couple of thousand years ago. If they had a headache, they would chew the bark of a willow tree. In modern medicine, aspirin is a chemical modification of that active ingredient derived from willow tree bark. Now aspirin is produced chemically, but the bark of the willow tree was the derivative. 
   The java devil pepper was in the healing garden. Drugs used to treat hypertension, or high blood pressure, which were used formerly as a tranquilizer, come from the java devil pepper. Who would have guessed this connection if not for the research by the scientists who discovered it? 
   Agents that fight tumors, leukemias or lymphomas, come from the plant called the mayapple. 
   The rose periwinkle produces drugs used as anticancer agents primarily in treating Hodgkin's disease and a variety of lymphomas and leukemias. 
   Foxglove is used in the medications digitalis and digitoxin, which are used to treat congestive heart failure and other cardiac disorders. 
   Of course, we all know about aloe, an active ingredient, of course, in skin care preparations. 
   It is interesting that, as funding has increased for studying plants and animals, scientists at the NIH are finding quite remarkable things. Deep in the Amazon rain forest lives a frog that has a deadly toxin on its skin. They believe that from studying the toxin of that frog, they can create a painkiller that is 200 times more powerful than morphine and not addictive. Think of that: 200 times more powerful than morphine and not addictive. 
   There is another frog which is very rare that has a toxin on its skin that is so deadly that a drop of it on the skin of a human being causes the heart to stop. 
   The scientists asked the question: If there is something this powerful that it causes a human heart to stop, can we unleash the power of that toxin to do something positive? 
   That is the kind of evaluation and study that is occurring at the NIH routinely. 
   As we double the funding for the National Institutes of Health, there are all of these wonderful scientists and researchers doing this massive amount of research--research to decode the human genome, research to grow new heart valves around parts of the heart muscle that are clogged, deep brain research to uncover the secrets of Parkinson's disease. 
   As all of this research occurs through the doubling of funding at NIH, we should say thanks to Senator HARKIN and Senator SPECTER for their leadership and commitment over several years to move this Congress to invest in these efforts that are so important to this country's future. 
   Now, let me go from that compliment to talking about how this research is dispersed across this country. There is a trend for how this research funding is allocated throughout the country that is very similar to what happens in other areas of the federal Government's research budget. The research that comes through the billions and billions of dollars that we spend--nearly $20 billion proposed for fiscal year 2001 at the NIH alone --has historically been clustered in a few areas of the country. In most cases, big universities get big grants that make them bigger, and from around those universities, you see the development of businesses springing up from that research. You will see the result of NIH research in a few areas of the country producing very significant opportunities. Then you will see other significant parts of America with almost no research base through the NIH. 
   Should research be done where it is done best? Yes, of course. But the largest universities in this country, in a handful of States, get most of the research dollars in part because the grants are peer reviewed by people from the same institutions that get the grants in the first place. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
   The chart I have here shows the way NIH funding is currently distribution across the country. If you look at the States in this country shown in the white shaded areas--mostly in the middle of the country--you will see that these States get very little funding for medical research. 
   The States shown in the blue and red areas--California, Texas, New York, Massachusetts, and so on--are the States that get most of the research grants. 
   This pie graph here shows what happens as a result of this imbalance. As you can see, three States get 35 percent of all of the medical research funds provided by the NIH. Institutions in three States get over a third of all the Federal dollars on medical research. In fact, one state alone received 15 percent of total NIH funds. 
   This little white slice shown on the chart represents 21 States that share only 3 percent of the research. 
   Why does that matter? If you live in one of these States, and you have Parkinson's disease, or you have breast cancer, or you have any one of a number of very serious health problems, and you want to participate in the cutting-edge medical research conducted by the NIH through one of its grantees, you may well have to travel hundreds and hundreds or perhaps thousands of miles to avail yourself of the clinical trials. 
   Second, there are wonderful institutions in the middle part of America that have the capability to provide unique and beneficial research on a range of issues ranging from cancer, to heart disease, to diabetes, and more through the funds we are providing at NIH. But they do not get the opportunity because the system is stacked against them. 
   At the NIH, we have a program called IDeA, or the Institutional Development Award program, that is intended to rectify this geographical inequity by helping historically under funded states to build their medical research capacity. IDeA is very similar to the EPSCoR program that exists in other federal agencies. 
   This program is under funded at NIH. The IDeA program is funded at the level of $100 million in the House-passed bill, which I think is too low. But it is funded at only $60 million here. That is an increase from $40 million to $60 million, and for that, I appreciate the efforts of Senators SPECTER and. But we ought to at least meet the House level. And we ought to do even more. 
   My amendment will take our proposed funding to the level of $100 million in the House bill. Through this amendment, we will simply say that we want to encourage the distribution of research across this country to all of the centers of genius--no matter where they are--that exist. 
   In States such as North Dakota, Iowa, South Dakota, and up and down the farm belt, we are losing a lot of population. This map shows that. All these red blotches on this map indicate counties that have lost more than 10 percent of their population. 
   What you see is that the middle part of our country is being systematically depopulated. Why has that happened? Why, when you have so many people living on top of each other in apartment buildings in big cities and fighting through traffic jams just to get to and from work each day, is the middle part of our country being depopulated?  
   At least part of the answer to that question relates back to what we do at the Federal level. We say that $20 billion will be made available through the National Institutes of Health to form centers of excellence for scientific research in medicine. We move that money to specific areas of the country where there is already a significant population, and from that springs economic opportunity and biotechnology companies and new jobs. We simply exacerbate all of these problems with the way we spend our money at the Federal Government. 
   There are centers of genius in the middle part of this country, in Minnesota and North Dakota and South Dakota and Kansas and Oklahoma. There are small centers of excellence that could do wonderful scientific research, but they do not get the funding. Why? Because the biggest States get all the money. Three States get a third of all the money through the NIH. 
   I am not suggesting that anything illegal is going on. It is just that we have a system that perpetuates itself and creates a circumstance where three States get fully one-third of the billions of dollars we provide for medical research and 21 other States are left to share 3 percent of the medical research. And that predicts and predetermines where the centers of excellence will be in the future. 
   It also, in my judgment, is unfair to all of those folks who live so far away from the biggest centers, where most of the money is moving to, because it is not going to be very easy for them to be involved in clinical trials for such things as their breast cancer, their lymphoma. They are going to have difficulty getting cutting-edge medical therapies. 
   That ought not be the case. I want to change that. I am hoping, with the cooperation of Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN, and with a new determination in the House and the Senate, that we can come to an understanding that, as we double the funding for the NIH, we can also do much better for this program at NIH called IDeA. Again, this program lets us reach out and find ways to use NIH funding all across this country, to get the best of what everyone in this country has to offer, to find all the centers of excellence that exist everywhere, and have them come to bear on research and inquiry. I am convinced that this represents our best chance to try to find ways to cure some of these diseases that ravage people who live in this country and the rest of the world. 
   We are making a lot of progress. With this amendment, I do not mean in any way to suggest we are not making great strides. Doubling the NIH budget is a terrific thing to do. It will produce enormous rewards for all who live in this country and those who will come after us. But it is also the case that we must do better in the distribution of this research money if we are going to be able to have access to all the best minds this country has to offer. That is the purpose of my amendment. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania is alluding to the analogy of the legislative process being akin to the making of sausage. Often, neither are a pretty process, so it is better, perhaps, to speak less of it. I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania that I am more concerned about the destination than I am about the route by which we get there. 
   He has indicated that he supports the $100 million level in the House bill for the IDeA program. Senator HARKIN has indicated the same. For that reason, I will not proceed with my amendment, with the understanding that their intention will be to reach that level in conference. 
   My sense is that we are making a lot of progress. Before the Senator was in the Chamber a few moments ago, I said he and Senator HARKIN will have the undying gratitude of the American people for their persistence and relentless work to increase funding at NIH. This is very important, not just for people who live here now but for generations to come. 
   My concern, as we do that, is to make sure we get the full genius of all the American people working on these scientific inquiries into treating and curing these ravaging diseases. I want more funding in the IDeA program so that smaller States have the opportunity to access these grants and we can put to work their scientists and their medical schools and their communities to meet our nation's medical research goals. 
   I appreciate my colleague's response. 
   I will not ask for a vote on my amendment. What I will do is ask that we handle it in conference, as the Senator has suggested.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, earlier this morning a Member of the Senate described the circumstances on the floor of the Senate yesterday with respect to a vote on the issue of a prescription drug benefit for Medicare. Yes, there was a vote on that issue. I want to describe why that motion was offered and the importance of it. 
   I also want to say that, while I certainly have the greatest respect for my colleague, this was not a circumstance where the minority leader or anyone else intended to surprise anybody. When the minority leader or any other  Senator is pursuing an agenda he believes is important for our country, he does not go desk to desk in the Chamber asking permission from anyone else to offer an amendment. That is not the way the Senate works, of course. 
   The minority leader believes very strongly, as does almost every single member of this caucus, and perhaps some others in the Senate, that we need to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. Life-saving miracle drugs can only perform miracles for those who can afford them. Senior citizens all too often are choosing between groceries and the prescription drugs they need. If we were to create the Medicare program today, unquestionably we would have a prescription drug benefit in that plan. 
   We have been very relentless in saying we believe we must add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program and we should do it in this Congress. We cannot and will not apologize for being relentless in that pursuit. We have had very few opportunities on the floor of this Senate to pursue our agenda. Yesterday was one of them. 
   If, at the end of the day, we get a bipartisan agreement to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program, then we will be rewarded for our success by the senior citizens in this country who will be able to have access to the prescription drugs they need. If, at the end of the day, we do that, I guarantee that it will only be because, for the last couple of years, we have been relentless on the floor of the Senate and in the House, saying this Congress must do this. 
   We have had others who say, yes, we agree about the need for a prescription drug benefit, but we want to have the private insurance companies write a plan, and so on and so forth. The fact is that the private insurance companies have said publicly, and they have come to my office and said repeatedly, ``We will not write a plan; we cannot write a plan.'' It is not within the range of financial possibilities for us to do what the majority party is proposing. In fact, one company official said, ``We will write a plan that has $1,000 in benefits, and we would have to charge $1,200 in premiums for the plan to cover the administrative and other costs of the benefit.'' That is the same as having no plan, the same as doing nothing in terms of adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare. 
   Our goal is to find a way to solve this problem in this Congress. This Congress, with all due respect, on some of the big issues, has been a Congress of underachievers. We can do a lot better than this. We can add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. We can pass a campaign finance reform bill. We can pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. We can pass an education bill that reduces class size and helps rebuild and renovate some of our nation's dilapidated schools. We can do these things if we put our 
   minds to it. But somehow there is this notion by at least those who control the agenda that what we need to do is tuck in our wings and get out of town and do as little as possible. 
   I don't want to belong to a Congress of underachievers. I want our Congress to do the things we ought to be doing together. Yes, a prescription drugs benefit in Medicare is one of those items. We cannot apologize for what we did yesterday. We must, at every opportunity, continue to push and coax and pull those in the Chamber who don't really want to do this to join us and fix what is wrong with respect to this Medicare program. 
   What is wrong, in part, is that it doesn't have coverage for prescription drugs, and there are a lot of senior citizens who are prescribed medications that will allow them to live longer and healthier lives, and they discover they can't afford them. 
   A woman in Dickinson, ND, who had breast cancer was told by her doctor that in order to reduce the chances of a recurrence of her breast cancer, she must take this prescription medicine. This woman, who was on Medicare and had a small fixed income, said, ``Doctor, there isn't any way I can afford that medicine. There is no way. I am just going to have to take my chances.'' This situation faces too many senior citizens who need prescription medicine and find that they cannot afford it. That is why we must put a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program. 
   Let's do something at the same time that puts some downward pressure on drug prices. Prices have risen too fast and too far on prescription drugs. 
   I just want to say that no one crossed any lines by not going to every desk in the Chamber about that motion yesterday. We are going to keep trying until we get enough votes in the Senate to add a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare plan. It is for a good reason. This country needs that sort of policy in place right now. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Internet and E-commerce are to continue to grow and flourish then Congress must address the difficult tax issues that these have posed. To that end, Senator VOINOVICH and I, along with Senators GRAHAM, ENZI, BREAUX and six of our distinguished colleagues are introducing the Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act. 
   First and foremost, this legislation extends for four additional years the existing moratorium on punitive and discriminatory Internet taxes, and on access taxes. Internet technology is becoming a real growth engine for our economy. Governments should not be allowed to impose new taxes on access, or to enact discriminatory tax plans that would apply to the Internet and E-commerce but not to other kinds of transactions. I believe that such policies could foolishly hurt the future growth of the Internet industry, and this legislation prevents that from happening anytime soon. 
   At the same time, however, this legislation moves toward a solution to the growing web of tax compliance problems that faces virtually everyone who would do business across state lines --sellers and customers alike. Our approach also would help to create a climate in which Web-based firms and Main Street businesses can co-exist and compete on fair and even terms. 
   Any new form of commerce presents a challenge to the rules and structures that have grown up around the old. The Internet is no exception. The Internet has raised vexing questions regarding both privacy and the protection of property rights in writing and music. It has raised similar questions regarding the revenue systems of the states and localities of this nation. Not surprisingly, the Internet simply does not fit neatly into these systems as they have evolved over the last two hundred years. 
   This disconnect has created tensions on all sides. On one side are the vital new businesses--Internet service providers, Web-based businesses and the rest--worried that they will be singled out as cash cows and subjected to new and unfair taxes. On the other side are state and local governments worried about the erosion of their tax bases and their ability to pay for the schools, police, garbage collection and more that their taxpayers need and expect. In between are Main Street merchants who collect sales taxes from their customers and worry about unfair competition from Web-based business that avoid collecting these taxes. Let us not forget the citizens and taxpayers, who appreciate the convenience and opportunities of the Web but who also care about their Main Street merchants, and about their schools and other local services. 
   All of these concerns are valid. There are no bad guys in the drama. Rather, it is the kind of conflict that a new technology inevitably poses. The automobile required the reform of traffic-control rules designed for the horse-and-buggy era. So today the rise of E-commerce requires an update of tax compliance rules designed primarily for local commerce. Our job in Congress is not to point fingers but rather to try to address the problem in a fair and constructive way. 
   The solution must begin by putting the worries of Web-based entrepreneurs to rest. They should not be concerned about new and discriminatory tax burdens, and they should not be singled out as cash cows. Congress should make this clear. We have enacted a moratorium to prohibit state and local governments from enacting tax plans that discriminate against the E-commerce or impose a levy on Internet access. This existing moratorium is set to expire next year. We should extend that moratorium to December 2005. That will help clear the air and also make possible the development of a real solution for the sales and use tax compliance problems now facing many businesses and and their customers. 
   The solution begins with a recognition of the problem. Collecting a sales tax in a face-to-face transaction on Main Street or at the mall is a relatively simple process. The seller collects the tax and remits it to the state or local government. But with remote sales--such as catalog and Internet sales--it's more difficult. States can not require a seller to collect a sales tax unless the business has an actual location or sales people in the state. So most states, and many localities, have laws that require the local buyer to send an equivalent ``use tax'' to the state or local government when he or she did not pay taxes at the time of purchase. 
   The reality, of course, is that customers almost never do that. It would be a major inconvenience, and people are not accustomed to paying sales taxes in that way. So, despite the requirement in the law, most simply don't do it. This tax, which is already owed, is not paid. For years, state and local governments could accept this loss because catalog sales were a relatively minor portion of overall commerce. The Internet, however, will change that. 
   Internet and catalog sellers argue that collecting sales taxes would be a significant burden for them. They contend that they would have to comply with tax laws from thousands of different jurisdictions--46 states and thousands of local governments have sales taxes. They would have to deal with many different tax rates and all of the idiosyncracies regarding what is taxable and what is non-taxable. They have a point. 
   However, there are some remote sellers who know they enjoy an advantage over Main Street businesses and simply do not want to lose it. They can sell a product without collecting the tax, whereas Main Street businesses must collect the local sales tax. Main Street businesses claim that is unfair, and they have a point, too. 
   As I said, all sides in this debate have valid points, and that is the premise of the bill we introduce today. There are three basic principles underlying the Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act. First, we believe that this new Internet technology is becoming a real growth engine for our economy. Governments should not impose access or discriminatory taxes that might jeopardize its growth. That's why the legislation we are introducing extends the current moratorium on Internet access and multiple and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce for over four additional years. 
   Second, state and local governments should be encouraged to simplify their sales tax systems as they apply to remote sellers. And third, once States have done this, then it is only fair that remote sellers do their part and collect any use tax that is owed, just as local merchants collect sales taxes. This simple step would free the consumer from the burden of having to report such taxes individually. It would level the playing field for local retailers and others that already collect and remit such taxes, and it would protect the ability of state and local governments to provide necessary services for their residents in the future. 
   Specifically, the Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act would do the following: 
   Extend the existing moratorium on Internet access, multiple and discriminatory taxes through December 31, 2005. 
   Put Congress on record as urging States and localities to develop a streamlined sales and use tax system with the advice of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. Among other things, such a system would include a single, blended tax rate with which all remote sellers could comply. It should also include within each state a uniform tax base on which remote sellers apply the tax, as well as a uniform list of exempt items. 
   Authorize States to enter into an Interstate Sales and Use Tax Compact through which member States would adopt the streamlined sales and use tax system. Congressional authority and consent to enter into such a Compact would expire if it has not occurred by January 1, 2006. 
   Authorize adopting States to require remote sellers with more than $5 million in annual gross sales to collect and remit sales and use taxes on remote sales, once twenty States have adopted such Compact, unless Congress has acted to disapprove the Compact by law within a period of 120 days after the Congress receives it. 
   Prohibit states that have not adopted the simplified sales and use tax system from gaining benefit from the authority extended in the bill to require sellers to collect and remit sales and use taxes on remote sales. 
   In my view, it would be a mistake for Congress to adopt a lengthy extension of the current Internet tax moratorium without addressing the underlying problem. If we don't, then the growth of the Internet, which should be a benefit to Americans, will instead mean a major erosion of funds available to build and maintain schools and roads, finance police departments and garbage collection, and all the other services that citizens in this country want and need. One study suggests that states and local governments soon could be losing more than $20 billion annually if the Internet industry continues its rapid growth, and if sales and use tax collection rules are left unchanged. 
   The competitive crisis facing local retailers is also growing more urgent. Testimony at a recent congressional hearing makes that clear: A representative of Wal-Mart testified recently that that company is incorporating a separate business to put Wal-Mart on the Internet. It will do so in a manner that will enable them to avoid sales and use taxes. The reason? Even though Wal-Mart has locations in every state and therefore would be required to collect such taxes on Internet sales, it recognizes that other large competitors will be making those sales tax-free. The company regards such avoidance as a matter of necessity to remain competitive. 
   This scenario will play out over and over again. The large retailers like Wal-Mart will survive; the small Main Street businesses will struggle. And, there will be a massive loss of revenues to fund schools and other basic services. 
   Mr. President, this is an important issue that Congress must address now. We believe that this legislation strikes a balance between the interests of the Internet industry, state and local governments, local retailers and remote sellers. It is workable and fair. 
   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this much-needed bipartisan legislation.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by Senator DODD from Connecticut. Fidel Castro has no supporters in the Senate. I deplore the miserable human rights record of the Government of Cuba and the lack of freedom that is accorded the folks who live in Cuba. I deplore the conditions that have persuaded and forced so many people to leave Cuba. So there is no support for the Castro regime in the Senate. That is not the issue.  
   The issue is an amendment that is a small step in the right direction to create a commission that will evaluate a series of things with respect to this country's policy about Cuba. 
   The commission will look for the development of a national consensus. I say to my colleague from Connecticut, I frankly think a consensus pretty much exists, not necessarily in this Chamber, but most of the American people believe that after 40 years of an embargo against the country of Cuba--40 years of an embargo that has not accomplished anything in terms of dislodging the Communist government in Cuba--the embargo has failed, and that there might be an alternative that can be used to find a way to bring freedom to that island. 
   Pope John Paul had some comments about these issues. I have been talking on the floor about the issue of continuing sanctions with respect to the shipment of food and medicine to Cuba. Just food and medicine, and that runs into great controversy. 
   This is what Pope John Paul had to say:  
   Sanctions ..... ``strike the population indiscriminately, making it ever more difficult for the weakest to enjoy the bare essentials of decent living--things such as food, health, and education.''  
   Everyone in this Chamber knows in their hearts that when we take aim at a dictator, we hit poor people, we hit sick people, and we hit hungry people. That is the absurdity of having food and medicine as part of the sanctions. 
   Today in the Washington Times--and other newspapers--it says: ``White House ends embargo on trade with North Korea.'' We have decided we are going to trade with North Korea and not have an embargo or sanctions with respect to North Korea. We have debated in this Chamber permanent normal trade relations with China. China is a Communist country. North Korea is a Communist country. Cuba is a Communist country. Yet we have those who say we must maintain the embargo with respect to Cuba. 
   That is not what this amendment is about. This amendment is about a very modest step in the right direction to study a series of options with respect to policies this country has on the subject of Cuba. 
   I have been to Cuba. I have talked to dissidents in Cuba. Frankly, you will run into dissidents, the harshest critics of the Cuban Government, who will say: Fidel Castro uses current U.S. policy as an excuse for the collapse of the Cuban economy. If you say to Fidel Castro: Look around you, this economy has collapsed--he says: Yes, yes, of course it has collapsed. The American fist around the neck of the Cuban economy for 40 years, of course, is what caused that collapse. 
   Current policy with respect to Cuba is the most convenient excuse Fidel Castro has for a collapsed economy and for a government that does not work. He continues to use it year after year. I happen to think, as some dissidents do, that a much different strategy with respect to Cuba would probably very quickly hasten the exit of Fidel Castro from the scene. 
   I want to add another point. While we are, as a country, beginning to think more clearly about this subject of whether or not we should continue sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine--and we will remove those sanctions with respect to 
   North Korea and many other countries--we have people rigidly insisting: No, we must maintain all of these sanctions with respect to Cuba. I ask them--aside from just the immorality of that policy, and I think it is basically immoral to use food as a weapon--I ask them to address family farmers. 
   I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask them to address, for example, farmers in America, and explain to them why the Canadian farmers will sell to Cuba, why the European farmers will sell to Cuba, why the Venezuelan farmers will sell to Cuba, but American farmers who see their prices collapse are told: No, these markets, including Cuba, are off limits to you; we have sanctions. We want to penalize those governments, and included in those penalties is a desire to say we will not allow food and medicine to move to those countries. 
   I hasten to say I have no difficulty at all and fully support the proposition that our country should impose economic sanctions on countries that behave outside the international norm, but those sanctions should never, in my judgment, include food and medicine. That is, in my judgment, an immoral policy. The proposition offered by the Senator from Connecticut today is just the first modest step in beginning a national discussion about whether 40 years of failure with the current embargo ought to be continued, or whether there ought to be some new evaluation of new strategies dealing with Cuba. It is very simple.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I commend the leadership of the Appropriations Committee, and particularly subcommittee Chairman SHELBY and Senator LAUTENBERG for their work on the Transportation appropriations bill that the Senate passed yesterday. However, I am gravely concerned about the omission of an item included in the President's budget request for Three Affiliated Tribes on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota. The President included $5 million for the design and preliminary engineering of the Four Bears Bridge on Fort Berthold Reservation. This bill makes no reference to this funding request. I am concerned that this will provide the federal government with yet another excuse for not replacing a bridge that is clearly its responsibility to replace. 
   This bridge, originally constructed in 1934 on another part of the reservation, was erected at its current site by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1952 during construction of the Garrison Dam. Because the Garrison Dam project created a permanent flood in the form of Lake Sakakawea on the Fort Berthold Reservation, the bridge became necessary to connect the west and the east sides of the Reservation. 
   Mr. President, Senator CAMPBELL, chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, shares my concerns that the Four Bears Bridge was not included in the bill as requested by the Administration. The reason that this bridge is necessary is because the federal government created a lake bisecting the Reservation. Now there's a situation on Fort Berthold where emergency vehicles, school buses, police and general local traffic are forced to cross a bridge that is only 22 feet wide. This kind of a bridge was built for the small cars of the 1930s--not for the large vehicles common today. It is also important to note that this bridge is one of the few crossing points along the Missouri River in North Dakota, making it a vital connection for all traffic--including large truck traffic--moving across the state.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, while we are waiting for the managers of the Defense authorization bill to continue--I understand they are trying to work out some arrangements on the bill itself--I wanted to make a couple of comments about an issue I intend to raise as an amendment on the Defense authorization bill. At the risk of being repetitious, which I think is probably advantageous in this Chamber, I want to speak again about the issue of using sanctions that are now being employed by the United States of America on the sale or shipment of food and medicine to other countries. Those sanctions are wrong. We ought not use sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine to other countries. Yet we are, so far, unable to repeal sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine. 
   We almost got it repealed last year. Seventy Senators voted to repeal the use of sanctions by the United States on the shipment of food and medicine to other countries--70 Senators voted for that--but we went into a conference and we were hijacked, literally legislatively hijacked by the Members of the House. So we still have sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine to many parts of the world. 
   I also have included this year in the Agriculture appropriations bill, a repeal of the use of sanctions for food and medicine shipments. That appropriations bill will come to the floor of the Senate at some point. But I understand, procedurally, the legislative leaders can hijack it once again with a number of parliamentary approaches. I may very well be in a situation where I, Senator GORTON, who cosponsored the bill in the Appropriations Committee, Senator ASHCROFT, and others, would have a wide majority of Senators and Representatives who believe the sanctions that exist on the shipment of food and medicine to other countries in the world should be repealed. But despite the fact we perhaps have 60, 70, or 80 percent of the entire Congress who believe that, we have been unable to get it done. For that reason, I intend to offer it as an amendment on the Defense authorization bill. 
   Let me describe just a bit what this issue is. First of all, this is very unfair to America's family farmers. I represent a farm State. Our family farmers are told you should have the freedom to farm. That is the title of the farm bill we have--Freedom to Farm. That all sounds good except farmers don't have the freedom to sell. Our farmers raise grain and they can't sell it in Cuba, they by and large haven't been able to sell it in Iran, they can't sell it in Libya, Iraq, Sudan, North Korea--why? Because we believe these countries are operating outside the international norms. We don't like these countries. We don't like what Cuba does. We don't like the behavior of Libya or Iraq or North Korea. So we say we are going to have a set of sanctions to penalize these countries--economic sanctions. That is fine with me. I am all for creating economic sanctions to try to hurt Saddam Hussein. 
   But I would say this: Everybody in this Chamber knows when you take  aim at a dictator by imposing sanctions on food and medicine, you aim at the dictator and you hurt hungry people; you aim at a dictator and you hurt sick people; you aim at a dictator and you hurt poor people. It is true in every one of these countries. Sanctions are fine, but we ought never include sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine. 
   This country needs to understand that and learn that. The legislation I have introduced with my colleagues, Senator GORTON from the State of Washington, Senator ASHCROFT, Senator DODD, and others, is very simple. It says all current sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine shall be abolished within 180 days--gone. This country will not use food and medicine as a weapon. 
   Second, no President will be able to impose sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine unless he comes to the Congress and gets an affirmative vote by the Congress to do so. In other words, 
   this ends the sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine.

   Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Virginia, of course, has been involved in this issue. I certainly agree the embargo has not worked. I mean, 40 years of embargo with respect to Cuba, speaking only now of Cuba, ought to tell us that when a policy doesn't work, you should change the policy--especially that portion of the policy that deals with food and medicine. It is immoral, in my judgment, for this country to use food as a weapon. It is not only unfair to our farmers--I have talked about that at some length-- It is unfair to say to farmers we have the freedom to farm but not the freedom to sell. But it is immoral for this country to use food as a weapon. I want to change it. 
   The Senator from Virginia described the support for this. I don't know if he heard me say I intend to offer it as an amendment on the Defense authorization bill. That will not be deemed a great pleasure by the Senator from Virginia, I am sure, but the only opportunity I have to get this done is to put it in legislation that is going to go to the President. 
   The legislative leaders have the opportunity in the appropriations process to strip this from the appropriations bill. They did it last year and they are going to do it this year. This year I am not going to sit back and say: That's fine; we do all this work and we get rid of the food and medicine sanctions in appropriations, only to have you hijack it in conference or with some parliamentary procedure, and at the end of the day this country still prevents the sale of food and medicine to the poor people in Cuba and Iraq and Libya. That is not something I am willing to accept. It is not going to happen anymore. 
   I mentioned previously I sat in a hospital in Havana, Cuba, last year when I visited Havana--sat in a hospital in an intensive care room and watched a 12-year-old boy in a coma. His mother, at a bedside vigil, was holding this boy's hand--and in an intensive care room--there was no beeping going on because there was no machinery or equipment there. This hospital had no equipment for a young boy in a coma in intensive care. The doctor at that hospital said, ``We are out of 250 different kinds of medicine; we don't have it. We are just out of it.'' 
   And our country says we cannot move medicine to Cuba? We cannot sell medicine to Cuba? We can't sell food to Cuba? It doesn't make any sense to me. 
   I have been to many of the poor countries around the world. I do not want to be a part of a government that says we want to continue to use food as a weapon; we want to continue to use food and medicine as weapons. That is fundamentally wrong. It is a wrongheaded public policy. 
   Again, I say to the Senator from Virginia, I do not think he heard me. He has been a strong supporter of these issues. I have great respect for him. He will not be pleased that I intend to offer this as an amendment to the Defense authorization bill at some point. I feel I must do that because it is the only way we will get it done. The legislative leaders intend to strip this out of the appropriations process. The only opportunity for the Members of the House and Senate to express their will is to put this in a bill that is going to be signed by the President. 
   Do I understand the managers wish to do some business?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I agree with the comments that were made, and I know the desire is to move the Defense authorization bill forward with some dispatch. I indicated previously that I intend to offer an amendment dealing with sanctions on food and medicine. There are national security issues which have compelled us to impose sanctions, which include food and medicine, on countries. 
   We have debated this at great length. We had 70 votes for this policy last year in the Senate. Seventy percent of the Senate said they want to strip out food and medicine sanctions. We also have this in our appropriations bill, but I understand the legislative leadership is going to strip it out, and they have the capability from a parliamentary standpoint to do that. 
   The only option for those of us who want to get this policy done is to put it in a bill that is amendable, like this bill. It is my intention to offer an amendment. I will accept a short time limit when I do so. It is not my intention to hold things up. This has been debated at great length, and 70 percent of the Senators said we want to end sanctions on food and medicine with respect to sanctions that exist around the world.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand that. The two managers, Senator WARNER and Senator LEVIN, are doing a remarkable job of trying to move this legislation forward. It is not my intent to cause difficulties, but I do not want one or two Senators holding up the will of 70 percent of the Senate, saying this country ought not use food and medicine in sanctions anymore. 
   If I were assured by somebody that the efforts we have underway--Senator ASHCROFT, myself, Senator GORTON, Senator DODD, and others--to strike these sanctions of food and medicine in other pieces of legislation that are coming to the floor were somehow protected, that would be one thing. It is quite clear to me, and the leadership said to me publicly: We intend to dump them; it does not matter how many people support it, we intend to dump them, get rid of them. 
   The only opportunity I have is to force my way into this bill. If we have an up-or-down vote on this, 70 percent of the Senate and 70 percent of the House says this country will never use sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine, which is wrong, and the only chance I have to do that is on a piece of legislation such as this. 
   As my colleague knows, we seldom have a piece of legislation on the floor that is open for amendment. This one is. I give the Senator my assurance that we do not need long debate on this at all. We can debate this in a very short order because we had extensive debate last year. Seventy Senators said let us not any longer use food and medicine on sanctions.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might continue, let me again speak of my admiration for the two managers. This isn't a case, however, of being either encouraged nor discouraged with respect to amendments. It is about the rules of the Senate. And I know the rules. I have the right to offer the amendment, and I will do that, but I will do that with consideration to the two managers, understanding that they have a job to do to try to get this bill out. So I will do it in a manner that says, let's have a reasonable time agreement. 
   But this is about national security. The reason we have imposed sanctions on other countries is because we have national security interests about the behavior of these countries. And if, in the interest of national security, we have said this country shall continue to impose sanctions on the shipments of food and medicine, then I say this country is wrong, and we must change the law. 
   We had been close to changing the law last year but failed, because there are only a few people--a handful of people; determined people--in the Congress who insist that they want to continue using food and medicine as a weapon. 
   The absurdity of it, of course, is that Saddam Hussein has never missed a meal. Does anybody think Saddam Hussein has ever missed breakfast because we are not able to send much food to Iraq? Does anybody think that Fidel Castro has missed dinner because we have imposed sanctions on the shipment of food to Cuba? If either of them take medication, do you think they miss their daily dose of medication because we have sanctions? Of course they have not missed either dinner or medication. Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro do just fine, thank you. 
   It is hungry people, sick people, and poor people who live in their countries who are injured by this. It is not the best of America to say we want to include sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine to other parts of the world because we are concerned about the behavior of their leaders. That is not the best of what America has to offer. 
   There are a couple of reasons I have to describe this issue in such repetitive terms. One is, I represent a farm State. Our family farmers say all the time: You tell us to go operate in the open market, to produce our grain and then go sell it in the open market. We have these folks who created this farm program called Freedom to Farm, but some of them have forgotten there also ought to be a freedom to sell. What about the ability to sell that grain to these countries? 
   There are $7.7 billion in agricultural sales--nearly 11 percent of all the wheat purchases in the world--by the countries with which we have sanctions. So we say to farmers: You have the freedom to farm, but you do not have the freedom to sell. You cannot move your wheat to Cuba. We will let Cuba buy its wheat from other countries--from Europe, from Canada, from Argentina. They all sell, but the United States will not. 
   Farmers have the legitimate right to ask the question: Why? Why would you do this to family farmers? Why would you penalize family farmers by making so much of the world's wheat market and so much of the world's grain market off limits to family farmers? 
   This chart shows a list of farm groups that support lifting the sanctions on food and medicine. It is a list that includes virtually all of them. I do not know of any farm group that thinks this policy is smart, thoughtful, or reasonable. Every farm organization in the country representing family farmers believes we ought to discontinue using food as a weapon. 
   What about medicine? Dr. Patricia Dawson, a breast surgeon from Seattle, WA, Providence Hospital, says:  
   The embargo appears to have a disproportionate impact on women and children by limiting access to new medications and technology. 
   In every one of these countries with which we have sanctions, I bet you will find a disproportionate impact on women and children. If anyone has the time, go talk to Congressman TONY HALL who went to North Korea and came back and made the report about hunger and malnutrition in North Korea. See what is going on in that country. Then ask yourself: Does it make any sense at all for this country to withhold food shipments to North Korea, or anywhere for that matter? The answer is a resounding no, of course not. 
   As I indicated when I started, there are two reasons for me to believe so strongly about this. One, this country has developed a policy that is wrong at its core. It is wrong for America. It is wrong for our family farmers. It is morally wrong, in my judgment, for a country that is the breadbasket of the world and produces such a prodigious amount of food to be telling other countries that, by the way, we will use our food in a punitive way if you do not behave. Mr. or Mrs. Leader of Another Country, we will decide that food is off limits to those who want to purchase commodities for your country. 
   What on Earth could provoke a country such as ours to believe that is a smart, sensible, or reasonable policy? It is not reasonable. It is not moral. 
   From a more selfish standpoint, I would say it is not fair to our family farmers. This morning someplace in my home State of North Dakota there is a family farmer who is driving a load of grain to a country elevator someplace. When that farmer gets to the country elevator, that farmer is going to be told that the food he produced--starting in the spring, gassing up the tractor, plowing a straight furrow, planting some seeds, and hoping and praying that seed is going to grow; and when it grows, finally being able to come out with a combine and harvesting the crop, and putting it in the bin, and then putting it in the truck, and then the elevator--that farmer is going to be told at the elevator that the food he produced from the work he did has no value; that food is food that does not have much value for the world at all. 
   So the price is collapsed. And the farmer scratches his or her head and says: I don't understand that. We have more than half a billion people going to bed with an ache in their belly because they didn't have enough to eat yesterday. Every single minute, up to eight children, die--every single minute--because of the winds of hunger around the world. Yet our farmers are told somehow their food does not have value, and those poor people who live in these countries--Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Iraq--are told American food, by the way, is off limits to you because we do not like the way your leaders behave. 
   So you poor folks in those unfortunate countries, you can't do much to kick Saddam Hussein out of Iraq, but we can prevent you from having access to American food. You can't even buy it.  
   That is just wrongheaded public policy. I intend to change it. As I indicated, Senator GORTON from Washington cosponsored the amendment I offered on the Agriculture appropriations bill. Senator ASHCROFT offered a nearly identical amendment on the floor of the Senate last year. The Senate will be dealing with this. 
   Finally, as I conclude, I say to those Senate leaders who believe they are going to be able to strip it out of the legislation this year, strip it out of the appropriations bill where I added it to the Agriculture appropriations bill, I am not going to let you do that. You might have the capability of stripping it out of that bill. I have the capability and the right on the floor of the Senate to add it to this bill. 
   Some say they don't want to do it because it does not pertain just to defense. It pertains to national security. I have a right under the rules to add it. I have to get a vote on it, but I have every right to offer it as an amendment. I intend to offer it. I will accept a short time agreement, but I intend that this Congress, with a wide majority of Senators and Representatives, 
   will support this. I intend that this Congress will not be hijacked by a handful of legislative leaders who are trying to protect a dinosaur of a policy that represents the worst of America--the use of food and medicine as a weapon in economic sanctions. 
   So if we have not gotten a decade past that mentality then something is fundamentally wrong with this country. This country should stand up for its family farmers, first, to say that you have the freedom to sell; and, second, it ought to stand up as a world leader to say that we will not use food as a weapon. Poor people around the world, people who live in countries that need our food, have the right to buy it, have the right to expect it, and have the right to have access to it under a range of programs. This country should no longer penalize those poor people and those hungry people. 
   I came to the floor as I saw there was a morning business opportunity just to say to the two managers--I like them, they are good friends; and they will grit their teeth and wring their hands and mop their brows--but I intend to offer this amendment. I have a right to do so. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is my intention, just for purposes of understanding, to speak on this amendment for a few minutes. I understand that some will raise rule XVI on this issue. This is an important issue, and I want to have the opportunity, in this context, to discuss this legislation. 
   This amendment is in the form of a bill that I have introduced with my colleagues, Senators ASHCROFT, GRAMS,  LEAHY, and others. A bipartisan group of Senators introduced a bill dealing with the interstate transportation of violent criminals around this country. 
   I want to describe why I think this is important. I have spoken about this on the floor several times in the past. 
   I show you a picture of a man named Kyle Bell. Kyle Bell is shown standing in this picture in shackles and handcuffs. He is a man who murdered an 11-year-old girl in Fargo, ND. But that was not all of his crime spree. He has committed other unspeakable acts, criminal acts. His criminal behavior culminated in the murder of a young girl named Jeanna North in Fargo, ND. 
   Kyle Bell was apprehended, sent to trial, and convicted of murder. When convicted of murder in the State of North Dakota, Kyle Bell was to go to the penitentiary to spend the rest of his life. But instead, Kyle Bell was put on a bus that was operated by a private company called TransCor. TransCor is a pretty good size company that hauls prisoners around America by contract. TransCor put Kyle Bell on a bus with about 12 other prisoners. He was being transported, under the Prisoner Exchange Program, to another prison in another State to be incarcerated. 
   They got to New Mexico. In fact, he was not going south, he was going straight west, over to the State of Oregon. But they got to New Mexico, and this Kyle Bell escaped. 
   The bus stopped for gas, apparently. One security guard from this private company was buying gas. Another two were asleep in the bus. And another was probably in buying a cheeseburger, as best we can tell. And so with both guards in the bus asleep--Kyle Bell apparently produced a key for his shackles and handcuffs, crawled out the roof of the bus, and while he was in civilian clothing being transferred in this bus, walked through the parking lot of a big shopping center, and they didn't see him again. 
   Kyle Bell, this child killer, was on the loose for several months. He has now been apprehended and he is back in prison. But I started evaluating what happened. It sounds as if the three stooges were given custody of a convicted child killer: two guards asleep, another guard buying a cheeseburger. What happened here? The more I look at it, the more I understand that there is something fundamentally wrong on our highways. 
   Do you know we have private companies taking possession of violent offenders, murderers, and others, to transport around the country, and there is not one regulation they must meet in order to hire themselves out as transport companies? You can be a retired county sheriff, and you and your brother-in-law and your wife can rent a minivan and say you are in business to haul prisoners, someone will turn a convicted murderer over to you, and away you go. 
   Interestingly enough, when they were transporting Kyle Bell, this child killer--he escaped in New Mexico--do you know how long it took them to understand he was gone, that he was not on the bus anymore? Nine hours later they finally counted their prisoners on the bus, to discover they had lost a child killer--9 hours later. 
   We have a circumstance in this country where when you pull up to the gas pumps next to a minivan or a small bus, you may not know it but you may be pulling up next to a minivan with four convicted murderers being transported by a retired police officer and his brother-in-law. 
   In fact, in Iowa, a man and his wife, hiring themselves out as a transport company, showed up at a prison to take possession of 
   five convicted murderers and a convicted kidnapper. And the prison warden said: You've got to be kidding me. You and your wife have come to take possession of five convicted murderers and a convicted kidnapper? The Warden said: You've got to be kidding me. But the warden turned the prisoners over to this man and his wife. And, of course, they escaped. It is absurd for us to be turning violent criminals over to private companies that do not have to meet any basic or reasonable standards. 
   As I indicated, Kyle Bell is now back in prison. 
   We do not know what he did when he was on the loose. He was on the loose for some long while. They apprehended him in Texas, as a matter of fact. 
   Then, just a couple of weeks ago, I read in the newspaper that the State of Nevada was going to send a convicted murderer to North Dakota under the Prisoner Exchange Program, a man named James Prestridge. So Nevada was going to send a murderer to North Dakota. James Prestridge, along with an armed robber, escaped in California while being transported. The two of them were gone. Once again, we had apparently a kind of three-stooges approach by the people who were supposed to have been guarding these violent criminals. 
   They found the armed robber who escaped with Mr. Prestridge just south of the Mexican border with a bullet through his head, dead. They apprehended James Prestridge recently. He is now back in prison. 
   Here is a man who is serving a life sentence without parole for first-degree murder, and he is turned over to a private company and that private company loses him. Extraditions International is the name of that company. 
   My proposition is this. When we in our criminal justice system convict violent criminals, convict people of murder, convict Kyle Bell of killing Jeanna North, I do not want those prisoners turned over to a private company that is going to put them in a minivan and transport them across the country with guards who are ill-prepared and ill-trained and follow no procedures. I do not want that to happen. 
   The private companies, if they are going to transport criminals across State lines in this country, ought to have to meet basic standards. 
   The amendment I have introduced--again, a bipartisan amendment--says the Department of Justice should establish regulations that must be met by private companies that are going to haul violent offenders. The standards should be no more than the standards that exist for law enforcement when they transport the same criminals. 
   I should mention, incidentally, the U.S. Marshals Service has a service, for a flat fee, of taking these child killers and violent offenders anywhere in the country. 
   In fact, I don't believe State and local governments ought to contract with private companies to transport violent criminals, as they now do. 
   The legislation I propose would require that a private company that is preparing to do this must meet basic safety standards with respect to training and other kinds of security circumstances that would give the American people some comfort that they are not in jeopardy by driving down the highway only to confront a minivan or a bus carrying 20 criminals coast to coast. 
   It might be useful to read into the RECORD other circumstances that persuade me there is something wrong in this area. 
   On January 22 of this year, three prisoners escaped while a van transporting them stopped at a minimart for a restroom break. While the two guards weren't looking, two inmates jumped into the front seat where the keys had been left in the ignition. How much judgment did that take? You are hauling criminals around the country. You stop at a gas station to go to the bathroom. You leave the keys in the vehicle. I am sorry; something is wrong. It is serious. 
   On July 24, last year, two men convicted of murder escaped from a van while being transported from Tennessee to Virginia. The two guards went into a fast food restaurant to get breakfast for the convicts. When they returned, they didn't notice the convicts had freed themselves from their leg irons, possibly with a smuggled key. While one guard went back into the restaurant, the other stood watch--there is some improvement; at least they are standing watch--but he forgot to lock the van door. The inmates kicked it open and fled. 
   On July 30, 1997, convicted rapist and kidnapper Dennis Glick escaped from a van while being transported from Salt Lake City to Pine Bluff, AR. While still in the van, Glick grabbed a gun from a guard who had fallen asleep, took seven prisoners, a guard, and a local rancher hostage and led 60 law enforcement officials on an all-night chase across Colorado. He was finally recaptured the next morning. 
   I won't read all of these, but there are plenty of them. 
   A husband-and-wife team of guards showed up at an Iowa State prison to transport six inmates, five of them  convicted murderers, from Iowa to New Mexico. When the Iowa prison warden saw there were only two guards to transport six dangerous inmates, he reportedly responded: ``You've got to be kidding me.'' Despite his concerns, the warden released the prisoners into the custody of the guards when told the transport company had a contract. Despite explicit instructions not to stop anywhere but the county jails or State prisons until they reached their destination, the guards decided to stop at a rest stop in Texas. Of course, the rest is predictable. The six inmates escaped, stole the van, led police on a high-speed chase, and so on. 
   My point is, I wasn't aware, and I will bet most Members of Congress are not aware, that State and local governments are routinely turning violent criminals over to the hands of private companies for transport across this country. Yet there is no basic standard, no set of regulations to guarantee the safekeeping of those violent offenders. I believe there ought to be. Republicans and Democrats who have joined us on this amendment believe there ought to be. That is the purpose of the amendment. 
   I understand this will probably be subject to rule XVI. I also understand the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator SHELBY, is trying to get this subcommittee markup moving. I sympathize with that. Senator LAUTENBERG wants the same thing. They want to get this through. I fully understand that. I hope the authorizing committee, where we hope to have a hearing on this legislation, will allow us to get that hearing and to advance this matter in another way, if in fact it is subject to rule XVI. 
   It is my belief, and I think the belief of almost everyone, that something needs to be done in this area to set some 
   commonsense rules. My first choice would be, if you have a violent offender, a criminal who has been judged violent by his or her behavior, they ought never leave the embrace of a law enforcement official. The address of someone convicted of murder ought to be their prison cell until the end of their term, with no time off for good behavior. Convict them and put them in prison. 
   Instead, what is happening is, too often they are being convicted and then under prisoner exchanges turned over to a private company for transport, only to discover that it is not very secure with respect to this transport: Guards who are ill prepared, vehicles that are not sufficient, procedures that are nonexistent. 
   Lest one doubt that, when Kyle Bell escaped in New Mexico, a child killer walked off the bus, a vicious child killer walked off the bus. The guards in that bus didn't count heads to find out that 1 of their inmates had escaped for 9 full hours. They didn't miss a child killer for 9 hours. Does anybody think this might be an area ripe for some thoughtful regulations and some thoughtful restraint? I think it is. That is why I offer the amendment. 
   I thank the Senator for his indulgence. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this afternoon, according to the news accounts released earlier today, the Environmental Protection Agency is calling on major oil refiners to meet in Washington, DC, to explain the price hike phenomenon, as it is called. This is not a phenomenon. It is a pain in the wallet what is happening with respect to the price of gasoline. 
   I want to talk a little about that, and talk a little about the problems that may be causing it. 
   It is not lost on the American people that when they drive to the gas pumps these days they are discovering, once again, another price spike in the cost of gasoline. 
   In North Dakota, for example, the North Dakota Petroleum Marketers Association provided me with current gasoline prices in North Dakota: Minot, $1.79 a gallon today; Fargo, $1.64 a gallon; Devil's Lake, $1.69; Bismarck, $1.68 a gallon. Interestingly enough, the current price in Bismarck of $1.68 is nearly a 30-cent-per-gallon increase in just the last couple of weeks since the previous price spike. Earlier this year, the price of petroleum spiked up and came back down. Now it has spiked up again, a nearly 30-cent-per-gallon increase in a very short period. 
   The EPA is asking for a meeting with the major oil refiners to evaluate what is happening with respect to the price of gasoline. Some indicate an EPA rule that describes the base fuel that must be used in certain cities in the country with respect to oxygenated fuel or ethanol as a circumstance where certain base fuels are kind of a narrow commodity and are not readily available and so it is pricing gasoline very high. That may be one case. I don't know the answer to that. I assume the EPA and the refiners will have that discussion. It is quite clear there are other things at work. 
   No. 1, this country gets a substantial amount of its energy from the OPEC countries. In a global economy, the OPEC countries are producing an ever-increasing amount of the energy the United States needs. Does this put us at the mercy of the supply coming from the OPEC countries? Of course it does. When the OPEC countries cut supply, as they did, and then increase it marginally, but not increase it to the level where they had previously been producing, that is going to have some dislocation in this country. The result is an increase in gasoline prices. 
   It is probably also the case, from hearings I have been involved with, that the refiners in this country were refining heating fuel for much longer than they normally would have and probably didn't switch over to gasoline quite quickly enough. Therefore, we are going to continue to see these price spikes. The news reports talk about volatility. Well, volatility is a euphemism for the price spikes that are jumping up and around with respect to the price of gasoline when we don't  have sufficient supply of crude stock coming into this country which refiners need to produce and turn into gasoline. 
   What we have are three possibilities. The most obvious is, we are seeing an ever-increasing dependence on the OPEC countries. They cut back supply, then increased it some, but not nearly enough. The result is increased prices for petroleum products in this country. 
   It ought to be a wake-up call for all of us. We are too dependent on foreign source energy. We ought to make certain we have a national energy policy that includes incentives for producers here at home, includes additional incentives for renewable energy. There isn't any reason we ought not be doing much better with respect to renewable energy in this country. The other possibility, aside from the OPEC industry, as I mentioned, is the potential of EPA recommendations or requirements that have created dislocation in certain markets in terms of the base supply that can be used with respect to ethanol. 
   I don't know what the outcome of this meeting will be, but I will be very interested to see what the EPA has done, whether that has caused some dislocation and some price spikes as well. 
   Third, it is not unlikely and certainly wouldn't be without precedent to have had the petroleum industry play some of their own games with respect to supply, the movement of supply and the pricing of supply. Some would say: Gosh, how could you think that? Well, history would bear out how I might be able to think that would be the case. We ought to look at all of these issues and evaluate exactly what is causing this price spike and what impact it is having and what we can do about it. 
   I come from a State that is 10 times the size of Massachusetts. North Dakota is a big old State. It takes a lot of driving to get around my State; 640,000 people live in a land mass 
   that is equivalent to 10 times the State of Massachusetts. Our predominant industry is farming. In order to seed a crop in the spring, it takes a lot of fuel. In order to get the crop off the fields in the fall, it takes a lot of fuel. Those family farmers, with the kind of depressed grain prices we have seen in this country, don't need further increases in input costs placed upon them by these increases in gas prices. 
   We have to get some answers from the EPA, the petroleum refiners, the major oil companies, and from those who are supposed to be involved in the development of an energy plan for this country to answer what kind of dependence do we have on the OPEC countries and what could the consequences be in the longer term, if those countries decided to have a much tighter supply of petroleum going to Western nations, including the United States. 
   I was reading a briefing memo this morning about this issue. I thought a couple of pieces of information were interesting. OPEC officials contend that prices are only marginally above the stated ban and ``the price rise is more due to a tight gasoline market in the United States where new environmental regulations are reducing volume.'' That is according to OPEC. OPEC is saying: It's not us. 
   The fact is, OPEC cut supply, increased it some but not nearly back to where they had originally been producing. 
   The Saudi Arabia oil minister also pegged the recent price movement on tight oil products markets; that is, oil products markets, not a shortage of crude oil itself. One source indicated that the increase in prices on certain world oil markets, notably in the U.S., has no relation to the volume of international crude output. That is an interesting theory. That would stand all logic on its head. Prices in the United States with respect to crude oil have no relationship to international crude oil production. I think that is not likely to be something that would be believed by anyone who is thinking. 
   The point is this: This is a significant and important issue to many areas of our country. We need to understand the consequences of it, what is causing it, and what we can do about it. I hope all of us working together can rely on not only the Energy Department, the EPA, but the Congress itself to evaluate all three of the suggestions I have just made.

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise to talk about the issue of sanctions on food and medicine shipments to other countries in the world. I know I have talked about this on the floor many times. At the risk of being repetitive, which I think is important in this body, I say again, it is immoral for this country to have a policy of imposing sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine to any other country in the world. 
   We have decided to impose economic sanctions on countries whose behavior we don't like. We have decided that economic sanctions is the way to punish certain countries. We don't like what Saddam Hussein in Iraq has been doing. He is an international outlaw, according to our country's view. Therefore, we want to punish him. So we impose economic sanctions. 
   We don't like Fidel Castro in Cuba, according to our public policy. So we want to impose an embargo that, by the way, has been existing for 40 years. We have sanctions against Iran, against North Korea. When we impose these sanctions, it is also included in those sanctions that we will not allow shipments of food and medicine to these same countries. 
   As I said, I think it is fundamentally immoral for our country to decide what they will withhold and prohibit the shipment of food and medicine to any country in the world. It doesn't make any sense. 
   I come at this from more than one standpoint. One, I represent a farm State. Yes, it bothers me that 11 percent of the international wheat market is off limits to our family farmers. We have folks that stand up here in the Senate and say: Well, we support the Freedom to Farm bill for family farmers. What about the freedom to sell bill? Why shouldn't farmers be free to sell into the marketplace where people are hungry and need food? What on Earth would persuade this country to have sanctions with respect to the shipment of food and medicine anywhere in the world? If my proposition is these sanctions are fundamentally wrong with respect to food and medicine sanctions, then let's change it. 
   We have tried to change it. Last year, we had a bill on the floor of the Senate. Seventy Senators voted to get rid of sanctions on food and medicine shipments everywhere in the world. Seventy Senators said: Let's get rid of them. We got the bill to conference and it got hijacked because some people want to continue sanctions, especially on the country of Cuba. 
   This year in the Senate Appropriations Committee on the Agriculture bill, I included an amendment that says: Get rid of all sanctions on food and medicine; get rid of them all with respect to Cuba and Iraq and North Korea. Get rid of all sanctions on food and medicine. That passed. It is in the Appropriations Committee. It will come to the floor on the Agriculture appropriations bill. Already we have some people in the Congress who are saying we are going to dump that. That is not going to become law. We are not going to get rid of sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine from this country to Cuba. 
   As I have said before, I intend to push this issue very hard this year. 
   It does not make sense to continue sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine to anywhere in the world. I want to read a couple of editorials that I think describe it as well. This is from the Seattle Post Intelligencer of May 28. This is an op-ed piece:  
   Economic sanctions against nations are long overdue for a critical appraisal. They make an appealing weapon. They are a way to hurt people without shooting at them. Done in the extreme, they inflict sickness and death. Sanctions have been used for many years--more than 40 years against Cuba and 10 years against Iraq. Lesser sanctions have been set against Libya, Iran and Burma. Threats of sanctions are annually made, but not acted upon, against China. In any case, economic sanctions have never removed a tyrant and they will never remove, for example, Saddam Hussein. In all likelihood, he will be in power until he dies. What sanctions have done is to further impoverish the Iraqi people.  
   Here is an excerpt from the Washington Times, an op-ed written by Steve Chapman:  
   Things have changed a lot since 1990. The Soviet Union no longer exists. The Federal  budget deficit has vanished. But two things remain the same. Iraq is under international economics sanctions, and the sanctions are a failure.  
   I don't have any great truck for Iraq or Saddam Hussein. I think he is an international outlaw. He operates well beyond the norms of international behavior. But it is also true that economic sanctions that include food and medicine represent an attempt to take aim at a dictator and hit hungry people, sick people, and poor people. It happens all the time when we impose food and medicine as part of economic sanctions. 
   This is from the Charleston Gazette, June 1, 2000:  
   Let's see if we've got this straight. Free trade with China will help export American values, paving the path for the end of communism in that nation. That is according to Republican House Whip Tom DeLay from Texas. However, free trade with Cuba can't be allowed because that would be rewarding a Communist regime. That is also according to DeLay, who simultaneously pushed for normalizing trade relations with China, while trying to stop a bill that would allow the sale of food and medicine to Cuba.  
   A piece in the Seattle Post Intelligencer, penned by my colleague on the House side, Congressman NETHERCUTT, who, incidentally, offered the same amendment in the House Appropriations Committee that I offered in the Senate. He was successful, and they are going to try to dump that provision in the House of Representatives before we get to conference. He says:  
   This week, Trent Lott, Majority Leader, defended the position. He said, ``It is very easy to see the distinction between China and Cuba. If you can't see it, maybe you are just blind to it.''  
   Well, I am not blind and I can't see it. I have been to Cuba. I was in Cuba last year. All I see in Cuba are people living in conditions of poverty. I see a country 90 miles to the north that has decided as a matter of public policy, because we don't like Fidel Castro, that we cannot move food and medicine to Cuba. Why? Because we have an embargo that includes the shipment of food and medicine. That is not fair to our farmers or to the poor people in Cuba. 
   I visited a hospital in Cuba one day. I was in the intensive care ward. I was there for a few days. In the hospital there was a little boy lying in a coma. He was about 12 years old. There was no equipment. This was an intensive care ward with no equipment at all. There wasn't a beeping sound because there was nothing to beep. There were no cords hooked up because they didn't have equipment. He was lying in this room with his mother holding his hand, lying in a coma. I asked the doctor: You have no basic equipment here? He said: No, we don't have any equipment. The doctor said: We are out of 250 different kinds of medicines. 
   I asked the question again when I came back to this country: Why is it that we have prohibitions against being able to send medicine to Cuba? Is sending medicine and food, or being able to sell medicine and food to Cuba, Iraq, North Korea, and Iran going to make this a less stable world? I don't think so. 
   Let me end where I started. This is an immoral policy. Yes, I come at it from a selfish perspective. I represent farmers who ask a question that cannot be answered: Why, if we raise food in such abundant quantity, are we told that those who need it so badly can't have it because this country wants to punish their rulers and leaders? I can't answer farmers when they ask that question. It doesn't make sense. It is a policy that is bankrupt. We ought to change it. We have 70 votes in the Senate to change it, and they won't allow a vote in the House of Representatives. If they did, they would have 70 percent voting in favor to change it. 
   So we are going to see in the coming weeks whether, once again, for a second year in a row, we have just a handful of people trying to hijack this effort to eliminate food and medicine from sanctions we impose on other countries around the world. When the roll is called, I think 70 Senators will vote, as they did previously, to say food and medicine sanctions anywhere in the world are not good public policy. They are not the best of America. Let's eliminate them. Let's abolish that mentality. You can punish foreign leaders whose behavior we don't like without hurting poor and hungry people. The only conceivable reason this gets held up--and it got held up last year--is a few people decided that because Fidel Castro sticks his finger in America's eye from time to time, they want to continue this 40-year-old embargo. And they darn well want to insist on keeping food and medicine as part of the sanction because if they don't, they will be considered weak on Cuba. Well, being considered weak because they pursue a public policy that is wrongheaded is not, in my judgment, a model of consistency. 
   Let us, in this session of the Congress, decide that at least on this marginal step forward, we will decide we will never again use food and medicine as part of economic sanctions, both in our interest and in the interest of poor, hungry, and sick people all around the world. 
   Madam President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to let my colleagues know about a woman who, this morning, is working at the post office in Knox, ND. Knox, ND, is a little town of 42 people, but it is big enough to have a post office. 
   Just recently, the postmaster of the Knox, ND, post office, a woman named Vivian Seter, retired. Upon Vivian's retirement at age 73, Maggie Miller took over the job. 
   Now maybe my colleagues are thinking there is nothing unusual in that. But Maggie is 83 years old, and she just took over the running of the post office in Knox from her 73-year-old friend Vivian. 
   The post office has cut its hours a bit since Maggie took over, so it is open now from 8:30 until 10:30 a.m. In fact, in about 10 minutes from now, central time in Knox, ND, Maggie will be hanging it up for the day. But for now, at age 83, after working 62 years in the postal system, Maggie has assumed the reins of the Knox Post Office. 
   The reason I mention this today is that I have talked a lot over the years about rural values. There is something quite remarkable and unique about life in the small towns of rural America. I represent a wonderful State, North Dakota, with a lot of small communities. Knox, ND, is one of them. 
   There are also a lot of hard-working, remarkable people in these small towns, and Maggie Miller is one of them. Again, she has been working for the postal system for 62 years, and I read in the newspaper that the postmaster from Rolla, ND, had to come  train her for her new position. Vivian, the retiring postmaster, joked: She has only been doing this 62 years, so she needs a little training. 
   The article I read about her said that last year Maggie, who was age 82 at the time, bowled a 204. Then she broke her wrist and has had to take the summer off. But Maggie being Maggie, she vows to make a comeback to her bowling league. 
   When I saw this story in the paper, I just had to call Maggie. When she answered the phone, I said: Maggie, this is BYRON DORGAN calling from Washington, DC. I wanted to tell you that it is wonderful that you are stepping in as postmaster at age 83. Maggie said: Tell me another one. I said: No, Maggie, it really is BYRON DORGAN. And she said: I bet it is. 
   So Maggie, if you happen to be watching this debate in Congress, I really did call you. I say congratulations. You have a lot of spunk. I am proud of all the things you have done and of the values that you represent of folks in small towns helping each other and working together. I know the post office in many small towns is the hub of the community, and I am confident you will serve Knox well. 
   Congratulations to Maggie and to the town of Knox.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will speak for a few moments about the issue of the sanctions on food and medicine that exist in this country with respect to other countries. 
   I have a chart that describes what has happened to our family farmers. I represent a State with a lot of wheat growers. This chart shows what has happened to the price of wheat. As my colleagues can see, it has collapsed. Over a period of a few years, the price of wheat has just flat collapsed. I guess it is because the grain markets have determined that the food our family farmers produce does not have much value. 
   So our farmers, at a time when their prices have collapsed, are struggling mightily. They have a very difficult time trying to deal with collapsed prices. Yet all their expenses continue to increase. They have a difficult time understanding what is happening in the world relative to their prices and to people around the world who need what they produce. 
   This is a picture that is in stark contrast to the graph that shows a collapse in the price of wheat. This is a picture of hunger. This picture is all too typical in some parts of the world. Starvation, deprivation, desperate hunger, hundreds of millions of people go to bed with an ache in their belly because they didn't have enough to eat. Millions and millions of children don't have enough to eat. Every eight seconds, one child dies because of hunger and hunger-related causes. Yet a family farmer who plows the ground in the spring and tends to the crop, and is lucky enough to get a crop off in the fall, takes that load of wheat to the elevator only to be told by the grain trade: The food you have produced doesn't have value. 
   Farmers wonder if so many people in the world are so hungry, 
   if so many live in starvation, and suffer from deprivation, and go to bed hungry, why is it that the food we produce in such abundant quantity in this country has no value? 
   As we talk about this disconnection--indeed, it is a disconnection of what we produce and what the world so desperately needs and the hunger that exists around the rest of the world, and then for our producers to be told that what they have produced doesn't have value--we have a policy in the United States that says: There are certain countries in this world whose behavior is such that we want to impose an economic embargo. Included in that embargo, we, as a country, want to prohibit the sale of food and medicine to those other countries. That is current policy. In fact, almost 11 percent of the wheat export market in the world has been off limits to our family farmers because of sanctions that we have applied against other countries. 
   North Korea, Iran, Cuba, and others have been told, the United States of America will not move grain and medicine to these countries because they are behaving outside the norm of international behavior and therefore, we impose sanctions. Those sanctions include food and medicine. That is wrong-headed public policy, and it should never have happened in the first place. It is a bipartisan mistake by administrations over the years that have included food and medicine in the economic sanctions. We should never include food and medicine in sanctions we impose against other governments. We should never use food as a weapon. We should never include medicine as a part of a sanction--to use medicine as a weapon. We ought to decide now that we are going to change that policy. 
   A bipartisan group of us, myself in the Appropriations Committee, joined by Senator SLADE GORTON from the State of Washington, with the support of Senator ASHCROFT, Senator DODD, and a group of others, have offered an amendment in the Appropriations Committee to say: No more; let us abolish all sanctions on food and medicine shipments everywhere in the world. It passed. It is in the Agriculture appropriations bill that will come to the floor of the Senate. 
   That is not new. We passed it last year as well, by 70 votes in the Senate. Because of one issue, it got hijacked by some legislative leaders and did not become law. They are planning to hijack it again. 
   The issue is Cuba. We have legislative leaders who say Cuba is a different story. We must maintain sanctions against the shipment of food and medicine to Cuba. They want to retain the entire embargo with Cuba. But the 40 years of embargo has failed. 
   The question is--when you have an experiment, a laboratory experiment, and this is a real experiment, a real laboratory, for 40 years you have an embargo against Cuba and it doesn't work--who will be the first to stand up and say: This does not work; maybe we ought to do something else? 
   We are not talking about the entire embargo with respect to Cuba. We are just talking about the issue of food and medicine and the sanctions that now apply to shipments of food and medicine to Cuba. The legislative leaders are intending to hijack this position once again. Our intent to repeal that sanction is going to be hijacked once again, unless we find a way to stop it. 
   The Washington Post today wrote an editorial, ``Food for Cuba.'' They make the point that there is no justification for having sanctions on food and medicine for Cuba, and there is no justification. It is interesting that the debate over normal trade relations with China produces all these folks who come to the floor of the House and Senate and say: We must engage with China. Engaging with a Communist nation will inevitably move that nation in a more constructive direction. 
   More trade and more direction towards open markets will inevitably improve things in a country such as China. 
   If that is the case, why is it not the case with Cuba, also a Communist country? Why is it the case that engagement with China is productive in moving them towards better human rights and towards a more constructive direction, but it is not the case in Cuba? The answer is the current embargo that exists with Cuba makes no sense at all. Sanctions against the shipments of food and medicine, not only to Cuba but to the other sanctioned countries in the world, is not moral policy. It is not moral for this country, in my judgment, to use food and medicine as part of sanctions. It is wrong. 
   I started by talking about farmers. Yes. I have an interest to try to make sure farmers have the opportunity to serve markets. Those who support Freedom to Farm. I don't; I don't think it has worked. We need to ask the same question with respect to markets. If you say the Freedom to Farm approach is something that is important for farmers, what about the freedom to sell? Freedom to Farm--what about the freedom to sell? Farmers are told they have the freedom to farm. What about the freedom to sell their products to Cuba, or the freedom to sell their wheat to Iran, or the freedom to sell their wheat to Libya? 
   If we have in the coming weeks the kind of chicanery that went on last year to hijack this policy, to hijack those Republicans and Democrats who say we must end these sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine to all countries--and, yes, including Cuba--if  they intend to hijack that again through legislative chicanery, they are going to have a whole load on their hands, because they did it last year and they were successful, but they are not going to do it twice. 
   If there is an up-or-down vote on this to eliminate the sanctions on food and medicine with respect to all of these countries, including Cuba--there were 70 votes in the Senate last year, and there was a majority in the House. By an overwhelming margin Republicans and Democrats in the Congress believed that we ought to eliminate sanctions on food and medicine shipments. The only conceivable way they can detour our effort is to prevent a vote in the House and to try to strip out the provision that the Senate Appropriations Committee put in when that bill comes to the floor of the Senate. 
   I serve notice to all who think about these issues that it is not going to happen the way it happened last year. You might have the muscle and you might have the cards up your sleeve to try to derail this once again. But it is going to cost in terms of the way this place works. 
   We have a clear, large majority in the House and the Senate on the side of the American farmer, who believe they ought to have the freedom to sell in these markets; on the side of those who say this policy of using food as a weapon is fundamentally immoral; on the side of doing the right thing with Cuba and yes, other countries; consistent with what we described and talked about with respect to China. We have a large majority in the House and the Senate to do the sensible thing this year. 
   I am not prepared to step aside and quietly go away on this issue. If leaders do to us what they are suggesting in the papers, they will try to do to us what they did last year successfully through legislative slight of hand. 
   Our farmers deserve better than that. Hungry people around the world deserve to look at this country and understand that this country will never, never ever impose sanctions on food and medicine. 
   This country in its zeal and desire to take aim at a dictator hits hungry people, hits poor people, and hits sick people. We are not hurting dictators. Does anybody here believe that Fidel Castro has ever missed a meal because we have an embargo or sanction on food and medicine? Does anybody here ever think that Saddam Hussein has missed dinner because we have not sent food to Iraq? We haven't hurt dictators. All we have done is hurt sick people, poor people, and hungry people around the world with this foolish policy. And, at the same time, we have hurt our farmers here at home. 
   This must stop. It must stop this year. And it must not be a halfhearted notion of putting on the brakes halfway and saying we will eliminate the sanctions with respect to these couple of countries but we can't do it with respect to Cuba. Nonsense. It must be done across the board, and it must be done this year. 
   Those, as I have said, who think they are going to hijack this policy are in for a long, hot summer. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if this was a dance contest, I say to the majority party: You win. I have never seen a shuffle like this. We are not stalling, they say, and yet this conference committee has had more than six months to reach an agreement and there has been no movement. Do not take it from me, take it from Dr. NORWOOD, a Republican Congressman from the State of Georgia. He says:  
   It is impossible to take this conference process seriously.  
   That is from a Republican. 
   While this Congress fiddles, people die. Yes, they die. Senator REID and I had a hearing in Nevada. A mother named Susan Roe spoke up at this hearing about her 16-year-old son, Christopher. Christopher is now dead. He died October 12, 1999. He had leukemia. Chris's pediatric oncologist recommended that he receive a bone marrow transplant, his only hope for long-term survival. But before Chris could receive a bone marrow transplant, his cancer needed to go into remission. Chris's oncologist felt that the only drug available that would help him achieve remission was a Phase III investigational drug known as B43-PAP. However, this treatment he needed for a chance at life was denied him. 
   At the hearing, Susan held up Christopher's picture and told us, through tears, how, as her son lay gravely ill, he looked at her and said: Mom, I just don't understand how they could do this to a kid. 
   Yes, people die while this Congress fiddles. This debate is about whether there should be a Patients' Bill of Rights. This amendment says, among other things, that every patient has a right to know all of their medical options, not just the cheapest. If you need to go to an emergency room for care, you have a right to get it. 
   If you stand with patients, you will support this amendment. This legislation ought to have been passed last year, but the fact is, it is locked in conference. There is a giant stall going on. The only difference between this conference and a glacier is that a glacier at least moves an inch or two a year. The Senator from South Dakota and the Senator from Massachusetts and others have every right and responsibility to bring this proposal to the floor of the Senate because we insist that this Congress take seriously the need to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I'd like to take a moment to tell you about some wonderful kids. Recently, two youth volunteers from each state, including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, came to Washington, D.C. with their parents. They were being recognized at the Fifth Annual Prudential Spirit of Community Awards for their outstanding acts of community service. 
   These kids are heroes. They set the example of selflessness and caring for others to follow and it was truly inspiring to hear their stories of service to the public and their communities. I was honored to serve as co-chair of the National Selection Committee along with Senator SUSAN COLLINS. 
   Ten students were chosen as National Honorees--five high school and five middle school students--and each received $5,000, a gold medallion and a crystal trophy for their school. The ten honorees will also have a total of $250,000 in toys and clothing dedicated to needy children in their names. 
   I'd especially like to congratulate the two volunteers chosen as finalists from my state of North Dakota: Jason Koth of Grand Forks and Scot Miller of Fargo. 
   Jason, a senior at Grand Forks Red River High School, wrote, produced and directed a play to raise funds for the Make-A-Wish Foundation. It was called ``The Sun in My Eyes'' and he wrote this play in memory of his handicapped brother. Jason said, ``I wanted to tell people to stop fighting over unimportant things and start opening their eyes to the beautiful people that surround them.'' His play raised over $1,300 for the foundation and helped send a terminally ill child on his dream trip to Disney World. 
   Scot, a ninth grader at Discovery Junior High in Fargo, became involved in several volunteer projects to help his community. When he learned that the public library needed donations to complete its expansion plan, Scot led a recycling drive to raise money and created an ongoing recycling program in his neighborhood. He is also president of his school's Builder's Club, a student organization dedicated to promoting volunteer efforts within his community. During his summer months, Scot spends four hours a day volunteering as a junior recreation leader for the local parks department.  
   I'm so proud of Jason and Scot. They should feel great pride for their hard work and the impact they have made in their communities and the lives of others. Their efforts are truly inspiring. 
   Mr. President, Senator COLLINS and I would like to honor all 104 Prudential Spirit of Community Honorees by reading their names in the RECORD. 
   The ten students selected as National Honorees are: 
   Linda Arnade, 17, of Palm Bay, Florida, who discovered that septic tanks in her community were causing groundwater contamination after testing more than 400 residential wells. She then launched an education and monitoring program to alert the public of this important health and environment risk. 
   Brett Byrd, 13, of Camas, Washington, who helped raise more than $100,000 in his mother's memory for breast cancer prevention by performing concerts along with his brother and their rock band. 
   Megan Doherty, 16, of Lemont, Illinois, who raised more than $56,000 to bring 29 young cancer victims of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster to her town for life-saving medical treatment. 
   Marcus Houston, 18 of Denver, Colorado, who developed an educational program called ``Just Say Know'' that teaches middle level students what it takes to achieve academic, social and athletic success in high school. 
   Andrew Leary, 17, of Vernon, New Jersey, who led a two-and-a-half year effort to establish the first permanent soup kitchen in the northern part of his rural county. He also helped raise $35,000 to operate the facility. 
   Joshua Marcus, 13, of Boca Raton, Florida, who created ``Sack It To You,'' a non-profit corporation that has provided backpacks filled with school supplies to more than 2,500 needy children. 
   Jarrett Mynear, 11, of Nicholasville, Kentucky, who raised more than $18,000 to distribute new toys each week to young patients at a children's hospital. Since the program started, Jarrett has been featured on many local television shows, as well as the nationally syndicated ``Rosie O'Donnell Show,'' to promote his cause. 
   Shelarese Ruffin, 17, of Atlanta, Georgia, who developed an intervention program that enables middle and high school students to confront and overcome drug abuse and other discipline problems instead of being expelled from school. 
   Danielle Shimotakahara, 13, of North Bend, Oregon, who waged a high-profile campaign to remove violent coin-operated games from places where children congregate in her town. She also testified at a U.S. Senate hearing on the effects of violent games on children. 
   Sagen Woolery, 12, of Warner Robins, Georgia, who started a summer meal service called ``The Kid's Kitchen'' for needy children and their families. The service, operated completely by 8-to-12 year-olds, has served more than 3,200 people in her community and also provides toiletries and school supplies for needy children who come to the kitchen.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr President, I rise to recognize a recent achievement of the University of North Dakota's flying team. At the end of May, UND won the National Intercollegiate Flying Association national championship. This is the eleventh such title for our University. 
   This national championship team placed first in the flight and ground events by scoring 162 points in the 10 different events--32 points more than its closest competitor. Erich Hess won first place in Top Pilot honors and secured the Craig Morrison award by receiving the top combined scores in Computer Accuracy, Simulated Comprehensive Aircraft Navigation and Preflight. Brain Visocky received second place in Top Pilot honors and took first place honors in the Short Field Landing event. Ten other committed students at the John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences helped lead UND to its first place victory. 
   I commend Coach Al Skramstad and Assistant Coach Eric Brusven for their work in helping these students rigorously prepare for this annual event. Winning the national championship is a significant achievement that could not have been realized if it were not for an enormous commitment on the part of both the students and their instructors. 
   The University of North Dakota is located in Grand Forks, ND, and I'm honored to have graduated from this great university. The John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences has always played a significant role at the University as an international leader in collegiate and contract aviation education and training services. With more than 1,500 students, the School of Aerospace Science is the second largest college at UND. 
   And so today I salute the University of North Dakota and its extraordinary championship flying team.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment addresses a critical need. I ask him if he sees in South Dakota what we know and see in North Dakota with respect to the veterans' health care system. The system is not working. We have a fellow in north central North Dakota who went to Vietnam and took a bullet in the brain and is severely disabled for life. Because of that, he has muscle atrophy and a range of other health problems and had to have a toe removed. 
   The VA system said to his father: Haul him over to Fargo, ND, and we will do that in the VA system. 
   In other words, take this severely disabled person, put him in a car, drive him nearly 200 miles to the east and have this procedure done--not a major procedure--and then drive him 200 miles back, and that is the only way we will cover that expense. 
   The father said: Is this the way to treat a son who served 
   his country in  Vietnam and was shot in the head and is now consigned to a very difficult life? Is this a way to treat him? It is not. The health care system is not working. The VA system is not able to meet the needs. 
   I ask the Senator from South Dakota, is it not the case, in his opinion, that the cost of veterans' health care is part and parcel of the cost of defending this country? It ought to be part of the cost of defense because it is a promise we made and have not kept to veterans in this country when we said: Serve your country, and we will provide you a health care system that works for your needs.

   Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the indulgence of the Senator from South Dakota. 
   I assume he agrees with me we are not in any way attempting to denigrate the wonderful men and women who work at the VA health care centers around the country. Many of them do an extraordinary job. But they are not funded well enough. We do not have the resources to do the job we should. 
   I just want to mention, on a Sunday morning some while ago, I was at a VA hospital presenting medals that had been earned, but never received by an American Indian. His family came, but also at this VA hospital, the doctors and the nurses came into his room. I pinned those medals on the pajama tops of this man named Edmund Young Eagle. He died 7 days later. He was very ill with cancer. But it was an enormously proud day for him because he served his country in Africa and Europe in World War II. The fact is, this man served this country around the world. He never complained about it. 
   The day I pinned the medals on his pajama tops, you could see the pride in his eyes. I appreciated the fact that at this VA hospital the doctors and nurses came around and were part of that small ceremony. 
   But there are so many people such as Edmund Young Eagle and others who served their country, have never asked for much, but then need health care, only to discover that the system for delivering that health care is not nearly funded well enough, while in the Congress, somehow we are more eager to say that defense relates to the things in the Defense Department and that the VA health care system is somehow not part of that obligation. It is part of that obligation. That is why I am pleased to support this amendment. 
   As I mentioned, I say to Senator JOHNSON, he has been working on these issues for a long while. I hope the Congress will embrace this approach now so that we can be as proud of what we are doing for veterans and for their health care needs as Edmund Young Eagle was proud that day of serving his country. 
   Isn't it the case that we have dramatic needs--underfunding in these facilities--and that the Senator's approach to dealing with this would say it is a priority in this Congress to address the health care needs of veterans and we believe the health care needs of veterans are part and parcel of this country's defense requirements?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, with great respect to my colleague from Idaho, and I did not come to the floor of the Senate to talk about this, let me say when any of my colleagues stand up and talk about gun control issues that the minority wishes to pursue--let me explain in a sentence or so what we are trying to do. It is not to restrict the opportunity of anyone in this country who has the right to own a gun. We are trying to close the gun show loophole to prevent convicted felons from getting a gun. 
   Go to a gun store to buy a gun in this country and you must run your name through an instant check because we do not want convicted felons to have weapons. They cannot, by law, possess weapons. Go to a gun store and you have to run your name through an instant check. If it comes up that you are a convicted felon, you do not get the gun. But go to a gun show on a Saturday morning as a convicted felon and buy a gun and you do not have to have your name checked against anything. Go get your gun at a gun show, if you are a convicted felon and want a weapon. We are trying to close that loophole. 
   Every American should support closing that loophole and should support it now. That does not affect any law-abiding citizen's right to own a gun. All it does is says let's keep guns out of the hands of felons. No one in this Chamber should believe convicted felons ought to be able to go into a gun show and gain access to a weapon they are not by law entitled to have. 
   I did not come to the floor to speak about that, but I did want to respond to the pejorative suggestion that people on this side of the aisle want to injure the rights of law-abiding citizens to possess weapons. That is just wrong. We are trying to close a loophole that every American ought to support closing--to keep felons from getting guns.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a picture of a man named Kyle Bell. This brutal criminal killed Jeanna North, an 11-year-old girl from Fargo, ND. 
   After being convicted and imprisoned, Kyle Bell escaped. How did he escape? When North Dakota authorities were going to transport him to a prison out of State for safekeeping, a prison in the State of Oregon, they contracted with a private company called TransCor to haul him there. As he was being transported across the country by bus with a dozen or more other prisoners, this child killer escaped. While stopped at a gas station, two guards with this private company were sleeping; another was apparently buying a cheeseburger. Kyle Bell went out through the top of the bus and this child killer walked away. 
   When I discovered what had happened, I thought to myself, that cannot be. We are turning child killers over to private companies to be transported across the country? But it is true. Then I discovered the record of these companies. You can be a retired sheriff and call your brother-in-law and say: Let's buy a mini van and let's go into the business of transporting criminals. In fact, in one state, a man and his wife showed up with a little mini van to pick up five convicted murderers. The warden of the penitentiary said: You have to be kidding me. They weren't kidding. That is who the State hired to transport these murderers. And of course the murderers escaped in short order. 
   What I have discovered is we have private companies being hired by State and local governments to transport violent criminals around the country, and those companies have no requirement to meet any standards at all. That doesn't make any sense. 
   I have introduced a piece of legislation I call Jeanna's Bill that says if any local or State government is going to contract with a private company to haul a violent criminal, they must meet some basic standards. They must meet some regulations. If you haul toxic waste, you must meet regulations. Haul cattle, you must meet regulations. Haul circus animals, you must meet regulations. But some of our States and local governments are willing to turn killers over to private companies who have no such standards to meet at all. 
   I received a letter in the last few days from the Governor of Nevada. I want to say I pass him my compliments. The Governor of Nevada was sending a convicted murderer named James Prestridge to North Dakota for safekeeping under the Prisoners Exchange Agreement. Mr. Prestridge, along with another fellow convicted of armed robbery, was being hauled to North Dakota by a company that is called Extraditions International. 
   Mr. Prestridge, this convicted murderer, escaped, as did John Doran, an armed robber. Mr. Doran was found just south of the Mexican border with a bullet through his brain, and Mr. Prestridge was recently apprehended. I wrote to the Governor of Nevada and said: I hope if you still intend to send this convicted murderer to North Dakota you will do it through the U.S. Marshals Service. They will haul violent offenders anywhere across this country for a flat fee and they don't lose them. 
   I got a letter back from the Governor of Nevada. He said:   
   In response to your request that Nevada stop using private transport companies, please be advised our prison system has ceased its business relationship with Extraditions International and that all of this State's out of state inmate transfers are now being staffed by our prison system.  
   Good for him. He said, incidentally, Mr. Prestridge is now not going to be sent to North Dakota. Good for us. 
   But good for him that he changed the policy. In our State, in the most recent days, the company that let this fellow go, the company whose negligence allowed a convicted child killer to walk away and evade authorities for some months, settled with the State for $50,000. The State sent them a bill for $102,000 and the company said: We won't pay it. We'd pay you $50,000. And then the State says this company is a pretty good company and we will use them again. 
   My State is making a mistake, in my judgment. I would like every State to make a decision when they are going to transport violent criminals around this country, do it with law enforcement officials, do it with the U.S. Marshals Service. They will do it for a flat fee and then some American family won't have to worry that, when they pull up at a gas station, next to them at the pump is a mini van with two inexperienced folks hauling three murderers. What is that about, in terms of public safety? 
   It seems to me we ought to have enough common sense in this country when we have convicted someone of killing children, when we have convicted someone of murder or violent crimes, at least we ought not to turn them into the arms of someone inexperienced in the private sector, a company that has to meet no standards at all with which to transport them. That doesn't make any sense to me. 
   So I say to the Governor of Nevada: Good for you. It is the right decision. I would say to our State: Change your mind. Decide this company should not haul violent offenders in North Dakota and that when you are going to transport a violent offender, the U.S. Marshals Service ought to be used to do it. 
   I say to every State official across this country: Until we get in place basic standards these companies must meet, you ought not use them for transporting violent offenders. Were I a chief executive of a State, I would not use them anyway because I do not think people who kill children, as in the case of Kyle Bell, ought to be turned over to anyone other than law enforcement authorities to transport them to another place of incarceration.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to speak about an issue that is of great importance to my State and to all agricultural producers around the country. That is the issue of the sanctions on food and medicine that now exist in our relationships with some countries around the world. 
   Our country has been in the habit of saying: We don't like certain countries, we don't like the way they behave, so we are going to slap economic sanctions on these countries and we have included sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine. So countries such as Libya, Iran, Cuba, North Korea, and others, are in a circumstance of having economic sanctions enacted against them to punish them, and we have included in those sanctions food and medicine. 
   A group of us are trying to change that. We do not think it is the moral thing to do. What is this country doing, saying to others that we will not allow them to have access to food and medicine? Taking aim at dictators and hurting poor people, sick people, and hungry people is hardly something about which we ought to be proud. This is not a moral policy. 
   I come from a farm State, so I care about having access to these markets as well. I admit that. Aside from the market side of this, which is important--after all, these countries against whom we have sanctions on food and medicine represent almost 11 percent of the world's wheat markets, and we have said to our farmers: By the way, 11 percent of the world's wheat market is off limits to you. Why? Because we decided we do not like these countries and we are going to make them pay a price. Part of the price we are going to exact is the ability for them to access food and medicine from the United States. 
   Of course, other countries access it from Canada, Europe, or others. We are the country that decides to withhold food and medicine from these countries. 
   Last year, we had a vote in the Senate on that. Senator ASHCROFT, I, and many others who pushed to repeal the sanction on food and medicine won with 70 out of 100 votes. We were hijacked by the House of Representatives in conference. I was one of the conferees. They just flat out hijacked us. When it was clear to them we were going to win the issue in conference, they adjourned the conference, never to see them again, and they stripped the provision. 
   I offered the same provision in the Senate Appropriations Committee, and it is now in the Agriculture appropriations bill. That is coming to the floor of the Senate. We have 70 Senators who said they think it is wrong to continue sanctions on food and medicine. The message in the Senate is: Stop using food as a weapon. It is the right message. 
   There are a lot of people in the House of Representatives who apparently are willing to do that except for Cuba; Cuba is a special case, and they will not withdraw sanctions on food and medicine with respect to Cuba. In fact, that is what derailed it last year. 
   I am one person, but I tell my colleagues that I am not going to allow, to the extent I can prevent it, the hijacking of this issue again this year by just two or three people who decide they are going to strip this provision and then have the House and Senate deal with the broader appropriations issues that do not include this provision. 
   We have spent a lot of time on this issue. This country is wrong in applying sanctions with respect to food and medicine shipments to countries such as Cuba. Yes, Cuba. 
   I was in Cuba last year. I have no truck with the Castro government. I think the Cuban government and its economic system have collapsed. But the sanctions that exist with respect to this 
   country's actions against Cuba have represented Fidel Castro's greatest excuse to the Cuban people. He says: Of course my economy does not work; of course my country is in trouble. The United States has had its fist around our neck for 40 years. 
   It is Fidel Castro's greatest excuse, in my judgment, for an economic system that has failed Cuba. It does not make sense, in my judgment, for us to exact a penalty on the Cuban people, on poor people, on hungry people, and on sick people in Cuba, in North Korea, and elsewhere to continue these absurd sanctions on food and medicine. 
   We can have a broader discussion at some other time about whether the embargo that exists with Cuba ought to be lifted. That is a different subject, a broader subject. Incidentally, I have strong feelings about that as well. This is a narrower issue: Do we believe it appropriate to continue sanctions with respect to the shipment of food and medicine to countries such as Cuba, North Korea, Iran, and others? The answer ought to be a resounding no. 
   My colleague, Senator SLADE GORTON from the State of Washington, is in the Chamber. He was a cosponsor of this in the Senate Appropriations Committee. He, I, and JOHN ASHCROFT have issued a statement that says to all within hearing distance that if you think you are going to hijack this issue again this year, think again, because we have 70 votes in the Senate that say we ought not use food and medicine as a weapon, and we intend to insist this year that we prevail on this issue. 
   I cannot speak for anybody else, but the statement we issued is pretty self-explanatory. I am here to give fair warning to those who want to do what they did last year that it is going to be a pretty difficult proposition if they intend to hijack this issue. We have the votes. Vote on it in the Senate, and it will pass by an overwhelming margin. Allow a vote in the House, and it will pass by an overwhelming margin. The only way those who want to defeat this proposition because it contains Cuba--which is an irrational position, for those who think through this a little bit--the only way they can possibly defeat it is to try to use some hijinks in the process to avoid an up-or-down vote. 
   I and others intend to see we have a full opportunity to have votes in the  House and the Senate on it. If the House leadership does what it did last year, I say to them: Fair warning, I am going to be here on the floor of the Senate objecting to a whole series of things. We need to straighten this out now. This country, at this time, on this issue, says we will no longer use sanctions with respect to the shipment of food and medicine. It does not work, it is not a moral policy, and it ought to stop now. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments about the conference report that is before us today. As I do, I want to compliment some folks for a lot of hard work: My colleague, Senator CONRAD, especially, who has played such an integral role in  this; Senator HARKIN, Senator LUGAR, Senator GRASSLEY, Senator ROBERTS, to just mention a few--for a whole series of folks in different areas have played significant roles in trying to bring this to the floor of the Senate. 
   Frankly, while there are some things I would have done differently in constructing this legislation--particularly the emergency aid--I am going to vote for it. I think this is a good day for family farmers in my State and the country. 
   We have a fellow in North Dakota named Arlo Schmidt. Arlo is an auctioneer. He told me one day about an auction sale he had conducted awhile back. What happened during that sale describes so well the passion and the hurt that exists in farm country when grain prices collapse and family farmers lose their hopes and their dreams. This auction sale had occurred on a family farm, owned by a family who was not able to make it. They had gone broke because prices collapsed. It was not their fault. A whole series of things conspired to say to this family they could not farm anymore. They were losing their hopes, their dreams, and their future that day. 
   At the end of the auction sale, a young boy who lived on that farm--he was 10 or 11 years old or so--came up to the auctioneer. The young boy was very angry with him, so angry, that he said to the auctioneer: You sold my dad's tractor. 
   Arlo said he put his hand on the boy's shoulder to try to console him a little bit, but the boy looked up at him through some tears and angrily said: I wanted to drive that tractor when I got big. 
   The young boy wasn't accepting any of that comfort from the auctioneer. He wanted to drive that tractor when he got big. 
   That boy felt like a lot of families feel, living on a family farm. The farm was much more than a business. It was a way of life. 
   Family farmers cannot make a living when grain prices collapse. The underpinning basis of Freedom to Farm was, let's not care about price supports or safety nets; let's operate in the open market, the free market. Well, there wasn't an open market when Congress passed it; and there's not one now. 
   It seems to me, after about 3 years of applying tourniquets, somebody ought to ask the question: Isn't there some serious bleeding going on here? We have brought to the floor--including this bill--emergency help three times in 3 years. All of this emergency help is to try to take the place of the safety net that does not exist in Freedom to Farm. 
   It seems to me it would be wise for us now--after we pass this bill--to learn from our mistakes. If we have to do this every single year, let's do it in a thoughtful way and the right way. Let's repeal Freedom to Farm and replace it with a safety net that works for family farmers, a safety net that says to that family who has those hopes and dreams: if you work hard and you do a good job we will give you an opportunity to make it, even during tough times. 
   This legislation has a lot of things in it. No. 1, it improves the Crop Insurance Program. I salute that effort by my colleagues. Many of us have had input, although I did not play the major role on this. The fact is, this improvement is a collaboration of Republicans and Democrats that is significant. This legislation increases premium subsidies to help family farmers buy up better levels of coverage; a better depth of coverage at less cost for family farmers. 
   In North Dakota, it solves some peculiar problems. We have 
   had problems year after year in which farmers have lost a substantial amount of their crop to wet cycles and, therefore, their production is decreased. Because of this, every single year their insurance coverage under crop insurance is decreased. They have been caught in a Catch-22 from which they could not escape, and it did not make any sense. This bill addresses those issues. This is an important and significant piece of reform to the crop insurance bill. 
   Let me also say this proposal before us today includes emergency economic assistance for family farmers. This assistance is what I talked about earlier. My colleague, Senator WELLSTONE, was absolutely correct on this subject. We ought not use doubling the AMTA payment, year after year after year, as a method of providing economic assistance to family farmers. It is not the most efficient and not the most effective way to deliver this assistance. 
   I am going to vote for this bill. If I had written this legislation, I would have written it differently. This replicates what we have done the last 2 years. This is the third year in a row we have increased AMTA payments. This will send money to people who have not seen a farm for a couple of years; have not gassed up a tractor in the spring to plow a straight furrow for awhile. They are not farming now. They are going to get money under this bill, and it does not make any sense to me. 
   What we ought to be doing is extending emergency help to family farmers living out there on the farm, and who are struggling to make a living. This help should be going to family farmers who are confronted with collapsed prices; all who have found that when you raise a bushel of grain for $4 a bushel and then have to sell it for $2.50, you are going to be in trouble. You cannot continue to make it that way. There ought to be a safety net for those folks, the folks who are really farming. Regrettably, the mechanism to distribute that emergency economic aid has been the double AMTA payment. I think we could have done much, much better than that. 
   My hope is that following the passage of this conference report--and I will vote for it even though I disagree with the mechanism of the economic assistance package, and I do compliment those who helped bring this to the floor--my hope is that when this is done, we will all understand that if we have to do this year after year after year, it is time to learn from it. We really ought to be able to learn when something doesn't work. Let's just admit our farm policy doesn't work and change it. 
   I started by talking about family farming. Some will say--they are careful about the circles they say it--but they say the family farm is just yesterday. This is all nostalgia about an economic unit that does not work anymore. This view is just wrongheaded. We have the kind of economy we intend to have. We can have the kind of economy we create in this country. We can decide we want big corporate agrifactories from California to Maine producing America's food, or we can decide to have a network of families working on farms producing America's food. 
   Europe has made that decision. Go to Europe and visit the rural communities in the countryside. You will discover small towns are doing well. There is life, there is a heart, and there is pulse in small towns. Why? Because Europe has decided they want a network of family farmers producing their food. 
   The result of this decision is a rural economy that is thriving and working. Europe has a safety net for family farmers they can rely on which gives them hope for the future. Regrettably, we have not had that same continuity in this country. 
   On the other hand, we in this country have lurched back and forth from farm policy to farm policy. Finally, we fell off the cliff with Freedom to Farm, saying we have this new idea--not a very good idea, incidentally--but a new idea called Freedom to Farm. Now, after 3 years of tourniquets, having had to pass three 
   successive economic assistance packages to make up for the deficiency, we all ought to understand that we have to change the underlying farm bill. 
   This legislation includes a substantial amount of resources at a time when those resources will be critically important to our family farmers. I have said, and I will say it again--I think repetition is probably important, at least to make this point--while I think there is a better way to move these resources to rural America, it is critical at this point, given the collapsed grain prices, to send these resources out now. This help will give farmers some hope. 
   Our family farmers are not some anachronism that does not fit in today's economy. As I said, there are some who think it is like the little diner that got left behind when the interstate came in--it is nostalgia to think about, but not really a significant part of our future economy. 
   People who think that way, in my judgment, are fundamentally wrong.  Go to rural America and learn from where the seedbed of family values comes. Understand the value of rural values in this country and the rolling of those values from family farms to small towns to big cities, and what it has done to nourish and refresh the values of our country. Then tell me somehow families living on America's farms don't count and don't matter. 
   The fact is, they face economic challenges almost no one else faces. A small family unit trying to run a farm puts a seed in the ground and has no idea whether that seed will grow. It might get too much rain; it might not. Maybe this seed won't get enough rain. It might hail; it might not. Maybe insects will come. Maybe not. Maybe crop disease will destroy it. Maybe not. 
   If they survive all those uncertainties, maybe they will get it off in time to go to an elevator and discover they have lost $1.50 a bushel for every bushel they raised. They get hit with this loss after all their months of work, starting with the tractor in the spring to plow the furrows to plant the seeds all the way to the combining in the fall to get it in off the field and into the grain elevator. 
   The lack of connection here is striking. So many hundreds of millions of people are hungry and our grain markets tell us the food produced by family farmers has no value. 
   It is a striking paradox. 
   In conclusion, I thank my friends, Senator HARKIN and Senator LUGAR, for whom I have great regard, for what they have done in this legislation. I urge my colleagues to come back, after we pass this legislation--and I shall gladly vote for it--to reform the fundamental farm program itself. If we do that, we will not then have to be continually passing emergency economic assistance packages, as we are doing today with the crop insurance reform bill. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. I noticed in the Washington Post this morning an editorial I wanted to comment on briefly. Those noted experts on agriculture and the farm program who write editorials for the Washington Post have written an editorial today entitled ``A Deal Too Sweet'' about the sugar program. I can just see them sitting out there in their Big Ben coveralls dumping sugar into their coffee, cogitating about America's sugar program and America's farm program. I want to suggest to them to look in a different direction. 
   They see a program in this country where sugar prices are kept far too high, in their judgment. They believe the market for sugar would produce prices at just a fraction of what the sugar program currently provides sugar producers. I fear the Washington Post just does not understand the sugar program or the market. 
   Most sugar in this world is traded contract to contract between countries. Very little is traded in the open market. What is traded in the open market is the surplus or the dumped sugar. This dumped sugar is traded at very low prices, but that does not reflect the cost of sugar that is traded between countries. 
   For a number of reasons, the sugar program is not working as well as it had in the past. For a long period of time the sugar program provided both stable prices for consumers and also stable income, or stable support for  sugar producers. Is this a worthwhile goal? I think it is. 
   We have seen times in this country when the sugar prices spiked up, up, way up, which was a terrible disadvantage to America's consumers. We have seen circumstances as well where farm income has dipped way down. That was devastating to producers. At least with respect to this commodity, sugar, we developed a program that provides stability for both consumers and producers. This makes sense to me. 
   The sugar program has not worked as well in recent months and years. The reason, in my judgment, is because the current underlying farm program has not worked. As prices have collapsed for most other commodities, and as we have pulled the rug out from under producers with a farm program called Freedom to Farm, we have had more acreage put into sugar production in this country. 
   In addition to that, we have had molasses stuffed with sugar coming in from Canada, which is just another method of transporting sugar into this country in excess of the amount agreed to by our trade agreements. We have a significant threat from Mexico, despite what we thought was an agreement on sugar, so we have a whole series of threats to those who produce sugar--cane and beet--in this country. 
   The Washington Post would make the case: Let's just get rid of the sugar program. Others will probably make the same case. It would be interesting to ask the following question, and perhaps get an answer from the Washington Post and others who believe this. The question would be: While sugar prices have fallen by a fourth since 1996, has anyone seen a reduction in the price of sugar at the grocery store? Let me repeat, prices to the producer have fallen by one-fourth; has anyone seen a reduction in the price of sugar at the store? What about candy bars, cereal, ice cream, cookies? 
   The answer is no. In fact, during that same period of time, while the price of sugar to the producer has fallen by a fourth, those prices--candy, cereal, ice cream, cookies, and cake--are up 7 to 10 percent. 
   The point is this. This program has worked and can work again if we have a decent farm bill. But it will not work in the long term unless we amend and change the Freedom to Farm legislation which is the underlying problem with all farm commodity prices. 
   This is not the time, and we should not allow those who preach it to decide the sugar program ought to be repealed. The sugar program has worked, and it is good for sugar producers and consumers in this country. 
   I wanted to make the case that those who editorialize about it, including this morning's editorial, in my judgment, are wrong. I respect their opinion, but I think they are wrong. It is, once again, a question not just for those who produce sugar--in my part of the country, there are family farmers who raise sugar beets--it is a question of do we want to have family farmers in this country's future. 
   Some say family farmers are a little old diner that got left behind when the interstate came through. Yes, it is nostalgic, yesterday's news, let's just get on with big corporate farms. I do not believe that. I believe family farmers contribute to the value and culture of this country in a significant way. If we decide there is no virtue between the crevices of mathematics and concentration--if we decide family farms do not matter--this country will have lost something significant, in my opinion. 
   One part of needed farm policy change, but an important part for those who produce sugar beets in our country, is the retention of a decent sugar program that provides some stability of income for producers. I hope my colleagues will understand this in the coming weeks and months as we begin discussing the farm program and related issues such as the sugar program.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, what piqued my interest last Friday and this morning was the announcement of the trade deficit. It is interesting to me, the deafening silence that occurs in this Chamber and around this town especially regarding the monthly announcement of our trade deficit. 
   I prepared a chart that shows our growing and alarming bilateral merchandise trade deficits. This is last year, 1999. As announced on Friday, our monthly merchandise trade deficit rose to $37 billion. We have a surplus in our services trade balance, so if services are included the net effect is a $30 billion merchandise and services deficit. In other words, we buy $1 billion a day more from other countries than we sell to other countries--$1 billion a day. 
   What does that mean? It means that is the debt we have and the liability we incur. 
   Does it matter? We had people doing handstands and having apoplectic seizures on the floor of the Senate for years and years about the fiscal policy deficit. They would come and talk about the Federal budget deficit, what a god-awful thing it was--and it was--$300 billion a year and rising out of sight. 
   With respect to this merchandise and services deficit--$30 billion a month net, $37 billion with respect to merchandise or manufactured goods, over $1 billion a day--one cannot find anybody who pays any attention to it or cares much about it. Why? Because the institutional thinkers in this country, once again on Friday, were genuflecting, as they always do when this news comes out, about how the deficit is not such a bad deal. This trade deficit means America is growing faster than other countries. If we are growing faster than other countries, then naturally we will be buying more from abroad and perhaps selling less to them. We will therefore have this trade deficit. 
   These are the same economists, the same ``thinkers,'' who told us in 1994: Why do we have a trade deficit? Because we have a fiscal policy deficit. If we get rid of the budget deficit, we will get rid of the trade deficit. 
   I can give names, but they are embarrassed when I read their quotes with their names. They are the same economists who said we have a trade deficit because we have a budget deficit. They said the trade deficit will be gone once the budget deficit is gone. No, that is not the reason at all. We do not have a trade deficit 
   because we are growing faster than other countries. That is an absurd contention, just absurd. 
   We have a trade deficit with China because our country is growing faster than China? No, China has an economy which is growing very rapidly. Our trade deficit with China, which is very close to $70 billion a year, is because we are buying more from China than they are buying from us. Is that because they do not need things? No, it is because they are buying from other countries instead of us. 
   Why do we allow that to happen? Because we are weak-kneed and do not have a backbone. Our country has never had the backbone to say to other countries: You must have a reciprocal trade relationship with us. If we are going to treat you in a certain way and we welcome you into our marketplace, then we must be welcome in your marketplace. We have never had the backbone to do that. 
   On Friday, the merchandise trade deficit with Japan increased from $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion. That means, with Japan, we have a merchandise trade deficit approaching $80 billion. How many years do you have to have $50 billion, $60 billion, $70 billion, $80 billion trade deficits with the same country before someone will stand up and say: There is something wrong here. They keep selling us all of their goods, but they buy what they need from others. 
   I represent, for example, ranchers. I know I mentioned this before. I represent farmers and ranchers and others. Every pound of American beef going into Japan today has a 38.5-percent tariff on it. This is a country that has a nearly $80 billion trade surplus with us, or we have a deficit with them. Send a T-bone steak from Dickinson, ND, to Tokyo, Japan, and there is going to be a 38.5-percent tariff on the T-bone steak. What is that about? Does one think we would be considered a massive failure in international trade as a country if we had 38.5-percent tariffs on products imported into our country? Of course we would. 
   Yet we have a trade relationship with Japan that allows them to have a 38.5-percent tariff on beef--this is after we reached an agreement with them, by the way. We had a big trade agreement for beef producers about 10 years ago.  At the end, one would have thought these folks just won the Olympics. They celebrated and had a day of feasting and rejoicing because this country had this great trade agreement with Japan. Yes, we have gotten more beef into Japan, but every pound of beef today that goes into Japan has a 38.5-percent tariff on it. That is outrageous. 
   I will go through a couple of other countries to close the loop. 
   Mexico. We have a trade agreement with Mexico called NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. I remember the two economists, Hufbauer and Schott. They said if we do this trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, this country will have 300,000 or so new jobs. 
   At the time, we had a trade surplus with Mexico. That trade surplus with Mexico is now over a $20 billion trade deficit. Immediately after we passed NAFTA, signed a new trade agreement with Mexico, and reduced tariffs on United States goods going into Mexico, Mexico devalued its currency and washed out any gains. In fact, the devaluation was much higher in terms of its effect on the tariffs, so it more than washed out any gains. A trade surplus with Mexico was turned into a very large trade deficit. The trade deficit with Mexico in March was $1.9 billion--for just a month. 
   What about Canada? Canada had a modest trade surplus with us, or we had a modest trade deficit with Canada, and then we passed NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. The announcement Friday said the goods deficit with Canada is now $3.9 billion, almost $4 billion. Our annual deficit with Canada is somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 billion to $40 billion. 
   With respect to the European Union, Friday the announcement was that the merchandise trade deficit with the European Union rose from $3.5 billion in February to $5.7 billion in March, the most recent month for which data has been reported. 
   I will comment on our trade deficits with Japan and Mexico a little later. 
   I taught economics briefly in college. I understand about economists. It is much less a discipline than it is some psychology pumped up with helium. It is just being able to say anything at any time about almost any subject. 
   This is what the economists say. 
   In today's Wall Street Journal, Mr. Wiegand says:  
   This deficit will start to shrink as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to slow the U.S. economy.  
   Oh, yes, that is probably a pretty good solution: Drive the economy into the ditch. That will probably take care of it. I do not dispute them. If Alan Greenspan continues to choke the neck of the American economy and drives this economy into the ditch, yes, I suspect we will probably be buying less from abroad. It is probably not very good medicine to kill what ails us, in my judgment. 
   The person who wrote this article in today's Wall Street Journal did not provide the name of the analyst. These are just anonymous analysts:  
   Analysts say they remain sanguine because the underlying fundamentals that fuel the deficit remain unchanged. America's economy is stronger than the economies of trading partners, and that's why we have these trade deficits.  
   That is absurd, just absurd. Why do we have a big trade deficit with Japan? It is because we lack a backbone. For 15 years, we have allowed Japan to throw their goods into our marketplace and keep their marketplace relatively closed to American goods. The same is true with China. The same is true with many other countries. 
   This country needs to have the backbone to say to other countries: Here is a mirror. Look closely because what you see in that mirror is what you will get. You are welcome to come into our country with your goods and services. Our consumers welcome them, and we welcome them. But you should understand, the price for admission to the American marketplace is that your markets be open to our producers, to the products of our workers and our production plants. If it is not, then you are going to pay a price for that. 
   About 30 to 40 percent of Chinese exports are sent to the United States. We are a ``cash cow'' for China's hard currency needs. There is no substitute on Earth for the American marketplace. China needs this marketplace. The closing of this marketplace would lead China to collapse immediately. Mr. President, 30 to 40 percent of their exports are to the U.S. economy. 
   So we say to China: That's all right. You keep shipping all your products here. Ship us your shirts and your shoes and your trousers and your trinkets. You keep shipping all the merchandise you want to the United States, and that's fine if you want to prevent us from accessing your marketplace. 
   We just negotiated a bilateral trade agreement with China. We had folks up all night over in Beijing and here. They were working back and forth and trading and doing the things you do when you negotiate a trade agreement. They finished a trade agreement. The vote we are going to have in the House this week, and subsequently, perhaps a week or two later in the Senate, is not about this trade agreement. We do not get the opportunity to vote on the bilateral trade agreement with China. The vote is going to be: Do we accord China permanent normal trade relations? 
   I have voted for normal trade relations in the past. The only difference in this vote is: Shall it be permanent? But it is not a vote on the bilateral trade agreement with China. Frankly, I do not know how I am going to vote on permanent NTR. At this point, I am leaning, perhaps, to vote in favor of it, but only if it includes a commission to monitor trade compliance--because China 
   has made other agreements with us and has not complied with them at all--and only if it provides some responsible monitoring of human rights in China. 
   But having said all that, these votes are not about the bilateral trade agreement. We do not need PNTR to do what we should do with China. In Washington, DC, because there are so many interests here that are working on this PNTR issue, you can't turn on the television without seeing another ad by big interest groups that are saying: You must vote for China PNTR. 
   Regrettably, they misstate it. They say: If we don't vote for PNTR, the Chinese marketplace will not be open. That is absurd. It does not make any sense at all. 
   The vote on China PNTR isn't about whether the Chinese marketplace is open; it is a vote on whether normal trade relations with China will be made permanent--just that; and only that. It is not even a vote on the bilateral trade agreement we reached with China last year. 
   Having said all that, as I said, I voted for normal trade relations previously. I think China is going to be a significant influence in our lives, and I prefer it be a good influence rather than a bad one. I happen to think that involvement is preferable to noninvolvement. But that does not excuse the relationship that exists between China and the United States in which our trade negotiators come so far short of reaching an agreement that is in our interest. I will give you an example. 
   China has 1.2 billion people. On the issue of automobiles in the recently negotiated agreement with China, after a phase-in period, there will remain in China a 25-percent tariff on any automobiles the U.S. would send to China. Any automobiles that China would send to the U.S. would have a 2.5-percent tariff. So China will retain a tariff that is 10 times higher than the U.S. on vehicles moving back and forth. This is a country that has a nearly $70 billion surplus with us. 
   I ask the question: Why? Why would a negotiator sit across the table and agree to a proposition that China can have a tariff that is 10 times higher on automobiles than we can? 
   The answer? The answer is: It is so much better than it was. The old tariff on automobiles was so much higher. We brought it down so far. 
   I said: Why don't you sit down at the table, and hitch up your belt, and say, All right, let's begin negotiating reciprocal policies and the same tariff. Why can't our negotiators do that? 
   Our trade negotiators would say: Oh, you can't do that because we are starting from different points. 
   It is time we start from the same point. It is time we demand that our trade negotiators begin dealing with this trade deficit with respect to what is really causing it. 
   These economists are wrong when they say the problem is that our country is growing too fast, other countries  are growing too slow, and therefore we have a big deficit. The reason we have a big deficit is that when China wants to buy airplanes China says: We are going to manufacture the airplanes in China. That is not the way you do business. If they are going to sell us all their commodities, then they have a responsibility to buy from us what we have to sell. If they need airplanes, they ought to buy airplanes built in the United States of America. If they need wheat, they ought to buy wheat from the United States. In other words, trade relationships ought to be reciprocal. But our trade negotiators never require that. 
   Is this a criticism of the current administration? You bet--the past administration, and every administration for the last 20 years. None of them have had any backbone. 
   I stand here and talk about this because the trade deficit report came out last Friday, and it said that the merchandise and services trade deficit was $30 billion in a month. That is roughly $340 billion a year more in manufactured goods that the United 
   States bought than it sold. 
   I know I will have people listening to this who will say: That guy is just a protectionist. They are wrong. I am not a protectionist in the definition of the word used pejoratively. One who seeks protection is somebody who wants to build a wall around the country and keep everybody out. That is not my view of it at all. We have a global economy. We have an expanding reach of opportunities around the world. 
   But this country has to understand that times have changed. After the end of the Second World War, for the first 25 years, our trade policy was almost universally foreign policy. We would engage with another country with one hand tied behind our back, and say: Do you want some help? Here is a trade policy that is concessional to you because you're struggling, you're flat on your back, your economy is devastated because of the Second World War. We want to help you get back on your feet. Therefore, our trade policy was largely foreign policy. That was fine because we could beat anybody with one hand tied behind our back. 
   But the second 25 years post-Second World War have been different. We have shrewd, tough, economic competitors. We have still tied the hands of America's producers and America's workers, and have provided concessional terms in trade negotiations to virtually every other country. 
   That is the only basis that you could excuse a recurring trade deficit with Japan that is $50 and $60 and, now, $70 billion a year--year after year after year after year. The only thing you can call that is neglect--yes, by Republican administrations and Democratic administrations. That is neglect. 
   People who hear this will say: That guy just doesn't understand that you can't see over the horizon. He does not understand all this. The problem is, I think I do understand it. 
   In the budget deficit debates, we used to have people come to the floor and say: Think of it in terms of your own family. If you're running up a deficit, you have to pay it sometime, don't you? 
   Think of the trade deficit in terms of your own family unit. If the country is your family, and you are buying much more than you are selling and, therefore, incurring a deficit that continues to grow, is that a problem? Will it at some point come back and bite you? Will that be a problem for this country? Will it inhibit America's economic growth? Will the fact that the current accounts' deficit--measured by recurring trade deficits--allows foreigners to hold American dollars with which they can make decisions about whether to invest in this country, and how to invest in this country, be a problem for this country? 
   I think it is. My only point is that last Friday should not pass without notice--a Friday in which we say the merchandise and services trade deficit is now $30 billion this month alone. That news occurs at the same time the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board says our country is growing too rapidly and we need to slow it down with another one-half of 1 percent interest rate increase. 
   Well, I am telling you, I think the combination of those two pieces of economic news ought to be very sobering to all Americans. Yet, as I said when I started, there is this deafening silence in the Chamber. Almost nobody will come and talk about the trade deficit because they will be branded by especially the corporate world as people who don't understand, who want to build a wall around this country, people who are protectionists. Yes, I want to protect America's economic interests. Of course, I do. I am an American and, of course, I want to do that. 
   But I believe the protection of our interests involves understanding that the economy has changed. This is a global economy but we must have fair trade rules. If we decide as a country that nothing matters that we fought about for the last 100 years, and that the globalization of our economy somehow should pole-vault over all of those issues, then we will, in my judgment, have lost substantial ground. We had people die in the streets in this country. They were shot and clubbed to death because they fought for the basic principle of workers being able to organize. People died for that right in this country. 
   Some companies will say: I know was a problem in America because you have all these collective bargaining issues. The way to get rid of that issue is we will take our manufacturing plant and close it. We will move to a country where workers can't organize, and we will not have those problems. People in this country fought so long for a minimum wage and a livable wage. A company might say: We can solve that issue. We don't have to deal with minimum wages. We will move this plant from the United States to Bangladesh, and we won't have to pay minimum wages. People fought a long time over the issue of child labor. They may say: Well, we can solve that. We will move our plant overseas and we will put 12-year-olds in the plant and we will pay them 12 cents an hour. We will work them 14 hours a day, and we won't have to meet plant safety standards. That is an easy way to pole-vault over those issues. 
   How about dumping chemicals into the streams or into the air? A company can say: We can solve those issues. You know that plant where we are going to hire kids to work, and pay them 12 cents an hour, and work them 14 hours a day, and not worry about safety? We can also dump the raw chemicals into the water and into the air. 
   Well, that raises the question, I am afraid: Should there be an admission price to the American marketplace? Should the admission price be at least that there are fair rules of trade? I have asked folks, and one honestly said to me he thought it was fine. If the marketplace decided that you can amass the capital and employ kids in unsafe conditions and pay them pennies, if you can produce a product the consumer wants, it is fine for that product to be in our marketplace. I respectfully disagree with that perspective. Globalization requires the attendance of rules, in my judgment, that relate to the kinds of issues we fought over for 100 years in this country. 
   Others would say, well, you are trying to export American values. There you have it. That is exactly what is necessary in the global economy--exporting the values of saying that fair competition is not competition with 12-year-old kids being paid 12 cents an hour. Fair competition is not competition between a plant in Pittsburgh that has to meet air pollution standards and water pollution standards, competing with a plant owned by the same company somewhere that can dump all of their chemicals into the streams and into the air. 
   Those are our range of issues with which we have to deal. All 
   of those issues, incidentally, relate to a very significant and unhealthy growth in this country's trade deficit. 
   Let me come back for a moment to the vote that will be very controversial on China's permanent normal trade relations. Last week--and I know I digress here--I was thinking of coming to the floor and submitting in a bill that says the Federal Reserve Board cannot go into a room and lock the door in something called the ``Open Market Committee'' and continue to call it open. I was thinking of putting in a bill that requires them to call this a ``closed market committee.'' If they are going to lock the American people out, they should not call it an open committee. Just as I was thinking of  doing that--and I decided against it for the moment--we ought not to call it normal trade relations with China, or Japan, or, for that matter, Europe; we ought not to call normal trade relations a circumstance that give us a $50 billion, $60 billion, $70 billion, or $80 billion trade deficit. There is nothing normal about our trade relations with Japan. There is nothing normal about having a $50 billion, $60 billion, or $70 billion trade deficit every single year. That is abnormal. Now, I could not get the votes, perhaps, to rename that ``abnormal trade relations,'' but it is not normal, and we ought not to consider it normal to have this sort of circumstance exist. 
   In the last decade, it has gotten worse, not better. The mantra of so-called ``thinkers'' who are quoted--incidentally, they are the same people because when reporters write the stories, they call the same people, ``thinkers''. These same people have put the same quotes in the stories every month for 10 years. Even though the times have changed and the thinkers were demonstrated to not be accurate, they just change their story. That is why the story has changed now from their original saying that when we had a budget deficit you are therefore going to have a trade deficit. They say now that wasn't it; now it is because we are growing too fast. There must be some familial relationship here with the Chairman of the Fed because he also thinks we are growing too fast. It must be the same group of thinkers. There must be a genetic code that exists between these folks. 
   Again, I digress. I came to the floor to simply say I don't want Friday's notice of this dramatic increase in the trade deficit to not be discussed at least at some length in the Senate. It is important that we discuss it and begin to provide remedies for it. 
   Mr. President, how much time remains?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there are a lot of issues in the Senate with which we ought to be dealing. Most of the important issues we are avoiding. Now, there exists in this Congress something called a Patients' Bill of Rights. It is in conference and we can't get it back. Why? Because big money interests have decided they want to block it; they don't want a Patients' Bill of Rights. We ought to have that on the floor of the Senate and the House, out of this conference, and we should pass a decent Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   We ought to be able to employ the opportunities to offer amendments on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act when it is here and strengthen this country's education system. But are we able to do that? No. 
   We also have a juvenile justice bill that is trying to close a loophole in gun shows. When you buy a gun, you have to run your name through an instant check to see whether you are a felon. If you are a felon, you don't have the right to own a gun. It would close the gun show loophole. Now you can go to a gun show and buy a gun and you don't have to run your name against anything. A felon can buy a gun, regrettably. That is not anti-gun; it is a moderate, thoughtful step to extend the instant check. That is in the juvenile justice bill. That is not on the floor of the Senate. 
   This Senate has been at parade rest for some long while. It 
   is time to take action on the things the American people want us to act on. We ought to deal with a Patients' Bill of Rights, and we ought to bring to the floor of the Senate the legislation that deals with the gun show loophole in the juvenile justice bill. We ought to have an opportunity to debate the Elementary and Secondary Education Act without somebody hovering and saying: Before you do that, I have to approve the amendments you offer. There are no gatekeepers here. The rules of the Senate don't provide for gatekeepers. 
   In the coming months, we have the opportunity to address health care, education, juvenile justice, and things that matter in this country. The only reason they are not on the floor of the Senate with extended debate, or out of conference which exists now, is because the leadership doesn't want them on the floor of the Senate. I must say that in the coming weeks and months we intend to do everything we can possibly do within the rules of this Senate to make sure those are the issues we debate in the Senate this year.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, allow me to tell you today about the extraordinary efforts of our youth volunteers we have across the country. Last week, there were week-long activities and ceremonies to honor over 100 young people chosen for their exceptional volunteer projects from across the nation as part of the 2000 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program. 
   I specifically want to congratulate eighteen-year-old Jason Koth of Grand Forks, North Dakota, and fifteen-year-old Scot Miller of Fargo, North Dakota, both from my home state. They were named the top high school and middle level youth volunteers in North Dakota last February, and were two out of 104 youth honored out of millions of youth in the United States. 
   Jason was recognized for his fund-raising efforts for the Make-a-Wish Foundation. Scot helped raise funds for a city library expansion project and started a community recycling program. In recognition of their community involvement, they each received a $1,000 cash award, an engraved silver medallion and an all-expense paid trip to Washington, D.C., for last week's events. 
   I am honored to have been a part of the 2000 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards Ceremony on May 8, where Senator SUSAN COLLINS and I had the opportunity to recognize the outstanding accomplishments of this group of youth volunteers. 
   The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards were created by Prudential in 1995 to encourage youth volunteerism and to identify and reward young role models. It operates in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals. 
   We should all take a moment to feel great pride in our nation's youth. These students show exactly what type of compassion and commitment is possible at any age. With their community spirit, our future is in good hands.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a meeting started 1 hour and 5 minutes ago at 20th Street and Constitution Avenue here in Washington, DC. The Federal Reserve Board is meeting in a large room in a building that takes up nearly the entire block. 
   No one in this Chamber is allowed at that meeting. No ordinary American citizen is allowed at this meeting. The door is locked. They are meeting behind closed doors at the Federal Reserve Board to decide how much they want to raise interest rates once again. 
   I think it is important to allow people to see who is meeting. Here are the pictures of the folks at the Fed--the Federal Board of Governors. The ones with the stars are the regional Federal Reserve bank presidents who will make the decision this morning. 
   They increased interest rates last June, in August, in November, in February, and again in March. In North Dakota, in Idaho, in Illinois, and in California, the average American household is now paying $1,200 a year in additional interest charges as a result. If you have a $100,000 mortgage, you are paying $100 a month more for your mortgage payment. Why? Because the Federal Reserve Board feels that too many people are working in this country and that our economic growth ought to be slowed. 
   If you ask them about the circumstance, they would say: We really have controlled inflation; it is because we have increased interest rates that inflation has been under control. 
   That is like the weatherman taking credit for the sunshine. The fact is, this economy has worked in spite of the Federal Reserve Board. 
   This Federal Reserve Board, under Mr. Greenspan's tutelage, has added nearly a three-quarters of 1 percent increase in the real Federal funds rate during his term versus the 20 years prior. It has added nearly a two percent increase in the real prime rate during the Greenspan years versus the prior years. They have leaned and tilted their interest rate policies towards the big banking center interests, and against the consumer's interest and against the taxpayers' interests. 
   By what justification would they increase interest rates this morning? This morning the Consumer Price Index came out. It is flat; plumb flat. The Producer Price Index from last month was down. The core inflation rate is down. 
   By what justification will the Federal Reserve Board decide to charge higher interest rates on the American people? They say, in a Washington Post article by John Berry, that the new theory of the Fed is that if worker productivity is up in this country, it puts pressure on the economy, and, therefore, they should raise interest rates to slow down the economy. 
   What a prosperous notion. It used to be when I came to the floor and indicated that the Fed complained workers were getting more money, or there was a threat that they would get more money but their productivity wasn't rising, the Fed used to say that is inherently inflationary. Now what they say is that it doesn't matter how productive they are; in fact, the more productive they are, the more likely it is the Fed wants to raise interest rates. 
   Talk about people flying blind. I learned to fly an airplane about a quarter century ago. I remember that as you do your solo cross-country flying the airplane, you have to learn to rely on instruments. How do you know where you are going? You have to read your instruments? The fact is, the Federal Reserve Board doesn't have instruments that work anymore. 
   To the extent you could picture a group of bankers in gray suits and wearing goggles, with a leather helmet and a silk scarf--to the extent you could picture them flying and flying blind--I respectfully say they are flying in the wrong direction and are perfectly happy to do so even when told. 
   The thing that I find interesting is this: We have an economy that has been remarkably strong. The Fed has been remarkably wrong all along. They have said our economy cannot grow more than 2 1/2 percent, and if it does we are going to have more inflation. It has and we haven't. 
   They have said that unemployment can't go below 6 percent. If it does, we will have more inflation. Unemployment has been below 6 percent for 5 years, and inflation has been down. 
   The Federal Reserve Board has been wrong about the performance of this economy. Yet as they write about the Fed, they simply take what the Fed says, print it, and they print no discussion about the alternatives. So we have no real debate about this. 
   The interesting thing is 30 years ago a one-quarter percent increase in interest rates proposed by McChesney Martin caused an outcry in this country. It was front-page headlines. Lyndon Johnson was President. He called this guy down to the ranch in Texas and put pressure on him all the weekend. It was front-page news. Today the Fed can go behind closed doors and raise interest rates one-half percent, and nobody seems to mind. 
   All of these chairs are largely empty in the Senate. I wonder where people are. What if someone were to bring to the floor of the Senate a proposal that said, what we would like to do is 
   increase taxes on the average household in this country by $1,210 a year. If there were a proposal to increase taxes in the amount of $1,210 a year, all of these chairs would be full. There would be a raging debate, and all of the folks would come to the floor to talk about taxes. They would be hollering and bellowing. 
   But guess what. You can increase interest rates five, six, or seven times by the Federal Reserve, and impose an additional $1,210 a year interest charge on the average household, and there is not a whimper. 
   Again, let me give credit where credit is due. All of these folks look alike. They largely think alike. All of them wear gray suits. All of them have a banking background. When they close the doors and lock the American citizens out down at the Federal Reserve Board, they are going to make a banking decision. 
   What is the banking decision? They increase interest rates on the American people in order to protect the big banking center interests. 
   The point is this: There is no inflation. There is no evidence of inflation. 
   It is going to be uncomfortable for the Fed. But of course they do not deal with comforts. Once they close the doors, they have all the comforts at hand. 
   Just this morning the Consumer Price Index was announced, and it is flat; no inflation. 
   Just this morning--a little over an hour ago--they went into the room, closed the doors, and locked everybody else out. Guess what they are going to decide. They will announce that they have decided, despite the fact there is no inflation, because American workers are more productive that justifies an increase in the interest rates. 
   Why if the American worker is more productive should the American worker not be entitled to a better share of income? Of course, they should. That is not inflationary. But the Federal Reserve Board has now concocted this goofy new theory that says if the American worker is more productive, they must impose an added charge on the average American. 
   You talk about people who can't think. I don't understand. Maybe they need to loosen all those neckties. But there is something wrong at the Fed. 
   I would be happy to yield for a question.

If these folks at a time when there is no additional inflation raise interest rates once again to try to slow down this economy and penalize the American workforce for being more productive, we will know in 5 minutes that is a mistake.

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I thought I had seen some fairly unusual and Byzantine proposals around this town, but one that was described in last Friday's Washington Post almost takes the cake. Going back some years, there was a proposal by the U.S. Post Office that would allow people to file change of address forms in the event of a nuclear war. I thought that was rather bizarre. One can imagine being under nuclear attack and trying to find the road to the post office to leave a forwarding address. That is not very likely. There is a proposal even goofier than that. 
   On Friday, May 12, John Berry, a Washington Post staff writer--someone for whom I have respect and he is an excellent writer and thinker--wrote an article about ``Rate Forecasts Climbing.'' He was talking about interest rates. John describes the thinking of some members of the Federal Reserve Board and the Open Market Committee about what they intend to do with interest rates. I wish that this story, however, included an analysis of opposing views and there are some. 
   Here is the situation: Tomorrow morning at 9:30, there will be a meeting in this town of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and regional Fed bank presidents--five of them--who will make decisions about interest rates. The speculation is they will increase interest rates by one-half of 1 percent despite the fact there is no evidence of inflation that suggests they should do this. 
   It is the same as deciding they are going to tax the American people. In fact, the rate increases last June, August, November, February, March, and now tomorrow--we will have another, mark my words--those rate increases have added about $1,210 in interest charges to the average household. If one has a $100,000 home mortgage, one is paying $100 more a month because of what the Federal Reserve Board has done. Every household is paying on average some $1,210 more per year in interest charges. 
   That is from the folks who meet in secret and effectively impose a tax on every single American. The only difference is, when it is done in this Chamber in the form of taxation, there is a debate and then a vote. It is done in the open. Tomorrow, the Federal Reserve Board will deal with interest rate questions in secret. 
   At 9:30, if those who are paying attention to C-SPAN want to go down to the Federal Reserve Board and say, I want to be involved in this discussion, they will be told: No, you cannot be involved; this is secret; the doors are locked; we intend to make decisions about your life and you can have no involvement. 
   Here is what the Washington Post article said about what these folks are going to think tomorrow which I think is bizarre. They are saying that American workers are becoming more productive and because the productivity of the American worker is up, they believe that justifies higher interest rates. 
   It used to be the same economists who cannot remember, in most cases, their home telephone numbers and their home addresses but who can tell us what is going to happen 5 years or 7  years from now, would say our problem is we have inflation pressures in this country because we do not have increases in productivity. If we have increases in productivity, that will deal with all of the other pressures that come to bear on the economy and offset them. 
   Now they are saying, but if workers become more productive, we are going to have to raise interest rates. You see, they are concerned about workers' pay. If workers in this country receive more pay, they say that is inflationary. So the workers are kind of stuck, aren't they? 
   The Fed has already said, if workers receive more money, that is going to drive up inflation. But in the past they have said, if workers' productivity goes up, that will be all right, because you can receive more money if you have greater productivity, right? You ought to. American workers ought to expect they would be able to share in their increased productivity and increased output. 
   Now the Fed is saying: That is not right either. Workers can be more productive, but we don't intend to see them get more money. We intend to continue to raise interest rates to slow down the American economy. 
   If workers in America become more productive, the Fed wants to go into a room tomorrow and penalize them--all of them. Talk about a goofy idea. 
   I was going to go through the entire article. I will not. 
   But let me do this, as I conclude. The folks who are going to do this, they all have gray suits, they all look like bankers, and they all think like bankers. They all have worked there for 100 years. These folks are confirmed by the Congress. To be appointed to the Board of Governors, they have to be confirmed by the Senate. But these other folks also serve on that Open Market Committee on a rotating basis--tomorrow five of them will be in a room with the Board of Governors. They are not confirmed by us. They represent their regional Federal Reserve Banks. They are all presidents of the regional banks. They are going to be voting. 
   I could have described what they said in that article. I could have described what Cathy Minehan said in that article. Strange. I don't understand this at all. Workers are more productive, and therefore you must penalize them? It used to be that people would say, if workers were more productive, they would be able to expect to receive more wages. 
   None of you folks down at the Fed has ever given a whit about the top executives in this country who earn $1 million, $5 million, $10 million, $100 million, or $200 million a year. You all have seen those numbers. I have spoken about some of them on the floor. It does not matter to these folks if the upper crust is getting a lot of money. But let the American workers get a gain in productivity and an increase in wages, and then you have these folks running in a room, closing the door, and, in secret, deciding they want to impose another higher interest rate on the American people. There is no justification for it at all. 
   The core Producer Price Index is up only three-tenths of 1 percent over the past 6 months. Retail sales are down. Auto sales fell seven-tenths of 1 percent--the second straight monthly drop. Building material sales are down 1.6 percent. These are the last monthly figures. There is no justification at all. 
   The only thing I can conceive of is these people just do not sleep. They see things that do not exist. Imagine how they must feel when the lights are turned off. They see inflation that does not exist. 
   For nearly a year they have been worried about inflation that does not exist. They have been willing to impose a penalty on the American economy and the average American household to the tune of $1,210 a year. 
   What do you think people would say if this Congress said: We have a proposal; let's increase taxes on the American people $1,210 a year on the average household? They would have apoplectic seizures around here. But these folks are doing it in secret, with no justification at all. Why? Because they tilt on the side of money center banks on the question of monetary policy. They always tilt that way. It is funny they can stand up, they tilt so far. 
   It seems to me this country deserves a monetary policy that allows workers in our factories, on our main streets, in our towns, to be more productive and to be able to receive the rewards of that increased productivity. 
   If these folks close that door tomorrow--and they will; mark my words--and increase interest rates another full one-half percent--and that is likely what they are going to do--they are going to continue to injure this economy and injure the American workers. 
   I said before that Mr. Greenspan has sort of used himself as a set of human brake pads. His only mission in life somehow is to slow down the American economy. He has always insisted we could not grow more than 2.5 percent without more inflation and that we couldn't go below 6 percent unemployment without more inflation. He has been wrong on both counts. We have been below 6 percent unemployment for 5 years, and inflation has gone down. We have had more than 2.5-percent economic growth for some long while, and inflation has gone down. 
   At some point, the American people, through this Congress, ought to ask the tough questions of this Federal Reserve Board: How do you continue to justify this? How do you justify this at a time when there is no evidence of real inflationary trouble in this country, risking ruining our economy, ruining continuous economic growth for some while and imposing on the backs of the American citizen, on the backs of the average families in this country, such a significant penalty? It is wrong, wrong, wrong. 
   I will have more to say about this tomorrow, after the Federal Reserve Board meeting. 
   Madam President, I guess that ends the business for today. 
   I yield back my time.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to be opposing the amendment offered by my colleague, Senator LIEBERMAN. He, I know, has thought a great deal about education issues. I admire his commitment to education. But we come at this from slightly different perspectives. 
   I want to speak not so much about the amendment that is before us but a bit more about the underlying issue that brings us to this intersection of the debate on this bill. 
   We know that in this country the education system needs some repair  and adjustment. I happen to think many schools in this country perform very well. As I have said before on the floor of this Senate, I go into a lot of classrooms, as do many of my colleagues. I challenge anyone to go into these classrooms and come out of that classroom and say: Gee, that was not a good teacher. I have deep respect and high regard for most of the teachers I have had the opportunity to watch in the classrooms in this country. 
   But there is almost a boast here in the Senate by some that we do not want to have any national aspirations or goals for our education system. I do not know why people do that. Our elementary and secondary education system is run by local school boards and the State legislatures. That is as it should be. 
   No one is proposing that we transfer control of school systems to the federal government. But we are saying that, as a country, as taxpayers, as parents, as a nation, we ought to have some basic goals of what we expect to get out of these schools. Yet there are people who almost brag that we have no aspirations at all as a country with respect to our education system. 
   I would like to aspire to certain goals of achievement by our schools and by our kids across this country, so I am going to later offer an amendment, part of which is embodied in the Bingaman amendment, dealing with accountability, saying that every parent, every taxpayer ought to get a report card on their local school. We get report cards on students, but we ought to get a report card on how our schools are doing. It is one thing to tell the parents the child is failing. We certainly ought to know that as parents. But what if the school is failing? Let's have a report card on schools, so parents, taxpayers, and people in every State around this country can understand how their school is doing compared to other schools, compared to other States. 
   The issue of block granting, with all due respect, I think is ``block headed.'' Block granting is a way of deciding: Let's spend the money, but let's not choose. We know there are needs, for example, for school modernization. 
   I heard a speaker the other day at an issues retreat I attended who made an appropriate point that I know has been made here before. Not many years ago, we had a debate in the Senate about prisons and jails. Some of the same folks who stand up in this Chamber and say, we cannot commit any Federal money to improve America's schools, were saying, we want to commit Federal money to help State and local governments improve their jails. 
   Why is it the Federal Government's responsibility to help improve jails and prisons for local government, but when it comes to improving schools, we say that is not our responsibility? I do not understand that. Jails and prisons take priority over schools? I do not think so. It seems to me there is a contradiction here. 
   All of us have been to school districts all over this country. We have seen young children walk into classrooms we know are in desperate need of remodeling and repair. Some of them are 40, 50, 60, 80 years old. I was in one the other day that was 90 years old. The school is in desperate disrepair, and the school district has no money with which to repair it. What are we going to do about that? 
   Are we going to say those kids don't matter? Are we going to say that we are going to commit Federal dollars to education, but we don't want to know where those dollars are going? Are we going to say we don't want to direct funding to deal with the issues we know are important, such as school renovation and repair or decreasing class size by adding more teachers? Are we going to say we don't want to reach some sort of national goals because we are worried someone will mistake that for Federal control of local schools? 
   Hear it from me. I do not think we ought to try to have Federal control of local schools. The school boards and State legislatures do just fine, thank you; but there are areas where we can help, and school modernization is one of them. We were perfectly willing to jump in and renovate prisons and jails for State and local governments, but now it comes to schools and we say, no, that is not our job. It is our job.

   Mr. DORGAN. I sure am. The GAO reported about the disrepair of schools, on Indian reservations, in inner cities, all across the country. You go to poor school districts that don't have a large tax base, and you find that we are sending kids into classrooms in poor shape. We can do better than that. The GAO documents that very carefully in study after study. We must, as a nation, begin to make investments in our schools.

   Mr. DORGAN. The message is pretty clear. We talk about education, but then if the schools are in disrepair and adults do not seem to care about it, students feel that education and they themselves do not matter. I toured a school about a week ago with 150 kids. It had two bathrooms and one water fountain. It was in terrible disrepair. 
   The teacher said, ``Children, is there anything you would like to ask Senator Dorgan?'' One of the little kids who was in about the third grade raised his hand and said, ``Yes. How many bathrooms does the White House have?'' Do you know why he asked that? I think it was because that is an issue in their school. They have long lines to wait to go to the bathroom--150 kids and two bathrooms. Why is that the case? Because these kids are sent to an old school. The school district has no tax base. When we send them through the classroom door, we cannot, as Americans, be proud of that school. We must do better than that.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, over the past several days, more than 1,200 students from across the United States are in Washington to compete in the national finals of the We the People...... The Citizen and the Constitution program. I am proud to announce that the class from Wyndmere High School from Wyndmere, North Dakota represents my state in this national event. These young scholars have worked diligently to reach the national finals and through their experience have gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy. 
   The names of these students are: Brian Boyer, Mandy David, Julie Dotzenrod, Elizabeth Foertsch, Alissa Haberman, Lindsey Heitkamp, Lori Heitkamp, Daniel Hodgson, Jesse Nelson, Kari Schultz, Amy Score, John Totenhagen, and Bobbi Ann Ulvestad. I would also like to recognize their teacher, Dave Hodgson, who deserves much of the credit for the success of the class, Phil Harmeson, North Dakota's dedicated state coordinator, district coordinator Dan Vainonen, and Kirk Smith, who serves as a judge for this year's competition. 
   One of the most memorable experiences of my life was when I was one of 55 people chosen to represent all Americans at a ceremony in the Assembly Room in Constitution Hall in Philadelphia to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the writing of the Constitution. Our Constitution was written by 55 white men, including some of the most revered men in our nation's history. In the Assembly Room, George Washington's chair is still sitting at the front of the room where he presided over the Constitutional Convention, along with Ben Franklin and James Madison. 
   Two hundred years later, the gathering was noticeably different--this time it was 55 men, women, minorities. I got chills sitting in this room because I had studied in a very small school the history about Ben Franklin, Madison, Mason, George Washington--just like those students participating in the We the People...... program are doing now--and there I was sitting in the very room where they wrote the Constitution of the United States. 
   I wish every American could have the same opportunity to visit Constitution Hall the way I did, but at the very least, every young American student should learn about the history and importance of our Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The We the People...... The Citizen and the Constitution program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Columnist David Broder described the national finals as ``the place to have your faith in the younger generation restored.'' 
   The class from Wyndmere High School has worked hard to become ``constitutional experts,'' and on behalf of my fellow North Dakotans and my colleagues in the Senate, I want them to know we are proud of their hard work and dedication.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this has been an interesting and certainly a thoughtful debate about education. This is exactly the topic we ought to be discussing in the Senate. We have a lot of folks in this country who care about the state of education and the condition of America's schools. They say America's schools are failing its children. What shall we do about that? 
   Before us is the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We debate this law every 6 years, and at that time we talk about what kind of policies we believe will work for America's schools and what kind of policies will give us the kind of education system we can have pride in. Are our children walking through classroom doors that give them the best opportunity for a good education? 
    Let me also say that I am a little tired--not only in Congress but in politics and in discussions generally--of the notion in this country of blaming America's teachers first. 
   I visit a lot of classrooms. I see a lot of teachers and a lot of students. In most cases, the teachers I see in America's classrooms are extraordinary men and women who do a wonderful job with our children in America's schools. They have a very tough job. Their students come to schools all over this country with problems that affect how well they will learn. There are children who are hungry, without a caring parent, who are regularly faced with violence, guns, behavior issues. All sorts of issues come to school with children. We have to respond to those and deal with those issues. But this notion of somehow blaming America's teachers is wrong. 
   Let me talk for a moment about who has new ideas. I was listening a while ago to a speech that I thought was interesting. But the notion was that only the majority party had new ideas, and somehow the Democratic caucus in the Senate was offering proposals that are just the same old thing. 
   The majority party offers, as its version of how to fix our education system, to provide block grants. Is there anything new about block grants? Block grants aren't new. In fact, this is the oldest idea in politics, and it is an idea that doesn't work. 
   We have very serious problems with our schools that we need to help solve. A lot of schools are in radical disrepair. 
   I was at a school Monday in North Dakota. It is a school whose student population is almost exclusively Native American. These young Indian children are attending a school that is not in good repair. They know it. I know it. The teachers know it. The school board knows it. This is a school that doesn't have much of a tax base because it is on an Indian reservation. It is a public school district, but does not have much of a tax base. 
   This is a school that doesn't even have an athletic field. Is there a place for these children to go out and run? Is there a place for them to play football or to practice soccer? No. This is a school without an athletic field. 
   As we were going through the classrooms in this school, the principal said to me: Senator, is there any chance you could help us try to get an athletic field for these kids? They have too much energy. They have so much energy and want the opportunity to go out on an athletic field to play football, or play soccer, or perhaps run track. But we don't have the money. 
   Again, this is a school without a tax base so they don't have the money. 
   As I was touring the school, the teacher said: Now, children, are there any questions you would like to ask the Senator? 
   One little kid in the third grade raised his hand real high, and he said: Yes. Mr. Senator, I would like to know how many 
   bathrooms there are in the White House. 
   I thought: Gosh, that is a funny question. How many bathrooms are there in the White House? 
   One little kid on the other side of the room said: I think there are 18. 
   Another little boy said: I think there are 46. 
   I said: You are both probably right. It is probably between 18 and 46. 
   Do you know in that school, with 150 kids, they have only two bathrooms, a boy's bathroom and a girl's bathroom? I guess he was thinking it would be a luxury to have a lot of bathrooms. 
   That is the sort of question that comes from a third grader. But it relates to the condition of the school. The third grader knows that he is not walking into the same kind of school that other kids are. This school needs repair. 
   One of the new ideas we proposed--that has been opposed, incidentally, by the majority party--is to provide the opportunity to repair, renovate, and rebuild America's schools that are in disrepair all around this country. But there is not much interest in that. Instead, the response is, let's send them block grants, and then pray that someone will use it for the right thing. 
   We have some experience with block grants. In fact, title I started out as a block grant a long time ago. However, Congress quickly learned that the funding was not helping the poor children who were intended to be the beneficiaries. 
   Let me give just a couple of examples of what title I was used for: They bought three tubas in one school. Another one used it for band uniforms. Another bought 18 portable swimming pools. That is block grants. 
   Of course, these block grants won't go directly to the schools. The block grant funds will go to the Governors. Then the school districts are going to have to go begging to the States asking: Can we get some of that Federal money you have back there in block grants? 
   We think maybe a new idea would be to say, let's renovate, remodel, and rebuild those schools that are in disrepair around this country, and let's help the local governments that do not have the resources to accomplish that task. We think a new idea might be to say, let's help those schools that are radically overcrowded, with kids sitting with an inch between their desks in a classroom, with 35 students taught by 1 teacher. We know better teaching goes on in the classroom when you have 1 teacher and 15 students or 1 teacher and 20 students, so let's decide to help schools reduce the size of their classes. 
   When someone says there are no new ideas, it is just that they have not heard them. We have talked about them. They have not heard them. They have not been willing to vote for them. 
   There are a lot of things we can do to improve education. I agree that we cannot throw money at problems, but I also believe we cannot withhold the resources necessary to fix this country's schools. We cannot send kids to inferior schools and ask why we didn't get a good student out of that school. We  cannot send kids into crowded classrooms and wonder why test scores are not higher. 
   As I said before, some of the most wonderful, dedicated people I have met are the teachers in classrooms, spending their days with our children. We can and should make some changes on the question of the teacher certification process. We ought to have alternative certification programs for people who later in life want to go back into a classroom and teach kids. They shouldn't have to go through a teacher's college or a curriculum that is long and difficult. 
   Let me give an example. There was a rather wonderful major league outfielder who played ball for the Baltimore Orioles who was going to teach physical education at a school in New York. Wouldn't you want your kid being taught how to hit by a major league outfielder? But he didn't have the proper teacher certificate so he wasn't kept in the school system. 
   What if Bill Gates decided he wanted to come into your school and teach a class on computers? He doesn't have the certification. What if Michael Jordan was willing to teach your child to play basketball in a physical education program? Do you think Michael Jordan and Bill Gates are not qualified? Of course they are. 
   We can find mechanisms by which we provide alternative certification for professionals and others who want to go into the classroom to help in this country. We can and should do that. 
   But to those people who spend all of their time beating up on America's schools, I wonder how they think we got to where we are in this world with our education system? How on Earth did we do that? Is there a place in the world anyone wants to trade places with? I don't think so. Do we want to trade our education system for the one in Haiti, Zambia, or Bangladesh? I don't think so. How about Germany? How about France or Italy? Do we want to trade it? I don't think so. 
   This country has invested a substantial amount of money in something called universal education. We did it because we don't believe in segregating kids and deciding some kids have talent to go here and other kids have the talent to go there. We decided all kids ought to have the opportunity to make the most of their education. 
   I have two children in school this morning. They are both the most wonderful children in the whole world. I love them to death. I want them to have the best education possible. I don't know what they will be when they grow up. My son, when he was 10 years old and we were going over an English lesson together, that he didn't need to study English because he was going to be a miner. I said: A miner? He said: I'm going to mine gold and I don't need to read and spell. I said: When mining gold, you have to be able to read and sign contracts. Over time, he changed his occupation choice, and he has had several other choices since then. We spend time every night with our children doing homework because we believe education is a priority for them. I want them to go through a classroom door I am proud of. I want them to go into a school I am proud of. I want them to have teachers I am proud of. 
   Dating back to my great-grandmother who homesteaded on the prairies of North Dakota and raised children who raised children who raised me, this education system has been a wonderful boon to most Americans, including our family. My father had to quit school in the sixth grade because his mother died and his father was in an institution for tuberculosis. In sixth grade, he quit school in order to go to work to help his uncles raise his sisters. The 
   proudest day of his life, it seems to me, is one day when, without ever having given us a hint, he told us at the supper table that he had, at age 55, just passed the GED test. Then he gave us a big smile. He didn't even tell us he was taking it. This meant a lot to him. 
   Education has enormous value. Every American family who cares about its kids understands that. This debate is not about two sides, one of which has new ideas and the other which has no ideas. It is a discussion about a range of approaches with respect to the education system and how we make it better. 
   I don't think our public school system is awful. I disagree with those who do. Go to school. I have been to schools that are awful schools, but do you know why? Because of all the other influences from which those kids come. I have been to schools with metal detectors at the front door. Shortly after I visited one of those schools, a kid was shot at the water fountain because another kid bumped him. The student who shot him got a gun through the metal detector, even though a security guard was sitting there. 
   That school has a crowd control problem as much as it has education problems. It is not because they are bad people running the school. It is because that school inherits all of the other problems of its surroundings. I think we need to understand that and help change it. 
   We can do better in education. I am not suggesting everything is great. We can do better in education. But I know my kids do more homework than I did. I graduated from a tiny high school class of nine in Regent, North Dakota. I am enormously proud of the education I received in that school. Are the kids there getting a better education today than I did? Yes, of course they are--more homework, more opportunities, bigger libraries, the Internet. They have access to any library in the world through the Internet. 
   As we look at what we do to improve our schools, I think the most important thing is to improve those crumbling facilities, reduce class size, and then require accountability. I am all for accountability. 
   There is a provision in Senator DASCHLE's substitute, which I will also offer as a separate amendment, to provide parents with a school report card. I get a report card about how my son and daughter are performing. I want a report card for the public school they attend, a report card that every parent and every taxpayer in this country should get, comparing their school to other schools in their district, in their state, and in other States. How is that school doing? Is it passing or failing based on a series of criteria--student performance, graduation and retention rates, professional certification of teachers, average class size, school safety, parental involvement--which is critically important--student dropout rates and student access to technology. How is that school doing? We deserve a school report card as parents and as taxpayers. 
   That ultimately will provide the accountability we should get. Yes, we ought to hold our education system accountable. We will have an opportunity to vote on school report cards as part of the Bingaman amendment, and if the Bingaman amendment fails, on an amendment I will offer separately. 
   The secret to education is not such a secret. Successful education comes from teachers who know how to teach, students who want to learn, and parents who are involved in their child's education. When all three of these elements are present, education works and works well. 
   Evaluate this country--where it has been, where it is now, and where it is going--and ask yourself if we have accomplished things through our education system of which we are proud? You bet we have. We have spliced genes, we have invented plastic silicone and radar, built rockets, and developed vaccines to prevent polio and small pox. Have we done something significant, all of it coming from our education system? You bet your life we have. Can we improve it? Sure. But we will improve it with new ideas--not tired old ideas called block grants. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday Senator WELLSTONE told our caucus of the health challenges Mike Epstein has been facing. I am someone who knows Mike. Am I his closest friend? No. But Senator WELLSTONE had his office next to mine in the Hart Building. Every day--during votes, and coming and going in the Senate--I would see Mike Epstein and see my colleague, Senator WELLSTONE, moving back and forth. I watched, with some wonder, at the work he did for Senator WELLSTONE. 
   I know he is now facing a health challenge that is difficult. I know there are times in this fast-paced world of ours--especially here in the Senate, with the travel and the hearings and the moving about quickly--that it is easy to forget what makes this work and what has real value in our lives. 
   This is a moment, as Mike faces this challenge, to say to Mike: Our thoughts and prayers are with you today as you face this serious health challenge. But we also want, as we think of you, to say thanks for what you have done here. The people who serve here, especially my colleague, Senator WELLSTONE, know how important personal relationships are. 
   The only thing we really have, as we try to deal with public policy, is our work. Personal relationships are everything. But it is not just personal relationships between Senators; it is also the relationships that exist around here between Senators and some talented, dedicated people who help make this institution work. One of those is Mike Epstein. 
   Each of us aspired to serve our country in different ways. That is what persuaded us in the Senate to seek public office. It is what inspires some of the most talented, dedicated men and women in our country to want to come and serve and work in these Senate offices. 
   Mike Epstein has worked with Senator WELLSTONE for many years. I know Senator REID just talked about at the end of considering pieces of legislation. I say to Senator WELLSTONE, at the end of the consideration of pieces of legislation that are long, torturous trials, trying to get all the amendments in, Senator REID and I have always tried to figure out, how do we get these amendments compressed? In almost every case, at the end of the process, it has been Senator WELLSTONE who has had three or four amendments. 
   The reason: I know Mike Epstein would be sitting behind Senator WELLSTONE, and Senator WELLSTONE would be exhibiting this passion, saying: No, we have to do these. This is important. It has been because he shares Mike's commitment to give voice to the voiceless, and hope to the hopeless, and to not let the big things obscure things that are important to average Americans and people who are struggling out there every day. 
   That is the legacy of the service of someone such as Mike Epstein to this Senate. As he struggles with this health challenge, I just wanted to comment, as a member of this caucus, and to say to Senator WELLSTONE, and say directly to Mike Epstein, our thoughts and prayers are with you. This country is better because of your service in this Senate. 
   We wish you well. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on February 10th of this year, the Senate passed S. 1287, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments of 2000. I commend the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Energy Committee for the time and effort they have dedicated to this issue. However, I did not vote for this bill, because it contains many of the same flaws as in past bills, including safety and licensing issues, inadequate delivery schedules, and a failure to address specific storage problems of some companies. 
   One of the companies in our region of the country that has such a storage problem is Northern States Power, NSP. Minnesota state law prevents NSP from expanding its nuclear waste storage capacity. As a result, NSP will be forced to shut down its Prairie Island nuclear power plant when it runs out of storage space in January, 2007. Mr. President, this is an issue of critical concern. NSP serves 1.5 million electricity users in five states, including 84,000 customers in my own state of North Dakota. If NSP is forced to close its Prairie Island plant, the resulting impact on electricity customers in our region would be devastating. Grid reliability could be compromised, and the energy costs of many North Dakotans could increase substantially. In a cold-weather state such as mine, any increase in electricity costs is a matter of great concern. In short, this utility is caught between a state law and federal inaction--and we need to address the problem. 
   While I agree with the Administration's decision to veto the nuclear waste bill, I am also disappointed by its failure to proactively work with Congress to reach a compromise on nuclear waste storage, particularly in light of the fact that North Dakotans have invested nearly $14 million to pay for the construction of a permanent waste storage facility with little to show for it. 
   In the coming weeks, I will be working with the Appropriations Committee to craft a solution to the problems brought on by state laws that limit or restrict the storage of spent nuclear fuel. I encourage the participation of the Administration and my colleagues in the Senate in this effort. I hope that this will be one of many efforts to address the outstanding issues that have, up to this point, prevented comprehensive nuclear waste legislation from becoming law.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in a recent article in the New York Times, Nicholas Kristof, a reporter, posed the question why this country should care about the fate of family-based agriculture in this country. 
   Many people are asking that question today. For part of the answer, I suggest they read a short essay by Elizabeth Haugen, a high school senior in Butte, North Dakota, a town of 129 people in the central portion of my state. 
   Elizabeth has grown up on a family farm. As her grandmother put it, she ``helps with the cows, drives truck, cleans granaries, and maintains an A+ grade average.'' She sings in the State Choir and competes in statewide speech contests. 
   Elizabeth is a member of the last graduating class in Butte Public School--one of two seniors. After she leaves the school will close. The school will not close because it has failed. It has been a success, and Butte too has been a success. For generations, the school, and the town, have produced the kind of traditional community values that we hear so much about in this Chamber and that this Nation desperately needs. 
   The Butte Public School will close because family farms are failing, and family-based agriculture is the economic base of Butte--as it is for thousands of small communities like it across America. 
   This is not rural romanticism of Jeffersonian nostalgia. It is real. If we want the kind of traditional values in this country that people here in Washington preach so much about, then we have got to show some concern for the kinds of economic arrangements that promote those values--including the family farm. 
   Family based agriculture is not failing in this country because it is unproductive or inefficient. It is failing because it cannot survive in a marketplace in which big grain companies, food processors and the rest are permitted to stomp on family farmers with impunity. It cannot survive when the federal government favors these corporate interests at every turn. 
   To begin to understand why we need to act, I commend this essay by Elizabeth Haugen to my colleagues. ``The little town of Butte, North Dakota is the positive evidence that the small, trustworthy, and simple lifestyle still exists,'' she writes. How would we replace those values, once they are lost? 
   I include for the RECORD a copy of the essay.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee spoke on the floor of the Senate on the subject of arms control. He is a distinguished Member of the Senate, someone for whom I have high regard, but someone with whom I have strong disagreement on this subject. I will speak this morning about the presentation he made yesterday and its relationship to a range of other issues we face. 
   The front page of the Washington Post this morning has a headline: ``Helms Vows to Obstruct Arms Pacts, Any New Clinton Accord With Russia Ruled Out.'' It is a story about the presentation made yesterday by the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in which he stated that any arms control agreement negotiated by this administration is going to be dead on arrival in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. With all due respect to the Washington Post, that is not news. The Foreign Relations Committee has been a morgue for arms control for a long time. In fact, this Congress has been a morgue for arms control. Everything dealing with arms control has been dead on arrival in this Congress and in that committee for several years. 
   The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference is now being held in New York. At that conference the world is looking to this country for leadership in stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons and stopping the spread the missiles, submarines, and bombers with which those nuclear weapons are delivered. Regrettably, this country has abandoned its leadership on the arms control issue. 
   I will include in the RECORD several editorials: one is the April 26 edition of the Chicago Tribune entitled ``Russia Takes Arms Control Lead.'' It discusses the Russian Duma's approval of Start II and the approval of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban treaty by the Russians. Another is from the April 26 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel entitled, ``Will the United States Lead or Follow on the Issue of Arms Control.'' Another is from the April 27 Dallas Morning News with the title ``Arms Control, the Senate Needs to Stop Playing with Nuclear Fire.'' And the last is this morning's column in the Washington Post by Mary McGrory entitled ``Nuclear Family Values.''

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the statement made yesterday by the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee was a statement that says, we don't know what you might negotiate. It has not yet been negotiated; a proposal does not yet exist. But whatever it is and whatever it might be, we intend to kill it. It will be dead in my committee. 
   That is not what this country ought to be doing with the subject of arms control. As we meet in the Senate discussing a range of things, and especially discussing, more recently, the case of Elian Gonzalez, which seems to have co-opted so much attention in this country, other countries around the world aspire to acquire nuclear weapons. The spread of nuclear weapons is a very serious matter. Will more and more countries have access to nuclear bombs and the means by which to deliver those nuclear weapons, or will this country provide leadership in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons? 
   Arms control agreements have worked. Those in this Congress who have stopped arms control agreements and who have said any future agreements will be dead in our committee or in this Congress are wrong. It is the wrong policy for this country. Our country should instead be saying we embrace thoughtful, reasonable, arms control agreements that make this a safer world. 
   This picture shows some of what the Senate and the Congress have done in the past on arms control agreements and why they work. 
   This is a picture of a missile silo. This used to hold an SS-19, a Soviet and then Russian missile. The missile in this silo had several warheads aimed at the United States of America. The threat from those warheads doesn't exist anymore. The missile is gone. The silo was filled in. The ground is plowed over and there are now sunflowers on top. Is that progress? You bet your life it is progress. 
   But it is not just missile silos. Here is the dismantling of a Russian Delta class ballistic missile submarine. This used to be a submarine that would find its way stealthily through the waters with missiles and nuclear warheads aimed at American cities and targets. It is no longer a submarine. Here is a piece of copper wire that is ground up that used to be on that Russian submarine. Did we sink that submarine in hostile action? No. Through the Nunn-Lugar threat reduction program, the Pentagon actually dismantled that Russian submarine. 
   More than that, we are sawing the wings off Russian bombers. Here is a picture of the Nunn-Lugar program cutting the wings off TU-95 heavy bombers. Why is the Pentagon cutting the wings off those bombers? Because we have had arms control agreements with Russia that have called for the reduction of bombers, missiles, nuclear warheads. Six thousand Russian nuclear warheads have been eliminated--6,000. That is the explosive equivalent of 175,000 nuclear bombs like those dropped on Hiroshima. Let me repeat that. Arms control agreements with Russia have eliminated the threat from nuclear weapons with destructive power equivalent to 175,000 bombs the size of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima. 
   We have people in the Congress who say: We don't like arms control. We want to build new things. We want to build new missiles. We want to build new missile defense systems. We want to build and we want to spend money building. What they do is light the fuse of a new arms race. 
   Without some new effort in arms control to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons, we will see a new arms race--expensive, dangerous, and one that will hold the world hostage for some time to come. Our job ought to be to find ways to reduce the nuclear threat, not expand it; to find ways to create arms control agreements that work. 
   Again, I have deep respect for all of my colleagues, even those with whom I have serious disagreements. I certainly have serious disagreements in this circumstance. But I don't understand an announcement that says, whatever the President might negotiate in arms control, even though it is not yet negotiated, even though we don't know the specifics, whatever it might be with respect to arms control, we pledge to you that it is dead. That is not leadership. That is destructive to good public policy. If we can negotiate with the Russians and others sensible, thoughtful arms control agreements that advance this country's interests, enhance world safety and security, then we ought to be willing to embrace it, not shun it. 
   I regret very much the announcement that there will be no hearings on any negotiations on arms control. We are quick to hold hearings on the Elian Gonzalez case. We have people doing cartwheels around the Chamber saying: Let's hold hearings; let's investigate. We can hold hearings on the Elian Gonzalez case, but somehow there will be no movement, no hearings, no discussion on the issue of arms control if, God forbid, we should be able to achieve some sort of breakthrough in an arms control agreement with the Russians or others. 
   In conclusion, it is our responsibility, it falls on our shoulders in the United  States to be a world leader on these issues. It is our responsibility to lead. We are the remaining nuclear and economic superpower in the world. It is our responsibility to lead, not towards another arms race but towards more arms control and towards stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. 
   Let's not have more countries joining the nuclear club. Let's not have more proliferation of the technology of missiles and submarines and nuclear weapons spread around the world. To those who say we are threatened by North Korea being able to send a missile with a warhead to threaten the Aleutian Islands, I say this: Almost anyone who thinks through this understands there are a myriad of threats our country faces. The least likely is a threat by an intercontinental ballistic missile from a rogue nation. It is far more likely that a truck bomb, far more likely that a suitcase bomb, far more likely that a deadly biological or chemical agent would be used to threaten or hold hostage this country. It is far more likely that a cruise missile would be used. It is, in my judgment, the least likely option that a rogue nation would have access to and acquire an intercontinental ballistic missile and use that as a threat against this country. 
   Having said that, I think we will now have a struggle between those who desperately want to build a national missile defense system at any cost in taxpayers' money, at any cost in arms control, at any cost, as contrasted with those of us who believe it is still our responsibility to make this a safer world by understanding that arms control has worked and has reduced the number of nuclear weapons. But we are not nearly finished. We must move to START III, we must preserve the ABM Treaty, and we must have new, aggressive, bold and energetic leadership in the U.S. to say it is our job to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to make this a safer world. 
   That burden falls upon this country and, regrettably, this Congress has not been willing to assume that responsibility. It is, in fact, all too often marching in exactly the opposite direction. We need to put it back on track and say it is our job, and we willingly and gladly accept that responsibility to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, to negotiate good arms control agreements that don't threaten our security, but enhance it by reducing the threat of nuclear weapons. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator yielding to me. 
   This is a very sad chapter. It is a story of a 6-year-old child who has been used as a political football now for some many months--yes, by Fidel Castro, but also by some in this country--and it ought to stop. What happened the other morning in Miami is something none of us wants to see in this country, but it happened without violence occurring. No one was injured, and the fact is, a 6-year-old boy was restored to his father's care. 
   I have heard all of the stories and all of the words. I watched television last evening. I heard irresponsible statements about Waco, about storm troopers, all kinds of conjecture about secret meetings between Fidel Castro and officials in this country. Look, those things serve no purpose at this point. 
   This is a 6-year-old boy whose mother died and who now has been restored to the care of his father. Are there  those here who believe that a 6-year-old boy whose father loves him should not be restored to the care of his father? If so, then let's have a long debate about parental rights. I suspect they do not want to restore this young boy to the care of his father because his father is a Cuban and he will go back to Cuba and that is a Communist country. But I do not see people coming to the floor of the Senate talking much about the fate of the children in Vietnam--that is a Communist country--or the fate of the children in China--that is a Communist country. 
   All of a sudden, this one 6-year-old child whose mother is dead and whose father wants him, because he comes from Cuba, does not have the right to be restored to the care of his father? 
   Something is wrong with this. 
   I understand there is great passion on all sides. The Attorney General was faced with an awful choice, and she made a choice. The choice she made was to use whatever show of force was necessary--not force; show of force was necessary--to prevent violence while they were able to get this boy and restore him to the care of his father. 
   The fact is, it worked. In a little under 3 minutes, they were able to get this boy. This boy, now we see in a smiling picture, is in his father's arms where he ought to be. 
   I know we can criticize Janet Reno and others till the Sun goes down and every day thereafter, but it is not going to change the fact that this boy belongs with his father. We all know that. We should not use this boy for some broader political purpose of U.S.-Cuba relations, anti-Castroism, this, that, or the other thing. This is not about Fidel Castro. This is about a 6-year-old child and his father.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened to the presentations on the floor. Let me say the passion with which the Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, and the Senator from Arizona bring this issue to the floor is a passion I understand. I certainly respect their views. 
   I have studied this issue at some length. I must say the Senator from California visited with me, I guess, half a dozen times about this issue over the past year or so. But I have reached a different conclusion. It is a difficult trail to get to this point, but my view is the issue is not whether victims in this country have rights in court proceedings, but how we achieve those rights. 
   It is true that criminals are accorded a whole series of rights in this country. I do not quarrel with that. I do not want us to put innocent people behind bars. It is difficult to convict in this country, and our Constitution establishes certain rights. We try, as a country, to make certain we only put those guilty of crimes, behind bars. 
   It is also true--and I say this to the Senator from California and the Senator from Arizona--it has been a longer process and a more difficult track, to make certain that victims and victims' families have their rights protected in our court system. I have offered legislation on this issue previously. In fact, I authored language included in the 1994 crime bill, which is now law, that gives crime victims the right to testify at federal sentencing hearings. My provision gives crime victims and their families the right in Federal court to present testimony about ``What this crime meant to me or to my family'' and ensures that judges and parole boards formally consider the impact of a crime on its victims when making sentencing and parole decisions. 
   I sat in a court at the manslaughter trial of the man on trial for the death of my mother. I am very sensitive to this issue. I understand--being a family member, sitting in a court, watching the trial of the man who was responsible for the death of my mother--I understand the concern a family member has about the rights of the victim and the rights of the victim's family to be present in that court. I understand the desire to present testimony during the sentencing phase, to have an understanding about when someone is let out of prison. I understand all that, and I am very sensitive to it because I have been through it personally, as a result of the tragic death of my mother. 
   I come to the floor of the Senate today saying I strongly support victims' rights. We are moving in this country in a variety of ways to achieve those rights. Thirty-three States have now amended their state constitutions to specifically describe the rights of victims and their families. Some say that approach does not work very well and is not universal; that sometimes it does not achieve our goal. I understand that argument. I understand the argument that the perpetrator of a heinous and violent crime is brought into the court, now some months later after the crime was committed, and his or her hair is combed, they are in a new suit, they look as if they just finished singing in a church choir, and all their acquaintances testify to what a remarkable person this is. It happens all the time in trials. 
   This animal who committed the violent murder on a Saturday night, in court 1 month or 2 or 6, or a year later, looks completely different and has a whole set of rights. I understand all that. 
   My concern is about the Constitution of the United States, and whether we should address this by changing the U.S. Constitution, or whether we should address it by continuing to make the changes, both with respect to Federal law and also mandating changes with 
   respect to State law and State constitutional changes that accomplish the same result. 
   I have in my hand three pages of constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this session of Congress. We have had several of them, frankly, on the floor of the Senate. These are very important issues. Amending or changing the Constitution of this country ought to be done rarely and then only in circumstances where it is the only opportunity to achieve the change we want as a society. These are three pages of constitutional amendments that are proposed by my colleagues now. 
   We have had over 11,000 proposals to change the Constitution since it was written; 11,000 proposals. One of them, for example, said let's have a constitutional amendment that provides the Presidency of our country should be rotated. One term it shall be held by someone who is a southerner, from the southern States, and the next term followed by someone who comes from a northern State. That was a proposed constitutional amendment. I could describe more, of course. 11,000 times, the Members of Congress have felt the need to change the U.S. Constitution--this document which begins:  
   We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union.......  
   We all understand the words. It was written by 55 white men just over two centuries ago in a room called the Assembly Room in Constitution Hall. My colleagues have heard me talk about it before, but I will say it again. In that room, George Washington's chair is still sitting at the front of the room where he presided over the Constitutional Convention. Go there today in Philadelphia and look at his chair. Ben Franklin sat over there; there James Madison. Thomas Jefferson was in Europe at the time so he didn't participate except through his writings, which then became, as we know it, the Bill of Rights. 
   But since those 55 men wrote the Constitution of the United States over two centuries ago, we have had so many proposals for change. I have mentioned to my colleagues on the 200th birthday of the writing of the Constitution, I was one of the 55 people who were authorized to go in for a ceremony, into this Assembly Room. This time, it was 55 men, women, minorities. I got chills sitting in this room because I had studied in a very small school the history about Ben Franklin, Madison, Mason, George Washington--the father of our country--and now I was sitting in the Assembly Room in Constitution Hall in Philadelphia where they wrote the Constitution of the United States. 
   Since that experience, I have had difficulty coming to the conclusion that we can improve upon the basic framework of the Constitution of the United States. Other countries try to replicate  this Constitution; we try to amend it. Some of my colleagues apparently think it is a rough draft available for amendment at the whim of someone's interest in the House or the Senate. It is much more important than that, and we ought to amend the Constitution, in my judgment, rarely, and then when it is the only solution. 
   As I mentioned, 33 States have amended their Constitution to provide for victims' rights. We can provide for the Federal portion, and the Senators from Arizona and California are absolutely right, that is a very small portion of crime in the criminal justice system. We can also mandate--and I am perfectly prepared to do that--that the States must do the same in exchange for a certain number of incentives which we in the Congress provide. I am perfectly prepared to do that. 
   I do want to clear up a couple of misconceptions that have been part of the discussion with respect to the victims' rights amendment. The proposal to change the Constitution, in some measure, rests on the discussion about, among other things, the folks who were convicted in the Oklahoma City bombing case. 
   I want to describe what happened in that case because like many others, I saw the initial ruling and comments of the judge in the Federal court in Denver, and was appalled. He essentially said that those who were victims or family members of victims who wanted to witness the trial would not necessarily then be granted the opportunity to testify during the sentencing phase of the trial. I was concerned about that. I felt that was an abrogation of victims' rights. 
   What happened as a result of that is Congress passed a piece of legislation called the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997. We did that almost immediately. It reversed a presumption against crime victims observing any part of the trial proceedings if they were likely to testify during the sentencing hearing. 
   This piece of legislation that was passed almost immediately after the judge's ruling prohibited courts from excluding victims from the trial on the grounds they might be called to provide a victim's impact statement at sentencing. The result of the legislation was that the victims in the Oklahoma City bombing trial were allowed to observe both the trial of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols and to provide impact statements through testimony. 
   In this circumstance, the legislation we passed in Congress worked exactly as Congress intended it to work. The testimony by a former prosecutor at the Oklahoma City bombing trial, Ms. Wilkinson, is something I want to recount because it is important to understand what happened, inasmuch as this example has been used. 
   It is important to look at how the Victim Rights Clarification Act was actually applied in the Oklahoma City case. 
   On June 26, 1996, Judge Matsch held that potential witnesses at any penalty hearing were excluded from pretrial proceedings and the trial itself to avoid any influence from that experience on their testimony. 
   That is what I described earlier, and I felt the same revulsion about that judge's decision as I think my colleagues did, and the result was that we passed the Victim Rights Clarification Act almost immediately. The President signed it into law on March 19, 1997. One week later, Judge Matsch reversed his exclusionary order and permitted observation at the trial proceedings by potential penalty-phase impact witnesses. In other words, the judge changed his mind immediately after the President signed the legislation. 
   Beth Wilkinson, a member of the Government team that successfully prosecuted, said:  
   What happened in [the McVeigh] case was once you all had passed the statute, the judge said that the victims could sit in, but they may have to undergo a voir dire process to determine whether rule 402.....would have been impacted and could be more prejudicial.  
   This is what the prosecutor said. It is important to say this:  
   I am proud to report to you that every single one of those witnesses who decided to sit through the trial survived the voir dire, and not only survived, but I think changed the judge's opinion on the idea that any victim impact testimony would be changed by sitting through the trial. [T]he witnesses underwent the voir dire and testified during the penalty phase for Mr. McVeigh. 
   It worked in that case, but it worked even better in the next case. Just 3 months later when we tried the case against Terry Nichols, every single victim who wanted to watch the trial either in Denver or through closed-circuit television proceedings that were provided also by statute by this Congress, were permitted to sit and watch the trial and testify against Mr. Nichols in the penalty phase--all without having to undergo a voir dire process.  
   The point is, when the judge in the Oklahoma City bombing trial, which was conducted in Denver, made his initial ruling, there was a great amount of press about it, and all of us, including myself, was aghast at this ruling. Congress passed a piece of legislation almost immediately, the President signed it, and the judge reversed his ruling, and every single one of the victims or victims' families who wished to testify during the penalty phase was allowed to testify. That is critically important to be on the record. 
   The urge to amend the Constitution ought to be an urge based on all of the information available, and there is plenty of information available, it seems to me, based on this case and also based on the fact that 33 States have now changed their constitution and more will do so. In fact, all could do so if we decided to provide a mandate that would require them to do so. We are making significant progress in this area. 
   I understand, as I said when I started, the passions of the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from California. I have those same passions, and I want victims to have the same rights. I believe, however, that amending the Constitution should always be a last resort, not a first resort. I do not believe, despite all that has been said, that it serves this document very well to bring a piece of legislation to the floor of the Senate on a Tuesday and have a cloture vote on the motion to proceed. Presumably, we will have a cloture vote on the bill itself and probably have 8 hours, maybe 10 hours, maybe 14 hours, which would be a lengthy period of time for discussion in this Senate, and an attempt, I am sure, to stifle amendments, and then we would say: All right, now the Senate has considered changing the U.S. Constitution. 
   I do not think that is what Washington, Franklin, Madison, Mason, or others would have wanted us to do in consideration of changing this sacred document. 
   My hope is we will have an interesting and significant discussion about this and we will, from this debate, not only turn back the constitutional amendment but probably stimulate a great deal more activity on the part of the States. As I said before, I am willing to either offer an amendment or join others in offering an amendment that will require the States to make these changes. That would accomplish exactly the same thing without amending the U.S. Constitution. We can, in any event, make certain all this applies with respect to the Federal statute and Federal crimes. 
   My hope is, at the end of it, we will not only have denied the impulse to change the Constitution, but we will have created new energy and new incentives to make certain that victims' rights gain ground in State after State across this country. I will be happy to join others in the coming days, weeks, and months in an effort to accomplish that, because I have strong feelings about this issue. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Today, in the Washington Post, there was a story headlined ``U.S. Arms Policy is Criticized at the United Nations.'' The occasion of the criticism comes at the beginning of the conference to review the status of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which opened yesterday at the United Nations in New York. This conference occurs once every 5 years. It is a conference on the status of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. I would like to read the first paragraph of the story in the Washington Post because it is really quite a sad day when our country is described in the following way:  
   After years of championing international attempts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons, the United States found itself on the defensive today as a broad alliance of arms control advocates, senior United Nations officials, and diplomats from nonnuclear countries charged that Washington is blocking progress toward disarmament.  
   Well, that is not something any of us aspires to hear. I hope and I believe that many of my colleagues want the United States to be seen as a leader in trying to stop the spread of nuclear  weapons and in trying to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in this world. Regrettably, others view the actions of the United States--especially in the last few years--as actions that are not actions of a leader in trying to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. 
   We have made some progress over recent years in reducing the number of nuclear weapons. I want to describe how because I think it is important to understand it. 
   I ask unanimous consent to show two items on the floor of the Senate.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a piece of metal that comes from the wing strut of a Russian TU-160 Backfire bomber. This bomber carried nuclear weapons during the height of the cold war. This bomber was a threat to the United States of America. 
   How is it that I stand on the floor of the Senate holding a piece of a wing strut from a Russian bomber? Did we shoot it down? No. It was actually sawed off the wing. Giant, rotating metal saws cut the wings off this bomber. Why? Because we negotiated an agreement with the Russians to reduce the number of bombers and missiles and nuclear warheads in Russia. We reduced our stockpile and our delivery mechanisms, and they reduced theirs. So without shooting down a bomber that carried nuclear bombs that threatened America, I now have in my hand a piece of a wing from a Russian bomber--because arms control works. We know it works. 
   This chart shows what arms control has done in recent years. In the 1980s we ratified the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and in the 1990s we ratified the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START I. When we started the process in the mid-1980s, the Russians--or then the Soviet Union--had about 11,000 nuclear weapons on long range missiles. Today Russia has about 5,000. That means that 6,000 warheads are now gone. Many of those warheads were probably carried in the Russian Backfire bomber this piece comes from. So 6,000 warheads no longer threaten the United States of America. 
   Do you know what that represents--6,000 warheads with the kind of strength and power of the nuclear warheads the Russians used to build? That is equal to 175,000 Hiroshima bombs. Let me 
   say that again. We have actually negotiated the reduction of nuclear warheads in the Russian arsenal, and 6,000 warheads are gone. Those 6,000 warheads represented the equivalent of 175,000 atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima. That is quite remarkable. 
   This is a small container of ground-up copper wire. This copper wire used to run through a Russian ballistic missile submarine. This type of submarine, a Typhoon class submarine that snaked under the waters throughout the world carrying 20 missiles, with 10 nuclear warheads on the tip of each of those missiles, aimed at the United States of America. This copper wire, before it was ground up, used to course through this Typhoon submarine. But now I have the wire from a Typhoon submarine ground up in a small vial. How did I get that? Did we sink this submarine? Did we go to war with Russia and sink this submarine? No. This was dismantled, brought up to the port, and then engineers, carpenters, and others took this apart piece by piece, and this submarine doesn't exist anymore. 
   This submarine was taken apart as part of the Nunn-Lugar program to reduce delivery systems and nuclear weapons in the old Soviet Union and in what we now refer to as Russia. We have spent $2.5 billion on the Nunn-Lugar program. We have actually paid for the destruction of Russian bombers. We have paid for the destruction of Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles, 5,000 nuclear warheads, 471 ICBMs, and 354 ICBM silos, 12 ballistic missile submarines. 
   I have had charts on the Senate floor that show a plot of ground in the Ukraine where a missile silo existed with a nuclear warhead aimed at the United States of America, and now the silo is gone. I have held up a piece of metal from the hinge of the silo on the floor of the Senate. That hinge and that missile silo are now scrap metal. The silo is gone, the missile is gone, the warhead doesn't exist, and there is now a plot of ground with sunflowers. Where a nuclear missile used to rest, sunflowers now grow. That is progress. That is real progress in reducing the threat of nuclear weapons. 
   What about the future? If this is what has happened and this is success, what about the future? Well, this success occurred under decisions by Congress--not in the last several years, but years before that--in which we said: We are the leaders in arms reduction and arms control. Our country wants to provide leadership. We want to reduce the number of warheads, reduce the number of bombers and missiles, reduce the tensions. And we have done that. 
   But in the last several years, something dramatic has changed in the Congress. No. 1, we saw the Senate defeat the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. It was almost unthinkable to me, but this Senate said: This country doesn't want to ratify a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty even though we have already decided that the United States is not going to test nuclear weapons. We decided that unilaterally some 6 or 7 years ago. So we are not testing nuclear weapons. A treaty that has been signed by over 150 nations, negotiated over many years, ratified by most of our allies, was not ratified by the Senate because we have Senators who say, no, we don't think that is in the country's interest. 
   Well, if it is not in this country's interest to reduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons and to stop the testing of nuclear weapons, stop the spread of nuclear weapons around the world, what on earth is in this country's interest? After the Senate failed to ratify that treaty, those who voted against the treaty blamed everyone but themselves. That treaty languished in the committee here in the Senate for over 2 years without a day of hearings--not one. 
   Then it was brought to the floor on a preemptory basis, given short shrift in debate, and killed. 
   Those who killed that treaty should not have taken much pleasure in putting this country in the position of failing to exert leadership with respect to the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and the ban on testing nuclear weapons all around the world. 
   Last week, the Russian Duma ratified START II. Prior to that, the Russians passed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. While that is happening, this country is talking about building a national missile defense system and trying to negotiate with Russia changes in the antiballistic missile system which in many ways is the linchpin for all of this progress in arms control and arms reduction. 
   And what happens? Yesterday at the United Nations we have diplomats looking at Russia and saying: You are making a lot of progress here, Russia. You have passed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. You ratified that treaty, you passed START II, congratulations. 
   And the United States: You have lost your edge, you are not doing much. You seem to be retreating on the question of whether you care about arms control. You seem to be stepping back from your commitment of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and working as hard as you worked previously to reduce the number of delivery vehicles and reduce the number of nuclear weapons. 
   I regret that is the case. That should not be the case. It cannot be a judgment of conservatives or liberals or Democrats or Republicans to believe that somehow it falls to someone else to be a leader in the world to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Do we worry that the nuclear club--a rather small club in this world consisting of nations that possess nuclear weapons--do we worry that is going to proliferate, there will be more and more nations that possess nuclear weapons, and more and more nations that have the mechanism or the wherewithal to deliver those nuclear weapons? We should certainly worry about that. 
   Even with START II, the U.S. and Russia will each have about 3,500 nuclear weapons. Hopefully we will begin negotiations of START III and agree to much lower levels. As we do that, we have people in this Chamber who want to focus not on arms control but on building some kind of a national missile defense system, some sort of a shield to prevent America from being attacked by a rogue nation. 
   We need to understand the only country in the world that possesses the  strength and the nuclear power to destroy our way of life is Russia. They still have thousands of nuclear weapons. We ought to engage with them in an aggressive START III negotiation and continue the progress of bringing down the number of nuclear weapons in the two major nuclear superpowers--Russia and the United States. We ought to continue that. 
   I know we have people here who don't sleep at night because they are worried that North Korea might threaten a small slice of the United States. But they should realize that, No. 1 A national missile defense, if deployed, will be horribly costly. No. 2, it will not protect this country against this kind of a threat. Those people say to the American people that Congress will fund a national missile defense program to defend against a rogue nation--North Korea, they suggest, Iraq or Iran. The fact is, the least likely threat that a rogue nation would have access to is an intercontinental ballistic missile. If it acquires access to a nuclear weapon, it is far more likely to deploy it as a suitcase bomb put in the trunk of a rusty Yugo car at a dock in New York City, rather than putting it on the tip of an intercontinental ballistic missile and having any notion of being able to fire it with accuracy. 
   It is much more likely they would acquire a cruise missile, 
   which would be easier to acquire, much less costly, and not as technically difficult to deploy. Of course, the national missile defense system wouldn't do anything to defend against that. It is much more likely a rogue nation would find it more attractive to use a deadly vial of chemical or biological agents to threaten a superpower. 
   We face a myriad of threats. There is no question about that. The biggest threat, in my judgment, is this country stepping away from its responsibility to lead and stop the spread of nuclear weapons around the world, and this country stepping away from its responsibility to decrease the number of nuclear weapons and decrease the launchers and delivery systems for those nuclear weapons. 
   My fervent hope is that we will agree that last year's vote by which the Senate defeated ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty should not signal to anyone in the world that this country is no longer interested in these issues. We must decide again, even though there is not an appetite by some in the Senate to do so, we must decide again that leadership in arms control is this country's responsibility. It is upon our shoulders that this responsibility falls. No one else can exert this leadership with the capability of the United States. 
   If we don't exert leadership, what we will end up building new nuclear weapons, building new defensive systems. We will start a new arms race. We will see more spending on nuclear weapons by China. We will see more spending on offensive weapons by Russia. We will see other countries joining the nuclear club because they will believe they should acquire nuclear weapons to represent their interests. We will see our allies depart from us on these issues because they believe abrogation of the ABM Treaty is very unwise. 
   I think the majority of the American people believe the biggest threat to our future is the nuclear threat, the threat of a nuclear attack by an ever-increasing number of countries who acquire nuclear weapons. 
   We know what works. Arms control works, negotiation works, destroying another superpower's bombers through negotiation by sawing off the wings, dismantling submarines that carry nuclear weapons: we know that works. It is far better to do that than to engage in the horror of a nuclear war from which this world will not, in my judgment, survive. 
   Think for a moment about the devastation visited upon Nagasaki and Hiroshima and go back to what I discussed earlier--the reduction in 6,000 nuclear warheads that has been negotiated and accomplished. That is just the first step, a big step, but just the first step. It represents the reduction in nuclear warheads equivalent to 175,000 bombs the size of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. 
   The reason I come to the floor at the end of the day is simply to say we ought not take any pride as a country in seeing an article in the press of the United States suggesting somehow we have lost our will to lead on this issue. We can come to the floor and debate 100 things in 100 days. Some of them are big; some of them are small. None are more important, in my judgment, than addressing the issue of the spread of nuclear weapons. Just because we have people now serving in Congress who have an unending appetite to keep building new weapons, an unending appetite to spend more money on new weapons, does not mean those who believe in arms control and believe real progress in arms control will make this a safer world in which to live, should step aside and say: Yes, you win; go build your weapons. 
   We ought not do that, but we ought to wage the fight for a safer world by having this country exhibit the leadership it needs to exhibit, that it should responsibly exhibit, for the safety of all the people who live in this world. 
   I will have more to say about this subject at another time. But on the eve of the meeting of the NPT Review Conference in New York, I wanted to talk about these issues. I want to say that some in Congress believe very strongly and feel very deeply the future of our children and grandchildren and the future of this country rests on those who believe in arms control prevailing in this Senate, 
   despite the recent events, despite the debate we have heard in the last couple of years. This issue is not over. Those of us who believe as I do are not going to go away. We hope this country will assume some sensible mantle of leadership in this important area.

   Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the majority leader yielding. I want to make an observation with the question: As I understand, the majority leader has sent to the desk two cloture motions, one on the underlying bill and one on the substitute, for purposes, as he described, to shut off a filibuster which I suggest does not exist. 
   That is all right. That is within the rules. We have all read the rule book in the Senate. 
   Circumstances in the Senate should exist in the following manner. You bring a piece of legislation to the floor of the Senate. Every Senator here has a desk. You come here and you have certain rights and certain opportunities. One of those is to offer an amendment to legislation brought before the Senate. As I understand the Senator from Mississippi, he is saying he wants to see amendments Senators are going to offer. He would like to see them before he makes a judgment about whether in fact they will be allowed to be offered. 
   I say the reason there is a substantial amount of anxiety building up in this Senate is that people were not elected from various States to say: Go and do your thing in the Senate under the rules, and, by the way, we would like the majority leader to decide which amendments you offer shall be in order.

   Mr. DORGAN. Except, if the majority leader will yield further, that is not what you are trying to do. What you have indicated is you want to limit the amendments. It is not a case of being curious to see what we are going to offer. This goes on bill after bill after bill that is brought to the Senate. You want to limit the amendments. 
   My point is this. When we deal with legislation on the floor of the Senate, everyone here has a right, it seems to me, to come and offer amendments and have a debate on them. You have just filed two cloture motions to shut off debate on a filibuster that doesn't exist. This happens time and time again, and we are getting tired of it.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor today as we begin business this week to talk about two issues. First, let me describe what happened Saturday evening on the east coast. There was a hockey team from the University of North Dakota that went to the east coast to play in the NCAA Division I hockey championship. When they finished that competition, the North Dakota Sioux were Division I national champions once again. In fact, it is the seventh Division I national championship for the University of North Dakota hockey team. 
   I am an alumnus of that great school, and it was with great pride I watched the game on television last Saturday evening and saw the North Dakota Fighting Sioux win that contest. We are the home of great skaters, great hockey players, and great tradition. This year, once again, we demonstrated that you don't have to have a 40,000-student population to be a Division I national champion. 
   I called the White House this morning and asked if they would invite that team to the White House, as is often the custom for championship teams--college football, basketball, and other teams, including professional teams who have been invited to the White House by the President to say congratulations to them. I hope he will do the same for this wonderful group of young men from North Dakota who are now this Nation's champions in Division I hockey. 
   So my hat is off to the University of North Dakota. It is a wonderful school. I am proud to have gotten my undergraduate degree there. I am increasingly proud year after year as I watch that school. Not only are they great athletes and hockey players, these are also great students and good young men. This is an athletic program without parallel around the country, in my judgment. Again, I congratulate those young men. I am very proud of them.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will discuss for a moment the issues that face the Congress, where we are and why we are here, and suggest perhaps a slightly more robust agenda for the next couple of months. 
   It is now a Monday in April, and it is not quite clear to me what the agenda will be on the floor of the Senate this week. I guess it is not quite clear yet to anyone. We know that in the coming weeks we will do our work as appropriators. I am on the Appropriations Committee, and we will do our work as appropriators and bring appropriations bills to the floor of the Senate, and there are some authorization bills that must get done. But beyond that, it is not quite clear what the agenda is. 
   Recognizing that my political party, the one I represent in this Chamber, did not win the election, it is also clear we don't set the agenda in the Senate. The political system has a unique way of describing who controls institutions such as this. And those who have the most members, who get the most votes in a general election, have the opportunity to control and create an agenda. That is as it should be. 
   But it is perhaps frustrating for me and others that our agenda is not nearly as robust as it could or should be. 
   Let me describe some of the things I think we ought to be doing and that I hope the majority leader and others will agree at some point in the coming weeks that we will do. 
   First, we passed some long time ago a Patients' Bill of Rights. I didn't support the Senate version of it because I didn't think it was a good bill. But the House of Representatives passed a bipartisan piece of legislation coauthored by a Democrat and a Republican in the House of Representatives. It was a very vigorous battle in the House. They passed a real Patients' Bill of Rights bill. 
   It says in this contest of wills between patients, doctors, the insurance companies, and HMOs, that there are certain rights that patients ought to have. 
   Every patient in this country who seeks medical treatment ought to have the right to understand all of their options for medical treatment--not just what's the least expensive. 
   Those who need emergency room treatment ought to be able to expect to have emergency room treatment when needed. 
   When a woman falls off a 40-foot cliff and is hauled into an emergency room comatose, and then the HMO later says: We will not approve your emergency room cost because you didn't get preapproval for emergency room treatment--there is something wrong with the system. 
   Are there certain rights that patients ought to have in this health care system? The answer yes. Among those are the rights embodied in the bill in the House of Representatives called the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is now in conference. It is not likely to produce 67 votes, unfortunately, under current circumstances because the House-appointed conferees, who in most cases didn't vote for the bill, sent it to conference. 
   The Senate, of course, has a piece of legislation that does not do the job. But those of us who support a strong Patients' Bill of Rights remain hopeful that between now and the end of this legislative session we will pass a bipartisan piece of legislation called a Patients' Bill of Rights that really provides the rights and the assistance to patients in dealing with their insurance companies with respect to their health care treatment. 
   Juvenile justice: We passed a juvenile justice bill in the Senate. That bill was passed in Senate legislation that many do not like. 
   Among the two pieces of legislation that people do not like on that bill--and the reason I guess it is stalled--is some legislation dealing with guns. We provided two simple components to that piece of legislation. 
   I come from North Dakota. I grew up hunting. I had a gun when I was a teenager. I pheasant hunted, I deer hunted, and practiced target shooting. I know about guns. I am not somebody running into this Chamber saying let's have gun control. That is not my orientation at all. 
   But the two pieces dealing with guns that we added to the Juvenile Justice Act are so sensible. One is mandatory trigger locks for handguns. When 6-year-olds go to school and shoot another 6-year-old, ought we not to understand the need for trigger locks on handguns? It seems to me that is eminently sensible. 
   Second, the issue of gun shows, and the question of whether at gun shows that people set up around this country on Saturdays or Sundays there ought to be an instant check when guns are sold to find out whether you are selling a gun to a convicted felon. 
   Go to a gun store anywhere in this country and try to buy a gun. They are going to run your name through an instant check to find out if you are a convicted felon because if you are, you cannot buy a gun. But we have a loophole at gun shows which are big, and getting bigger. There are more of them. Many feel--including the Senate, incidentally, by a rather close vote--that 
   we ought to have the opportunity to close that loophole and say if you are  going to buy a gun, it does not matter whether it is in a gun store or at a gun show, you ought to have to have your name run through an instant check so we can make sure we are not selling a gun to a felon. 
   Those two issues--trigger locks for handguns for the safety of children in this country, and closing the gun show loophole--have meant that the juvenile justice bill, which is so important, is now in conference, and apparently we can't get it out. I hope we can be more sensible about this and get that bill out of conference, bring it to the floor of the Senate and the House, and get it to the President for his signature. 
   There are other items we continue to struggle with, such as the issue of school construction. 
   I have spoken at great length about walking into the Cannon Ball School and seeing little Rosie Two Bears, a third grader, who says: Mr. Senator, are you going to build me a new school? 
   I said: No, I don't have the money to build you a new school, Rosie. 
   This is a school with 150 kids, one water fountain, two toilets, and closings of the school building which is not fit for classes, where sewer gas comes up and they have to evacuate the rooms. Rosie isn't getting the kind of education we want for her as an American. 
   When we say let's help rebuild, renovate, and construct some of America's schools to bring them back up to standard, we are told, no. You can't do that. That is not the Federal Government's job. 
   It is interesting. There was a piece in Newsweek by Jonathan Alter, a rather interesting columnist. He said about 4 or 5 years ago the Congress decided they were going to spend $8 billion to upgrade jails and prisons. The State and local governments absolutely spent the money for jails and prisons. The Federal Government can upgrade the jails and prisons but not the schools. Is it less important to bring schools up to standard than a jail or a prison somewhere? 
   If we can spend $8 billion to improve places to incarcerate criminals, we ought to be able to spend a few billion dollars to help kids go into a classroom door in a school that we as parents could be proud of. That ought to be done in this session of the Congress as well. 
   Judicial nominations, we want to get through. We don't have a committee in this Congress for lost and found. Almost everywhere else--hotels, airports, every other institution--when you lose something and ask where the lost and found is, they send you there. There is a lost and found over there. In Congress there is no place you can go to the lost and found. Maybe we need a committee on the lost and found. When these policy issues leave here, you never hear from them again. 
   I hope that in the coming days Republicans and Democrats together can decide that there are certain common elements to an agenda that will strengthen this country and make this a better place in which to live. I don't believe that we have a circumstance where one side of the political aisle is all right, and the other side all wrong. That is not the case. We have good men and women serving in this Chamber on both sides of the political aisle. But it remains a frustration that in some areas where we have passed legislation, it gets sent to a conference somewhere never to be seen again because a small minority refuses to accept sensible judgments of the majority in both the House and the Senate. 
   I think that is the case with the Patients' Bill of Rights with respect to the vote in the House, and certainly is the case with juvenile justice and decisions in the Senate on things such as trigger locks and also closing the gun show loophole. 
   I hope we can find a way to address some of these important issues in the coming weeks and months. 
   I hope we can demonstrate to the American people that we care about education and health care, address the crime issue in a thoughtful way, get nominations through this Chamber, and appoint Federal judges to fill vacancies, which are things that represent part of the agenda that needs to be completed as soon as possible in the Senate. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President I enjoyed listening to the majority leader. I have always worked well with him, although we have different perspectives and a different philosophy and opinion on some issues. I have worked with him both in the House of Representatives and here in the Senate. When I listen to him I am always reminded why I have always liked him personally. He is a good person. I appreciate his public service. 
   There are some things on the agenda, however, that we might not agree about. I want to comment about a couple of those issues, especially with respect to an agenda item this week dealing with the repeal of the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax, which is set for a cloture vote tomorrow afternoon here in the Senate Chamber. 
   My expectation is that the cloture vote will fail. I am not certain of that, but that is my expectation. Just hearing some of the comments and some of the statements that have been made previously, I expect that cloture vote will fail, and I think justifiably so. 
   Let me describe why. 
   I think the price of fuel in this country is a pretty tough pill for the American people to swallow. What has happened is the price of gasoline has spiked up. It is not because the free market has caused that. It is because we have a cartel called the OPEC countries that are limiting production and increasing the international price for their product. 
   That is not the free market. That is monopoly pricing. They have the strength and, I guess, the opportunity to do that. What they have done is, of course, impose a significant new charge on American families, on family farmers, producers, manufacturers, drivers, and others. 
   There was no vote on that. That was something the OPEC countries did. We  didn't have a chance to discuss that or vote on it in the Congress. 
   The question I ask with respect to the repeal of the 4.3-cent gas tax--which is, after all, rather small in the scheme of what has happened to the price of gasoline--is who would get the benefit of that? Is there a guarantee of any kind that the American people would actually get the benefit of the gas tax reduction? The gasoline tax is not imposed at the pump. The gasoline tax is imposed up the line. There is no guarantee at all that if the Congress would repeal the 4.3-cent gasoline tax, that that savings wouldn't simply be blended into the profits of the large oil companies. There is no guarantee that the American driver is going to pull up to a gas pump and find that gasoline prices are 4.3 cents a gallon less. 
   The other question is, What is going to happen to make sure we continue the building of the transportation infrastructure, roads and bridges, the programs we have already approved in the highway program that are done with this money? I am told by some: This money will be made up from the general fund. Where from the general fund? Where do we get that money? How do we know that will be the case? 
   Someone once said you should never buy anything from somebody who is out of breath. There is a kind of breathless quality about bringing this bill to the floor of the Senate to repeal the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax. 
   One of the reasons we heard Members stand up last week and ask some very tough questions about this is, most of them understand, this is kind of an immediate, quick reaction that hasn't been thought through very well. It will not necessarily provide any relief to drivers. There is no guarantee this 4.3-cent-a-gallon reduction is going to show up at the pumps. 
   Secondly, where is the money? Where are we going to make up the money? Which roads aren't we going to fix or which bridges are not going to be repaired? Those are questions that need answering this week. Because they cannot be answered, I think the cloture vote will fail. 
   I think this is a pretty good discussion we are having with respect to energy policy. The majority leader indicated this country doesn't have much of an energy policy. I don't quarrel with that. We haven't had much under any administration, as a matter of fact. We are far too dependent on foreign sources of energy. There is no question about that. But in many ways this is a helpful discussion because we have had the discussion in recent years about the globalization of our economy. How can one stand in the way of the global economy? We are told this economy is a global economy. Understand it, they say. 
   Well, where are people going to produce energy in this world? In a global economy, they will produce energy where it is least expensive to produce. You can bring up oil under the sands in the Persian Gulf for a fraction of the cost of bringing up oil in the United States. That is the global economy, I guess. That is a decision the global economy helps make. 
   The majority leader asked the question--I think a very important question--do we have a national policy with respect to energy and our desire to be somewhat independent of foreign sources? That is a good question not just for oil. It is a good question for steel and for a whole series of things we know are important to the American economy. 
   We have been told until this time there is nothing that is more important than globalization of our economy; if steel moves and is produced elsewhere, so be it. Do the people who say that feel the same way about oil? Because that is where we are. The oil we consume is produced elsewhere. We now discover that when a cartel manipulates artificially the price of oil by restricting supply, Americans get overcharged. That is part of a monopoly in 
   the global economy that we do not control. 
   We need to do a lot of things. This administration is proposing something I hope the majority leader and others will support in the area of domestic renewable energy. They are proposing significant new initiatives in wind energy, which I think make a lot of sense. We have new technology on wind-generation devices that is remarkable. If we put some in this Chamber on the right days, we could electrify New York. 
   In my State, North Dakota, I grew up walking outdoors in the morning with the wind and the breeze. If you take a map and evaluate what is the Saudi Arabia of wind energy, it is North Dakota, and a lot of other northern border States are right behind. Some will say, listening to me speak, they would have known we ranked high on wind energy. But seriously, we have an opportunity, with new technology, to capture wind energy in many parts of this country and extend our energy supply. 
   The same is true with biomass. The same is true with geothermal, and natural gas, which the majority leader suggested. Absolutely, we have wonderful new discoveries in natural gas and deep well finds. We are doing a lot of that. 
   We do need to pay attention to the development of oil and the development of coal, which are important in this country. We also need to get behind the proposals coming from the Department of Energy and this President's budget that call for the development of renewable energy resources and what is called green power--environmentally friendly sources of power. I mentioned one: wind energy. We need to fully fund these initiatives. 
   I hope no one comes to the floor later and says, ``We really care about our energy supply,'' if before that time they voted against these initiatives to extend our energy supply by investing in renewable energy sources. We need to do that. 
   This, in many ways, is a wonderful discussion. What does the global economy mean? Does it mean we don't have to worry about dependence on anything? We are now discovering it means we have to worry about dependence with respect to oil. What about steel? What about a range of other economic activities without which a country such as ours will not long remain a world economic power? This is a great discussion to have. It is right on point and right on time. 
   Yes, it is about oil and gas, but it is about much more than that. When we have this vote on cloture on the 4.3-cent gasoline tax repeal, I hope it will be preceded by a rather lengthy discussion of a whole range of these issues. I appreciate the majority leader raising them today. 
   I don't intend to support cloture. As I said, there is kind of a breathless quality of coming to the floor with a 4.3-cent gas tax repeal that consumers will probably never see, even if we take the 4.3 cents off. I expect it is going into other pockets long before it gets to the consumer. If it gets done, dye the dollars green and then look around for green pockets someplace. You won't find green at the gas pumps. You will find it somewhere upstream. Some bigger enterprise will pocket that money.

   Mr. DORGAN. There is no disagreement in the Senate about the marriage tax penalty, that it ought not exist. We should change it. There are several different proposals to change it. We ought to come together with respect to one of those proposals. 
   I will describe one approach to address the marriage tax penalty. I am going to be introducing a piece of legislation at some point in the days ahead with my colleagues, Senator JUDD GREGG, a Republican, and Senator DICK DURBIN, a Democrat, and perhaps others, that would dramatically change the income tax system in this country. This approach would eliminate for a large number of Americans the marriage tax penalty. I have been working on this a couple of years and appreciate the work of Senator GREGG and others. 
   Over 30 countries that have an income tax system allow people to comply with their income tax without having to file a tax return. How do they do it? They just manipulate their W-4 that is filed with the employer to provide a little more information, and their actual withholding becomes their exact tax liability--no questions. That is your liability, no return filed, no searching for records, no long line at the post office on April 15. 
   Our country can do that. Our country can do it in a way that will allow 70 million Americans to comply with their income tax responsibilities on April 15 without having to file an income tax return. How do we do it? You  take the W-4 form when you sign in with your employer and you say: I have four children. I own a home--check that box. Check about three or four boxes. From that, you provide opportunities for the deduction for, on average, a mortgage interest deduction, and a couple of other things. 
   A table is then provided by the Internal Revenue Service that sets forth the exact amount of taxes that the employer will withhold and send the IRS, and that is the end of the transaction. You are not going to be hassled or forced to search for receipts; you are not going to wait in a long line at the post office to get your income tax return postmarked by April 15. 
   Now, in doing that, this plan will also eliminate the marriage tax penalty. But the plan only applies to people making $50,000 a year or less in wages, if they are single, or $100,000 a year or less, if they are married filing jointly. If they have less than $2,500 in other income such as interest, dividends or capital gains if they are single, or $5,000 or less in such other income if they are married and filed jointly, they are eligible to check the box that says, yes, I want to use the Fair and Simple Shortcut Tax plan, the FASST plan, which means I don't have to file a tax return. My withholding will be adjusted at my place of work, and the withholding will be sent to the IRS and there is no tax return. 
   Simple, yes. It is the only plan I know of that discusses simplicity. Everybody who talks about simplifying the tax program, in most cases, ends up proposing things that will make it horribly complicated. This will simplify it--but not for everybody. 
   Some people have unusual income characteristics, with four different jobs, and investments, and capital gains of $20,000 or $40,000 a year. It won't work for them. For the majority of the American people whose only income is their wage at work and they have a de minimis amount of other income in capital gains or interest--$5,000 a year if they are married and filing jointly--all that other income will be tax free. So that is the incentive for savings and investment; that is the right incentive. All of the wage income--after several major deductions--up to $50,000 single and $100,000 married filing jointly--will be taxed at the single lowest rate. This plan extends the bottom rate and provides a de minimis amount of income tax free and you don't have to file a tax return anymore. 
   That makes a lot of sense to me and a fellow named Bill Gale at the Brookings Institution, who has done a lot of work on this issue of return-free filing. We are going to introduce legislation, which has been underway for a year and a half, I hope within the next week. As I indicated, Senator JUDD GREGG of New Hampshire has agreed to cosponsor, and Senator DURBIN and, I hope, others, so we can begin discussing real simplification for tens of millions of Americans who always do the right thing. They always file a tax return, they always fill it out correctly, and they believe as an American it is their responsibility because we do things, as a country, to provide for a common defense, to build roads and schools, and to provide for a whole series of things. They understand their obligation to pay for the cost of a civilized society, to pay for the cost of democracy. But they ought to be able to do it in a way that is far simpler than the current system, and that is what we intend to accomplish with this legislation. 
   Madam President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this budget is brought to the floor as part of an annual ritual. The ritual in the Senate is to debate budget priorities. It is about making choices. 
   One hundred years from now we will all be gone. We will not be around, but historians can look back at this day, and by evaluating what we viewed to be important and what we wanted to spend money on, they can evaluate what our priorities were. Did we feel health care was a priority? Was education a priority? Were tax cuts a priority? 
   Let's look at the choices. This budget is brought to the floor suggesting that a significant priority is to provide tax cuts, the benefit of which go largely to upper-income folks in this country. The Senator from Virginia, Mr. ROBB, offers a different set of priorities. He says: Let's not have these tax cut proposals move forward until and unless there is a prescription drug benefit added to the Medicare program. 
   I happen to think we ought not have tax cuts until we have made a significant payment toward reducing the Federal debt. I also believe, with the Senator from Virginia, that we ought to have a benefit for prescription drugs in the Medicare program. 
   That is what this debate is about--it is about making choices. What are the right choices? I have held hearings in six States with the Democratic Policy Committee on the issue of prescription drugs and Medicare. Let me tell Members about choices senior citizens are making. The Senator from Virginia suggests we are about to make the wrong choice unless we adopt his amendment. I agree with him. Let's make the right choice. 
   Let me describe the choices senior citizens are making. At a hearing in Dickinson, ND, Dr. James Baumgartner told me of a patient of his on Medicare who had surgery for breast cancer. He told her about the prescription drug she would have to take to reduce the chances of recurrence of breast cancer. She said: Doctor, I can't do that. I don't have the money to buy those prescription drugs. I'm just going to have to take my chances. 
   That is a choice. Not a good choice, but a forced choice because there is no coverage for prescription drugs in Medicare. 
   How about the choice of buying food? At another hearing in Illinois, a woman told me that where she goes to the grocery store, the pharmacy counter is at the back end of the store. She must go to the rear of the store to buy her prescription drugs, first, because only then will this older woman know how much money she has left for food. She must buy her prescription drugs first because only then will she know what she can afford to pay for her food. 
   That is a choice she had to make. 
   At another hearing, a fellow told me that he pays $2,400 for medicine. He is living on a fixed income in retirement. He said: I eat spaghetti sometimes 8 and 9 days in a row because I can't afford anything else, and still be able to pay for my prescription medicine. 
   That is a choice. Not a good one but a choice. 
   Or transplant recipients at a hearing in Illinois. We had two people with heart transplants and one with a double lung transplant. One of them said her prescription drugs costs $24,000 a year. 
   That person could probably make a choice of having the rejection of her transplants, but that is not much of a choice either, is it? 
   Or the woman in New York at the hearing I held. Connie, from Rye Brook, NY, has no prescription drug coverage and is forced to pay out-of-pocket costs she cannot afford. She said: I cut the pill in half and take half the dosage so it lasts twice as long. 
   That, too, is a choice. Not a good choice. 
   All over the country, senior citizens are having to make these choices. They are not good choices because we don't have a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program. 
   Senator ROBB from Virginia has said in his amendment that we ought to make it a priority to do the right thing. He is dead right. We have a responsibility to add a prescription drug benefit to this Medicare program. This is the time and the place to make that choice. This vote will determine what that choice is going to be. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate, and it is fascinating. Some things that are debated in the Senate are complicated. This is not. 
   The question proposed by Senator CONRAD is: Will we devote more money to reducing the debt? If during good economic times we have a surplus and we cannot reduce the debt we have accumulated during tough economic times, when are we going to see real debt reduction? I do not think there is any Senator who ought to be voting against Senator CONRAD's second-degree amendment. 
   With respect to the point he made about the use of Social Security funds, he and I, the Senator from Nevada, and others have been on this floor for, I guess, 5 or 6 years talking about this very issue. We cannot use these funds as offsets for something else and then say: No, we didn't use them; in fact, we created a lockbox. Some lockbox. Somebody got away with the key in the middle of the night, apparently. 
   Back to the point. The issue here, offered in the second-degree amendment, is, if during tough economic times we ran up this Federal debt to $5.7 trillion, will we, during good economic times, when we have a surplus, begin to make significant payments to reduce that debt? 
   Is there any greater gift we can give to America's children to reduce that burden on their shoulders of this Federal debt? The answer is no. 
   This second-degree amendment is an amendment every single Senator ought to be supporting if they believe in basic conservative principles of, during good times, paying back what you had to borrow during tough times. That is what this second-degree amendment is all about. It is very simple. As I said when I started, there are a lot of things that are frightfully complicated on which we vote on the floor of the Senate. This is not. This is incredibly simple. We ought to support the second-degree amendment. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to introduce some legislation dealing with violent crime. Before I describe that legislation, I want to speak briefly about another piece of legislation that I previously introduced called Jeanna's bill, named after an 11-year-old girl from Fargo, ND, who was brutally murdered some while ago. I will speak about that for a moment today because something has happened in the last couple of days of which we ought to be aware. 
   This is a picture of a man named Kyle Bell. He is a child killer. He molested children. He was sent to prison for 30 years. He was eventually convicted of killing Jeanna North from Fargo, ND, and sent off to prison. 
   As is too often the case in this country, Kyle Bell was remanded to the custody of a private company to transport him to a prison in some other part of America. That private transport company lost this child killer along the way. He escaped. He was not wearing red clothing or an orange jumpsuit that said: ``I am a prisoner.'' He was in civilian clothes. He was in a van with other prisoners. 
   One of the guards of the company that was transporting him apparently went in to buy a hamburger or something at a gasoline stop, and the other was asleep in the van. Kyle Bell somehow got his shackles off, climbed up through the roof of the van, and was gone. Tragically, the guards did not notice they had lost a convicted child killer for 9 hours--9 hours. 
   It concerned me when I saw what had happened to this child killer. This newspaper piece describes what happened and the manhunt around the country for Kyle Bell, a very violent career criminal. 
   I put together a piece of legislation and was joined by Senator ASHCROFT, Senator LEAHY, and others, to say that if state and local authorities are going to contract with a private company to haul convicted killers and violent offenders, at least the company ought to have to meet some basic standards. That is just common sense to me. It is not now the case. 
   Any retired law enforcement officer and their brother-in-law and cousin can buy a van, show up at a prison someplace and say: We are hired to haul your prisoners. In fact, it has happened all too often. I will give an example. 
   A husband and wife team showed up at an Iowa State prison to transport six inmates, five of them convicted murderers. The warden looked at the husband and wife team and said: You have to be kidding me. But the prisoners were given to the husband and wife to transport, and, of course, they escaped. There is story after story of this same circumstance. 
   The reason I mention it today is earlier this week in Chula Vista, CA, convicted murderer James Prestridge was being transported. He is a person convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole. He was apparently, according to the Los Angeles Times, being transported from Nevada to North Dakota where he was going to be incarcerated under some kind of prisoner exchange. This is a convicted killer, to be incarcerated for the rest of his life. 
   Guess what. Mr. James Prestridge, a convicted killer, is no longer in custody. The private company called Extradition International lost him. He escaped. They stopped at a bathroom and he overpowered a guard. He went back to the van, overpowered the other guard, and this guy was gone. He and another violent offender who was with him are on the loose today. 
   Why is this happening? It does not happen when the U.S. Marshal Service transports violent offenders around the country. They are not losing violent offenders. But private companies have no standards to meet, none at all. Hire a couple of people, rent a van, get your brother-in-law, and you are in business. Some States will turn convicted murderers over to you to be transported to another part of the country. 
   This makes no sense to me at all. Convicted killers are being transported around our country without the precaution one would expect in the transport of violent offenders. Under these circumstances, the American people are not safe. 
   Again, the bill I have introduced will require any private company that transports a violent offender to meet basic standards established by the Department of Justice. That bill needs to be heard. We have asked for a hearing before the Judiciary Committee. 
   It has bipartisan support. Congress needs to pass this legislation this year. 
   The escape in Chula Vista, CA, of a convicted murderer is just one more example of many escapes from private prisoner transport companies. I could stand here for 20 minutes and describe the escapes that have occurred with private companies having access to violent offenders. That is not in the public interest. 
   In my judgment, violent offenders probably ought to be transported only by law enforcement. But if some States decide they are going to contract with private companies to transport violent offenders around this country, then those companies ought to have to meet basic standards--standards on how you shackle a violent prisoner, standards on what that violent prisoner shall wear when being transported, standards on the experience and the training of the guards and the kind of equipment that is used. 
   But those standards do not exist now. There is none. That is why people, such as James Prestridge, a convicted murderer, are on the loose. Let's hope no one else loses their life because of this kind of incompetence.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me briefly comment on the remarks made by the senior Senator from West Virginia. I know from having visited with him about this subject over some long while that he found this to be a difficult subject, not a simple subject, not an easy issue to resolve. I felt the same way about this issue. He spoke about the U.S. Constitution at great length today and all Members of the Senate will learn from that speech. 
   I have told my colleagues previously that on the 200th birthday of the writing of the Constitution I was one of the 55 Americans who went into that room where the Constitution was written 200 years prior to that, when 55 men went into that room and wrote a Constitution. Two-hundred years later, 55 people--men, women, minorities--went into that room. I was privileged to have been selected to be one of them. I have told the story before and people may get tired of hearing it, but I sat in that room--I come from a town of about 270 people, a small ranching area of Southwestern North Dakota. I sat in that room--the assembly room in Constitution Hall--200 years after the Constitution was written, the document that begins, ``We the people.'' 
   In that room, George Washington's chair is still in front of the room, where he sat as he presided over the constitutional convention, and Ben Franklin sat over on this side, and there was Madison and Mason; Thomas Jefferson was in Europe, but he contributed through his writings to the Bill of Rights. I thought to myself that this is a pretty remarkable country where a fellow from a town of about 270 people can participate in a celebration of this sort. 
   From that moment, I have been troubled by the proposition that some convey so easily of wanting to change the U.S. Constitution. I mentioned yesterday that we have had, I believe, 11,000 proposals to change the Constitution, 11,000. Among those, for example, was a proposal to have a President from the North during one term and then the requirement that the next term of the Presidency be filled by a President who comes from the southern part of the U.S. That was one idea. 
   Fortunately, the Constitution is hard to amend. Since the Bill of Rights, only 17 times have we amended this document, and then in almost every case, it was to expand freedom and liberty. So I have had great difficulty with this issue. I love the flag and what it stands for. I am devoted to the flag and the Constitution and the principles on which this country was founded. I know the Senator from West Virginia is as well. I wanted to say how much I and my colleagues, I am sure, appreciate his presentations to the Senate not just today but on a recurring basis, reminding us of the timeless truths about who we are and about who we have been, about the rich and majestic history of our country and the principles that have allowed us to progress to the point now of the year 2000 as the oldest successful democracy in history. 
   So I want to say thank you. As I say, this is a very difficult issue. I came to the same conclusion, that I did not feel I could amend the U.S. Constitution in this manner. It doesn't mean that I don't believe we ought to find a way, short of changing the Constitution, to provide sanctions for those who would desecrate America's flag. I just have not been able to make the leap of saying, yes, let's change the framework of the Constitution. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his enormous contribution today.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I offer legislation today that I introduced previously but on which I was not able to get action during a previous Congress, and that is legislation dealing with truth in sentencing. 
   Let me talk about some folks who have committed violent acts in this country. Recently, I read in a local paper here that a man named Kenneth Lodowski is walking around this metropolitan area. He was sentenced to die in 1984. He murdered two people--one  an off-duty police officer, and the other a clerk in a convenience store. He was sentenced to die in 1984 for two murders. The prosecuting attorney called the murders ``as vicious a crime as I have experienced in my 24 years as State's attorney.'' 
   That is the crime. 
   After a series of appeals, this man, who was sentenced to death for two murders, had the sentence changed to life imprisonment without parole, then changed again, then changed again. Finally, the sentence was 25 years in prison. After 16 years in prison, this person is walking around the streets of this metropolitan area--free. 
   Why? Here is the reason. If you commit murder in this country, on average, you are going to be sentenced to about 21 years in prison. On average, a murderer will be sentenced to about 21 years in prison but will serve, on average, only 10 years behind bars. 
   Most people will be startled to hear that. But let me say that again. The average sentence served by a murderer in this country is about 10 years. Why? Because people are let out early. Murderers go to prison, and they get ``good time,'' time off for good behavior: If you want to get out early, just be good in prison, and we will put you back on the streets. 
   What happens when you are put back on the streets? You read the stories. I have spoken a number of times about Bettina Pruckmayr, a young woman who moved to town with great expectations, a young lawyer. She was abducted in a carjacking, then taken to an ATM machine to extract cash, and then stabbed 30 times in a horrible death. This young, 26-year-old attorney who was just beginning her career in this town, was stabbed 30 times by a man who had previously been convicted of rape, armed robbery, and murder. That man was on the streets legally, let out by a criminal justice system that does not keep people who we know are violent behind bars--let out early. 
   Or Jonathan Hall, about whom I have spoken in this Chamber, 13 years old, stabbed by a man who moved into his neighborhood, stabbed 60 times with a screwdriver, thrown down an embankment into a pond. When they found young Jonathan, after being stabbed 60 times, they found dirt and grass between his fingers because even though he had been stabbed 60 times, this 13-year-old boy had tried to crawl out of that pond into which this fellow had thrown him. His clenched fists described his will to survive. But he did not; he died. 
   Jonathan's murderer was a career criminal. He had been convicted previously of kidnapping and murder, but let out, and was living in the neighborhood and able to murder this 13-year-old boy--paroled just 1 year before he took Jonathan's life. 
   And Julie Schultz from ND, a woman whom I know fairly well, the mother of three, who stopped at a highway rest area one day on a pleasant, tranquil afternoon in North Dakota. She was 
   attacked by a man who tried to rape her, slashed her throat, cutting her vocal cords, and left her for dead at a rest area on Highway 2 in northern North Dakota. 
   She survived the attack. In fact, I saw Julie just 2 weeks ago at the Minneapolis Airport. She survived the attack but has lasting scars and difficulties as a result of that attack. 
   Who attacked Julie? The same kind of person who attacked others around this country--people who we knew were violent, were put behind bars, and let out early because the criminal justice system says: You only have to spend 10 years, on average, in jail if you commit a murder in this country. We will sentence you to 21 years, but you only have to spend 10 years behind bars because we will let you out early if you are good. 
   The fellow who slashed the throat of Julie Schultz served 7 years of a life sentence in the State of Washington before being released, before being on Highway 2, on an afternoon in North Dakota, able to do what he did to Julie Schultz. 
   Sara Paulson, 8 years old, went out for a bike ride one day and never came back. Her body was found under a pine tree less than 200 yards from her home. She had been sexually assaulted and strangled to death. Her murderer had been previously sentenced to prison for rape but was paroled after serving less than half of his sentence. 
   I am introducing legislation today, cosponsored by Senator CRAIG of Idaho, and another piece of legislation cosponsored by Senator CRAIG of Idaho and Senator ROBB of Virginia. The point of it is very simple. I believe in the criminal justice system we ought to have different standards for those who commit acts of violence. Everyone in this country who commits acts of violence ought to understand: You go to prison, and your address is going to be your jail cell until the end of your sentence. 
   Do you know what the prison folks say to us? We need mechanisms by which we can persuade inmates to behave in prison. The mechanism is to dangle before them an early-out, time off for good behavior. So if we are able to reward them for behaving in prison, we are able to manage them. 
   I say to them, what about managing them on the streets? 
   As I stated, there is a fellow who is walking the streets in this metropolitan area now, after 16 years, who killed a policeman and killed a clerk in a store, because he was released early. 
   What about the people on the streets who are going to meet that fellow? What about their safety? Who is managing that violent offender now? Who managed the violent offender who viciously attacked Julie Schultz? Who managed the behavior of the man who violently attacked Jonathan Hall? Who was watching the fellow who violently attacked Bettina Pruckmayr? 
   The answer is, nobody. 
   Let us segregate and separate those who commit violent acts in this country from those who are nonviolent offenders. Let's incarcerate them all. I do not mind early release for nonviolent offenders. But for violent offenders, we ought to have a society in which everyone understands: If you commit an act of violence, the prison cell is your address to the end of your sentence. No good time off for good behavior, no getting back to the streets early. You are going to be in prison to serve your term. 
   It is the only way, it seems to me, to protect innocent folks, such as Bettina Pruckmayr and Jonathan Hall and Julie Schultz, and so many others who have been victimized by people we know were violent and should have been in a prison cell but, instead, were on the streets early because prison authorities let them out early with ``good time'' credits and ``good time'' releases. 
   Let's stop it. My legislation will do that. It says to the States: You must do it. If you do not, you are going to lose certain grants under the Criminal Justice Act. Is that tough? Yes. But we must, it seems to me, take these steps to change this. 
   Again, let me conclude. My colleague from Illinois, I know, wants the floor. But early releases--these are State prisons, incidentally--sexual assault: Sentenced for 10 years, on average, and you are out in 5; robbery: Sentenced for 8 years, on average, and you are out in 4; murder: Sentenced for 21 years, on average, and you are out in 10. 
   Everyone in this Chamber knows the horrors of crime, 
   if not personally with them and their family, then a neighbor, a friend, a relative. 
   We know the current system isn't working. Too many violent offenders are sent back to America's streets. There is a way to stop that. Yes, I know we have too many people in prison; But the way to be smart about it is to segregate those who are violent offenders from those who are nonviolent. This piece of legislation would start us doing that. 
   If any of us, God forbid, would lose a loved one or relative because of a vicious crime committed by someone who should have been in prison but was let out early, we would spend the rest of our days trying to pass legislation like this. We ought to do it. 
   Let me again say, the piece of legislation I began to talk about today, because of the escape in Chula Vista, CA, has resulted in a convicted murderer walking around on the loose, a man named Prestridge. A violent murderer supposed to be spending the rest of his life behind bars is now loose because he was being transported by a private company and incompetence allowed these violent offenders, two of them, to escape--if we pass Jeanna's bill, named after the young 11-year-old who was violently murdered by Kyle Bell, if we pass that piece of legislation, I won't  be here speaking about those circumstances again because they won't happen again. I hope we will be able to address both of those pieces of legislation in the remaining months of this Congress. 
   I thank my colleague from Illinois. I wanted to introduce this legislation and talk about it at some length today. I know he is here to talk as well. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. I agree with what the Senator has said. Nearly half of the people incarcerated in this country are violent offenders, half are not. It seems to me we ought to be smarter in the way we incarcerate them, those half whom we know are violent. For those we know are violent, we should not be incentivizing them to move to the streets earlier. We ought to try to find ways to keep them in prison to the end of their term. Those who are nonviolent they have to be punished, serve their time. But they are not violent and are not a threat to people. 
   Senator John Glenn used to talk about this in the Senate. He used to bring with him a model of a Quonset hut, apparently made in Ohio. He said: This is the kind of place I lived in during the Korean war. My wife and I lived in one of these huts various places around the world. It was Marine housing, among other things. He said, for nonviolent offenders, we could put up some barbed wire and build Quonset huts. It doesn't take a fortune to create incarceration compounds for nonviolent offenders. We don't have to put them in lockups that are massively secure, lockups that cost a fortune. Use those lockups for violent offenders; then give yourself enough space to keep violent offenders behind bars to the end of their term. 
   That is the point I was making. I don't disagree with anything the Senator from Illinois said about the crime factor inside the prisons and about the circumstances these days of mandatory sentencing and crimes that have been nonviolent that have crowded the prison system. I thank the Senator for his comments.

   Mr. DORGAN. Ten years ago the U.S. Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision struck down a Texas flag protection statute on the grounds that burning an American flag was ``speech'' and therefore protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution. I disagreed with the Court's decision then and I still do. I don't believe that the act of desecrating a flag is an act of speech. I believe that our flag, as our national symbol, can and should be protected by law. 
   In the intervening years since the Supreme Court decision I have twice supported federal legislation that would make flag desecration illegal, and on two occasions I voted against amendments to the Constitution to do the same. I voted that way because, while I believe that flag desecration is despicable conduct that should be prohibited by law, I also believe that amending our Constitution is a step that should be taken only rarely and then only as a last resort. 
   In the past year I have once again reviewed in detail nearly all of the legal opinions and written materials published by Constitutional scholars and courts on all sides of this issue. I pledged to the supporters of the Constitutional amendment that I would re-evaluate whether a Constitutional amendment is necessary to resolve this issue. 
   From my review I have concluded that there remains a way to protect our flag without having to alter the Constitution of the United States. I joined Senators BENNETT, MCCONNELL and CONRAD today to introduce legislation that I believe accomplishes that goal. 
   The bill we offered today protects the flag but does so without altering the Constitution and a number of respected Constitutional scholars tell us they believe this type of statute will be upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. This statute protects the flag by criminalizing flag desecration when the purpose is, and the person doing it knows, it is likely to lead to violence. 
   Supporters of a Constitutional amendment are disappointed I know by my decision to support a statutory remedy to protect the flag rather than support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I know they are impatient to correct a decision by the Supreme Court that they and I believe was wrong. I have wrestled with this issue for so long and I wish I were not, with my decision, disappointing those, including many of my friends, who passionately believe that we must amend the Constitution to protect the flag.  
   But in the end I know that our country will be better served reserving our attempts to alter the Constitution only for those things that are ``extraordinary occasions'' as outlined by President James Madison, one of the authors of the Constitution, and only in circumstances when it is the only remedy for something that must be done. 
   More than 11,000 Constitutional amendments have been proposed since our Constitution was ratified. However, since the ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1791 only 17 amendments have been enacted. These 17 include three reconstruction era amendments that abolished slavery, and gave African-Americans the right to vote. The amendments included giving women the right to vote, limiting Presidents to two terms, and establishing an order of succession in case of a President's death or departure from office. The last time Congress considered and passed a new Constitutional amendment was when it changed the voting age to 18, more than a quarter of a century ago. All of these matters were of such scope they required a Constitutional amendment to be accomplished. 
   However, protecting the American flag can be accomplished without amending the Constitution, and that is a critically important point. 
   Constitutional scholars, including those at the Congressional Research Service, the research arm of Congress, and Duke University's Professor William Alstyne, have concluded that this statute passes Constitutional muster, because it recognizes that the same standard that already applies to other forms of speech applies to burning the flag as well. This is the same standard which makes it illegal to falsely cry ``fire'' in a crowded theater. Reckless speech that is likely to cause violence is not protected under the ``fighting words'' standard, long recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States. 
   I believe that future generations--and our founding fathers--would agree that it's worth the effort for us to find a way to protect our flag without having to wonder about the unintended consequences of altering our Constitution. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am, along with Senator DASCHLE, Senator BAUCUS and Senator JOHNSON, introducing the Rural Broadband Enhancement Act to deploy broadband technology to rural America. As the demand for high speed Internet access grows, numerous companies are responding in areas of dense population. While urban America is quickly gaining high speed access, rural America is--once again--being left behind. Ensuring that all Americans have the technological capability is essential in this digital age. It is not only an issue of fairness, but it is also an issue of economic survival. 
   To remedy the gap between urban and rural America, this legislation gives new authority to the Rural Utilities Service to make low interest loans to companies that are deploying broadband technology to rural America. Loans are made on a company neutral and a technology neutral basis so that companies that want to serve these areas can do so by employing technology that is best suited to a particular area. Without this program, market forces will pass by much of America, and that is unacceptable. 
   This issue is not a new one. When we were faced with electrifying all of the country, we enacted the Rural Electrification Act. When telephone service was only being provided to well-populated communities, we expanded the Rural Electrification Act and created the Rural Utilities Service to oversee rural telephone deployment. The equitable deployment of broadband services is only the next step in keeping America connected, and our legislation would ensure that. 
   If we fail to act, rural America will be left behind once again. As the economy moves further and further towards online transactions and communications, rural America must be able to participate. Historically, our economy has been defined by geography, and we in Congress were powerless to do anything about it. Where there were ports, towns and businesses got their start. Where there were railroad tracks, towns and businesses grew up around them. The highway system brought the same evolution. 
   But the Internet is changing all of that. No longer must economic growth be defined by geographic fiat. Telecommunications industries and policy-makers are proclaiming, ``Distance is dead!'' But, that's not quite right: Distance will be dead, as long as Congress ensures that broadband services are available to all parts of America, urban and rural. 
   I look forward to working with Senator DASCHLE, Senator BAUCUS, Senator JOHNSON and my other colleagues in the Senate to pass this legislation and give rural America a fair chance to survive.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to talk about two issues we must address in this Congress before the end of the year, both dealing with health care. I will describe very briefly why these are important and why many have been pushing for some long while to try to get the Senate to act on this issue. 
   First is prescription drugs and Medicare. On Friday of the past week, I was in New York City with Senator CHUCK SCHUMER holding a hearing on the issue of prescription drugs and Medicare. I have held similar hearings in Chicago, in Minneapolis, and various places around the country as the chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee. We have had virtually identical testimony no matter what part of the country we were in. Senior citizens say drug prices are very high. When they reach their senior years, living on fixed incomes, they are not able to access prescription drugs that they need. 
   In Dickinson, ND, a doctor told me of a patient of his who had breast cancer. 
   He told the woman after her surgery that she was going to have to take some prescription drugs in order to reduce the chances of the recurrence of breast cancer. When she found out what the cost of the prescription was, she said: I can't afford to take these drugs. 
   The doctor said: Taking them will reduce the risk of recurrence of breast cancer. 
   The woman said: I will just have to take my chances. 
   Why did she say that? Because there is no coverage in the Medicare program for prescription drugs and because many of these prescription drugs cost a significant amount of money. Senior citizens in this country are 12 percent of America's population, but they consume 33 percent of the prescription drugs in our country. 
   Last year, spending on prescription drugs in the United States increased 16 percent in 1 year. Part of this increase is the increase in drug prices and part is greater utilization of prescription drugs. 
   What does that mean? It means that everyone has a rough time paying for prescription drugs, especially senior citizens who live on fixed incomes. Many of us believe that were we to create a Medicare program today in the Congress, there is no question we would have a prescription drug benefit in that program. 
   Most of these lifesaving prescriptions were not available in the sixties when Medicare was created. But a lifesaving prescription drug can only save a life if those who need it can afford to access it. That is the point. That is why many of us want to include in the Medicare program a benefit for prescription drugs. We do not want to break the bank. We want to do it in a thoughtful way. We would have a copayment. We would have it developed in a manner that allows senior citizens to choose to access it or not. They could either participate in this Medicare prescription drug program or they could decide not to do it. 
   In any event, we ought to do something on this subject. Those of us who have come to the floor over and over again saying this is a priority believe with all our hearts this is something we should do for our country. 
   I will take a moment to describe part of the pricing problem with prescription drugs. The U.S. consumer pays the highest price for prescription drugs of anyone else in the world. 
   I ask unanimous consent to show a couple of pill bottles on the floor of the Senate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, these are two pill bottles. They are a different shape, but they contain the same pill made in the same factory, made by the same company. 
   This happens to be a pill most of us will recognize. It is called Claritin. It is commonly used for allergies. This bottle of 100 tablets, 10 milligrams each, is sold in the United States for $218. That is the price to the customer in the United States. This pill bottle is sold in Canada. It is the same pill made by the same company, in the same number of tablets and the same strength, but this bottle costs only $61. The same bottle of pills is $218 to the U.S. consumer; to the Canadian consumer, $61. By the way, the Canadian price has been converted into U.S. dollars. 
   One must ask the question: Do you think the pharmaceutical manufacturers are losing money in Canada selling it for $61? I guarantee you they would not sell it there if they were losing money, but they charge 358 percent more to the U.S. consumer. I will demonstrate another drug. 
   These two bottles contain Cipro. It is a common medicine to treat infection. This time, the drug is actually packaged in the same type of bottle, with the same marking, same coloring, and containing the same pills made by the same company. Incidentally, both were from facilities inspected by the FDA in the United States. Cipro, purchased in the United States, 500 milligram 
   tablets, 100 tablets, costs $399. If one buys the pills in the same bottle in Canada, it is $171. The U.S. consumer is charged 233 percent more. 
   We need to do something about two issues: One, we need to put some downward pressure on pharmaceutical drug prices and to ask the legitimate question: Why should the American consumer pay higher prescription drug  prices than anyone else in the world? Is that fair? The answer, of course, is no. 
   What does it mean to those who can least afford it? It means lifesaving medicine is often not available to those who cannot afford access to it. I can tell my colleagues story after story of folks who came to hearings I held in Chicago, New York, and all around the country describing their dilemma. There were people who had double lung transplants, heart transplants and cancers, talking about $2,000 a month in prescription drug costs. 
   This is serious, and this is trouble for a lot of folks. We need to do something about putting downward pressure on prescription drug prices. 
   I have a solution for that, and that is to allow US pharmacists and distributors access to the same drugs in Canada and to bring it down and pass the savings along to the US consumers. We have to pass a law to do that. We are having a little trouble passing that bill. 
   Second, we need to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. 
   I will now turn to the Patients' Bill of Rights, which is the second piece of legislation we ought to get done. The Senate has passed a bill, some call it the ``Patients' Bill of Goods'' because it did not do much and it covered few people. The House passed a bipartisan bill, the Dingell-Norwood bill. Democrats and Republicans joined to pass this bill. It is a good bill. 
   The Senate and House bills are in conference. The House appointed conferees who voted against the House bill because the House leadership does not support the bipartisan bill that passed the House. We have a paradox of conferees from the House who, by and large, do not support the House bill, which is the only good bill called the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I will describe a couple of the elements of the Patients' Bill of Rights, which are so important. 
   First is the situation with Ethan Bedrick. One might say: You have done that before; that is unfair. It is not unfair. Health care denied to individuals is a very personal issue. When we have a framework for health care delivery in this country that denies basic health care services under certain HMOs and certain policies to people who need it, it is perfectly fair to talk to people in the Senate about the need to change public policy. 
   This is little Ethan Bedrick from Raleigh, NC. When he was born, his delivery was very complicated. It resulted in severe cerebral palsy and impaired the motor functions in his limbs. As you can see, he has bright eyes and a wonderful smile. When he was 14 months old, his insurance company curtailed his physical therapy. Why? Because they said he only had a 50-percent chance of walking by age 5. A 50-percent chance of walking by age 5 is not enough, they said. This is a matter of dollars and cents, so Ethan shall not get his physical therapy. 
   Is it fair to raise these questions? Of course it is. Should someone like Ethan with a 50-percent chance of walking by age 5 have an opportunity for the physical therapy he needs? You bet. Should we have a Patients' Bill of Rights that will guarantee him that access under an HMO contract? You bet. 
   We have in the House of Representatives Dr. GREG GANSKE, a Republican, and very courageous fellow, I might add. He is one of the key sponsors of the Patients' Bill of Rights in the House of Representatives. Dr. GANSKE is also someone who has done a substantial amount of reconstructive surgery. 
   He used this photograph, which is quite a dramatic photograph showing a baby born with a very serious defect, a cleft lip shown in this picture. Dr. GANSKE was a reconstructive surgeon before he came to Congress. He said he routinely saw HMOs turn down treatment for children with this kind of defect because they said it was not medically necessary. 
   I thought when I heard Dr. GANSKE make that presentation the first time: How can anyone say correcting this is not medically necessary? 
   Then Dr. GANSKE used a picture which showed what a correction looks like when reconstructive surgery is done. Isn't it wonderful what can happen with good medicine? But it can only happen if that child has access to that reconstructive surgery. 
   Is it a medical necessity? Is it fair for us to discuss and debate the Republican policy? The answer is clearly yes. 
   Let me also mention a case I have discussed before on the floor of the Senate, young Jimmy Adams. Jimmy is now 5. When he was 6 months old, he developed a 105-degree fever. When his mother called the family's HMO, they were told they should bring James to an HMO-participating hospital 42 miles away, even though there were emergency rooms much closer. 
   On that long trip to the hospital, this young boy suffered cardiac and respiratory arrest and lost consciousness. Upon arrival, the doctors were able to revive him, but the circulation in his hands and feet had been cut off. As you can see, he lost his hands and feet. 
   Why didn't they stop at the first emergency room or the second emergency room that was closer? Because the HMO said: We will only reimburse you if you stop at the emergency room we sanction. So 42 miles later, this young boy had these very serious problems and lost his hands and feet. 
   What are we to make of all this? We have very significant differences in the Patients' Bill of Rights between the House and the Senate. The differences in the bill of rights in the House and the Senate are the differences dealing with medical necessity. As used in HMO contracts:  
   Medical necessity means the shortest, least expensive or least intense level of treatment, care or service rendered or provided, as determined by us.  
   The fact is, health care ought not be a function of someone's bottom line. Young Ethan, young Jimmy, or the young person born with a severe birth defect, like the cleft palate defect of the type I described, ought not be a function of some insurance company's evaluation of whether their profit or loss margin will suffer by providing treatment to these patients. 
   A woman fell off a cliff in Virginia, dropped 40 feet and was rendered unconscious. She went into a coma and was brought into an emergency room and treated for broken bones and a concussion. They wheeled her into the emergency room on a gurney, while unconscious, yet the HMO later, after she survived, said: We will not pay for your emergency room treatment because you did not have prior approval. 
   This is a woman, unconscious, in a coma, wheeled into an emergency room, but she did not get prior approval. That is the sort of thing that goes on too often in this country in health care. It ought to be stopped. It can be stopped if we pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. Not if we pass a patients' bill of goods that someone tries to misname to tell their constituents they have done something when, in fact, they stood up with the insurance companies, rather than with patients. We need a Patients' Bill of Rights that really digs in on these issues: What is a medical necessity? Do patients have a right to know all of their options for treatment, not just the cheapest? Do they have those rights? 
   The piece of legislation that was passed in the House gives patients those rights. The piece of legislation the majority passed in the Senate does not. We are going to continue to fight to try to get something out of this conference committee that medical patients in this country, that the American people can believe will give them some basic protection, some basic rights, so that the kinds of circumstances I have described will not continue to exist in this country. 
   Health care ought not be a function of someone's profit and loss statement. People who need lifesaving treatment ought to be able to get it. The ability to access an emergency room during an emergency ought not be something that is debatable between a patient and an HMO. 
   Those are the issues we need to deal with in the coming couple of months--both of them health care issues, both of them important to the American people. I hope that as this debate unfolds, we will have some bipartisan help in trying to address prescription drugs in Medicare, No. 1, and, No. 2, passing a real Patients' Bill of Rights, to give real help to the American people. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Utah. This has always been a very difficult issue for me. I voted against a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag desecration both as a Member of the House of Representatives and also previously as a Member of the Senate. But it has been very difficult, largely because I believe, as do most Americans, that desecrating our flag is repugnant. It is an act that none of us would find anything other than disgusting. Yet the question is not that; the question is, Shall we amend the Constitution of the United States? 
   As I said on two previous occasions, I have voted against a constitutional amendment to prohibit the desecration of the flag, not because I believe the flag is not worth protecting--I believe it is worth protecting--but because I believe the Constitution should be altered only rarely and only in circumstances where it is the only method available to achieve a desired result. 
   The Constitution was written by 55 men over a couple of centuries ago. The room in which they wrote that document still exists, the assembly room in Constitution Hall. I was privileged to go back there for the 200th birthday of the writing of the Constitution. On that day, 55 of us went back into the chamber where they wrote the Constitution. Men, women, and minorities were among the 55 of us who went into that room. Sitting in that room, I got the chills because I saw the chair where George Washington sat as he presided over the Constitutional Convention. You can see where Ben Franklin, Mason, Madison, and others sat as they discussed the development of a constitution for this new democracy of ours. That Constitution begins with the three words: We the people. Then it describes the framework for self-government, representative democracy. 
   That framework has served this country very, very well over a very long period of time. As I understand it, there have been over 11,000 proposals to change the Constitution since the Bill of Rights. There have been 11,000 different ideas on how to alter the U.S. Constitution. Fortunately, over two centuries, 17 have prevailed. The framers of the Constitution actually made it fairly difficult to amend the Constitution. They did that for good reason. Only 17 of the 11,000 proposals have actually prevailed. Those 17, of course, are significant. Three of them are Reconstruction-era amendments that abolished slavery and gave African Americans and women the right to vote. There have been amendments  limiting the President to two terms and establishing an order of succession for a President's death or departure from office. 
   We have had proposals, for example, to amend the Constitution to provide that the Presidency shall be rotated with one term by a President from the southern part of the United States and then the next term by a President from the northern part. That is just one example of the 11,000 proposals to change the U.S. Constitution. It has been done only very rarely. 
   I indicated to those who support a constitutional amendment that when we are confronted with this question again--I greatly respect their views; I know they have great passion in doing so; they are patriots--I would do a significant review once again, and I have. I reviewed virtually all of the writings of the constitutional scholars on this issue. I read almost anything anyone has written about it, evaluated all of the research, and concluded once again that I think the best approach would be to pass a statute of the type described by the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Utah, and provide protection for the flag in that manner which constitutional scholars of the Congressional Research Service say will be upheld by the Supreme Court. I believe that is the more appropriate and right approach as opposed to amending the Constitution. 
   I will read something from Gen. Colin Powell, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He puts it probably better than I can. I read it only to describe again that there are some who say, well, if you are not supporting a constitutional amendment to prohibit desecration of the flag somehow you don't support the flag or you are unworthy. That is not the case at all. I hope all of us will respect the various positions on this. 
   Let me read the letter from Gen. Colin Powell. 
   He said:  
   I love our flag, our Constitution and our country with a love that has no bounds. I defended all three for 35 years as a soldier and was willing to give my life in their defense. 
   Americans revere their flag as a symbol of the Nation. Indeed, it is because of that reverence that the amendment is under consideration. Few countries in the world would think of amending their Constitution for the purpose of protecting such a symbol. 
   We are rightfully outraged when anyone attacks or desecrates our flag. Few Americans do such things and when they do they are subject to the rightful condemnation of their fellow citizens. They may be destroying a piece of cloth, but they do no damage to our system of freedom which tolerates such desecration. 
   If they are destroying a flag that belongs to someone else, that's a prosecutable crime. If it is a flag they own, I really don't want to amend the Constitution to prosecute someone for foolishly desecrating their own property. We should condemn them and pity them instead. 
   I understand how strongly so many of my fellow veterans and citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful sentiment in state legislatures for such an amendment. I feel the same sense of outrage. But I step back from amending the Constitution to relieve that outrage. The First Amendment exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but also that which we find outrageous. 
   I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants. The flag will be flying proudly long after they have slunk away. 
   Finally, I shudder to think of the legal morass we will create trying to implement the body of law that will emerge from such an amendment. 
   If I were a member of Congress, I would not vote for the proposed amendment and would fully understand and respect the views of those who would. For or against, we all love our flag with equal devotion.  
   I think this letter from Gen. Colin Powell says it well, particularly when he says:  
   I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants. The flag will be flying proudly long after they have slunk away.  
   The statute that has been introduced by my colleagues from Utah and Kentucky, cosponsored by myself, Senator CONRAD and others, is a statute that offers some protection. I am convinced that it would be upheld constitutionally, and the constitutional scholars of the Congressional Research Service have written us with their opinion that it would be upheld as well. 
   I believe in every circumstance we ought to find ways to do that which is necessary and which is important without the resulting desire to change the framework of this democracy, the Constitution. 
   I greatly respect those who disagree with me, but I believe that over a long period of time--a decade, a half a century, a century--America will be better served if we resist the impulse to amend the Constitution in ways that will create unintended consequences. 
   Once again, that room in which George Washington, Madison, Mason, Franklin, and others wrote the Constitution of the United States with the advice and consent of Thomas Jefferson, who was serving in Europe at the time and contributed most to the Bill of Rights, contains a great sense of history for those of us who have been there, as well as an understanding that the framework for our democracy, the U.S. Constitution, is a very special and very precious document. It should be changed only in rare circumstances, and even then only when it is the last method available for achieving a result we deem imperative for this country. 
   I believe the statute that has been offered as an amendment is a statutory approach that will solve this issue in an appropriate way, and will at the same time preserve the Constitution as intended, especially with the Bill of Rights and most especially with the care that Congress and the American people have nurtured over nearly two centuries. 
   Mr. President, let me commend the Senator from Kentucky. I know this amendment has been offered before on the floor of the Senate. I heard the debate by the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Utah. I concur with that discussion and hope we can achieve a positive vote on this proposal when it is voted on. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the Senator from Kansas, Mr. ROBERTS; Senator KERREY from Nebraska; my colleague, Senator CONRAD from North Dakota, and others, for their excellent work in bringing this legislation to the floor of the Senate. It is my intention to support this legislation. 
   I also say that I think the sense-of-the-Senate resolution offered by the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. WELLSTONE, is certainly thoughtful and worthy of support, as well. 
   I, too, join him in saying to my colleague, Senator LUGAR, that I have always believed he is a major contributor to most every public debate in this Senate, especially on foreign policy, and a range of other things. But it is true, we disagree on farm policy from time to time. We recently had an exchange of letters about that disagreement. But that does not, in any way, diminish my respect for him as a leader and a legislator. 
   My fervent hope is at some point I could reach over and reach out to Senator LUGAR and convince him that we need to--tomorrow or Thursday--start a series of hearings and change the farm bill. But I do not expect that will be the case. He will certainly explain his position on these issues in an articulate way soon. 
   But let me describe some of my feelings about where we are. Let me start with this: I say to my friend from Minnesota, this morning for breakfast I had something called Cream of Wheat. I do not know how many servings of Cream of Wheat are served in America every morning or every year but a lot of them. 
   Cream of Wheat, if you want to know the origin of it, just for fun--I notice the Presiding Officer is hanging on my every word here--came from Grand Forks, ND, in the year 1893. A little old mill called the Diamond Mills was not doing very well. They had a scientist who was sort of moving around and trying to figure out what he could do with various parts of the grain. He used what are called the middlings of wheat, and he concocted what he called a ``breakfast porridge.'' 
   So a man named Tom Amidon from Grand Forks, ND, in 1893, concocted what he called ``breakfast porridge'' with the middlings from wheat, and it is what is called Cream of Wheat. It is what I ate for breakfast this morning. 
   Cream of Wheat comes from the wheat fields in North Dakota and other places in the country. A farmer gases a tractor, buys the seed, plants the seed, and does all the work to produce this  wheat. Then it is ground up. Among that grinding you get some middlings. Somebody produces breakfast food with those middlings. 
   Cream of Wheat does not come from Grand Forks, ND, I must say with disappointment. Cream of Wheat is owned by Nabisco Company. It happens to be produced in my colleague's home State of Minnesota. The middlings, the wheat, the Cream of Wheat, the jobs, do not belong to the folks that gas the tractor and plant the seed and harvest the grain. No, that is not the way it works in agriculture. 
   Our farmers go out and plant a crop--corn, wheat, barley--and then someone comes along and buys it. They take a look at that kernel and say: You know what we ought to do. We ought to puff that up and then put it in a bright-colored box, and we will take that wheat and call it puffed wheat. Guess what that costs. Go to the grocery store and buy puffed wheat, puffed rice. They puff it; they shred it; they crisp it; they manipulate it in a hundred different ways and send it to the 
   grocery store shelf in bright-colored boxes. 
   The farmer gets a pittance for that grain because the farmer is told that grain does not have any value anymore. At the grocery store shelf it costs a fortune because now it has been puffed. So the puff is apparently more valuable than the grain that is produced out of the ground from the tireless work of a family farmer. 
   That describes part of the problem in this system of ours. We had a couple thousand people come to town, as the Senator from Minnesota described. They are the ones who could afford to come. I am sure it was a struggle for many of them. 
   Folks from my State--400 of them--got on buses, seven buses. I think they will have traveled close to 6 days--they are still on a bus, I am sure--traveling to Washington and back to North Dakota. 
   The fellow from just west of Valley City would not have been among them because he stood up at a meeting I had some while ago, and his chin began to tremble, and he had tears in his eyes--a big, husky guy with a beard. He said his granddad farmed his farm; his dad farmed his farm; and he farmed it for 23 years. Then his chin began to tremble, and he said: But I can't do it anymore. I'm being forced off the farm. 
   You could see that for him it was not about dollars and cents; it was the loss of a dream--a broken heart and broken dreams. I am sure he did not come out here because he is not farming anymore and could not afford it. He is probably struggling, after 23 years on a farm, trying to find something else to do--another job to try to make some income. 
   He made a point, as so many farmers do, that he was a good farmer. He did not waste money. He did not go to town on weekend nights. He did not buy new clothes. He told the kids they could not afford a new pair of jeans for school because they did not have the money. 
   He said: This isn't my fault. Collapsed prices are not my fault. Bad trade agreements are not my fault. Monopolies that press their boots down on the chests of family farmers are not my fault. 
   He was right about that. 
   He didn't cause these problems. Somewhere in the crevice between mathematics and virtue rests a blindness that somehow refuses to recognize value and values. We tend to think of all of this in the context of economics and numbers, not understanding, apparently, that family farmers produce something more than a crop. 
   Yes, a farmer produces wheat in the fields of North Dakota. That family living on a farm also produces a social product that most economists and most others believe has no value whatsoever in our country, a social product called community, called family values, called part of our culture that all of us understand, an environment that is good, a neighborhood that is free of crime, a lifestyle in which neighbors help one another. 
   When Ernest had a heart attack at harvest time in my hometown, his neighbors took the crop off the field. Why? Because they were competitors? No, because they were neighbors. That is a social product, but economists say it has no value. 
   The Europeans say it has value. In fact, in the trade negotiations between Europe and the United States, they say they want something called multifunctionality considered. Our trade people scratch their heads and say: What on Earth are you talking about, multifunctionality? The Europeans say: This is an important element of farming that you are missing when you just look at the hard numbers. What is missing is community, values, a certain culture we want to retain and sustain in our future. Our trade negotiators just can't understand that. They say: We don't understand that. This is all about dollars and cents. This is about markets. 
   My point is, family farms produce more than just grain. They produce something very important for this country. It is a social product that this country ought to want to retain and keep. 
   There are a series of things we must do to respond to the urgent needs of family farmers. We must repair a safety net that does not now provide the kind of assistance family farmers need when prices collapse. Family farmers can't make it across the valley when prices collapse without some kind of safety net to bridge that valley. That is No. 1. 
   No. 2, we must have better trade agreements. Family farmers cannot compete with one arm tied behind their backs. It is not fair. The Canadian trade agreement wasn't fair to our family farmers. It sold out family farmers' interests. I regret to say that, but I can bring data to the floor released yesterday that demonstrates that was the case. 
   NAFTA was unfair and GATT was unfair to our family farmers. I will be happy to come and speak at great length about that, but I won't today. 
   We must have a better safety net, better trade policies, and action against monopolies. Farmers ought not to have to market upstream when they are selling fat steers into a circumstance where just several companies control 80 percent of the steer slaughter. The same is true in every direction a farmer looks. If you want to put the grain on a railroad someplace, guess what. You will put your grain on a railroad that is a monopoly in most cases. The railroad will say to you: Here is what we charge. If you don't like it, tough luck. 
   Just as an example, if you have a carload of wheat in Bismarck, ND, and you will ship to Minneapolis, you will be charged $2,300 to ship it from Bismarck to Minneapolis. Ship the same carload of wheat from Minneapolis to Chicago, about the 
   same distance, and you are charged $1,000. Why are North Dakota farmers charged more than double to ship a carload of wheat about the same distance? Because there is no competition in North Dakota on that line. Between Minneapolis and Chicago, there is. That is called monopoly pricing, and it is unfair to family farmers. 
   The fourth thing we need to do is fix crop insurance. That is what this does. That is why I am here supporting it. I know that is a long introduction to get to my support. I will be very brief to say that I think this legislation has a lot to commend itself to the Senate. This is a good piece of legislation--perfect, no, but good. 
   Here is what it does. It makes crop insurance more affordable at buy-up coverage levels that are most useful to farmers. It addresses the problem of multiyear losses, which has been a very difficult problem for North Dakota farmers, and their impact on insurance coverages. It makes an important financial commitment to crop insurance expansion, research and development, education and outreach--issues that are particularly important to specialty crop communities. It authorizes a pilot program for livestock. It improves the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program. 
   This is a good bill. I know my colleagues have struggled mightily to produce this legislation. This bill comes to the floor with bipartisan support, Republicans and Democrats supporting it. I am pleased to support it and to commend all those who have helped bring this to the floor and who will support it in the Senate. It is but one step in a series of steps we must take to try to give family farmers some help. 
   Those 400 North Dakotans who are on 7 buses now on the highways going back to North Dakota could well have  been elsewhere this week. In most cases, in ordinary years, they would have been in the machine shed and they would have been working on their tractor, working on their farm equipment, repairing, replacing, renovating, greasing, changing the oil, getting all ready for spring. That is what farmers do. Farmers only can farm if they have hope. In most cases, these families live out on the farmsteads because they love that way of life. 
   The only way any of us could understand this is if we were to take our income each year. We have a salary in the Senate; we know what we are going to get each month. Wouldn't it be interesting if all Members of the Senate could let their income rest on certain things that are outside their control and have no certainty of income. Perhaps let your income rest on the question of whether it rains enough or too much, whether insects come to the Midwest, whether crop disease surfaces, whether there is a hail cloud that shows up or a funnel cloud that shows up in late August before harvest. If perhaps if we had that risk of income, we would be able to understand better, as all Members of the Senate, what family farmers face. 
   It is a very unusual, risky proposition that family farmers face every single year, with many elements in the determination of what kind of income they get that are completely outside of their control. That is why this is different. The enterprise of farming is different. Thomas Jefferson said it in words I cannot nearly match. But family farming is different. It is critically important to the future of this country. It is much more than just economics, finance, or math. It is a social product produced on our family farms in this country that contributes mightily to the character of this country as well. 
   That is why this is an important piece of legislation. I hope it is but a first small step in a journey we can make together to improve the opportunities for family farmers in our country. 
   I think the amendment offered by my colleague from Minnesota, which is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment commending those who came to Washington, DC, this week, is an appropriate amendment. I hope the Senate will agree to that amendment as well. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand the Senate is about to adjourn for the day. I was not going to come to the floor. Then I thought I would not sleep much tonight if I didn't come to the floor and say what I think ought to be said about the Federal Reserve Board. Again, today in secret downtown they increased interest rates for the fifth time in a relatively short period of time. 
   Will Rogers once said--and it is probably good to quote him in this room, where we used to have spittoons all across the Senate, I understand, well before I came here--``When there is no place left to spit, you either have to swallow your tobacco juice or you have to change with the times.'' 
   That is something the Federal Reserve Board would not understand. 
   The fact is, they met today again in secret behind closed doors, as they always do, because it is the last dinosaur left in this town. Everything else is relatively open. But the Federal Reserve Board meets in secret. They decided to do so again today. They decided to increase interest rates once again. 
   The last five interest rate increases, including this one today, mean that every family in America, on average, will pay an additional $440 in interest charges this year. That is a tax on every American family. That was imposed on the shoulders of every American family, with no debate and no discussion. It was done in secret by the bankers down at the Federal Reserve Board. 
   Just because I feel so kindly about the role they played, I figured I should show the American people at least who they are. As I have in the past, I provided their pictures, their salaries, and their education. 
   Of course, if you put them all into a barrel and rolled them around, it wouldn't matter which was on the top; they still look the same. They still have the same education, they still make about the same amount of money, and they apparently still think the same. They all think this country is growing too fast, and they think there are too many people working. So they view themselves as a set of human brake pads whose design it is to slow down the American economy. 
   The problem with that is, there is no evidence to support what the Federal Reserve Board has done today. Worker productivity is up. It is up substantially. The Consumer Price Index with respect to the core inflation rate and the Producer Price Index with respect to the core rate are not showing what the Federal Reserve Board is looking for; that is, a new wave of inflation in the American economy. 
   In fact, inflation is well under control and the productivity of the American workers continues to rise. 
   According to the Federal Reserve Board's own ``beige book,'' which is what they call it, wage pressures have actually eased in some parts of the country since late last year. Last year, productivity in this country rose by 3 percent. The final quarter of 1999 saw productivity increasing 6.4 percent, the largest rise in seven years. This surge of productivity by American workers pushed down unit labor costs by a 2 1/2 percent annual rate. 
   The question is, Why does the Federal Reserve Board not want to allow workers who are more productive to share in this country's prosperity? Why is it the central bankers are desperately afraid of having folks who work on assembly lines, and are more productive for doing it, get a wage increase or a salary increase? The first sight of that and the Fed has an apoplectic seizure and decides it wants to tax every American with higher interest rates. 
   I read the other day about a fellow named Walt Frazier. The Fed ought to invite Walt to town and bring him into their mahogany room before they close the door. The Washington Post wrote a story about Walt Frazier. Walt is a live chicken hanger. He works in one of these chicken processing plants. The live chicken hanger is the fellow in the front end of the room who pulls chickens by their feet and hangs them as they go around through the throat slasher and the other processes, and at the back end comes out a chilled, packaged chicken that goes to the store. Walt is a chicken hanger at the front end. 
   The shift he works begins at 5:48 in the morning. He is done at 2:18 p.m. in the afternoon. He grabs a live chicken every 2 seconds and puts that live chicken on a hanging machine that circulates. He lifts and hangs 10,000 chickens a day, the Washington Post said. That is 2 1/2 tons of wiggling, fighting, clawing flesh. Walt works on the line. Do you know what Walt makes? For 20 years he has done that. He makes $8.88 an hour or $18,470 a year. He had a couple of operations on his wrists because grabbing live chickens in a chicken plant means you get clawed, scratched, and beat up. 
   The point about mentioning Walt Frazier is he is one of the folks who works in the chicken plant. He is more productive because of machinery and other things, but the Federal Reserve Board doesn't want to look at folks  who are working in those circumstances who, because they are more productive, ought to be able to earn more money. 
   The Federal Reserve Board says: No, we don't want America to show greater gains for workers. We worry about that. We think that is inflationary. 
   So what do they do? They keep slapping on new interest charges. It is a classic fight we have had over the past two centuries between those who finance production and those who produce and work in production. Those who finance have great friends at the Federal Reserve Board. The gold stars are the folks on the Open Market Committee who today helped the Fed Board of Governors decide that the American families ought to pay higher interest charges. The American people had no say. But the Federal Reserve Board did it because they tilt their policies toward the big money center banks and against the interests of working folks in this country. 
   I say once again, as I have said on other occasions, the Federal Reserve Board could use a good dose of common sense. We have two vacancies. I have said repeatedly one ought to go to my Uncle Joe. My Uncle Joe used to fix generators and alternators in his garage. He worked with his hands and knows something about running a small business. None of these people on the Federal Reserve Board appear to understand the consequences of slapping $440 in additional interest charges on the American people. They 
   can afford it. They are not worried about the effects of those working for a living on the assembly line who are trying to be more productive and who expect as a result of being more productive to get more income. 
   The Federal Reserve Board is interested in money center banks. They see inflation under every cover and under every bed. Every moment they see new waves of inflation. I say to the Federal Reserve Board: You are wrong again. You have been wrong, wrong, wrong. Go back about 5 years and tell the American people what you said then: If unemployment falls below 6 percent, we will have more inflation. 
   Unemployment has been below 6 percent for more than 5 years and inflation is down. Federal Reserve Board, tell the American people what you said about growth: If the country grows at greater than 2 1/2 percent, there will be greater inflation. 
   It has grown faster than that and the inflation rate has gone down. They have been wrong, wrong, wrong. 
   Because they have the ability in secret to impose the added burdens and charges on the American people's shoulders, they do so, but that does not make it right. 
   Will Rogers said: When there is no place left to spit, you better change with the times. This Federal Reserve Board is tinkering with the economy, which could well injure the economy, an economy which has produced many months of sustained economic growth. American workers deserve the opportunity to share in the benefits of that growth. I hope the Fed will think better of this strategy. It is the wrong strategy for this country. 
   It is, if nothing else, therapy for me to say it because no one can have any impact on this board. It does what it does and says what it says with total impunity. Some day I hope that the Board of Governors and the presidents of the regional Fed banks, who have tilted their policy so in favor of money-centered banks, will actually consider the interests of working people in this country. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have over 2,000 family farmers who have arrived in Washington, DC, this morning. In other times and other circumstances, they would be preparing for spring planting. 
   Spring is a time for farmers to begin thinking about getting to the field to plant their seeds and do the work family farmers do. But instead of preparing for spring planting, 2,000 family farmers are here in Washington, DC, today. 
   I intend to leave this Chamber and have lunch with them. They are holding a ``farmer's share lunch'', just steps from the Capitol on the lawn in the upper Senate park beside the Russell Building. A customer buying this same lunch at a restaurant or in some other venue in Washington, DC would pay $10. These farmers are charging the portion of the food dollar they get: From a $10 lunch, they get approximately 39 cents. So over in the park, farmers will be providing lunch for 39 cents to demonstrate how little of America's food dollar family farmers are getting. 
   We have such a serious problem on America's family farms. Two thousand of those family farmers have come to Washington, DC, to say to the Federal Government that the public policy dealing with family farmers simply isn't working. If it is in the interests of our country to preserve a network of family farms to produce America's food--if those are our policy interests in America--then we must change public policy because the current farm program does not work. 
   There is a fellow in North Dakota named Dave Smith. He is a farmer in Makoti, ND. Frankly, I have never met Dave Smith. He calls himself the Flying Farmer. He has developed a hobby of jumping over stock cars. He builds a ramp, jumps these cars, and dives over to the other side. He wears a helmet and performs at the county fairs and the State fairs. 
   I have seen him do these tricks a couple of times and have always wondered what would persuade someone to do these things? 
   Let me tell you how he got in the ``Guinness Book of World Records''. Dave Smith, the Flying Farmer, from Makoti, ND, set a world record by driving in reverse for 500 miles at an average speed of 34 miles per hour. 
   I am thinking to myself: Why would someone want to do that? But then I recognized that it reminds me of public policy as it affects family farmers, an endurance race in the wrong direction. 
   The question is, What do we do to stop this movement in the wrong direction and start it in the right direction? 
   What do we do for family farmers? 
   I have on previous occasions talked in the Senate about what one finds when going to Europe. Go to the European countryside, visit with their farmers and go to the small towns that rely on families who live off the land. Get a feeling for how things are going in rural Europe. 
   Farmers are doing well in Europe. Small towns are doing fine in Europe. There is life; one can feel it. One can sense it. Why? Because Europe has decided that as a matter of public policy, the kind of economy they want is an economy that has food production based on the family unit. They want to maintain and retain family farmers in their future. It is a deliberate public policy in Europe. They have been hungry, and they don't intend to go hungry again. They want broad-based ownership of food production in Europe. 
   I found it interesting that the European trade representatives, who are often vilified--and perhaps I do it from time to time--talked about trade in agriculture in the context of families and communities when I met with them at the WTO meeting in Seattle. ``Multifunctionality'' is the term they used. They talked about the impact on family farmers and the relationship to building communities as a result of a network of farms in the countryside. 
   Our trade negotiators look at trade through the pristine view of one word--markets, as though it doesn't have anything to do with families or communities. As if somehow there is no relationship between virtue and math when it comes to the question of profits and losses. I want to talk for a couple of minutes about the fallacy of all of that. 
   These days, when there is so much economic prosperity in so much of our country, and we are blessed with so many things, we find that in the granaries, garages and in the machine sheds of America's family farms, families are gathering trying to figure out: How do we get this equipment ready for the field work in the spring to plant a crop? Will our banker lend us the money to buy seeds and fuel and fertilizer, for example, to once again try  to make a living on the family farm? Or are we now going to lose our dream? Will we, after 30 years of trying, lose the opportunity to continue farming this year because prices have collapsed and our trade agreements have not been good for agriculture? 
   Interest rates are going up. So many other things are confronting the farmer over which they have no control. 
   I will show a few charts that describe what is happening to America's family farms. The families who have come to town, the 2,000 of them, to say there is something wrong that needs to be fixed, here is what they are confronted with. Look what has happened to the farmer's share of the retail beef dollar. It has dropped precipitously. 
   This chart shows the farmer's share of the retail pork dollar--it is almost interchangeable--a dramatic collapse in 19 years. For North Dakota, where we raise a great deal of grain, this chart shows the farmer's share of the cereal grains dollar. Some might say, well, we are importing a lot of food; consumers are able to access cheaper food. Have you been to the grocery store lately and taken a look at the bar codes of hamburgers or bread or that which is made from cereal grain or livestock? Have you noticed that food prices have come down? I don't think so. Grain prices have collapsed. 
   For a while, we had a very substantial collapse in livestock prices. In fact, at one point about a year ago, a hog that brought the hog producer $20 on the market for an entire hog had its meat sold for $300. So what happened between the $20 the farmer got for selling an entire hog and the $300 that was charged at the grocery store counter for the meat from the very same hog? The middle folks, the folks who handle all of that, are making a lot of money. The farmer is left with the carcass. 
   I will mention a couple of other items with respect to the 
   family farm. Farmers have come to the Nation's Capital to ask for a change. We passed a piece of farm legislation some years ago. I voted against it, but nonetheless it passed. It essentially pulled the rug out from under family farmers. It said they should all just operate in the marketplace. 
   That sounds good enough, if the marketplace were a fair marketplace and farmers were involved in fair competition with others who produce food around the world. That is not the case. Our trade agreements injure family farmers rather than help them. They don't have an opportunity to pay a fair interest rate because the Federal Reserve Board is jacking up the cost of money in a manner that is totally unjustified. They deal with monopolies in every direction they turn. If they want to put their grain on a railroad, the railroad is overcharging them. What is going to happen is if they are going to sell their cattle to packing companies, three or four packing companies are involved in 80 to 85 percent of all the steer slaughter in this country. It is the same with pork and lamb. Family farmers are competing in a game in which the deck is stacked. 
   We have a policy establishment in Washington that views all of this through a very clear lens. It is a limited vision, but the direction they look appears clear to them. This, in some of their minds, is kind of a ``stuff Olympics.'' Those who produce the most stuff get the most medals, even if you are producing stuff you already have too much of and not producing what you need. For example, in rural America, if you are producing what nurtures and strengthens communities, that is irrelevant according to these folks. The policy establishment says that is not what we are about. We are about the ``stuff Olympics.'' Those who produce the most stuff win. 
   Of course, that is not a proper way to look at who we are and what we want to be. The markets are fine, but markets are not always fair. We, as a country, have a right, as Europe has a right and has done, to decide what kind of economy we want. What kind of things do we want produced from the arrangements of production? If we say we need better communities, stronger families living on the land and a network of producers producing America's food, then we need to question whether our economic arrangements contribute to that end. Clearly, the answer now is no. 
   Should we not support the form of agriculture that contributes to that kind of economy and that kind of society? What is the farm program really for? These farmers have come to town saying the farm program doesn't work. What is it really for? 
   In my judgment, we don't need a farm program. We could abolish it if its goal is not simple and singular. We should have a farm program that is designed to support and sustain a network of families living on America's agricultural land. If that is not the goal of the farm program, then we don't need one. If someone wants to farm an entire county, God bless them, but they don't need the Government's help. But when prices collapse, if families who are living on that farm don't have a bridge across those price valleys, they are simply not going to make it from one side to the other. 
   My belief is that the contribution a network of family farms makes to our country is irreplaceable and invaluable. Let me tell my colleagues about that contribution, that lifestyle, because I come from a State I dearly love. It embodies those values that America needs more of. 
   We have a man and a wife in Sentinel Butte, ND, who own a gas station. Perhaps I have told the Senate about this before. They are near retirement age and don't want to keep the gas station open all day. This is a town of under 100 people. They decided that when they close at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, they would hang the key on a nail. If you need gas, you drive up and take the key, unlock the pump, and fill up. Then you are supposed to make a note that you did that. 
   Yes, that is true. Yes, that happens in my home State, a small community of under 100 people who understand the value of the small town cafe, the hub of life in a small community, and can't afford to keep the small town restaurant open. How do they do it? A signup sheet. Everybody in town has to volunteer to work for nothing to keep the restaurant open. 
   Yes, that is the way the restaurant works in Havana, ND. Tuttle, ND, a town of under 100 people, lost their grocery store. What to do? They could not find anybody to start a grocery store. So the town itself--the community--built a grocery store. Yes, the town owns the grocery store because that is the kind of town they want and the kind of life they want. 
   I may have told the Senate about the woman who owns the flower shop in Mott, ND. A town 14 miles from Regent, my hometown. My parents are buried in the cemetery in Regent, ND, a town of 270 people. We always send flowers to my mother's grave on Mother's Day from the Mott Florist Shop. They are always apologetic for charging a couple of dollars extra to send them to the Regent cemetery, which is 14 miles away. 
   The Mott Florist Shop is quite a place. This year, my brother called them--he or I usually call them--and he asked them to deliver flowers for Memorial Day. He said, ``By the way, I forgot to call on Mother's Day when we usually order flowers for my mother's grave.'' She said, ``That's all right. I figured you forgot so we sent flowers over to your mother's grave anyway. I figured I would send you a bill later, and if you paid it, OK; if not, that's OK, too.'' 
   Where does that happen in this country? It is pretty special to have those kinds of communities and people. 
   About the same time that happened, I read an article in the newspaper--and I don't mean to be pejorative about New York City because it is a wonderful city, but a fellow died on the subway and he continued riding 4 or 5 hours on the subway before somebody discovered he was dead. Big difference. Rural values, community, responsibility, looking out for each other, helping each other, knowing each other--that is part of what we need to be as a country. 
   I worry so much that we are losing a great deal of that in the way we deal with public policy. Thomas Jefferson used to say that the kind of agriculture we choose in this country affects the kind of communities we have. It affects the kind of Nation we are going to be. He was dead right about that. 
   That is why the issue that these folks have come to town to discuss, the 2,000 farmers, who otherwise would be in their machine shed getting ready for spring's work, working on the transmission, greasing the tractor, going to town to get the seed, all excited about  being able to finally get that tractor started and getting out and plowing the ground and putting seeds in the ground, are instead over here about a block away. And I am going to get there soon. They are here to say family farming matters to this country and Congress must do something to help or we will be left with corporate agriculture from California to Maine, and it will be different. A part of America will be gone forever. Some say: Well, that's the way it is. The family farm is like the little diner left behind when an interstate highway comes through, and it is too bad; it was a wonderful place to have soup and sandwiches. But that is life.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague from West Virginia that I am humbled by his words. I was on a radio talk show earlier this morning for an hour or so. When he said I had my head screwed on right, I just say that is the nicest thing said about me all day. 
   I appreciate very much the comments the Senator made. 
   I also say this is not about nostalgia. It is about a country having to choose the kind of future it wants, a country measuring what it wants to achieve with its economy, and a country that determines what has value. 
   It is so much a disconnection to me that we are the largest arms seller in the world by far--somewhere around $10 to 12 billion a year. A fair amount of those purchases are from countries that can least afford to purchase jet fighter planes, tanks, and weapons of war, and, yet, they do. 
   In those same Third World countries that are purchasing arms, people are desperately hungry. At the same time that people are desperately hungry for food in so many places in the world, and hundreds of millions of people go to bed with an ache deep in their belly because they haven't had enough to eat, then in Mohall, ND, in the morning someone will load a two-ton truck with wheat and drive to the elevator and will be told by the grain trade: Your food doesn't have value. Your food just doesn't have value. Yet we know it costs you $4.50 a bushel to produce it, but it is only worth $2.30 a bushel because it just doesn't have value. 
   What a serious disconnection. We need to find a way to create value in our country for that which matters: the production and work of family farmers and the risks of what family farmers produce; yes, food for a hungry world, but also the social structure of a community and a rural economy. 
   Mr. Critchfield, a wonderful author, wrote a book called ``Those Days.'' He talked about the ``seed bed'' of family values in America for over two centuries from family farms to small towns to big cities. It was always the ``seed bed'' of family values. 
   When a man named Ernest in Regent, ND, collapsed of a heart attack right near harvest, his neighbors brought the combines over to take his wheat off the field? If his neighbors were in corporate America, they would be called competitors. But on family farms, they are neighbors. And they are part of a social structure that works together. But they can't work together and make a living when grain prices have collapsed. They need a safety net of some type that says: You matter, you have value, and you are important to our country's economy. 
   I wish to mention two other quick items that affect family farmers in a very significant way. They came to town today. In fact, I was on an airplane with some of them last evening. Most of them came by bus but a few came on the airplane--last evening, today, and tomorrow. 
   Two things will happen here in Washington, DC: One, the Federal Reserve Board will meet. When they do, it won't be as if they are doing it in front of television cameras. It will be behind closed doors. They will make a decision in secret. We will not be a part of it. There will be no discussion and no debate. These central bankers will make a decision about whether to increase interest rates once again. All of the evidence is that they will do so. 
   Those poor farmers who are coming to town asking for some assistance when prices have collapsed will find one more time that the Federal Reserve Board has boosted their cost of production by increasing interest rates. 
   What is the justification for that? The answer is none. There is no justification. Workers' productivity is up in this country--way up. Do workers in this country not have a right to more compensation if they are more productive? 
   Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board are worried about inflation. The core inflation rate that has been recently announced in both the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index, which indicates that inflation is not a serious threat in this country. As I said, productivity is growing. Yet, somehow, Mr. Greenspan fashions himself as a set of human brake pads whose sole mission in life is to try to slow down the American economy. 
   It is wrong for the Federal Reserve Board to believe that too many people are working and that we are growing too fast. They are worried about that because they believe it will provoke more inflation. They have believed  that for the last several years, and they have been wrong, wrong, wrong in every circumstance. But it has been used as justification to increase interest rates. That adds to the burden these family farmers have to bear as they go out to try to borrow money to buy the seeds, the fertilizer, and the fuel with which to put in their spring crops. 
   The Federal Reserve Board tomorrow will add to the burdens of these farmers, in my judgment, in a manner that is wholly unjustified. Productivity last year grew at a substantial 3 percent rate. That surge pushed the unit labor costs down by 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter in 1999. 
   I have talked at length about the Federal Reserve Board. I don't mean to cast disrespect on their motives as people. I have said that I commend Alan Greenspan for his public service but disagree with him from a policy standpoint very significantly. 
   But there is no justification for this Federal Reserve Board, the last dinosaur of our government, that does all of its business in secret. What other unit of government closes its doors and then says, ``Let's decide what we want to do next to the American people''? 
   If Mr. Greenspan, as has been the subject of some of his recent pronouncements, believes that the stock market is moving too high--``irrational exuberance'' he once called it--then he can take action to deal with that. He could increase margin requirements, which I think he probably ought to do. But instead of doing that--and he doesn't want to do that--he says: I will have all the American people, especially producers, pay higher interest charges. It is unwise, unfair, and risky, in my judgment, to raise interests at a time when fuel costs are rising and commodity prices all across the board have collapsed. I think it risks a significant slowdown in this economy. 
   I regret that they will take that action tomorrow. If they do, I will be here to speak again briefly about it. 
   Let me take 2 additional minutes to talk about one other issue that will be announced tomorrow. In addition to the Federal Reserve Board meeting, there will be an announcement tomorrow morning by the Commerce Department about America's trade deficit. I expect once again that the monthly trade deficit will be near record level. 
   What does that mean? It means that those family farmers who are gathered today in Washington, DC, asking for some help will once again see the consequences of a trade policy that has not worked. 
   We are not exporting nearly enough. We are importing too much. We find closed markets for agricultural commodities all around the world. Even when we negotiate new trade agreements, the negotiations are not the independent, kind of hard-nosed negotiations that you would expect on behalf of our producers. We do not, as a country, stand up for our producers' interests. 
   I will talk at some later time about the recent bilateral trade agreement with China. I have spoken at great length about the NAFTA agreement, and Canada and Mexico, and so on. But family farmers and others have a right, in my judgment, to be very concerned about these kinds of policies. 
   I will show a chart about the trade deficit. This chart shows what is happening to this country's merchandise trade deficit. It was $347 billion in 1999. 
   Let me mention China. I want to mention it just in a microcosm. We reached an agreement with China only months ago. A significant part of this $347 billion was nearly $70 billion with China alone. 
   Let me take automobiles, for example, because there is not a lot of trade in automobiles between the United States and China. But in our trade agreement with China, as I understand it, after a phase in, we reached an agreement by which China will have only a 25-percent tariff on U.S. automobiles that will be sent to China. We would have a 2.5-percent tariff on Chinese automobiles into this country. So we reached a trade agreement which says we will phase this in slowly. But after it is fully phased in, China, you can have a 10-times greater tariff on automobiles going into China than we would have. 
   I ask a question: Who is negotiating, and on whose behalf? We should get some uniforms and jerseys that say ``U.S.A.'' on them. At least when they sit down we would understand who they are and we could demand that they work for our interests and demand reciprocal agreements that say treat us like we treat you. Open your markets. 
   I mention automobiles, because it is not of great consequence in that particular trade agreement. But I am going to talk at greater length about some of the other issues as well. I mention it, because tomorrow the Commerce Department will, once again, announce the monthly trade deficit. It will, in my judgment, signal the storm clouds that exist in this area to which we must respond. 
   Our economy is wonderful. We live in a great country. We are blessed with all kinds of good news. However, we must address this issue. 
   I finish by telling the Senator from West Virginia what happened to me at the WTO meetings in Seattle in December. Everyone remembers how raucous those WTO sessions turned out to be, especially with demonstrators in the street. Something happened I will relate that reminds everyone once again of who we are and where we are. A group of House and Senate Members were meeting with a group of 10 or 12 European parliamentarians across an oblong table, talking about the differences between Europe and the United States in trade, the beef issue, and the Roquefort trade issue. 
   Mr. Rocard, the former Prime Minister of France, leaned over and said: Mr. Senator, I want you to understand something. We are talking about disputes between the United States and Europe. I want you to understand how I feel about your country. I was a 14-year-old boy on the streets of Paris, France, in 1944 when the Liberation Army marched into my country and removed the Nazis from my country. When I was a 14-year-old boy, standing on the streets, when those American soldiers marched into my country, a young black American soldier reached out his hand and gave me an apple. I want you to understand that I will never, ever forget that moment and what it meant to me and what it meant to my country. 
   I got chills as I listened to that. We have, as a country, done so much for so many around the world. We are self-critical and tend to forget the remarkable things we have done. 
   This fellow said to me: I will go to my grave having very special feelings about what your country, what your soldier, what your commitment was to me, to my family, and to my country. 
   That is something we should understand. We have a great capacity to do good things. As a democracy, we make some mistakes from time to time. But we have a great capacity to do good things in our abilities to make choices regarding public policy, in developing the kinds of policies that are produced in this Chamber. All of us must, from our various centers of interest around America, come here and with passion make the case for the things we think are important. 
   The Senator from West Virginia makes passionate arguments on behalf of the families who have been mining America's coal in the hills of Appalachia. I listened with wonder to his description of what is happening in those small communities. He understands that those from farm country, from North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, and elsewhere feel the same way, with the same passion, about the people we represent who are struggling and in many ways confront the same problems of collapsed commodity prices. There is the notion by some that this is just all nostalgia, not hard-nosed market economics. 
   That is why, as we do all of this, as we engage in these debates, we must as a country think through the public policy questions with better clarity, especially with the understanding that tomorrow's economy and tomorrow's country is what we decide it will be. We have a right to make these decisions. Europe has decided it wants family farmers in its future. It wants rural Europe to be healthy and family farmers to make it. Why? Because they understand that family farms produce more than just grain or livestock. They produce something that is social in nature--community, a rural lifestyle and culture that is important. That is something Europe is already reconciled to, and we ought to, as well. 
   I have taken far more time than I intended. Let me end as I started. I will  go to the farmers' lunch near the Russell Building. They are serving a $10 lunch for 39 cents because farmers are here, 2,000-fold, saying: This is our share of the food dollar. It is not enough. We cannot make a living. We need help. We don't need charity. We need a little attention from Congress, better trade agreements, a better farm program, a little action on the antitrust front to deal with the concentrations of monopolies that exist, and a little understanding that we matter to America's future. We produce food. It is a hungry world. Food matters. Congress, pay attention. That is all they are saying. 
   With that, I will have lunch with friends of mine. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came back from North Dakota on a late flight last evening on Northwest Airlines, flying North Dakota to Washington, DC. When one is traveling all day and up late, one gets up in the morning and it takes a while to adjust to find a good mood. My morning wasn't enhanced when I saw USA Today and saw the headline, once again, that Mr. Greenspan digs in his heels on rate hikes. 
   Mr. Greenspan goes to Congress and decides he will tell the American people they should brace themselves, he will increase their taxes in the form of higher interest rates. That did not exactly make my day this morning. 
   I will make a couple of comments about what Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board are doing.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the issue of arms control this morning. There are many issues that we consider in this country. We have the deafening sounds of Democracy as the American people and politicians discuss, debate, and describe many, many issues. Both candidates and crowds these days are generously discussing issues ranging from abortion to economic growth to defense policy, and so on. But there is dead silence on the subject of the spread of nuclear weapons and the threat it poses to every single person on this Earth and especially the threat it imposes to our children. 
   Let me describe where we are with nuclear weapons. In 1985, the Soviet Union had 11,500 nuclear warheads on long range missiles. Defense analysts predicted that would go up to 18,000 or 20,000 nuclear warheads by the mid-1990s. These numbers do not even mean much. What is a thousand nuclear warheads? Each Soviet warhead had about 20 or 30 times the power of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. 
   Instead of the 20,000 warheads many predicted, Russia has only about 5,000 warheads today. Why do they have 5,000 warheads? Because they have gotten rid of about 6,000 of the nuclear warheads they used to have. The Soviet stockpile, now the Russian stockpile, has been cut by the equivalent of 175,000 Hiroshima bombs. How did that happen? Because of arms control agreements. We agreed to reduce our nuclear weapons and they agreed to reduce theirs. 
   I will describe what has happened. We have something called the Nunn-Lugar program, named after our colleagues, former Senator Nunn and Senator Lugar. They said a good way to reduce the threat is by helping a potential adversary destroy his weapons while we reduce our own weapons. As a result the Nunn-Lugar program has reduced the threat to the United States by eliminating 4,900 Russian nuclear warheads, 471 intercontinental ballistic missiles, 12 ballistic missile submarines, and 354 ICBM silos. 
   For example, this is a picture of a Typhoon submarine owned by the Russians. It carries 20 missiles with 10 warheads on each missile. That is 200 nuclear weapons that can be fired from this Typhoon-class submarine. This submarine is twice the length of a football field and a third larger than the Trident submarine, the largest U.S. submarine. 
   What is going to happen to this submarine? It is going to be dismantled, and we are going to help pay for the dismantling of this submarine under the Nunn-Lugar program. We are going to reduce the threat by taking a Typhoon-class submarine and destroying it. This is a picture of what it looks like today. This is what it will look like later this year. You can see what once was a submarine carrying 200 nuclear warheads aimed at U.S. targets is now a shell being taken apart and turned into scrap metal. 
   This picture shows the elimination of intercontinental ballistic missiles. They pull them from the ground and take off the warhead, and then cut the missile to pieces. 
   This is a picture of an ICBM silo, the last piece of metal being removed. The dirt is then piled over and sunflowers are planted. This is in the Ukraine. Is that progress? You bet your life it is progress. A silo in which a missile once rested aimed at the United States of America with multiple warheads with nuclear explosive power is now eliminated. The Ukraine is free of nuclear weapons because of the Nunn-Lugar program. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to show this piece of a wing strut from a Soviet bomber.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DORGAN. How did I get this? Did we shoot the bomber down? No. This bomber was sawed up. The wings were sawed off as 
   a result of an arms control agreement that we have with the Russians by which we reduced our delivery systems and nuclear weapons and they reduced theirs. Their submarines are dismantled, their intercontinental ballistic missiles are dismantled, and their bombers have had the wings sawed off. 
   This is a picture of the heavy bomber elimination, TU-95. 
   That is what is happening with arms control. It is, in my judgment, exciting and breathtaking. 
   What is expected to happen in the future? Under START III, we are expected to go to 2,500 nuclear weapons. Think of that--2,500 nuclear weapons. What is one nuclear weapon? In most cases, the yield of a nuclear weapon is many times the yield of the one used in Hiroshima. Mr. President, 2,500 weapons on each side if we get to that--we are not there. 
   What has the Senate done with respect to arms control treaties? The U.S. Senate over the years has done a great deal. We passed START I, START II, the 1988 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty--a whole series of arms control initiatives. We have funded the Nuclear Cities Program to employ scientists in Russia who know how to make nuclear bombs so they are not hired by the Iranians, the North Koreans, and others. We funded the Nunn-Lugar program. We have done a lot of things. 
   The fact is, there is no discussion anymore about arms control in this Senate. In fact, all the discussion is about deploying a national missile defense system, abrogating the ABM Treaty, and making a full retreat on issues on which we were making significant progress. We need to change that. 
   In addition to that, last year, after languishing for 2 years without even a hearing, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty was defeated by the Senate. The President just asked General Shalikashvili to head a task force to see if everybody can work together toward a common goal and resolve the concerns many Senators have about the treaty. 
   Does anybody really believe it is in our interest or anybody's interest to begin testing once again nuclear weapons? What a huge step backwards. My  hope is we can, once again, on the Presidential campaign trail and in the Senate and in this country, as a matter of discussion among American citizens, talk about what we want for our future and our children's future. 
   Do we want a future with 2,000 or 5,000 or 10,000 nuclear weapons? Do we want a future, by the way, in which more and more and more countries have access to nuclear weapons? Because that is going to happen unless the country provides some leadership. 
   There is no significant leadership in the world at this point to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. It is our responsibility to do that. It is our job to do that. Most people do not understand the danger that was posed just a year or so ago when India and Pakistan--countries that do not like each other, countries that have fights on their border--both exploded nuclear weapons, virtually under each other's chin. Most people do not understand the potential consequences of that. 
   But we must, once again, as a Congress, and as a Senate, begin working seriously on the issue of controlling the spread of nuclear weapons and reducing the stockpile of nuclear weapons. We must get to full implementation of START II, and get to START III, and continue discussions, and not abrogate the ABM Treaty, and pass the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty. We must do those things. 
   It seems to me we must not run off and decide: Well, now what we want to do is start an arms race once again. Let's deploy a national missile defense system. It does not matter what it costs. It does not matter what the consequences are. We don't care what the Russians think. We do not care what it does to the Nunn-Lugar program. We do not care that it abrogates the ABM Treaty. We just do not care. In my judgment, that kind of mindset does not serve this country's long-term interests well at all. 
   What will best serve this country's interests is if we decide that a safer world will be a world in which we provide world leadership to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. We do not want any additional countries to access nuclear weapons. 
   I know people say: But we have these rogue states. They may shoot an intercontinental ballistic missile at the United States. That is probably the least likely threat this country faces. A rogue nation is not very likely to shoot an intercontinental missile. They are much more likely to acquire a cruise missile, for which a national missile defense system would not provide a defense. They are far more likely to get a suitcase nuclear bomb and plant it in the trunk of a rusty Yugo, plant it on a dock in New York City, and hold the city hostage. That is a far more likely threat than that some rogue nation would actually achieve access to an intercontinental ballistic missile. 
   Even more likely than all of that is the threat of a deadly vial of biological or chemical agents, that is acquired by a rogue nation or some terrorist, planted in a subway system in a major city. 
   Those are the most likely threats. Yet we have people in this Chamber who stand up and say: We demand deployment, immediately, of a national missile defense system. What that threatens to do is pull the legs out from under every bit of arms control efforts we have had underway for 15 years in this country. 
   The reason I show this chart is that I want to show that arms control has achieved the reduction of 6,000 nuclear weapons in the Russian arsenal. Six thousand nuclear weapons are gone. The experts predicted it would grow from 11,500 nuclear weapons to 18,000 or 20,000 nuclear weapons. They were wrong because arms control agreements with the Russians and the old Soviet Union represent a substantial decrease in the number of nuclear weapons they now have in their arsenal. The equivalent of 175,000 Hiroshima explosions has been eliminated from the Russian arsenal. 
   Will our children and grandchildren live in a world in which thousands of nuclear weapons are targeted at their homes, at their cities, at their country? I hope not. Will our children live in a world in which dozens of additional countries have access to and have acquired nuclear weapons and can and may use them to hold others hostage? Will our children live in a world in which 
   terrorists will have access to nuclear weapons and hold cities and countries hostage? I hope not. 
   But the answer to those questions depends on the will and the aggressiveness here in this country of a President and the Congress to stand up and say: Arms control works. The United States of America will lead in this world to achieve new arms control agreements, dramatically reduce numbers of nuclear weapons, and reduce vehicles to deliver those nuclear weapons, with a substantial regime of inspection and monitoring and a Senate that will pass the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty. The American people should expect us to do that. 
   Let me conclude where I started. 
   There is a deafening noise in this country about a lot of issues--some important, some not. That is the noise of democracy. It is the sounds of democracy. But there is a dead silence on the subject of arms control. 
   When Members of the Senate walked out of this Chamber last year, after having voted in the majority against the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, most must surely have felt some dissatisfaction about that. That treaty was signed by over 150 countries, sent to this Chamber, and not one hearing was held in 2 years. Most must surely have left this Chamber with a feeling of dissatisfaction. 
   I hope that dissatisfaction can persuade those of us who care about controlling the spread of nuclear weapons and reducing the arsenal of nuclear weapons to come together and work together. There is nothing Republican or Democrat about the issue of nuclear weapons. 
   I say today, I hope the Presidential campaign can be about these issues. I hope the debate in Congress can be about these issues because, in my judgment, there is no issue more important to our future and our children's future. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the amendment I offer today deals with a standardized school report card. I want to describe that, but first, I will talk generally about this issue of education and about the debates we have had in recent hours and days in this Chamber. 
   I talked about the schools I have visited recently in North Dakota. I had a meeting yesterday in Washington, DC, with some people from the Ojibwa School on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation in North Dakota. 
   I want to describe it because we are talking today about how to spend money to improve this country's education system. Some say: Let's provide it in the form of tax credits for education savings accounts that will allow parents to accrue money to send their kids to this school or that school. 
   There is another way to handle it, and that is to make investments in our schools so children are walking into school buildings that are well-equipped and in good condition, repaired and renovated, and they are going into school classrooms where they have quality teachers and the classrooms are not crowded. That is another way to improve our country's schools. 
   Because I just had a meeting yesterday with the folks from the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation about the Ojibwa School, a school I have visited many times, I will read a couple of comments from eighth grade students so Members of the Senate, as they discuss these issues, will understand what eighth graders are saying about their school. I can verify everything they say in these letters is true, and in some cases, worse. 
   This is Cathy Renault. Cathy says:  
   In the 2 *.*.* short years I've been at Ojibwa, I have had to go home during the day very often.  
   This is an eighth grader.  
   It isn't because of sickness or being checked out or because a teacher or substitute weren't available. No, it's because of very threatening subjects, things you wouldn't find at other schools: Sewer backup, mold growing in buildings, heat that's too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter; harsh weather and having to walk from building to building just to go to lunch.  
   This is an eighth grade kid. The Ojibwa School is in mobile buildings, small buildings on a hill where young children are moving back and forth. By the way, the fire escapes are made of wood. Figure that one out. There are all kinds of problems with this school. 
   Does this eighth grade child get the same education as another child where they have less crowding and better facilities? The answer is no. 
   Leslie Champagne is another eighth grade student. This is what she says:  
   Last year our seventh grade teacher slipped and broke a part of her foot and at the same time the other seventh grade teacher had a cast on and had to step in all of the mold and dirty water on the floor. There has been a lot of elders--  
   Again, this is on an Indian reservation--  
   There has been a lot of elders and children falling down outside and getting seriously hurt walking to another building.  
   Again, they are mobile buildings, like a double-wide trailer, sitting on the side of a hill on the Indian reservation at Turtle Mountain.  
   There are even roofs caving in and leaking because of heavy rain or snow. I haven't seen anything new in this school for a long time. The only time I've seen something new is just this year when we got a more decent gymnasium.  
   From Belcourt, ND, Shelly Selina Davis:  
   ......we don't have shower systems that work properly. After physical education class, we are not able to take a shower and are forced to go through the rest of the school day feeling our hygiene is unhealthy. 
   Last year and one time this year, the whole school had to eat lunch in their classrooms or office, because there was a sewage problem in the kitchen and it made the whole cafeteria smell very badly. 
   Each year, during the winter, there are many students who become ill and miss many school days because of their sickness. The students became ill from having to walk from building to building in the very cold winter weather.  
   These are grade-school students saying kids do not get to make the decision if they want to be poisoned by a poor sewer system or mold. Kids should be worrying about how they are going to do on a big test, not whether the building is going to collapse. A new school is something we need and have wanted for a long time. This is an eighth grade kid imploring that they need help. 
   Yesterday, I talked about the Cannonball School. It is no different than this school. Part of the Cannonball School is 90 years old and has been condemned as a fire hazard. The second level of the school is unusable because the stairs leading up to it are unsafe and the school cannot afford to replace the steps. The sewer and the water systems are old, and they back up regularly, sending the smell of sewage gas throughout the school. Classes routinely have to be moved because of the smell of sewage gas becoming so bad in classrooms. One wing of the school does not have running water. There are 150, 160 kids and two bathrooms, one water fountain. They are packed in 8-foot-by-12-foot classrooms with desks so close they almost bump each other. They do not have to worry about whether or not they have computers; they would not have a place to put them. Of course, they could not hook them up anyway in a school in that condition because they do not have the capability to wire the computers. 
   I have said before that when Little Rosy Two Bears asked me the day I visited that school--and I have done it a couple of times--``Mr. Senator, are you going to build me a new school?'' the answer is I cannot build her a new school. This is a public school with a public school district and no tax base. We have mice running around, mold growing, sewer gas coming up, kids crowded into classrooms, and that little third grader walking through that classroom door is not getting the same kind of education other kids are getting, and we ought to do something about that. 
   We know about the value of education. This is not rocket science. The way to solve this is not to give tax breaks to folks. The way to solve this is to decide we are going to renovate, improve, and rebuild these schools that are falling down. The Ojibwa folks need a new school, and they need it now. Cannonball School needs to be replaced and replaced now. If we care about kids all across this country who are going to school under those conditions, we will do something about it. We will not talk about it, we will do something about it. 
   My father left school at age 9. His mother died giving birth to a younger sibling. His father was institutionalized for tuberculosis. My father quit school in order to go to work and raise money. My father worked all through his youth, so he had almost no education. Then my father, in his fifties, one day came home and announced to us, when all the family was together, with a smile, that he had just passed his GED. He never even told us he was studying for it. He did not tell us he was going to take it, but in his fifties, he decided he wanted to become a high school graduate because he never had the opportunity. He had to quit school when his mother died, and he had to help provide for his brothers and sisters. Then at age 50, with a smile on his face, he told us he was now a high school graduate. 
   We understand how much people care about education. I guess it is one of the reasons my father and mother always impressed upon us that education was paramount, you must invest in yourself. 
   Ben Franklin once said: Anyone who empties their purse in their head will never be without riches. 
   Thomas Jefferson once said: Anyone who believes a country can be both ignorant and free believes in something that never was and never can be. 
   We understand the value of education. That is why we are debating it now.  But we are debating it in circumstances where I fear we will come out with a wrong result. 
   One piece of a series of steps that makes sense to me is to provide for a standardized school report card so parents will understand what they are getting out of that school system. All parents get a report card on how their child is doing every 6 weeks, every 9 weeks. They get a report card on how their child is doing. But no parents get a report on how their school is doing. How is their school doing in educating children as compared to other schools in other school districts, in other States, in other communities? 
   It seems to me, there ought to be some standardized way for parents to understand: How is this school doing? We spend $350 billion a year on elementary and secondary education and have no earthly idea how our individual schools are doing for our children. Could we do that? We could have a basis for a comparison of our schools with other schools--our schools with other schools in the school district, between school districts, between communities, and between States. 
   Some will say there already is a school report card. Most parents have never seen it. Thirty-some States have some version of a school report card, but most of them provide very little information, if any at all. 
   I believe there are about eight standard things we ought to require the State education authorities to provide on this school report card. If we did that, every parent in this country--as a taxpayer and a proud parent--would understand what the school is producing for their children. 
   I say this, if we get to this kind of approach of providing a standardized school report card on how the school is doing--not only how the kids are doing but how the school is doing--we will only be able to say, as parents, this school is doing fine if we are willing to accept our responsibility to schools, such as the Ojibwa School and the Cannonball School, and to rebuild, renovate, and repair schools that we are sending children to that are not up to standards for educational purposes. 
   In conclusion, there are two principal issues we have fought for on the floor of this Senate--so far unsuccessfully. One issue is having a smaller class size, because we know that with 15 or 18 kids in a classroom there is a better relationship between teacher and students, and education is much more effective than if a teacher is teaching in a classroom with 30 or 35 students. We need more teachers to reduce class sizes. 
   The second issue is that we also want to improve and renovate schools that are in the condition I have just described that exist in Cannonball and Ojibwa that ought not to exist. It is not going to be solved by some scheme of giving tax cuts. 
   For every national ache or pain, we have someone who trots to the floor of the Senate and says: I have a new idea. Let's provide a tax cut. That is not a new idea. That is a substitute for what we ought to do to fix real problems in education. Every time someone suggests anything that describes some kind of national aspiration or goal, someone else pops up and says: Oh, so you want some Federal bureaucrat to run the education system? The answer to that is no, of course not. But let's not brag about having no national goals or no aspirations nationally as a country for our education system. Let's stop bragging about that. That ought to be a source of despair. 
   We, as a country, ought to have national goals of what we want to produce in our education system. If we develop those goals, then we will also accept our responsibility to improve our schools, invest in our schools, renovate, repair, and rebuild our schools, and reduce class size. We know that works. We know how to do it, if we have enough people who will stand up in the Senate and cast the right votes. 
   I will not seek a vote at this point. My understanding is that my amendment will be set aside and dealt with at a later time. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the subject, of course, is education and I wanted to come to the floor for a few moments to visit about this issue. I am a product of a small public school in Regent, ND. I graduated in a high school class of 9. I always kid that I was in the top 5 of my class; I won't tell exactly where in that 5, though. I went to college and to graduate school and, through a strange set of circumstances, I made my way to the Congress and finally to the Senate. 
   I am proud to stand on the floor of the Senate and discuss education. I don't pretend that I know more than anybody else in the Senate on the subject. I don't pretend to have all of the answers. But I do hope that when we debate education--and most parents in this country want us to debate how to improve public schools--I hope we will be able to debate all of the good ideas that exist in this Chamber, not only some or a few. 
   It is my hope that, shortly, we will have an agreement by which we will be able to consider all of the good ideas that exist in this Chamber to improve and strengthen education in this country. 
   Thomas Jefferson used to say that anyone who believes a country can be both ignorant and free believes in something that never was and never can be. He understood the value of education, as I am sure most of my colleagues do. I understand the value of a quality education. I want every young child in this country to be able to go through a classroom door that we are proud of, into a classroom that will allow young children to be the best they can be. Regrettably, that doesn't happen all across our country. We have some wonderful schools and some excellent teachers, but we have some challenges as well. 
   Let me start with this premise: Those who suggest the public education system in this country has collapsed and is unworkable are wrong--just wrong. We have many fine public schools in America. We have some outstanding teachers in our country. We need to have more. There are some significant areas of concern in some schools. Some inner-city schools and BIA schools on Indian reservations, for example, have physical facilities that should be cause for great concern. 
   Mr. President, decade after decade, we hear the debate that the school system in this country is collapsing, and that somehow public schools are not making the grade. In fact, however, the evidence shows that we have many fine public schools in this country. 
   The public school system has allowed the United States of America to progress and do things that virtually no other country has done. Why? Because we have an educated population. 
   Some while ago, a periodical described the progress in our country. They said we have spliced genes, we have split the atom, we have cloned sheep, we invented plastic, the silicon chip, radar, television, and computers. We built airplanes; we learned to fly them. We built rockets and flew to the Moon. We cured polio. We cured smallpox. And this country is hardly out of breath. 
   Did that come from a country that didn't educate its people? No. All of those advancements are a result of our investments in education in America--an investment in a system of public education in which we decided as a nation that every young child should be allowed to become the best he or she could be. We do not say to children somewhere along the line: All right, here is what you are going to do and become. Instead, we've said every child has the opportunity to be the best they can be in this system of ours. 
   Is it an accident that we stand at this precipice in history with the strongest economy in the world? Is it an accident that we invented television, that we invented the computer, and that we are the center of the high-tech industry? It is, in my judgment, a direct result of the educational system. 
   I am a little tired sometimes of hearing people denigrate the system of public education in our country. There is a lot to be said for public education. 
   I'm reminded of the old saying that bad news travels halfway around the world before good news gets its shoes on. Never is that more evident than in the debate on education among politicians. They can't bump each other fast enough to get to a place to make a speech about how bad our schools are. 
   Yes, some of our schools are not up to par. Some of our schools are in terrible need of repair. Some of our schools need reform. Yes; that is true. But I go into a lot of schools, and I see some remarkable places of learning. 
   I have a couple of children in school. I deeply admire their teachers. They do more homework than I did when I was in school. They are studying subjects at a higher level than I did when I was in their grade in school. 
   When we debate this subject of education, let's debate it based on the facts. I intend to bring a book to the floor by a researcher who compares the test scores of children in school now to children in schools a decade ago and to children in other countries, and who evaluates what, in fact, is happening to our system of public education. Is it, in fact, collapsing? Are test scores among the same group of students actually increasing? 
   Said another way, perhaps only the top 25 percent of the kids in high school took a college entrance exam not too many years ago. Now somewhere around 60 percent do. Has the average score dropped? Sure. That is because you have the top 60 percent rather than the top 25 percent taking the exam. Compare the top 25 percent of today to the top 25 percent a decade ago. Have the scores decreased? No. They have not at all. 
   There is a lot to be commended in our system of public education. I don't want to hear people talk about how awful it is because it is not awful. In my judgment, it has created a country that is the best in the world. 
   But let me talk about the challenges because they exist. That is part of what we want to address. 
   As I said, I come from a town of 300, and a high school that had 40 kids combined in all four grades. So I know something about small schools. I visited an inner-city school--something with which I was totally unfamiliar. When I went in the front door of that school, there were two metal detectors and armed security guards sitting at the front door. There was a shooting at this school some weeks after I had been there. One kid bumped another at a water fountain, and the other kid pulled a gun and shot him three or four times. This is a school with metal detectors and armed guards. 
   Does that school have a serious challenge? You bet your life it does. 
   In my State of North Dakota, there are two schools I have described before. If people have heard this already, I am sorry, but it is important. Among the issues we will discuss, now that we have an agreement, is not only the proposal brought to the floor by Senator COVERDELL and others to provide a tax cut for education savings accounts, but also ones to provide some help to improve and renovate schools and to reduce classroom size. 
   Let me talk about the Cannon Ball School. I am probably the only one in the Senate who has been to the Cannon Ball School, which is about 40 miles south of Mandan, ND, on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation. It is not a BIA school; it is a public school with mostly Indian students. And since it is on Indian land it has almost no tax base to support it. 
   The school has roughly 160 kids, most of them young Native American children. Much of the building is 90 years old; some of it is newer. Most of the classrooms do not have the capability to be wired for the Internet, so we do not have high-tech education. It has 160 kids, 2 bathrooms, and 1 water fountain. When I went there, they were using the old boiler room as a sort of make-do classroom, except a couple times a week they had to evacuate that temporary classroom because of a backed-up sewer system. 
   In the classrooms, the desks are an inch apart, with kids crowded into the little classrooms. How would Members feel if their daughter or son were walking into that classroom? Would they feel their children had an opportunity for a good education? 
   A little girl named Rosie Two Bears, who was a third grader at the time, said to me: Mr. Senator, are you going to build me a new school? 
   No, I am not able to build you a new school, not by myself. But I hope the actions of the Senate will give Rosie the opportunity to have a new school. I hope every young Rosie who is walking into a classroom in this country has parents who believe they are sending a child into a classroom of which they are proud, not one that is crowded with 30 or 40 children, but a classroom in which a teacher can pay attention to those children and give the children a good education, a classroom connected to the future with new technology, a classroom in a building that is safe, a classroom where that child can learn to be the best she or he can become. 
   That is not the case, regrettably, in Cannon Ball, ND, and those poor folks who run the school cannot do a thing about it because they don't have a tax base with which to issue a bond to renovate that school or build a new one. We ought to do something to help schools like this one, by providing funding for new teachers to reduce class size and to build new classrooms to reduce overcrowding. 
   Some will say that this is a bureaucrat's approach to solving the problems at Cannon Ball Elementary School. If we say let's provide help to a school such as that, so that child can go to a good school, we are told that we want bureaucrats to run our public education system. That is not the case at all--not a bit. 
   I am not embarrassed as a country for having goals and aspirations for our  children. Some want to brag that we as a country, the United States of America, have no national goals in education; good for us. Don't count me among those who pat themselves on the back for having no national goals or no national aspirations for what we want to get out of our public school system. 
   Has anybody been to the Ojibwa School? Probably not. The Ojibwa School has trailers sitting out on a hillside on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation. It is a BIA-funded school. We have a responsibility to these schools to do better. This school has been deemed unsafe by everybody. God forbid that someday there should be a fire that sweeps across those temporary classrooms with their wooden fire escapes, taking the lives of children. Everybody says: Why doesn't somebody stand up and take notice of that? They did. Study after study after study has found this 
   school to be unsafe. Those children have to go out in the freezing cold weather in North Dakota between these mobile, temporary classrooms. Does anyone in the Senate volunteer to have their children attend that school? I don't think so. 
   Where are the resources to give those kids a decent school building? Maybe from some bureaucrat? Is it by the local school district? By the tribal council? How about the State legislature? No, no, no, in every case. How about from us? Could we in the Congress do something for the young school children in the Ojibwa School? 
   We have a list of those schools for which the federal government has responsibility. This is a federal trust responsibility that we have for Indian schools, and we are not meeting it. Why? Because we don't have the will to put up the money to build a decent school for those children. 
   Everyone in the room knows what makes a good education: A good teacher who knows how to teach, a child who wants to learn, parents who care about that child's education, and a safe and effective learning environment. We know what works. 
   We will, because of this unanimous consent agreement that was just reached, be able to address not just the question proposed by the Senator from Georgia regarding providing tax-favored education saving accounts for K-12 education. 
   In conclusion, I fully support and feel very strongly about the need to address the issue of reducing class size. We know a teacher does much better for students when she or he is teaching a class of 15 children rather than 35 children. We know that. That is not rocket science. We also know that a child who goes into a classroom that is in decent repair, in a good school building of which we can be proud, has a better opportunity to learn. We know that. To fail to address those two major issues is to fail on the subject of education. We will have an opportunity to debate that. I intend to debate those issues. 
   An additional point. I believe every school in this country ought to provide a report card to parents about how it is doing. I am a parent. My children are in school. I get report cards. I am able to open the mail and get a report card that gives me a grade for how my children are performing in mathematics, in English literature, and so on. That is very helpful for a parent. Parents can talk to their children all day long when they get home from school: What did you do in school today? What did you learn? And you get one-word answers, as we know. So a report card is a very important tool to let parents know how their children are doing in school. 
   But what about a report card on the school itself? Why don't parents, as taxpayers, have an opportunity to get a report card that says: This is how your school is doing versus other schools in the State; this is how your school is doing versus other schools in the school district, the State, and the Nation; so parents and taxpayers can compare their school to other schools? A school report card would give a parent information, not only about their child, but also information about their child's school, which is very important to their children's education. 
   So I intend to offer an amendment that would provide that report card. It is not intrusive, in my judgment. It would empower parents, give parents information about what they are getting for their tax dollars, what kind of school they are producing for their children to attend. 
   Let me say to the Senator from Georgia, as I have on past occasions, that he is a serious legislator. He brings ideas to the floor, some of which I disagree with strongly. Occasionally I have supported his ideas. But we are on the right subject. Education is the right subject. It is our future. It is our children. The unanimous consent agreement now gives us the opportunity in the next couple of days to address all the ideas for improving education. Instead of getting the worst of what each has to offer, maybe we can get the best of what both have to offer in this Chamber. That would be a refreshing change. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am so pleased that the Senate has confirmed Kermit Bye's nomination to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   Kermit Bye is one of North Dakota's most distinguished and respected attorneys, and a senior partner in one of the top law firms in the Midwest. He has nearly 40 years of trial and appellate experience, he was President of the North Dakota Bar Association, and he's received the North Dakota State Bar Association's Distinguished Service Award. 
   I won't name every civic and community organization that Kermit Bye has chaired and served on, because the list is too long. Instead, I will say Kermit Bye cares deeply about the law and about the people our laws protect. 
   He is a man of impeccable integrity and sound judgment, possessing a formidable intellect and a healthy dose of North Dakota common sense. Kermit is temperamentally very well-suited for the bench, and can be counted on as a fair-minded jurist who understands the importance of the rule of law to society, and the judiciary's proper role within our constitutional system. 
   As many will recall, this seat on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals was first vacated in April 1997, and my fellow North Dakotan John Kelly was nominated and confirmed to this seat last summer. Tragically, just a few weeks after taking his oath, Judge Kelly took ill and passed away. 
   I am pleased today that Kermit Bye has been confirmed to fill this vacancy so that our Federal judiciary can benefit from his wisdom and judgment.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this will be a session in Congress in which we will have plenty of challenges and opportunities to discuss issues. We live in a country where we are blessed with an economy that is growing, and with unemployment that is about as low as it has been in my adult lifetime. Inflation is down. We have had the blessings  of a rising stock market; we recently had some adjustments there. But home ownership is up. Personal income is up. We have a lot of things that exist in our economy that represent good news for our country. 
   I come from a farm State, and there is not such good news for family farmers. They are suffering through a very severe crisis with collapsed grain prices and other difficulties. But, generally speaking, our country has been doing quite well. Our economy is stronger than almost any other economy in the world. Economists now predict that we will have budget surpluses as far out as the eye can see. Of course, that is not very far; economists who can't remember their home address try to tell us what is going to happen with the economy three, five, and ten years from now. 
   It is interesting to note, if you go back to the early 1990s, virtually all leading economists in America predicted that the 1990s would be a decade of slow, anemic economic growth. Of course, they were almost all wrong. So as we confront our challenges and opportunities in the future, I think it is wise for us in this Chamber not to be seduced by some who would say that if we are going to have continued budget surpluses, let's have a $1.3 trillion tax cut over 10 years. I think it is much wiser to provide some targeted tax cuts with some of the surplus, if it materializes, and use a fair amount of the expected surplus to reduce Federal indebtedness. 
   Why? Because during tough economic times you need to use increased debt to help you through those tough times, and during good economic times it seems to me you would want to reduce indebtedness. So I hope that is what we do. 
   However, even as we discuss all of those fiscal policy changes and challenges, it is important for us to evaluate what else is necessary to be done, and what investments should be made. One is education. Clearly, our future is our children, and clearly we all, Republics and Democrats, want the same thing for our children. We want every single young child in our country to walk through a classroom door and believe, as parents and as Americans and as legislators, that that classroom is one of which we are proud. 
   That is a classroom in which that young child can learn, in which that young child may grow up to be a nuclear physicist, or to be a doctor, or a lawyer, or the best plumber, mathematician, carpenter--whatever it is the talents of that young child allow it to be. That is what we want for our children in education. 
   There are a range of other education challenges that we will debate and discuss this year. In the area of health care, there are challenges as well. 
   I came to the floor to talk about one specific area which, it seems to me, we must work together to address, and that is this: How do we respond to the increasing needs in Medicare, especially with respect to prescription drugs? 
   Times have changed in this country. Many people are living longer and much more productive and healthy lives. I have talked before about my uncle, and I will not describe him again in great detail. But my uncle is 79 years old. My Uncle Harold is a runner. He didn't discover he could run until he was in his early 70s. Then he discovered quite by accident that he was a pretty good runner. My uncle is now 79 years old, and he has 39 gold medals from running in races all over the country. He runs in the 400 and the 800 in Senior Olympic events. My uncle is probably a perfect description of how things have changed in our country. 
   It wasn't too many decades ago that when you reached 79, there was a special place for you. It was a big, easy chair where someone would serve you soft food--probably oatmeal. You were 79, you were old, relaxed, and you were retired, eating soft food. That is not true anymore. People are living longer, better, and healthier lives. My uncle, God bless him, is in Arizona today training for his next race at age 79. 
   In this job, we all meet and confront wonderful and interesting people. I have met some senior citizens who now, reaching the retirement portion of their lives and facing diminished income because they are no longer working, are able to look forward to responding to some of the health challenges with lifesaving drugs and therapies. They weren't previously available to them. But medicine has marched forward with new procedures, surgeries, and medicines. 
   A woman came to a town meeting one day and told me that she had two new knees, a new hip, and cataract surgery. She said she feels like a million dollars. I told her that it was a pretty big investment, but good for you. 
   Forty years ago, if I had held a town meeting in that small community, she would have been there in a wheelchair--if she was there at all--with bad knees and cataracts. But now, with surgical advances, there are so many things happening that allow people to live longer, better, more productive and healthier lives. And a part of that is the medicine that allows people to deal with their difficulties. There are breakthroughs in medicine that are quite remarkable. 
   One of the things we must do in this session of the Congress, in my judgment, is to try to attach some sort of prescription drug benefit to Medicare. What is happening to senior citizens in this country is that all too often they reach that portion of their lives when they have diminished income and they have an increased need for prescription drugs, and they can't afford them. 
   Senior citizens are 12 percent of the population in America, and they consume one-third of the prescription drugs in our country. Let me say that again because it is important. Senior citizens are only 12 percent of our population, but they consume one-third of the prescription drugs. Why? Because they need them. 
   In Dickinson, ND, a doctor said to me that one of his Medicare patients had breast cancer. She was being treated for breast cancer, first with surgery, and with some prescription drugs to reduce her chances of recurrence of breast cancer. 
   The doctor told his patient that she needed to take these 
   prescription drugs to reduce the chances of recurrence of breast cancer. This woman told the doctor that she couldn't afford those prescription drugs, and therefore couldn't take them. She told him that she couldn't afford them because she didn't have coverage to help her pay for them through insurance or Medicare. This woman told the doctor that she was just going to have to take her chances with the recurrence of breast cancer because she couldn't afford the prescription drug. 
   What about the woman with heart disease and diabetes, in her 80s, living on several hundreds of dollars a month of income who is told that she needs several different kinds of expensive prescription drugs to manage her heart disease, her diabetes, and all the other health challenges that come from that? She said to me: ``Mr. Senator, I don't have the money to do that. I can't buy these prescription drugs because I cannot afford them. I buy prescriptions as much as I can, and I try to cut the pills in half and take a half a dose occasionally in order to try to make it stretch.'' 
   Doctors tell me that can actually exacerbate health problems. That is the difficulty. 
   How do we respond to that? We respond to that by providing a thoughtful, sensible, affordable prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program. We can do that. To put this together is not rocket science. All of us together can do that, understanding that people are living longer. But when they reach diminished income, as senior citizens do, they need affordable prescription drugs to deal with their health care problems. 
   I have held Democratic Policy Committee hearings in New York, Chicago, and North Dakota. We will be having future hearings in Atlanta and other places to talk about these issues and to take testimony from senior citizens about the issue of prescription drugs and Medicare. The testimony is so gripping. 
   Senator DURBIN and I held a hearing in Chicago. A woman came to testify who had a double lung transplant. She explained to us that the way the system works for her health care is it costs her $2,400 a month in prescription drug costs for the very expensive drugs to prevent the rejection of these organ transplants. She said she didn't have the money. She said that because she couldn't afford them, she could get them through Medicaid for 1 month.  Then they stop coverage for a second month. So she described to me the circumstances. 
   It is like every other testimony you hear all across this country from senior citizens. Lifesaving drugs can only save your life if you are able to afford to take them. If you do not have the money, and don't have access to the drug that you need for your health--especially senior citizens--you will discover their life is not so long and not so healthy.

   Mr. DORGAN. Senator BOXER raises the question that is raised in so many hearings. We had a woman testify at a hearing I held who said something you hear often. She goes to a grocery store that has a pharmacy in the back of the store, and she takes a number of prescription drugs. 
   By the way, a lot of senior citizens will take three, five, or seven. I have had senior citizens tell me they are on ten different prescription drugs for a whole series of health challenges and problems. 
   This woman told me that when she goes to the grocery store, she must first go to the back of the store, to the pharmacy, to buy her medicine. She said that she does this so she will then know how much money she has left to purchase food. Only then will she know how much food she can buy. 
   We hear that time and time again. 
   Last year, spending on prescription drugs in America rose 16 percent. Some of that is price inflation; much of it is increased utilization. 
   Let me talk just for a moment about the cost of these drugs because that is part of the other issue. A fellow named Alan Holmer, who represents the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, wrote a letter to the newspapers in North Dakota because he was upset about prescription drugs. 
   I have been putting pressure on the prescription drug industry to try to moderate prices. How much do we pay for prescription drugs? When we pay $1 for a drug, the same pill, in the same bottle, made by the same company, the Canadians pay 64 cents; we pay $1 for what the English pay 65 cents for; we pay $1 for what the Swedish pay 68 cents for; we pay $1 for what the Italians pay 51 cents for. We pay the highest prices for prescription drugs for any consumer in the world. 
   I want to show my colleagues four pill bottles which make the point better than I, and I ask unanimous consent to do so.

   Mr. DORGAN. This is a bottle of medicine called Cipro, used to treat infections. It is a commonly used medicine. This bottle contains pills made by the same company, from the same plant--the same pill, inspected by the Food and Drug Administration. 
   The difference? There is no difference in the medicine, no difference in the bottle. The difference is in price. This bottle of 100, 500-milligram tablets is sold for $399 to the U.S. consumer. This bottle--same company, same medicine, same pill--that sells for $399 in the United States is sold for $171 in Canada. 
   Why? Good question. 
   This is a different bottle, same pill, same company. Everyone will recognize this drug called Claritin, 10 milligrams, 100 tablets. In North Dakota, this is purchased for $218. The same pill--same company, in plants inspected by the Food and Drug Administration, approved by the Food and Drug Administration, sold for $218 to the United States consumer--is sold for $61 in Canada. 
   Why? Good question. 
   The same is true with a whole list of drugs, especially the most commonly prescribed drugs for senior citizens. The drugs on this chart include Zocor, a cholesterol drug. Buy it in the United States, it costs $106; in Canada, $43; in Mexico, $47. 
   The question is this: Why is the U.S. consumer required to pay the highest prices of anyone in the world for the exact same drug that is sold for a fraction of the cost in virtually every other country in the world? 
   Mr. Holmer, who represents the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, has written a critical letter to the editor, which is fine. It is a free country; he can do that. I want the drug companies to do well and be profitable. I want them to produce good products. I want them to do research to find new medicines. We do it at the Federal level; there is a lot of federally sponsored research. I also want fair pricing for the American consumer. Fair pricing gives us an opportunity to put a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program. This is a very important issue for all Americans, especially senior citizens.

   Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from California says it better than I. In the multiple-tiered pricing systems, we have preferred customers who get drugs at a fraction of the price if they are in the right system; others pay the highest price on Main Street because the local pharmacies are not able to access, in most cases, those less expensive drugs. 
   We have several different problems with pricing. One is internal. A preferred customer gets one price; if one is not preferred, they get another price. Often, senior citizens are the ones who walk to the corner drugstore in their hometown. The corner drugstores buy from a distributor that does not give them the preferred prices, and senior citizen pay the highest prices. 
   I took senior citizens to Emerson, Canada. Senator WELLSTONE and others are working with me on a piece of legislation that deals with the international pricing issues. Senator WELLSTONE has done the same with Minnesotans and talked about this  issue. We went to Emerson, Canada, which is 5 miles north of the North Dakota border. The same drugs are being sold 5 miles north of the border at a fraction of the price as in Walhalla or Pembina, ND. Does anyone think the drug companies are selling in Emerson County at a loss? Of course not. A small drugstore--a little, one-room drugstore in Emerson County is making a profit, pricing at a fraction of what they charge 5 miles south. 
   We have two issues. One is something called the International Prescription Drug Parity Act. If the global economy is good for everyone, make it work for everyone. Let the pharmacist go up to Winnipeg, Canada, and access the same drug for a fraction of the price and pass the savings on to the pharmacist customer. There is a Federal law now that prohibits that. We ought to pass the International Prescription Drug Parity Act that Senator WELLSTONE and I and others introduced. 
   Also, this Congress ought to work, Republicans and Democrats together, to understand that after 35 years it is time to add a sensible, thoughtful, and affordable prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. Let's help those folks who are in their declining income years be able to access lifesaving drugs that will allow them to continue to live healthy lives. That is our challenge.

   Mr. DORGAN. They would not allow a pharmacist who runs a drug store in Grand Forks to go to Canada and purchase Claritin and bring it back and sell it to a consumer. That is the problem. We have a global economy that is apparently good for the global interests, but it doesn't work for the Main Street pharmacist or distributor who wants to access lower prescription drug prices in Canada, for example. 
   But if you ask doctors where we go from here, they will tell you that if you have a senior citizen who has a series of health difficulties--and often they do, perhaps diabetes, perhaps some cardiac problems, arthritis, a whole series of problems--the most expensive way to treat them is to wait until the problem is magnified because they cannot afford the prescription drugs they need. If they cannot afford them, they will just not get them, and that is the expensive way to solve medical problems. What will happen to that patient? He will end up in a hospital bed someplace. And what does it cost for a day in the hospital? 
   It is less expensive way to say to those folks: Here are the opportunities for you to access the right kind of prescription medicines that you need to manage your disease, and to allow you to stay out of the hospital. That is the most thoughtful and the least expensive way to treat health problems. 
   In some ways it is like the old argument about wellness. We have always, as a country, been willing to treat somebody who is desperately ill. The minute someone becomes ill, we want to help. But when it comes to preventing someone from becoming ill, we don't want to worry about that. We would never pay for that in an insurance policy. We will only pay for the higher cost treatments once you are admitted to a hospital somewhere. 
   The same thing applies to providing prescription drug benefits to Medicare. It will promote wellness, in the sense that it will keep people out of the most expensive medical treatment--time in an acute care hospital bed. We can do this. 
   The Senator from California asked the right question at the start of her last discussion: What are our priorities? John F. KENNEDY used to say that every mother hopes her child might grow up to be President, as long as they don't have to be active in politics. But, of course, politics is the process by which we make choices in our country. We do not have an unlimited opportunity to make choices. 
   I hope this economy continues in ways that provide significant budget surpluses. If we have those surpluses, then let's be sensible and thoughtful about what we do with them. Let's have 
   some targeted tax cuts, and, especially, pay down the Federal debt. But, in addition, we should find ways to use some of that surplus to do important things in education and health care. Let's construct together, in this Chamber, a prescription drug benefit for Medicare that, in my judgment, has been needed for a long time and is an issue Congress has ignored. We can do this. 
   We cannot do any of this--we cannot even begin to talk or think about it, if someone comes to the floor, gives us a bill, and says they would like a $1.3 trillion tax cut over 10 years. First of all, we don't have those surpluses; they are simply economic projections. Second, $1.3 trillion means you are going to dip into the Social Security trust fund to give the tax cut, and it means nothing else can be discussed because you have given out all that money in tax cuts. 
   At least one of the Presidential candidates out there has proposed the $1.3 trillion tax cut in a way that, as always, gives the bulk of the money to those who need it the least. These at the upper side of the income scale will get the preponderance of this money and it will foreclose the opportunity to do some other important things. 
   Yes, let's have a targeted tax cut; yes, let's reduce the debt and pass some other measures that will help this country offer a prescription drug benefit, and then let's invest in an education for our children that we can be proud of as well.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, well over a decade ago, plant pathologists at North Dakota State University's Agricultural Experiment Station observed signs of a plant disease called Fusarium Head Blight--more commonly known as scab--in a few of the region's wheat fields. Upon this discovery, the researchers swung into action, not knowing they were about to do battle with an insidious plant disease which would eventually devastate wheat fields across the Northern Plains during the 1990s. Since 1993, scab has been an ever present scourge. Losses to the region's farmers from this cereal crop disease have been estimated to be as high as $2.6 billion during the last decade, the most costly plant disease outbreak ever in the United States. 
   Earlier this month, though, some good news was delivered on this front by those researchers who have battled this disease for so long. The North Dakota State University Agricultural Experiment Station announced the release of a new scab resistant spring wheat variety named Alsen. The new variety is named after the town of Alsen, located on route 66 in Northeastern North Dakota, an area which was particularly hard hit by this disease. 
   The researchers say that while this variety is not immune to scab, it can fight off the disease. This is excellent progress and welcome news. And, while this is the first spring wheat variety to exhibit scab resistance, it certainly won't be the last. 
   My hat is off to these researchers from North Dakota State University! There are many long, tedious, and unglamorous hours involved in cross-breeding wheat plants. The farmers of the region will be served well by this research, and it is proper and fitting that we recognize the dedicated efforts of those who have contributed their life's work to combat this disease which threatens the livelihood of our producers. 
   On behalf of all who are involved with, or impacted by, the agricultural economy of the Northern Plains--which includes just about everyone living in the region--I am proud to be able to take this opportunity to say thank you for a job well done to the researchers and support staff of the North Dakota State University Agricultural Experiment Station.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this morning there was a story in a daily newspaper in my State, the Bismarck Tribune, entitled ``National candy company takes on Mandan couple.'' It is a curious story, an interesting story, and one that is perhaps repeated all too often around the country. It concerns a type of business dispute in which one company alleges that another company is doing something that intrudes upon the rights of the first company. 
   As corporations become larger through mergers and acquisitions, all too often we see big companies trying to muscle mom-and-pop businesses around. That is what I think this case is about. 
   For those of us who care about small businesses and stand up for the rights of entrepreneurs, people who work hard, people who risk almost everything to make a go of it on Main Street, this kind of story is pretty ominous. Let me describe what it is about. 
   It is about a small business in Mandan, ND, run by Debbie and Russel Kruger. They run a drugstore and soda fountain on the main street of Mandan; and to try to make a little extra money, they make homemade candy. Debbie Kruger has created three different candy bars, and she markets these candy bars as well. 
   It is a good small business. They are not making a fortune, but they are struggling and doing business on the main street of Mandan, ND. 
   If I might, with the permission of the Chair, I ask unanimous consent to show the Lewis & Clark Bar on the floor of the Senate.

   Mr. DORGAN. It is a candy bar that has on its wrapper a picture of Lewis and Clark, and buffalo, and the young Indian woman, Sakakawea, who guided Lewis and Clark across the West. It is a milk chocolate candy bar called the Lewis & Clark Bar, designed by Debbie Kruger in 1997. 
   She did this because we are coming up to the 200th anniversary of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. There will be celebrations up and down the route that Lewis and Clark took. They stayed the winter in Mandan, ND--about 40 miles north. They spent the entire winter there. They spent more time in North Dakota than any where else on their trip. 
   The 200th anniversary--1804, 1805, 1806--will bring enormous visitation to the Lewis and Clark route. So Debbie Kruger, created a candy bar, the Lewis & Clark Bar. 
   She produced 20,000 to 30,000 bars. She sold about 20,000; and 10,000 are on shelves or in inventory. 
   Then she got a letter from a lawyer in Boston, MA. That is ominous enough, just getting a letter from a lawyer in Boston, MA. 
   The lawyer wrote: 
   ``I represent New England Confectionery Company (Necco).'' I know Necco. I have been eating Necco products since I was a little kid. 
   The letter continues that a matter has come to the attention of this lawyer for the New England Confectionery Company. The matter that has come to his attention? There is a candy bar in Mandan, ND, named the Lewis & Clark Bar. What does that mean? 
   He says his company has produced this bar--it is the Clark Bar--and this woman has infringed on our rights by using the name, Lewis & Clark Bar. She must cease and desist, he says. We seek an arrangement. We demand she suspend operations. 
   The small business has to go hire a lawyer, who writes back and says: This is not an infringement. This is a different candy bar, a different wrapper. We aren't infringing on anything. 
   The Necco lawyer writes back from Boston--I guess one has to go to a special law school to do this--and says: The differences between your client's candy bar and my client's candy bar are not the kinds of differences that dispel confusion. ``They are both candy bars,'' he says. Where do they train lawyers like this? Where on Earth could such lawyers come from? 
   He says, ``We seek an arrangement.'' We know what that means. They seek some money. Then at the end, of course, they demand that the registration for the Lewis and Clark bar be withdrawn and ``assigned to us,'' and so on. 
   Now, the corporation that owns this confectionary company--Necco--is actually the United Industrial Syndicate. They do mill works. They make automobile parts, truck parts. And yes, they make candy bars, including the Clark bar. That candy bar was named after a Mr. Clark who lived in the 1880s in Pittsburgh and started the company that made the bar. 
   The United Industrial Syndicate bought this company at a bankruptcy sale in 1999. It has nothing to do with Lewis & Clark. But here is a Boston lawyer, working on behalf of this company, this corporate conglomerate, who thinks the name Lewis & Clark apparently belongs to them. Sorry, it doesn't. 
   Debbie and her husband weren't looking for a fight. They don't have the money to spend on a battery of lawyers. They are a small business trying to make a living. 
   What is happening here is wrong, but it happens all the time. It is a form of corporate bullying. It is throwing your weight around, if you are big enough to do it. 
   My message for Necco is: Pick on somebody your own size. I am one of your customers. I can't walk past a candy counter without stopping, if  they have those little wafers. I like the all chocolate ones. I buy them all the time. Is that a vice? I suppose. But I do it because they are awfully good. 
   I am one of their customers, and I say to Necco: Lay off small businesses. Don't hire blind lawyers. If you can't tell the difference between their Clark bar wrapper and the wrapper for the Lewis and Clark bar, then get a new lawyer, and do something worthwhile for a change. 
   Thomas Jefferson always said that the long-term success of this country would be our ability to sustain broad-based economic ownership. Of course, he was talking about a network of family farms and small businesses. That is what refreshes democracy, broad-based economic ownership. He always insisted that you can't maintain political freedoms unless you maintain economic freedom, and economic freedom comes from broad-based economic ownership. Therefore, this freedom is rooted in the economic health of men and women in this country who run America's small businesses on main streets. We need to be concerned about that. 
   How often do you hear Members come to the floor of the Senate and worry about the number of lawsuits in this country? They worry about the lawsuits filed by customers against big corporations. What about this use of lawyers by a big company trying to put a small company out of business? What about that kind of corporate 
   bullying? It is time to stop it. 
   The men and women who risk their all and work hard to run small businesses in this country don't deserve to have to defend themselves against a battery of lawyers hired by big corporations. I hope the company that produces a product that I purchase--a company I don't know very well--will decide that they ought to cease and desist. 
   I hope they will decide they have better things to do. I hope they will decide they don't own the name ``Lewis & Clark.'' I hope they will decide that there is no threat to the economic well-being of their company by the existence of a small business on the main street of Mandan, North Dakota that makes candy bars and hand-dipped candy. I hope they will find lawyers who can understand the difference between these two wrappers. 
   There must be better things for this company and for its lawyers to do. I hope to report to my colleagues one day that this company has decided to take a more constructive approach. I also hope that the many others around the country who suffer the same sort of difficulty--who are being bullied and muscled by some of the larger corporate enterprises that worry about the existence of competition--I hope these small business people will decide that the solution is not to cave in. The solution is to fight. Don't give up. 
   I know that this subject is radically different from the issue of nuclear waste. But it has a lot to do with what goes on in this country, the kinds of business we pursue and the kind of economy we will have in the future. If those who are big enough can always gain the upper hand then those who are small will never be able to defend themselves. 
   We must from time to time be the defenders of those in this country who aspire to do good work and aspire to run a small business and create something of value on the main streets of America. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know we are nearing the end of the day, and there are no further votes today or tomorrow. I will be reasonably brief. 
   I wanted to come to the floor when my colleague, Senator DURBIN, and others were speaking about the crisis dealing with AIDS in Africa. I wasn't able to come. I would like to mention that issue for a couple of moments; then I would like to talk about the issue of trade. 
   Today in the Democratic Policy Committee luncheon, we heard from the President's chief adviser on the subject of AIDS policy, and we also heard from Rory Kennedy, who has done a 12-minute documentary film, an award-winning film on the issue of AIDS in Africa. I know my colleagues came out to the floor and spoke on that subject following the Democratic Policy Committee luncheon. 
   It is almost unthinkable what has happened, especially in Africa, with respect to the subject of AIDS. AIDS is a scourge, a plague that is affecting the entire world. It is the first plague since the bubonic plague for which there is no cure, no vaccination, no significant remedy. It is devastating to a number of parts of this world, especially the continent of Africa. Twenty million people have died in Africa from AIDS; 14 million people are currently infected with HIV or AIDS in the continent of Africa. 
   We can't pretend it doesn't matter to us. AIDS is affecting all of the world, including our country. It has a devastating effect on Africa, a devastating impact on the millions and millions of children in Africa who now have no parents, who are left homeless by this scourge called AIDS. We must, as a country, gather with others in the world and combat this deadly plague. 
   We are spending substantial resources to try to find a cure for AIDS. We are also joining with others to try to find ways to educate people about how to stop the spread of HIV and AIDS. Some countries in Africa have begun to take emergency steps and have been successful and are beginning to stem the tide of the spread of AIDS, but it is not nearly rapid enough. These steps need to be taken with much greater urgency, and our country needs to be a part of that with other countries in the international community. 
   I would first like to compliment Rory Kennedy, who appeared today and played for us a 12-minute documentary film that almost takes your breath away when you see on film what has happened to the children and the families in Africa with the decimation of so many families as a result of death from AIDS. 
   We must do more. I compliment my colleagues, Senator DURBIN, Senator BRYAN, Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator FEINGOLD, and others, many of whom have traveled to Africa in recent months, and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle as well who are involved in this. We must work together to address this issue.

   Mr. DORGAN. I will talk for a moment about the issue of the trade deficit that faces this country. I would like to do so, understanding that this country is full of good economic news. 
   And there is a lot of reason for all of us to be optimistic about the future. The good economic news that was described last week--in fact, a week ago this evening--by President Clinton in the State of the Union Address tells us that unemployment is way down and more people are working than virtually ever before in this country; home ownership is up at record levels; inflation is down, down, way down; income is up; the stock market is up. There are so many evidences of good news in our country. Crime rates are also down. There is evidence all around us that things are better in America. All of us feel good about that. We live at a wonderful time in a wonderful country. It is quite a remarkable opportunity all of us have. 
   But we must be vigilant about some storm clouds on the horizon. One of those storm clouds for this country's economy is the burgeoning trade deficit, the imbalance between what we buy from other countries and what we sell to other countries and the resulting deficit that comes from selling less and buying more. 
   The trade deficit in this country is virtually exploding. We have a trade deficit that is higher than any trade deficit ever experienced anywhere on this Earth at any time. Does it matter? Is anybody talking about it? Was it mentioned in the State of the Union Address last week? No. Everyone wants to ignore the fact that we are rolling around pretty well, even though the trade deficit is increasing dramatically, and it somehow doesn't matter. We have wrestled this ``500-pound gorilla'' called the Federal budget deficit, with great pains, over many years. Finally, the scourge called the budget deficit, which was growing like a tumor--growing forever--is now gone. 
   But the budget deficit, while gone, is being replaced by a trade deficit that is growing at an alarming rate. I want to describe part of that today. Everyone talks about the past 107 months of economic expansion. I want to talk about that, but I also want to talk about the trade deficit that could put an end to that economic expansion if we don't do something to resolve this burgeoning deficit. 
   I will put up a chart that describes what we face for a trade deficit. This chart goes back to 1991. It shows the amount of goods and services we export and the amount we import. The red, of course, represents the imbalance, the trade deficit. In January, the Commerce Department announced that the trade deficit had widened to $26.5 billion in November alone, a new monthly record. But a new monthly record was set in 8 of the last 11 months. Our goods and services trade deficit--that is, all goods and services--in 1999 will be $266 billion. That will exceed the previous year's $164 billion by 62 percent. Understand that the goods and services trade deficit will have ratcheted up by 62 percent in 1 year alone. 
   We imported $92 billion worth of goods and exported $59.5 billion in goods in November. Now, if current trends continue, the growth in our international debt will simply not be sustainable. The foreign debt in this country is projected to be $1.7 trillion in 1999. That is not debt we owe to ourselves as the Federal budget deficit was; that is debt owed to foreigners who have a claim to assets in this country--$1.7 trillion. Almost all economists will tell us that is not sustainable and we must do something to address it. 
   When we become more dependent on receiving and retaining foreign capital to finance this imbalance, the day will come when foreigners lose faith in this economy and begin to pull out of our financial markets. When that happens, the value of the dollar will fall, interest rates will rise, corporate profits and stock prices will decline, and then we will have a slowdown in this economy. 
   Senators BYRD and STEVENS and I authored legislation, which is now law, creating a trade deficit review commission. That commission is now impaneled and underway, looking into the nature, causes, consequences, and remedies of this trade deficit. They 
   will report their findings in August. In the meantime, this trade deficit escalates. This is the deficit in goods alone--what is called the merchandise trade deficit. This shows what happens to your manufacturing base. This is the most alarming deficit of all--$343  billion--and you can see what has happened to this trade deficit since 1991. It is a dramatic escalation--$343 billion in a single year. 
   It would be useful to look at how our bilateral agreements have contributed to our bilateral goods deficit. 
   Between 1998-99, our merchandise trade deficit with Canada went from $14 billion to $28 billion. Mexico--incidentally, I might mention that, before Congress passed NAFTA--without my vote; I didn't vote for it--we had a trade surplus with Mexico and a relatively small deficit with Canada. NAFTA turned that into a large deficit with Canada and a very large deficit with Mexico. 
   The European Union: You can see what happened in the last year with respect to trade deficits with the European Union. They have increased dramatically. 
   China and Japan: What happened there is almost unforgivable in terms of an economic relationship. China had, in 1999, a merchandise trade deficit of over $60 billion with the United States, up from about $53 billion in the previous year. Japan's is $67 billion. These aren't getting better, they are getting worse. 
   What does all that mean for this country? We just negotiated a trade agreement with China. One of the major issues of great controversy in this Chamber in the coming months will be whether China should be granted permanent normal trade relations, the same as we grant other countries. We will debate that sometime soon. 
   That will be the source of great controversy for a number of reasons. Some in this Chamber will believe the Chinese have not made progress on human rights. Others will perhaps believe the Chinese are not abiding by fair labor standards that we would consider important in this country. Still others will believe China hasn't complied with previous trade agreements. So there will be a substantial amount of debate about this issue. 
   I have been interested in the bilateral trade agreement negotiated with China because we have a very large trade deficit with China. I wonder, when our negotiators negotiated, did they negotiate with some idea that we will bring that into balance? Can we send more goods into China? Can we sell more to China? Or will we simply continue to be a sponge for China and watch their goods come here while they still retain a relatively closed market to many of our goods? 
   Once when I was in China, I met with the President of that country. I talked to the President of China about trade issues. I said: You must buy more pork from the United States. You must buy more wheat from the United States. You must buy more from the United States. You ship us your trousers, your shirts, your shoes, your trinkets. Boats come from China loaded with all of the things you produce. Our consumers are happy to buy them. But we are not so lucky when American producers are trying to sell goods into the Chinese economy. We are told: No, you can't sell wheat in these circumstances in China; no, we won't purchase your pork; or, no, we won't purchase this or that. In fact, the things we do have, you want to make copies and violate the intellectual property rights of our producers. And we are not going to enforce that. We are going to look the other way when your plants press out the CDs with copyrighted music made by American artists. 
   My point is this: I think China is a very big, strong, interesting country that is going to be a significant part of our lives in the future. I am not sure what kind of influence they will have on our future, but it will be significant. I want China to play a constructive role in our future. I want us to play a constructive role in their future. So I want us to have engagement and opportunity. I want us to have trade relationships that are fair. I want China to move in a more significant way to improve their record on human rights and to move in a way that provides more opportunity for their workers to have a fair say in their economy. 
   But having said all of that, I don't have great confidence that the trade agreements we have with countries such as China are intent on ending these kinds of trade circumstances that are unfair to our country. 
   Two weeks ago, for example, after a bilateral trade negotiation with China was announced as a great success, the Chinese WTO negotiator, Vice Minister Long Yungtu, went to Kweichow in south China to talk about it. He was quoted in the South Asia Post as saying: You know, the agreement we have with the United States, this notion of buying a certain number of millions of tons of wheat doesn't mean we are going to buy any wheat in the United States. That is just theory. That is all theoretical. The notion that we will now accept meat from several thousand meat-packing plants in the United States doesn't mean we intend to have any U.S. meat come into our country. That is all just theoretical. 
   When I read what Minister Long, the man who negotiated the Chinese side of the agreement, said, I wrote to him and asked about that. I understand people get misquoted from time to time. I also asked Charlene Barshefsky, our trade ambassador, to find out what this means. So far I have not heard a word from the Chinese negotiator. I have not heard a word from the U.S. trade ambassador. I hope to hear from both. 
   I would like to see some progress in these areas. I want us to have a good trading relationship with China, Japan, Europe, Canada, and Mexico. But a good trading relationship to me is not defined as a circumstance where they plug our market with all of the goods from their country and then keep their market closed to many of our producers of commodities and goods. That doesn't make any sense to me. 
   This country can't allow that to happen any longer. We must insist on a reciprocal opportunity in foreign markets. A trade relationship with another country must be mutually beneficial to us and to them. We have far too often negotiated trade agreements that are one-way streets with foreign goods coming into the U.S. economy, but not a similar opportunity for U.S.-produced goods, including agricultural commodities and manufactured goods, to go into other economies. That is one of the reasons we have this massive trade deficit that is growing at an alarming rate. 
   I was going to speak about our situation with Canada and durum. I will reserve that for another time. I know we are nearing the end of the day. Some have other things they want to do. I am going to close with a point about trade enforcement. 
   It is one thing to have trade agreements that are bad agreements. We have had plenty of those. Our trade negotiators have not done well for this country, in my judgment. But it is another thing to have trade agreements that are reasonably decent but are unenforceable. That is also, I think, what happens even with those agreements that were decent agreements in the first place. 
   In the Department of Commerce where we monitor trade agreements, the number of people whose job it is to work on enforcement issues with respect to China and our trade agreements with China is 10. We have nearly a $65 billion merchandise trade deficit with China. We have all kinds of problems getting into the Chinese marketplace with American goods, and we have 10 people whose job it is to work on the issue--10. 
   Or Japan--we have had a trade deficit with Japan of $45 billion to $60 billion forever. Do you know how many people work on that issue? Sixteen. 
   Canada and Mexico together--we turned a surplus with Mexico into a big deficit, and we doubled the deficit with Canada. That is all the result of this wonderful trade agreement called NAFTA for which we had people stand up and brag on the floor of the Senate saying that you have to pass this because if you do we will have more American jobs. It will be better for everybody. 
   I didn't vote for NAFTA. But the Congress passed it. Guess what. All of those economists are now unwilling to show their face around here because they predicted several hundred thousand new American jobs. In fact, we lost several hundred thousand opportunities, and a trade surplus with Mexico turned into a huge deficit. And a trade deficit with Canada doubled because this country didn't negotiate a reasonable trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. This country lost. Do you know how many people are working on this issue at the Department of Commerce? Ten for two countries, and a combined trade deficit of over $50 billion. We have 10 people working on it.  
   There was a story not too long ago that said that U.S. officials who are responsible for monitoring trade agreements sometimes couldn't even locate the text of the agreements. It is one thing to be incompetent. It is another thing to exercise benign neglect over things that are your responsibility. But it is quite another thing to be in charge of something and then just lose it. 
   Do those of us who have concerns about this have legitimate concerns? Yes. We need to negotiate better trade agreements. We need to enforce trade agreements. And we need to make certain that the relationships we have with other countries are mutually beneficial to us and to them. That has not been the case, sadly. 
   At the WTO conference in Seattle, which turned out to be such a fiasco with demonstrators in the streets, with some thugs in the streets who defaced buildings, broke windows, and that sort of thing, one thing happened that was quite remarkable. I want to say, however, there were very few people who I call thugs who used paint cans up and down the streets of Seattle. It was regrettable that they defaced buildings and destroyed property. But the bulk of the people in the streets of Seattle--literally tens of thousands of them--were perfectly peaceable. They demonstrated up and down the streets in ways that were perfectly peaceable. They were there to demonstrate for legitimate reasons. They demonstrated about a range of issues about which they cared deeply and passionately. 
   There will never be, in my judgment, a place in the world where there are negotiations about trade in which there won't be people showing up to ask legitimate questions about labor standards and environmental standards because you can't fight in a country such as ours for 75 years and have people die in the streets demonstrating for the right to form unions and then decide, well, we will just pole-vault over all of those things and go and produce our goods in Sri Lanka or some other country where you do not have to worry about labor unions because they don't allow workers to form unions. We won't pay a livable wage, we won't have safe workplaces, and we won't restrict people from dumping chemicals into the streams and into the air. We'll hire kids for 12 cents an hour, work them 12 hours a day, and put them in unsafe plants. And, if you do not like it, tough luck. 
   That is the attitude of some in the rest of the world, and the people who demonstrate in the street are saying that isn't fair because we fought 75 years in this country for a minimum wage, for safe labor standards, and for a whole range of issues that are very important to who we are and what we are, and we are not going to allow those to be traded away in trade agreements. They have a legitimate concern. There will always, in my judgment, be Americans in the streets unless they are part of the negotiations. That is why the WTO needs to be much more open and much more inclusive. Having secret negotiations and excluding people is not a way to resolve these issues. 
   Globalization, galloping along, must be accompanied by rules that are fair and thoughtful dealing with these serious issues of labor standards, environmental standards, and other issues. They must be accompanied by thoughtful rules. 
   In Seattle, I met with a group of Parliamentarians from Europe. I and a number of my Republican and Democrat colleagues went together to the WTO meetings in Seattle with great hope, and regrettably those meetings didn't produce much in terms of agreement. They produced a great deal of chaos in the streets, and among the negotiators nothing much happened. But during one memorable meeting for me with a group of Parliamentarians from Europe something happened that was quite remarkable. Michel Rocard, who was a former Prime Minister of France and is now a member of the European Parliament in Europe, leaned across the table to me and said something interesting. He said:  
   We talk about the beef dispute, beef hormones, and the dispute with Roquefort cheese, and all of these issues we have with Europe. They are nettlesome, difficult issues with Europe on the trade disputes.  
   As we were talking about the differences between Europe and the United States, Mr. Rocard, who was the former Prime Minister of France, leaned forward to me and he said:  
   I want you to understand something, Mr. Senator. We talk about our differences, but I want you to understand something about how I feel about your country. I was a 14-year-old boy standing on the streets of Paris, France, when the U.S. Army came in to kick the Nazis out of our country. A young black American soldier handed me an apple as he walked past. It was the first apple I had seen in several years. I will never forget how a 14-year-old boy felt about this young American soldier walking down the street in Paris, to liberate my country, and this young soldier handing me, this young French boy, an apple.  
   It occurred to me that we forget, I think, what this country means, what it has been to so many others in the world; what we have done and what we have yet to do in the world. I tell you that story only to say that while we have substantial trade disputes, our country has done a lot for a lot of people around the world. We liberated Europe. We beat back the forces of fascism. This country was perhaps the only country that was capable of doing that at that time. 
   After the Second World War, for the first 25 years after that, we said to Europe not only did we kick the Nazis out of France and American soldiers moved across Europe and liberated the Europeans and defeated Hitler, not only that, but this country has decided to create a Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe. We rebuilt the economies of Europe. 
   For 25 years, in addition to spending money for the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe and rebuild the economies of Europe, we also said our trade policy will be our foreign policy. We made concessional trade agreements with everybody because it was not a problem for us. We were big enough and strong enough so that with one hand tied behind our backs, we could beat almost anybody in the world with international trade. So our trade policy was our foreign policy, and it was to help other countries get back on their feet. 
   But things changed. After about a quarter of a century, from the Second World War on, at that point we began to see our allies gaining strength, having better economies, doing a better job. All of a sudden, we had some tough, shrewd economic competitors. And in the second 25 years post-Second World War, our competition has changed. Our competition has been tougher in international trade. But in this country, much of our trade policy has remained foreign policy. 
   Instead of our being hard-nosed competitors with a reasonable trade policy that cares about our producers and the economic health of our producers, our trade policy has remained largely focused on foreign policy. That needs to change. We cannot always say it does not matter what our deficits are with China or Japan. We cannot say it does not matter--of course it matters. This has economic consequences to us. Our trade policy with respect to Japan needs to be a hard-nosed trade strategy that says you have tough competitors. But we need to compete with fair rules, and the rules of trade between the United States and Japan are fundamentally unfair. They are fundamentally unfair. I will come some other time to talk about the specifics of that. That was all fine, post-Second World War for a quarter of a century, but it is not fine anymore, and it is going to begin to injure this country and sap economic strength from this country. 
   No one wants a future of economic growth for this country more than I do. But the way to assure continued months of economic prosperity and continued years of prosperity will be to deal with problems that exist. One set of problems and storm clouds on this country's horizon is a huge, growing trade deficit that nobody seems to care about and nobody seems to want to talk about and no 
   one seems willing to do anything about. I just hope one of these days enough of us in the Senate can say to our colleagues, can say to the administration, and can say to our trading partners and our allies, that things are going to have to change. We believe in the global economy. I believe in expanding trade opportunities. I do not believe in putting up walls, and I do not believe in restricting trade. But I believe very much this country needs to say to our trading partners that we insist and demand fair trade rules. We demand it. 
   It was fine 40 years ago that we did not have them because we did not need  them and we were helping other countries get back on their feet. That is not the case any longer. With Japan, we need some equilibrium and fairness. If you want to ship your products to this country, God bless you. They are welcome, and our consumers will be advantaged by having the ability to buy them. But we demand the same of your consumers. We demand the ability of your consumers to buy that which is produced in this country. 
   When you go to a grocery store in Tokyo and pay $30 or $35 for a pound of T-bone steak, you do that because they do not have enough beef. They don't have enough beef. That is because we don't get enough American beef in, because it is limited. Why? Because we have a trade agreement that provides, as we speak, a 40-percent tariff on every single pound of American beef going into Japan. If we did that on anything Japan sends into this country, it would be considered an outrage. We would be held up to ridicule, saying how on Earth dare the United States do this? Yet for every single pound of U.S. beef going into Japan as I speak, today, there is a 40-percent tariff attached to it. It is not fair. 
   My point is this country can compete. Its producers can compete anywhere in the world any time. But only if we negotiate trade agreements and enforce trade agreements that are fair to our country and our producers and that are mutually beneficial to us and to our trading partners.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand we are here on the floor of the Senate to talk about the renomination of Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. I want to start my presentation by saying it is not my intention to come to the floor of the Senate to persuade people Mr. Greenspan is not a good person or has not been a good public servant--I do not believe that. He is someone with great skill and great devotion to public service. 
   But I do come to say that I have profound differences with Mr. Greenspan over monetary policy issues and I believe his stewardship with the Federal Reserve Board, while widely hailed by many, falls short of what I think should have been done at the Fed during the same period. I would like to spend some time describing that. 
   As I begin this discussion, let me point out that just this afternoon the Federal Reserve Board has announced yet another interest rate hike. They have announced today that the Federal Open Market Committee is hiking short-term interest rates another one quarter of 1 percent. 
   What does that mean? A lot of people will not think much about the one quarter of 1 percent in terms of what it means to them. It means the Federal Reserve Board is imposing a tax on every single American with these interest rate hikes because they are worried about some new wave of inflation that does not exist in our country. I had some work done at the North Dakota State University by Dr. Won Koo in the Department of Agricultural Economics. I asked him to tell me what it means, just in terms of North Dakota, when the Federal Reserve Board has now on four occasions in a matter of 8 months raised interest rates by 1 percent. What does it mean when we have a 1-percent interest rate increase? 
   The additional average interest payments for North Dakota farmers will be nearly $23 million a year as a result of the actions of the Federal Reserve Board, or about $719 per farm annually. 
   A typical North Dakota household will see their interest charges go up by an additional $356 a year because of the four Fed interest rate hikes. The Federal Reserve Board is imposing a tax on every single American with these four rate hikes. 
   I will explain more later why I think the rate hikes are unjustifiable. But these rate hikes are unjustifiable because the Federal Reserve Board is searching for inflation that does not exist. Inflation has gone down, down, way down, all the while the Federal Reserve Board has insisted the fires of inflation are just around the corner. The Fed has been consistently wrong on that. And there seems to be almost no debate about it. It is OK if the Fed decides it wants to increase interest rates and effectively tax all the American people with higher interest rates. 
   Some of those who come to the floor of the Senate who are the most aggressive people in opposition to any kind of a tax increase, sit silently while the Federal Reserve Board says: We want to impose new costs on the American people in the form of mandated higher interest charges. That is rather curious to me. Why so silent when the Federal Reserve Board does this without justification, I might add. 
   Here is the Federal Reserve Board. And I do this to give the American people a sense of who makes monetary policy. We have a Board of Governors. There are two seats that are currently vacant. We are hoping maybe we can get someone appointed to the Federal Reserve Board who cares something about consumers and family farmers and others who will have to pay the higher interest charges. It is not likely  to happen, but we are trying. None of the current Board members is from our part of the country. There have only been three Board members from the Upper Midwest appointed to the Board of Governors since it was created. We are hoping maybe somebody who might take one of these vacant seats will be somebody who knows how to make something, to produce something, who does something every day and will come here not representing the money center bankers' interests but representing the interests of consumers, family farmers, or Main Street businesses. 
   The Board of Governors and, the presidents of the regional Fed banks on a rotating basis, go in a room, shut the door, and in secret decide what kind of monetary policy they want to employ and whether they want to increase interest rates. The American people were not present in the room and I was not present in the room because we are excluded from these deliberations by the Federal Reserve Board. 
   These are the folks who went into that room: Roger W. Ferguson, Jr., Alan Greenspan, Edward Gramlich, Edward W. Kelley, Jr., Laurence Meyer; and then these folks from the Fed regional banks, the ones with the gold stars: Robert Perry, Jack Guynn, Mr. Broaddus, Mr. Jordan, and Mr. McDonough. They apparently think the American people's interest charges are not high and decided to raise it one-quarter of 1 percent, a total of 1 percent over the last four rate hikes. The question is why. 
   It is interesting, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board says he does this because there is a threat of new inflation in this country. Over the past 12 months, however, inflation has been well under control. The CPI has risen 2.7 percent in the last 12 months. In the last 3 months, the CPI has risen at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, and the core CPI--if you take out volatile food and energy prices, has risen 1.9 percent in the last 12 months, the lowest it's been since 1965. 
   In addition, Mr. Greenspan has come to the Capitol and said: We think the CPI overstates inflation by 1.5 percent. I do not think he is right about that, but if he is right, we have effectively no inflation in this country. If we have no inflation in this country, what on Earth are these folks doing in a secret meeting downtown, wearing suits and glasses and talking in bankerspeak, deciding to increase taxes in the form of a higher interest rate on every American? What are they doing? How do they 
   justify that? Why do those in this Congress who wail so much about taxes sit silently while the Federal Reserve Board does this without justification? You tell me where the new fires of inflation exist. 
   Alan Greenspan for years came to counsel us on Capitol Hill. He said: We cannot countenance economic growth in this country more than 2.2 or 2.5 percent without risking substantial new waves of inflation--just can't do it. He was wrong. Again and again he was wrong. Economic growth has been well above 2.5 percent, and inflation has been way down, not up. Mr. Greenspan came to Congress and gave us the sage advice that if we saw unemployment fall below 6 percent, we risked new fires of inflation. He was wrong again and again. He was wrong. 
   Yet we hear people come to the floor to say he is the greatest American ever. He is a nice enough fellow. I have nothing against him personally. His policies, in my judgment, have imposed an added financial burden on the American people in the form of higher interest charges than is justifiable. I ask all of you who know these numbers, evaluate what have been the interest rates relative to inflation--that is, the real rate of interest--in the Greenspan years versus pre-Greenspan years. What is the real economic rent for money? What kinds of policies imposed by the Greenspan years at the Fed have resulted in what kinds of charges to the American people relative to what had been done before Mr. Greenspan came to the Fed? 
   I will tell you the answer. The answer is, interest rates on a real basis have been higher in the Greenspan years by about one-half of 1 percent than the pre-Greenspan years. Can you justify that? I do not think so. And Mr. Greenspan, leading this Fed--and make no mistake, he is in charge, it is his policy, no one would contest that--has said over the years: We must grow more slowly; we cannot support higher growth; we must shade on the area of having more people unemployed rather than fewer people unemployed, and because of the risks of having too few people out of work and too much economic growth, we must retain interest rates at a level that is higher than historically justified relative to the rate of inflation. 
   Some might come to the floor and be able to justify that in their own minds. I certainly cannot. I do not think the American people believe either that Mr. Greenspan's higher interest rates relate to this new economy that can grow faster with lower unemployment numbers than most economists ever thought available or doable. 
   Let's talk just about the numbers for a few minutes. I mentioned that the core rate of inflation is now 1.9 percent over the last 12 months, the lowest its been since 1965. I mentioned Mr. Greenspan thinks the CPI overstates the rate of inflation by a percent and a half. That means we have virtually no inflation. But today the Fed said we are worried about inflation, therefore we must increase interest rates once again. The Fed is wrong once again. 
   In 1999, the GDP grew at 4 percent; in 1998, 4.3 percent; in 1997, 4.5 percent. In other words, in the two previous years to 1999, we had higher rates of growth than in the last year, and yet the Fed today, by its interest rate increase, says our economy is growing too fast. Again, in my judgment, it is implausible. This Fed Chairman steers the Fed on monetary policy on the side of money center banks. I think monetary policy ought to be steered in a direction and on a course that relates to all of the needs and all of the interests of this economy and of the American people. 
   I talked a little about unemployment. In the past, the Fed has preached that the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment was 6 percent. In short, if the unemployment rate goes below 6 percent, consumer prices will go up. The Fed's reliance on this and other buggy-whip approaches to economic analysis have been terribly misdirected given the globalization and 
   the galloping globalization of the workforce. 
   The unemployment rate has been below 6 percent for 64 consecutive months, over 5 years, without a peek at a new wave of inflation. Today, unemployment rates are at a 30-year low of 4.1 percent, and our economy is growing at a healthy rate without a shred of evidence that there is a new threat of inflation. 
   Some say Mr. Greenspan is increasing interest rates not so much because he is worried about inflation, although that is what he says, but because he wants to curb speculation in the stock market. He thinks there is something in the stock market; he said once ``irrational exuberance''--whatever that means to economists. I used to teach economics ever so briefly. Irrational exuberance, he says--it is interesting--irrational exuberance on the part of those who are engaging in transactions on Wall Street that are presumably market transactions, and presumably in a circumstance where the market works. It is interesting that Mr. Greenspan decides, because of this irrational exuberance, he wants to impose a penalty on all the American people through higher interest rates rather than deal with what I think may be the cause of this so-called irrational exuberance. 
   If Mr. Greenspan really wants to try to bust some of the bubble on Wall Street, maybe he ought not raise interest rates that cause direct and immediate harm to families and to producers, but maybe he ought to consider taking real steps to put limits on the use of ``margins'' by investors to buy stocks. 
   It is interesting, the amount borrowed by investors to buy equity securities is growing to levels of significant concern. 
   Last November, the margin amount increased by 13.2 percent in 1 month alone--the largest monthly increase since 1971. Perhaps Mr. Greenspan might want to put some limits on the use of margins; but, no, not Mr. Greenspan. He would sooner impose an added interest charge on all Americans. 
   Let me talk for a moment about what I think is the low watermark of the Fed in recent times. That is the  issue of Long-Term Capital Management, the ill-fated hedge fund, because it relates not only to the management of the Fed, but it relates to what the Fed is interested in and relates to the Fed's, in my judgment, insensitivity of or, perhaps in a stronger sense, blindness to solve the risks that exist that they ought to be concerned about but are not. 
   Long-Term Capital Management. 
   Mr. President, how much of my time remains?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, some while ago the Federal Reserve Board orchestrated a $3.6 billion bailout of something called Long-Term Capital Management, the highflying hedge fund, which I think calls into question the leadership at the Federal Reserve Board and calls into question what they think is important and what they are willing to ignore. 
   The federally insured banks were lenders and investors in this Long-Term Capital Management fund. The GAO, in its 1999 report, requested by myself and Congressman MARKEY, Senators HARKIN and REID, found that federal regulators failed to detect lapses in risk management by lenders, and others, that allowed Long-Term Capital Management to become large and excessively leveraged until after the crisis. 
   Mr. Greenspan testified that the intervention in the Long-Term Capital Management debacle was needed to prevent a crisis in the global financial markets. But then he appears just as quickly to dismiss the Fed role in the bailout as little more than a spectator providing office space. 
   What makes this more troublesome, to me, is that just days before the Federal officials visited Long-Term Capital Management in Connecticut to discuss its financial problems, Chairman Greenspan was testifying before the House Banking Committee that: ``Hedge funds were strongly regulated by those who lend the money.'' Of course, nothing could have been further from the truth, as was uncovered by the GAO's 1999 investigation of the Long-Term Capital Management's near collapse. 
   The independent report reveals that our Federal regulators, including the Fed, allowed this speculative hedge fund to load up with $1.4 trillion notional value in derivatives, which threatened to bring chaos in financial markets here and around the world. 
   While I am on this subject of unregulated hedge funds, which the Fed on a Sunday had to bail out by arranging bank loans, shortly after they said: Gee, there is no problem here with hedge funds. 
   Let me add that the subject of derivatives ought to have some attention by not only our committees but by the Fed and other banking regulators, as well. There is something around $33 trillion notional value derivatives by banks in this country, and we have banks whose deposits are insured by the Federal Government, doing proprietary trading on derivatives on their own accounts. 
   They could just as well put a craps table in the lobby of a bank. They could just as well put a roulette wheel in the lobby of a bank. A bank, with federally insured deposits, trading on its proprietary accounts in derivatives, and nobody seems to care. But someday, some way, someone will care because this is going to go the way of Long-Term Capital Management, unless there is adequate supervision. When those cards collapse, that collapse is going to be significant. 
   We need, in my judgment, strong management. We need assertive oversight by our committees. We need strong, aggressive oversight in the regulatory approaches by the Federal Reserve Board. Regrettably, that is not the case these days with respect to the Federal Reserve Board. 
   Since the chairman of the Banking Committee is here, I will say that I urge the committee to pay some attention. You probably already have. I am not suggesting you have not. I don't know what your agenda is. I hope very much the issue of derivatives and the issue of the regulation of hedge funds, or at least the concern about what hedge funds are doing in light of Long-Term Capital Management scandal, is something that is part of the agenda of the Banking Committee in this Congress. 
   I have described, at the start of my presentation, it is not my intention, nor would I expect it to be the intention of the Senator from Iowa, Mr. HARKIN, or others, to come to the floor to say that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board is a bad person. I do not believe that. I met him. I like him. I think he is a good public servant. I think he has given a great deal to this country. 
   He and I simply have fundamental differences on monetary policy. He has run monetary policy with a tight fist, believing a certain way, and those beliefs include that we could not allow more growth. We had to have slower growth in order to avoid inflation. We had to have more people unemployed in order to avoid inflation. He was wrong on both counts, wrong consistently. 
   My point is, I think it is time--and I have told this to the President--I think it is time for new blood at the Federal Reserve Board. 
   I say to the Senator from Iowa, who has come to the floor, look at this Board. I, from time to time, as a public service--because the Fed is so closed and so secretive; it is the last dinosaur on the American landscape in public policy--I bring pictures to the floor to show people what the Fed looks like. Here is who they are. Here is where they graduated from. Here is what their degrees are. Put a gray suit on all these folks, and they all look the same, talk the same, and think the same. That is why this policy is a homogenized policy that does not provoke any debate in this country about monetary policy. 
   A century ago they used to debate monetary policy in bars and barbershops. I thought that was healthy. Fifty years ago and 40 years ago, when McChesney Martin was running the Federal Reserve Board up here, he was going to raise interest rates by one quarter of 1 percent, and Lyndon Johnson got him down to the ranch in the Perdinales in Texas and darn near broke his shoulders he was squeezing him so tight. 
   The point is, it was front page headlines around the country because McChesney Martin was going to have the Fed raise interest rates by a quarter of 1 percent. The President got so upset he even called McChesney Martin down to the ranch. The Fed did not have to respond to Lyndon Johnson, but my point is, back then interest rate policy was a matter of public concern, of public debate. These days, these folks go in that well-paneled room and shut the door, and it is all done in secret. Then they open the door and say: Guess what we have done for you. There are too many people working. We are growing too fast, so therefore we have increased a tax on all the American people by increasing interest rates once again. 
   Four successive interest rate increases--1 full percent. Again, let me say that the average North Dakota household, which pays $356 a year more in interest rate charges--that is a new tax on the American consumer in my State and around the country.

   Mr. DORGAN. It was not a tax debated on the floor of the Senate. If we had that debate, my friend from Texas, Senator GRAMM, the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee, would be on the floor, I guarantee you, because when we debate taxes he is on the floor. He is a passionate combatant in those debates. But we cannot have that debate on the floor of the Senate because the Federal Reserve Board does not have a debate in public. It does it in secret. 
   What I am saying is, I think the Federal Reserve Board process needs to be more open. I know the response and the rejoinder to that will be: Well, the Senator wants to make the Federal Reserve Board process politics on the floor of the Senate. That is not my point. My point is, I think there ought to be, leading into this process somehow, some interests of the American people. It does not exist at the moment. 
   It is my intention to not support this renomination. I expect this renomination will carry with a very large vote in the Senate, but it will not carry with my vote because I believe monetary policy ought to change in this country. I do not believe our country is growing too fast. I do not believe too few people are unemployed. I do not  share that view, that is too often shared in the bowels of the Federal Reserve Board. I would like someday for us to have a monetary policy that represents the entire interests of our country, not just the interests of money center banks.

   Mr. DORGAN. There is so little known about the Federal Reserve Board that when Senator REID and I had a GAO report done recently, they said that the Federal Reserve Board has stashed away now close to $6.4 billion--then I believe it was $3.7 billion--in a kind of a rainy day fund. The rainy day fund was described by the Fed as a surplus fund that was to be used in the event they needed it if they suffered a loss. 
   This is an institution that makes money. This is an institution that has never had a loss, will never have a loss, and stashes away a cash reserve in the event that it has a rainy day. The GAO report, of course, was very critical of the management of the Fed on a wide range of things. But I will not put it in the RECORD.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few moments today about the call in the State of the Union Address for a prescription drug benefit to be added to the Medicare program. 
   In all of the discussions about the State of the Union and what is happening to the health of the American people, one of the underlying issues is that people are living longer and better lives. When people live longer and better lives, it means we have more strain on Medicare and on Social Security. But, of course, all of that is born of good news: People are living longer. At the start of the last century, citizens of the United States were expected to live, on average, to about 48 years of age. One hundred years later, in the year 2000, you are expected to live to be about 78 years of age--a 30-year increase in life expectancy. That is really quite remarkable. 
   What are the reasons for that? There are a lot of reasons: Better nutrition, new medical technologies, and life-saving prescription medicines that have been developed to extend life. There are a lot of reasons for the increased longevity. 
   In 1965, we created a Medicare program that has contributed substantially to the increase in longevity in this country. Prior to that time, 50 percent of senior citizens had no health care coverage at all--none. Medicare provided health care coverage to all senior citizens, and now 99 percent of older Americans in this country have basic health care protection through Medicare. That clearly has extended life and has allowed people to live longer and better lives. But in 1965 when Medicare was created, many of the prescription drugs that now exist for extending life simply weren't available. There was not, therefore, a need for a prescription drug benefit in Medicare. 
   The call now by the President and by Members of Congress, myself included,  Democrats and Republicans alike, is for a prescription drug benefit for the Medicare program. Why? Because senior citizens in this country comprise 12 percent of our population and consume 33 percent of the prescription drugs in our country. 
   Let me repeat that because it is important. 
   Twelve percent of our population are senior citizens, but yet they consume one-third of the prescription drugs. 
   The cost of prescription drugs last year increased nearly 16 percent--last year alone. Part of the reason for that increase was price inflation, and part of it was a dramatic increase in utilization. But we should, it seems to me, be especially concerned about senior citizens having access to the prescription drugs they need to extend and improve their lives. 
   As chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, I have been holding hearings in various parts of the country on this very subject. For instance, I held a hearing with Senator SCHUMER in Westchester, NY, and a hearing recently with Senator DURBIN in Chicago. I guess I have held perhaps six or eight hearings on this subject. 
   It is heartbreaking sometimes to hear the stories told at these hearings. An oncologist came to a hearing I held. He told of one of his patients who was a senior citizen, a woman who had breast cancer. And he said: There is a medicine she needs to take following her surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation that will reduce the chances that she will have a recurrence of breast cancer. When I described this medicine to her, she said: What does it cost? The doctor told her what it cost. And she said: There isn't any way I can afford that medicine. I will just have to take my chances. I will just have to take my chances of the breast cancer recurring because I can't afford the medicine. 
   It breaks your heart to hear that. 
   Or to hear a senior citizen who said: When I go into the grocery store where I purchase my medications, the first stop for me must be the pharmacy counter because I must get my prescriptions filled, so then I will know how much money I have left for food. Only then will I know how much food I can buy. 
   Senior citizens will find in some circumstances that they take 4, 6, or 8, and in some cases 10 and 12, different kinds of medicines at the same time. Some of them are horribly expensive. Yet most older Americans have very little prescription drug coverage. 
   I would like to show some charts that describe these circumstances graphically, especially for senior citizens. 
   This chart shows that nearly a third of senior citizens spend $1,500 a year on prescription drugs. These are people who are living on fixed incomes, and 70 percent of them have incomes of $15,000 or less. 
   This chart shows that nearly 75 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have inadequate prescription drug coverage. In fact, 34 percent have no drug coverage at all--none, zero. So they must go to the drugstore to buy their prescription drugs, living on a fixed income, trying to balance the need to pay heat and light and rent and food, and then try to figure out how to pay for increasingly expensive prescription drugs. Many of them find they can't do it. 
   They tell me at these hearings some of the measures they are forced to take: I have heart trouble, or I have diabetes, they tell me, and what I do is buy the prescription drugs that the doctor says I must have, and cut the pills in half and take half the dose so it lasts twice as long. And they hope somehow that they will avoid medical problems by doing it. 
   It breaks your heart to hear someone 85 years of age who knows he has to take medicine to deal with his heart disease and diabetes, but who says: I can't afford it so I don't take the medicine. 
   As this chart shows, this is especially a problem for older women. As you can see, the majority of women have no prescription drug coverage at all. That is a very serious problem. 
   This chart illustrates that rural beneficiaries are less likely to have prescription drug coverage across all income groups. I represent a rural State and the many hearings I have held in North Dakota confirm this fact. 
   We are going to be confronted in this Congress with the question of whether we should add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. When I was in New York with Senator SCHUMER, Connie Pennucci, 77 years old, said she has no prescription drug benefits and pays $200 a month out of pocket for the medications she needs to treat her arthritis and osteoporosis. 
   In Illinois about 2 weeks ago, a woman named Anita Milton told Senator DURBIN and I that she had a double lung transplant. Because of the way Medicaid works, she gets help to pay for her prescription drugs one month, but then the next month she has no drug benefits at all. I think she told us that her prescription drugs to prevent the rejection of her new lungs cost $2,500 a month. Think of that, $2,500 a month. 
   At that same hearing, this wonderful woman who had a double lung transplant was joined by two people who had heart transplants. They told us the cost of their prescription drugs that are necessary to prevent rejection of their transplanted hearts. Is all of this miracle medicine? Of course it is. But it is only miraculous if you can afford the prescription drugs that must be taken on a daily basis to ward off the rejection of the transplanted organ. 
   There is an urgent requirement, in my judgment, for all of us in Congress to join together to find a way to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. We should do it in a way that is voluntary for senior citizens. We should do it in a way that doesn't break the Treasury, and pharmaceutical prices should be affordable. But we can do that. I hope Republicans and Democrats together will recognize the urgent need to do this. 
   I would like to address one other issue, and that is the issue of the price of prescription drugs. Why do prescription drugs cost so much, and what can we do about it? Let me say at the outset, I want the pharmaceutical industry to be successful. I want the drug companies to be successful. I want them to be profitable. I want them to continue to invest in new research and development to help discover new lifesaving medicines and drugs. As you know, the federal government provides a substantial investment in pharmaceutical research and development through the National Institutes of Health and tax credits. A substantial amount of research and development for new medicines is publicly funded. But the pharmaceutical industry does private research and development. 
   I want them to be successful. But I also want them to price pharmaceutical drugs fairly for all of the American people. In virtually every other country in which you purchase a prescription drug made by a pharmaceutical company in a plant inspected by the Food and Drug Administration, the same pill in the same bottle made by the same company costs double, sometimes triple the amount in the United States than in virtually any other country in the world. I will give you some examples. 
   Let me go back to some of the medications most frequently used by older Americans who consume a third of the prescription drugs in our country. If they take Zocor, a cholesterol-reducing drug, the same drug in the same dosage and quantity costs $106 in the United States, and only $43 in Canada, $47 in Mexico. These prices have been converted to U.S. dollars. 
   Or Prilosec, a drug for ulcers costs $105 in the U.S., $53 in 
   Canada, and $29 in Mexico. 
   Zoloft, a drug for depression, costs $195 in America, $124 in Canada, and $155 in Mexico. The list goes on. 
   This chart shows it better. How much do we pay for prescription drugs? For every $1 that American consumers pay for a prescription drug, that same drug would cost much less in other nations. For every dollar Americans spend for prescription medications, Canadian consumers pay 64 cents, the English pay 65 cents, the Swedes pay $68 cents, and the Italians pay 51 cents. 
   Why do U.S. consumers pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? The answer is because the pharmaceutical industry can charge as much as they want if they choose to do so --and they do. 
   I took a small group of senior citizens to Emerson, Canada, recently. They purchased prescription drugs at the pharmacy in Emerson. These are senior citizens with heart disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, and other illnesses. Guess what. We went 5 miles  across the border into Canada and there they could buy the same prescription drugs at a small percentage of the price of the prescription drugs in this country. These are the same pills, made by the same company, often actually made in the United States and then shipped 5 miles north into Canada. Yet, if U.S. consumers were to buy them in the United States, they are charged much higher prices. 
   Is that fair? No. If this is truly a global economy, then it seems to me that pharmacists in this country ought to be able to access those same drugs in any market in the world and pass the savings on to their customers. That would, in my judgment, force the pharmaceutical industry to reprice their products in the United States. 
   As I said when I started, I want the pharmaceutical industry to make money. I want them to do good pharmaceutical. The Wall Street Journal calls the profits of the pharmaceutical industry ``the envy of the corporate world.'' Why? At least in part, it seems to me, it is because the U.S. consumer is charged very, very high prices for the same drug that is marketed in the rest of the world at a much lower cost. I have introduced a piece of legislation, the International Prescription Drug Parity Act, that I and a bipartisan group of cosponsors are going to try to get passed in this Congress to address this problem. 
   These issues of pharmaceutical drug costs and a prescription drug benefit in Medicare are very important issues. Lifesaving medicine is only able to save lives if people can afford to have access to that medicine. Too many Americans find these prices are out of their reach. Too many senior citizens living on fixed incomes are finding they are not able to afford the medicines that are necessary for them to prolong their lives, to improve their lives, and to treat their diseases or illness. We in Congress can do something about that. But I would say this. Even as we try to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, we must find a way to put some downward pressure on prescription drug prices and provide some fairness relative to what the rest of the world pays for the same prescription drugs. 
   Mr. President, I again thank the Senator from Iowa for the courtesy. I know the bankruptcy bill is on the floor. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Chairman's cooperation and assistance on this bill and his willingness to work with me in the Energy Committee to bring this legislation to the floor. His commitment to convene a workshop to resolve outstanding issues provides the basis for moving forward with this legislation, which would meet the outstanding Federal commitment to our state. 
   As the Senator from Alaska knows, North Dakota has significant water quality and water quantity needs that must be addressed. In many parts of my state, well water in rural communities resembles weak coffee or strong tea; it is unfit for drinking and other domestic uses. Several parts of my state, including the Red River Valley, do not have access to reliable sources of water. This bill is designed to address those needs and help provide clean, reliable water to families and businesses across North Dakota. When the Senate attempted to consider this legislation in recent days, objections were registered by other Senators who had concerns about the bill. In response, Senator CONRAD and I have worked with those Senators to address their concerns. 
   I am certain that with the Chairman's assistance and that of Senator SMITH we will be able to resolve these concerns expeditiously.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one of the bills that will pass today as part of an Energy and Natural Resources Committee package is S. 769, which provides a final settlement on certain debts owed by the city of Dickinson, North Dakota to the Bureau of Reclamation. The legislation, which was introduced by Senator KENT CONRAD and myself, is virtually identical to that introduced during the last Congress. 
   The Dickinson Dam Bascule Gates Settlement Act (S. 769) will afford long overdue relief to the citizens of Dickinson. Let me briefly explain why the debt liquidation is needed and appropriate. For one thing, the Bureau of Reclamation built a faulty project. The debt was incurred by the city of Dickinson for construction of a dam with gate structures which never worked properly. In addition, the need for the bascule gates as regulating structures to help provide a reliable local water supply was eclipsed by the construction of the Southwest Pipeline. The pipeline is part of the Garrison Diversion Project which is managed by the same Bureau of Reclamation. 
   Consequently, it makes no sense for the city of Dickinson to have two water supply systems when it needs only one--especially when the first system was a faulty one. The city has already repaid more than $1.2 million for the bascule gates, even though they now provide virtually no benefit to the city. 
   The legislation itself is actually quite simple. It would permit the Secretary of the Interior to accept one final payment of $300,000 from the city of Dickinson in place of a series of payments, totaling about $1.5 million, required by city's current repayment contract. The final payment may be adjusted for payments made after June 2, 1998. 
   The bill also clarifies that the city of Dickinson will be responsible for up to  $15,000 in annual operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. This amount represents the average costs for O&M on the gate structures over the past 15 years. The bill as introduced was not explicit on this point and Senator CONRAD and I have worked with the Energy Committee on an amendment that is part of the reported bill. 
   I want to thank Chairman FRANK MURKOWSKI, Ranking Member JEFF BINGAMAN, Subcommittee Chairman GORDON SMITH, and their staffs for their cooperation and assistance. I also want to underscore the leadership of Senator CONRAD in developing this legislation and the excellent work of his Deputy Legislative Director, Kirk Johnson. May I also commend Dickinson Mayor Fred Gengler and City Administrator Greg Sund for their help and persistence in seeking a fair resolution to this matter.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, I commend Senator WELLSTONE for his leadership on this issue. I rise to support the amendment that he has offered. I have been involved with Senator WELLSTONE in constructing this proposal. The proposal very simply is to try to have a time out of sorts with respect to the mergers that are occurring in the agricultural processing industries. The question at the root of all of this is, What is the value of a family farm in our country and do we care about whether this country has family farmers in its future? 
   If we do, if we care about keeping family farmers in our country's future, then we must do something about the concentration that is occurring and plugging the arteries of the free market system in the agricultural economy. Family farmers are not able to compete in a free and open system. It is just not happening. Why? Because of these mergers and concentration in the large agricultural industries. 
   Let me show you with this chart what is happening to family farmers. The family farm share of the retail cereal grains dollar has gone down, down, and way down. Why? Why is the family farm share of the food dollar going down? Because as my friend from Minnesota likes to say, the big food giants have muscled their way to the dinner table. He is absolutely correct. They are grabbing more of the food dollar. The family farmer gets less. The food processors are making substantial amounts, record dollars, and the family farmers are, unfortunately, not able to make it. 
   The farm share of the retail pork dollar is down, down, way down. The family farm share of the retail beef dollar? Exactly the same thing. 
   Why is all of this occurring? Because concentration in these industries means there are fewer firms. For example, in market concentration in meat processing, in beef, the top four firms  control 80 percent of the profits; in sheep, 73 percent; pork, 57 percent. Exactly the same is true in grain. Wet corn milling, 74 percent, the top four companies. 
   The point is, this massive concentration is plugging the arteries of the market system. There isn't competition, or at least the kind of competition that is fair competition for family farms. 
   Now, our proposal is very simple. It proposes a moratorium on certain kinds of mergers. We are talking only about the largest firms. And then during that moratorium for 18 months we have a commission review the underlying statutes that determine what is competitive and what is anticompetitive. 
   There are people here who don't care about family farmers. They say, if the market system would decide that family farms should continue, then they will continue. And if the market system is ambivalent to it, then we won't have family farmers. But that is because the view of such people matches the view of economists, which is that you can value only that which you can measure in quantitative terms. If you can attach dollars and cents to it, then it has value. If you can't, it doesn't. The fact is, family farm enterprises have value far beyond their production of corn or wheat. Family farms in my State produce much more than their crops. They also produce a community. They have a social product as well as a material product. 
   Now, this product is invisible to economists and to policy experts who only see what they can count in money, but it is crucially important to our country. We tend to view our economy as a kind of Stuff Olympics: Those who produce the most stuff win. We are a country that produces more stuff than we need in many areas but much less of what we really need in other areas. And one such thing we lack is the culture and the opportunity we get when we continue a network of family farms. Europeans call this contribution ``multifunctionality.'' That is just a fancy way of saying that an enterprise can serve us in more ways than an economist can give credit for. A small town cafe is much more to that small town than its financial statement. It is the hub of the community. It is the hub of interaction, the crossroads where people meet rather than be blips on a computer screen. The same is true with family farms. It is much more important to this country than the financial receipts would show. 
   To those who do not care much about family farms, none of this matters. To those of us who believe a network of family farms preserved for our future enhances and strengthens this country, we believe very strongly that we must take actions to give family farmers a chance to survive. 
   One of those actions--only one--is to say, let us stop this massive concentration in the giant food industries that is choking the life out of family farms. Why is it that when you buy a loaf of bread, the amount of money the farmers get from that loaf of bread is now not even the heel, it is less than the heel? 
   Why is it that anyone in the food processing industry who touches that which farmers produce--wheat, corn, soybeans, and more--makes record profits, but the farmers are going broke? 
   Why is it that a farmer who gases a tractor, plows the land, and nurtures the grain all summer, combines it and harvests it in the fall, goes to the elevator only to be told the county elevator and the grain trade have described that food as worthless. Then someone gets hold of that same grain and crisps it, shreds it, flakes it, puffs it, puts it in a box and gets it on the grocer's shelf. The grain then sells for $4 or $5 a box, and all of a sudden it has great value as puffed or shredded wheat. The processor makes record profits and family farmers are making record losses. 
   Why is that? Because this system does not stack up. It does not stack up in a manner that allows fair, free, and open competition. When you have this kind of concentration, there is not a free market. That is true in the grain processing industry, it is true in meat, and it is true as well in the other areas I have discussed. 
   Family farmers are seeing record declines in their share of the cereal dollar while everyone else who handles the grain the farmer produced is making a record profit. That is the point. 
   I am for a free, fair, and open economy and fair competition. But our economic system today is not providing that because some are choking the life out of family farmers by clogging the marketplace with unfair competition. We have antitrust laws to deal with this. They are not very effective, frankly. When Continental and Cargill can decide to marry, and are then sufficiently large to create a further anticompetitive force in this market, then there is something wrong with the underlying antitrust laws. 
   This bill is not a Cargill-Continental bill, incidentally. It is not aimed at any specific company. It is aimed rather at having a timeout on the massive orgy of mergers that is occurring at the upper level of the corporate world, $100 million or more in value, and at evaluating what is happening to the market system. 
   If we believe in the free market, we have to nurture that free market and protect it. A free market exists when you have free, fair, and open competition. 
   The last antitrust buster of any great note was Teddy Roosevelt at the start of the century saying the robber barons of oil could not continue to rob the American people. 
   My point is that if we want to keep family farms in our future, we must take bold and aggressive action to make certain that competition is fair to family farms. Today, it is not. They are losing their shirts primarily because of the unfair competition that comes from substantial concentration. 
   My point, to conclude, is we lose something very significant, much more than economists can measure, when we decide we will not care about the destruction of the network of family farms in this country. Europe has 7.5 million family farms dotting the landscape because they decided long ago that these contribute much more to their culture and economy than what the balance sheet shows in numbers. They do in this country as well. It is time we take bold action to do something about it. 
   The first step, a modest step in my judgment, proposed by the Senator from Minnesota, myself, and others is to do something about antitrust, the concentration that is clogging the free market, taking money away from family farmers and putting us in a position where the family farm in this country is devastated. 
   We can stop this. This is not rocket science. Good public policy directed in the right area will give economic help and opportunity to families who are attempting to farm in America. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we only have 20 additional minutes to debate this. There will be a vote this morning. 
   I have always had the greatest respect for my colleague from Oregon. I think he is a really excellent Senator and a good thinker. On this issue, the purpose of our being here is about competition. I don't think anyone can dispute that family farmers have been squeezed by a system in which highly concentrated industries are taking more of the profits, saying we want more of the profits and we want to give family farmers less profits. That is not a sign of good competition; it happens because these industries have the economic power to do it. 
   I taught economics briefly. Some would suggest you are not fit for other work when you have done that. But I have gone on nonetheless. Economists will argue this both ways. I understand that. But there is a commonsense aspect to this. 
   Harry Truman used to say that nobody should be President who first doesn't know about hogs. The Senator from Minnesota talked about hogs and concentration in the hog industry. Hogs are just one. Beef, grains--in every single area, industries are more and more concentrated, choking the economic life out of the little guy, out of the little producer. Why? Because they can. They want to increase their profits, increase their size, and choke the life out of family farmers. Our point is, that is not free, fair, and open competition. That is not a marketplace that is working.

   Mr. DORGAN. This little guy/big guy notion of economics reminds me of the old parable that the lion and lamb may lie down together but the lamb isn't going to get much sleep. That is also true in economics. It is certainly true in this economy. The little interests are disappearing. That is true of agriculture. Family farmers are having the life choked out of them by the concentration in industries which they have the muscle to say: We want more of our food dollar coming from that bread, and we want you to have less. That is what they are saying to family farmers.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in my concluding 30 seconds, I will say that the Jeffersonian notion of how this system ought to work is broad-based economic ownership. That is what Thomas Jefferson envisioned--broad-based economic ownership in this country which not only guarantees economic freedom but political freedom as well. 
   The point is, the concentration that is occurring is unhealthy, especially in agriculture, because it is choking the life out of family farmers. We are talking simply about a timeout here. 
   When I talked about Harry Truman's description of hogs, incidentally, that would have lost its luster had he said that nobody should become President without first knowing about green peas. He was talking about hogs because he was talking about broad-based economic ownership on America's family farms. He had it just right. That is what we are trying to get back to with this amendment.

   Mr. DORGAN. I understand the point made by the Senator from Oregon. 
   First of all, I was not here during the discussion on the floor. So I am not someone who can describe what happened during that discussion. But if the Senator from Minnesota is correct--and he may well be--that, in fact, the majority leader made representations, I think he would not want to abridge them at this point. 
   I think it is a matter of finding the record; the majority leader has always acted in good faith to honor an agreement he made on the floor. 
   Before denying the opportunity to the Senator from Minnesota, we ought to get that record and find out to what the majority leader agreed. I am certain what he agreed to then he would agree to today. If he agreed to allow a modification, the Senator from Minnesota should be allowed to pursue that modification. 
   I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have introduced a piece of legislation in the Senate with my colleagues, Senator ASHCROFT from Missouri, and Senator LEAHY from Vermont. I have written this legislation with their assistance to deal with a problem that could cause and will cause and perhaps has caused significant jeopardy to Americans, American families and others. 
   Let me describe the circumstance. There is a young girl from North Dakota named Jeanna North. Jeanna was a wonderful 11-year-old young girl from Fargo, ND, who was brutally murdered by a man named Kyle Bell. Kyle Bell had previously been sentenced to 30 years in prison for assaulting three other girls, had been convicted of violent acts, and then sentenced to life in prison for murdering this 11-year-old girl, Jeanna North, in Fargo, ND. 
   This convicted child murderer and violent offender, after being convicted and sentenced in the courts of North Dakota, was being transported to prison in another state. Apparently, folks who molest children and are convicted of crimes against children sometimes are put in prisons elsewhere because they run into problems in prison. Even in that culture they are not considered very good people, so child molesters are sent to other prisons for their own safety. This fellow named Kyle Bell, who killed young Jeanna North, was being transported to a prison in the State of Oregon. 
   This convicted child killer was being transported by a private company which was contracted by the State of North Dakota. Apparently--and I wasn't aware of this--there are transport companies that hire themselves to State and local governments to transport prisoners and criminals around the country. The private company's name was Transcor. 
   Kyle Bell was on a bus with more than a dozen other prisoners. The bus stopped in New Mexico at a gas station. One guard got out of the bus to fill the bus with some fuel, a second guard got out of the bus and went into the service station apparently to buy a hamburger or whatever one was going to buy at the food station, and two other guards fell asleep on the bus. The other guards slept on the bus. 
   Kyle Bell, a convicted child killer, in handcuffs and shackles--with one guard putting gas in the bus, the second guard buying food in the gas station, and the other two asleep in the front seat--Kyle Bell took a key he had in his shoe, took off his shackles and climbed out the ventilator, the roof of the bus. That bus then continued on its route. It wasn't for 9 hours, when the bus was already in Arizona, that the guards discovered this convicted child killer had escaped. Nine hours later they finally discovered he had escaped. Two hours after that, the guards finally notified law enforcement authorities. 
   Today this man is somewhere in this country. ``America's Most Wanted'' did a story last Saturday, the second they have done. Now over a month has gone by and this violent child killer is somewhere on the loose. 
   Why? Because a private company that is required to meet no standards at all hired itself out to haul violent criminals. If you hire yourself out to haul toxic waste interstate, I will tell you one thing: you are going to have to meet standards. If you are going to haul toxic waste, one State to another, you have to comply with reasonable standards for public safety. The same is true if you haul circus animals. The same is true if you are trucking cattle across the country. But if you truck convicted killers across the country--no standards at all. If you want to be in that business, get your cousin, your brother-in-law, maybe a couple sons, buy a minivan and you are in business. Contract with a State or local government and you can haul violent criminals through Arizona, New Mexico, North Dakota, New Hampshire, anywhere. You do not have to meet any minimum standards. There is something wrong with that. 
   Senator ASHCROFT and I and Senator LEAHY are introducing a piece of legislation saying: If you are holding yourself out to do business hauling violent criminals interstate in this country, then you must meet some reasonable minimum standards. 
   When Kyle Bell walked away from that rest stop, he was wearing civilian clothes. Apparently, he walked into a parking lot, they think, of a shopping center. But he wouldn't have been noticed as a convicted child killer because he was wearing civilian clothes. One would ask the question: if you are hauling a convicted killer across this country, why would you not have that convicted killer in an orange suit that says ``prisoner'' on it? Instead, he was sitting on that bus with a key in his shoe and civilian clothing, so when he slipped out of that bus when the guards were asleep and walked into a shopping center parking lot, apparently no one noticed. So over a month has gone by and people in this country are at risk because this convicted killer is on the loose. 
   This young girl, Jeanna North, who died, you can imagine how her folks feel. I talked to her folks last week. The aunt and uncle of Kyle Bell, this murderer, are worried as well because he has threatened his own relatives. 
   The point is this: All of this has happened because a private company decides it is going to hire itself out to haul killers around the country, but there are no standards to be met. Senator ASHCROFT and I and Senator LEAHY believe the Justice Department ought to write standards--no tougher than they themselves will follow in the Federal Bureau of Prisons or the U.S. Marshals Service. Incidentally, they do transport killers all across the country. The U.S. Marshals Service has done it for years; so has the Federal Bureau of Prisons. We believe there ought to be some minimum standards that apply to these companies. The Justice Department ought to be able to establish those standards that are no greater than the standards that will be complied with by the Federal agencies themselves. 
   Is this, this escape of Kyle Bell, some sort of strange and unusual occurrence? No, regrettably it is not. Let me give a few examples. 
   Although there are no reporting requirements for private companies that haul convicted prisoners across this country, media reports indicate that in the last 3 years alone, 21 violent convicted prisoners have escaped during transport by private companies. No  Federal Bureau of Prisons prisoners have escaped during transport--none. U.S. Marshals Service--it has been years and years since the Marshals Service has had anyone escape from their custody during transport. But private companies that are unregulated and have no requirements to meet? 
   July 24, 1999: Two men convicted of murder escaped while being transported from Tennessee to Virginia. Two guards went into a fast food restaurant to get breakfast for the convicts. When they returned, they didn't notice the convicts had freed themselves from their leg irons. While one guard returned to the restaurant, the other stood watch outside the van, but he forgot to lock the 
   door. The inmates kicked it open and fled. One was caught 45 minutes later; the other stole a car and was free for 8 hours before being apprehended. 
   July 30, 1997: Convicted rapist and kidnaper Dennis Glick escaped while being transported from Salt Lake City to Pine Bluffs, AR--again by a private company. While still in the van, Glick grabbed a gun from a guard who had fallen asleep. He took seven prisoners, a guard, and a local rancher hostage, and led 60 law enforcement officials on an all-night chase across Colorado before being recaptured the next morning. 
   November 30, 1997: Whatley Rolene was being transported from New Mexico to Massachusetts. He was able to remove his handcuffs and grab a shotgun while one guard was in a gas station and the other slept in the front seat. He later surrendered after a showdown with the Colorado State Patrol and a local sheriff's office. 
   December 4, 1987: During transport, 11 inmates escaped from a private company after overpowering a guard in the van. Among the escapees was convicted child molester Charles E. Dugger and convicted felon and former jail escapee Homer Land. Apparently, they shed their shackles by either picking their locks or using a key. The guard in the van opened the van doors to ventilate it while the other guard was inside the Burger King. The guard in the van had been on the job less than a month. 
   The man named Dugger was apprehended a short time later, but Homer Land forced his way into the home of a couple in Owatonna, MN, held them hostage for 15 hours, and forced them to drive into Minneapolis where they escaped when Land went into a store to buy cigarettes. He was later apprehended on a bus headed to Alabama. 
   August 28, 1986: A husband-and-wife team of guards showed up at an Iowa State Prison to transport six inmates, five of them convicted murderers, from Iowa to New Mexico. When the Iowa prison warden saw there were only two guards, a husband and wife, to transport six dangerous inmates, five of them convicted murderers, he responded, ``You've got to be kidding me.'' Despite his concerns, the warden released the prisoners to the custody of the guards when he was told the transport company had a contract to move these prisoners. 
   Despite explicit instructions not to stop anywhere but a county jail until reaching their destination, the guards decided to stop at a rest stop in Texas. During the stop, the inmates slipped out of their handcuffs and leg irons and overpowered the two guards. The six inmates stole the van and led police on a high-speed chase before being captured. 
   The escape was not even reported to the local police by the guards who were at fault but instead by a tourist who witnessed the incident. 
   There is clearly something wrong here. I mentioned a few of these examples. Violent prisoners are being hauled across this country, interstate transportation, without the kind of basic precautions you would expect. Again I say if you want to haul toxic waste interstate you must meet specific safety criteria. But that is not the case if you want to haul violent criminals. 
   What if you or your family were to drive up to a gas station and stop next to a minivan that is holding three convicted murderers being transported by some guy and his two sons-in-law to a prison in California? Is that something you would worry about? I would. People in this country ought to worry about that. There ought to be standards. 
   It is interesting that most of these escapes occurred when a private company stopped at a fast food place or to get fuel. Do you know what federal agencies do when they need to stop someplace? They try to only stop at a police station or jail or prison so they have decent help in making certain these folks are not going to escape during a stop. 
   None of this makes any sense. All of us know this is not the way to do business. The Kyle Bell escape is just the most recent. God forbid that this man should murder someone while he is out. God forbid someone is injured, hurt, or murdered during this person's escape. 
   This story of Kyle Bell's escape was on ``America's Most Wanted,'' last Saturday night. I don't know whether he will be apprehended, when he will be apprehended, where he might be apprehended. But this country and its law enforcement authorities should not be having to go through this. This person should be in a maximum security prison in the State of Oregon right now. That is where he was headed. He should be serving life in prison for the killing of this 11-year-old girl. Instead, he is somewhere out there in this country, a danger to the American people because we have private transport companies that are required to meet no regulations, no minimum standards. 
   The legislation I have introduced is rather simple. With my colleague from the State of Missouri, Senator ASHCROFT, and my colleague, Senator LEAHY, from Vermont, I have introduced legislation that will say the Justice Department shall establish minimum standards and minimum requirements a business must meet in order to transport violent offenders. I am only talking about violent offenders. Among those would be the requirement of certain kinds of handcuffs and shackles, the requirement for violent offenders to wear easily recognized, bright clothing identifying them as prisoners, and a range of other sensible ideas. 
   The bill does not allow the Justice Department to impose requirements on the private sector that exceed the requirements the U.S. Marshals Service or the Federal Bureau of Prisons themselves will meet as they transport prisoners. But it seems to me reasonable, and it does to my colleagues as well, that we ought to require some basic, thoughtful, commonsense standards to be met on the part of these private companies. 
   I should also say that some of the companies themselves believe this is a reasonable thing to do. Some of the transport companies themselves say there needs to be some set of standards. Because when anyone can get into this business without taking reasonable precautions, we will have convicted murderers escaping and the American public will be at risk. 
   This legislation is supported by a wide range of organizations: The National Sheriffs Association, the American Jail Association, the California Correctional Peace Officers Association, the New York Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association, the North Dakota Chiefs of Police Association, the North Dakota Fraternal Order of Police, the Victims Assistance Association in my State, the Klaas Kids Foundation in California, the Megan Nicole Kanka Foundation, and others. 
   We call this bill Jeanna's bill. It is called Jeanna's bill in the hopes that the memory of this 11-year-old girl, Jeanna North, might serve for the Congress to pass good legislation that will impose sensible, commonsense requirements on private companies transporting violent criminals so some other family will not have to go through the agony, the heartbreak, and the sheer terror that has visited the North family--first because of the murder of their daughter, then the trial of the murderer, and now the murderer's escape. 
   Let us hope Congress can pass this kind of legislation and we will not in the future be seeing stories about private companies allowing convicted killers to escape while they are being transported to their life in prison in a maximum security institution. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I must respond to the comments made by our distinguished colleague from Missouri and comments made by his colleague from Missouri yesterday, as well, with respect to the Dakota Water Resources project in North Dakota. The legislation that was being referenced is profoundly misunderstood. In fact, the Dakota Water Resources Act (S.623) reduces the authorization of the water project. It doesn't expand it; it dramatically reduces it--cutting authorized irrigation from 130,000 to 70,000 acres and deauthorizing several project features. 
   It also fully protects the interests of the State of Missouri. Nevertheless, one letter from the State of Missouri, written today and delivered to us, complains about the Dakota Water Resources project. In so doing, the letter describes a completely separate and unrelated project (the Devils Lake outlet), which has nothing to do with this at all. So there is a profound misunderstanding here about the facts and circumstances affecting two distinct projects. 
   I might say, additionally, that the Dakota Water Resources Project is not some dream somebody just had in the last day or two. My State has a Rhode Island-sized flood that has visited us permanently, forever. The Federal Government said, if you will keep a flood forever, you can move some of the water behind the dam around North Dakota for your beneficial purposes. Why did the Government want the permanent flood in North Dakota? The reason was to prevent Missouri River flooding at St. Louis and dozens of other downstream communities. 
   North Dakota said, fine. The downstream states have flood protection and a lot of the benefits. We agree with that. We support that. 
   But we have not gotten the benefits, after these many decades, that we were promised, in turn, from a multi-purpose water project. It has been pared back and back, and the legislation just discussed on the floor by my colleague from Missouri shrinks it even further. In fact, we have proposed further protection for Missouri, because one of the objections by the Senator from Missouri was that this project would use water from the Missouri River and Missouri really wants that water. He doesn't feel that the equivalent of one-tenth of a foot off the Missouri River at St. Louis should be used in North Dakota. So we have proposed there be no reduction in water going through St. Louis. We would manage the water impounded by the Garrison Dam in a way that guarantees there would be no reduction in the Missouri River water for St. Louis. 
   I make the point that the comments made by the Senator from Missouri and his colleague from the same State, in my judgment, and with great respect, profoundly misstate what we are doing. This bill shrinks the authorized project dramatically and would not produce anything like the kind of results that have been alleged. In fact, we believe this project is good for Missouri and all of the States in the Missouri Basin and in the region. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor today along with my colleague from Idaho, Senator CRAIG, to discuss objectives we have for the upcoming WTO trade summit in Seattle, WA. We want that trade summit, the initiation of a new round of trade talks, to be as productive as possible for this country and especially for this country's family farmers and ranchers. 
   In recent years, we have seen the results of our trade negotiators negotiating trade agreements in secret around the globe and developing the conditions under which we trade goods and services. Family farmers and ranchers largely have discovered they have been given short shrift and not treated very well. In fact, their remedies to attempt to confront unfair trade arrangements were taken away. They discovered that in many cases the competition they face in the marketplace for agricultural goods was unfair competition. They discovered foreign markets were still closed to them, with little promise of them being opened. 
   We decide this time that the round of trade talks that will begin with the WTO in Seattle would be different. So Senator CRAIG and I convened a caucus, the WTO Trade Caucus for Farmers and Ranchers. We called our colleagues in the House, Congressman Simpson and Congressman Pomeroy, and, with the four of us as cochairs, created an organization in Congress that has nearly 50 Senators and Congressmen, to try to establish, a set of objectives that will be helpful to family farm interests in this country for our trade ambassador and our trade negotiators to follow. 
   Mind you, we are not simply focusing on the issue of family farmers. We want our trade talks to be fruitful to our country and our economy as a whole. But we believe very strongly, representing rural States, that family farmers have been hurt by recent trade agreements and that ought not be the case. Trade arrangements and trade negotiations ought to help our producers, not hurt them. So our caucus--again, nearly 50 Senators and Congressmen strong--Republicans and Democrats working together, established a set of objectives. Those objectives we have used in meetings with the trade ambassador and with the Secretary of Agriculture and others, and many of us will in fact go to Seattle the first week of December and be present at the initiation of these trade talks, trying to press the case that this time family farmers and ranchers across this country must not be given short shrift in the trade talks. 
   I would like to go through a couple of charts that describe the seriousness of the situation we want to confront with this trade agenda. Here is a chart that shows what has happened to our trade deficit. We are beginning a new round of trade talks at a time our trade deficit is going through the roof, $25 billion in a month in trade deficits. That is very serious. That is the highest trade deficit anywhere in history, by any country, any place, any time. 
   What is happening with imports and exports? This chart shows that imports keep going up, up, and up, while exports are basically a flat line. That is, of course, what is causing our trade imbalance. 
   Just on agricultural trade alone, in the last couple of years, we have had a very healthy surplus in agricultural trade that has shrunk, and shrunk, and shrunk some more. This is a chart that spells out the difficulties family farmers now face--the rather anemic ability to export to other countries. We are not exporting as much as we used to, and there is a substantial amount of increased imports in food products from abroad. 
   Finally, let me take it from the general to the specific, to say one of the burrs under my saddle has always been the trade with Canada. It is fundamentally unfair. This chart shows what has happened with our agricultural trade balance with Canada. The United States-Canadian trade agreement and NAFTA turned a healthy trade surplus with Canada in agricultural commodities alone into a very sizable deficit. That is the wrong direction. In durum wheat, in the first 7 months of this year compared with the first 7 months of previous years, which themselves are an all-time record, you will see once again we continue a massive quantity of unfair trade coming in from Canada. 
   I simply tell my colleagues this to explain that we have serious challenges in this trade round. The caucus that we have established created some objectives on behalf of farmers and ranchers, under the heading of Fair trade for agriculture at the WTO conference: 
   Expand market access. Too many markets around the world are closed to American farmers and ranchers who want to compete. Expand access, eliminate export subsidies. Those are trade-distorting. 
   The fact is, we are barraged with export subsidies in multiples of what we are able to do. We ought to eliminate export subsidies--the Europeans, especially, are guilty of massive quantities of export subsidies. 
   Discipline state trading enterprises. These are sanctioned monopolies that would not be legal in our country. The Canadian Wheat Board, especially, engages in unfair trade. 
   Improve market access for products of new biotechnology. 
   Deny unilateral disarmament; that is, do not give up the tools to combat unfair trade; and do not give up the domestic tools to support family farmers. 
   We have a substantial list on our agenda. Rather than go through all of this, I want to yield to the Senator from Idaho in a moment, but let me also say the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Wyoming, is also involved in this caucus, as are many others, Republicans and Democrats, working together for a common purpose, and that common purpose is to say: Farmers and ranchers around this country work hard, and they do their level best. They raise livestock and grain and they do a good job. They can compete anywhere, any time, under any condition, but they cannot compete successfully when the rules of trade are unfair. 
   That, sadly, too often has been the case, and we intend this time in this WTO round to see that is no longer the case. We want these negotiations to bear fruit--bear grain, actually, now that I think about it, from my part of the country, but fruit for others. We want these negotiations to work for our family farmers and ranchers. 
   Bipartisan work in Congress does not get very much attention because there is not much controversy attached to it, but there are many instances in which we work together across the aisle. This is one. A bipartisan group of 50 Members of the House and Senate are working together for a common objective: to improve conditions in rural America as a result of the upcoming WTO round of trade talks. I am very pleased to have been working with my colleague, Senator CRAIG, from the State of Idaho. I yield to the Senator from Idaho.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from Idaho, and one of the points he made is important. A lot of people do not understand that following the conclusion of the latest round of trade talks, there remains a 50-percent tariff on average in other countries. To the extent we can get our agricultural commodities into those countries, there is a 50-percent tariff on those goods. 
   In previous speeches I talked about eating American T-bone steaks in Japan and that there is a 40.5-percent tariff on every pound of beef going into Japan. That is actually a bit lower than the average tariff that is confronting our products going elsewhere in the world. 
   I think anyone would conclude it is a failure if we had a 50-percent tariff on  an agricultural commodity coming into this country, and yet our producers confront it all across the world. In fact, those are the cases when we can get products in. There are many circumstances where we will not get products into a market at all or, if we get some products in, we cannot get sufficient quantity; is that not correct?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, further inquiring, is it not the case that exactly the same thing happened on export subsidies? The Senator from Idaho described tariffs that exist in our country versus other countries and trade talks attempting to reduce those tariffs, except they left the tariffs much higher in other countries than in our country. If you go down 10 percent, and one country has a 50-percent tariff, that means you have taken their tariff down from 50 to 45 percent. If we have a 10-percent tariff, we go from 10 to 9. That does not make any sense to me. 
   Exactly the same thing was true with respect to export subsidies. So the European countries were left with export subsidies many times in excess of anything we could possibly use. That was probably fine in the first 25 years after the Second World War because then our trade policy was really foreign policy. We were trying to help other countries out of the trouble they were in. We could beat anybody else around the world in trade with one hand tied behind our back. It didn't matter very much. We could do a lot of concessional things. 
   That is not the case anymore. The European Union is a tough, shrewd economic competitor. Japan is a tough, shrewd economic competitor. The same is true of many of our trading partners. We must begin to insist that trade policy be hard-nosed economic policy, not foreign policy. 
   I inquire of the Senator from Idaho, is it not the case that the point we are making in these trade objectives is to say, on both market access--on tariffs, on export subsidies--and other items, that we do not want to be in a circumstance anymore when, at the end of the negotiation, we have made concessions to other countries that put our producers at a significant and distinct disadvantage? 
   Is it not the case that our producers, at the end of the previous rounds, were at a distinct and dramatic disadvantage, and our objective is to make sure that does not happen again.

   Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator would yield, I think the Senator is describing, at least in one case, a barley shipment coming from the European Union to Stockton, CA. It pulled up to the dock in Stockton, CA, and was able to offload barley shipped over here from Europe at a price that was dramatically below the price that was received in this country by barley growers, at a time, incidentally, when our barley price was in the tank. 
   How could that be the case? The reason they could do it is they deeply subsidized it. In fact, they dumped it into our marketplace. When that ship showed up at the California dock, it represented legal trade. Think of that: A deeply subsidized load of grain coming into a country that is awash in its own barley, with prices in the tank, and that ship shows up, and it is perfectly legal. They can just dump it into our marketplace. They can hurt our farmers. It doesn't matter because it is legal under the previous trade agreement. 
   That describes why our farmers and ranchers in this country are so upset. They have reason to be upset. They ought to be able to expect, when our negotiator negotiates with other countries, that we get a fair deal. It is not a fair deal to say to other countries: We will compete with you, but you go ahead and subsidize; drive down the price. Dump it, if you like, and there will be no remedy for family farmers to call it unfair trade because we in our trade agreement will say it is OK. 
   It is not OK with me. It is not OK with the Senator from Idaho. It is not OK with many Republicans and Democrats who serve in Congress who insist it is time to ask that trade be fair so our producers, when they confront competition from around the world, can meet that competition in a fair and honest way. That is not what is happening today. 
   If I might make one additional point, the Senator represents a State that borders with Canada, a good neighbor of ours to the north. My State borders with Canada. I like the Canadians. I think they are great people. 
   But following the trade agreement with Canada, and then NAFTA, we began to see this flood of Canadian durum coming into this country. It went from 0 to 20 million bushels a year. Why? Do we need durum in this country? No. We produce more than we need. Why are we flooded with durum? Because Canada has the state trading enterprise called the Canadian Wheat Board, which would be illegal in this country but legal there. 
   They sell into this country at secret prices. It is perfectly legal. You can sell at secret prices. You dump and hide behind your secrecy, and no one can penetrate it. That is why our farmers are angry. It has totally collapsed the price of durum wheat. It is unfair trade. All the remedies that farmers and ranchers would use to fight this unfair trade are gone. 
   Ranchers have just gotten together in something called R-CALF. They have spent a lot of money and legal fees and so on and taken action against the Canadians. Guess what. The first couple steps now they have won. But that should not be that way. You should not have to force producers to spend a great deal of money to go hire Washington law firms to pursue these cases. 
   Trade agreements ought to be negotiated aggressively on behalf of our producers in order to require and demand fair trade. But I wanted to make the point about State trading enterprises, which must be addressed in this new WTO round, because the STEs have dramatically injured American farmers and ranchers. 
   My expectation is that Senator CRAIG has discovered exactly the same circumstance in Idaho in terms of his ranchers and farmers trying to compete against sanctioned monopolies from other countries.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been pleased to work with Senator CRAIG and others in establishing this caucus. I will be in Seattle at the trade talks, as are many of my colleagues. We are determined this time to make sure that, at the end of these trade talks, we do better than we have done before on behalf of family farmers and ranchers. 
   Will Rogers said, I guess 60 years ago, the United States of America has never lost a war and never won a conference. He surely would have observed that if he had observed the trade negotiations that have occurred with Republican and Democratic administrations over recent decades. We are determined to try to change that. That is the purpose of this caucus. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, we are here debating the question of the minimum wage: Should the minimum wage be increased? We are talking about people at the bottom of the economic ladder in this country, people who work hard, who do not ask for much. They do not have stock in the stock market. They have not, by and large, been blessed with substantial increases in income by a growing economy. In many cases, they have been losing ground. 
   I know when we talk about the minimum wage, we tend to talk about it in terms of statistics, tables and charts. I have met repeatedly over the years with people who have had difficulty, who are trying to get back into the labor market, who are working at minimum-wage jobs. I recall one such meeting in my office in Fargo, ND, with probably a half dozen young women who were struggling to get off the welfare roll and get on a payroll and earn a living, to get some training and move into the job force again. 
   All of them told me the same story of the difficulty of making ends meet on a minimum wage paycheck. They shared with me how hard it was to balance a checkbook on minimum wage--meeting the monthly bills like child care, rent, a car payment, let alone trying to find a few dollars to buy a Christmas present for the kids. 
   The story is always the same. Those stories come to you from people who are trying very hard. Most of them tell those stories with tears in their eyes. It is the case here in Congress that the halls are not full today of interest groups who are well organized, who have hired some very skilled people to lobby on their behalf for this kind of legislative change. For people at the lower end of the economic ladder, there are not halls full of well-paid lobbyists and others pushing for this change. They are largely the voiceless in our society who do not have the capability to influence legislative events quite as easily as some other very important interests in this country do. But that should not persuade anybody that this interest is not important. 
   It is very important for our country, especially in a circumstance where the economy is growing. All the signs are that our country is doing well. The stock market is doing very well. Unemployment is at a 30 year low. 
   It is important for us also to understand there are families struggling on minimum wage trying to make ends meet. The fact is, the purchasing power value of that minimum wage has diminished dramatically. It is about $2.50 below the purchasing power value in 1968. 
   None of us in this room are working for minimum wage. No one. So none of us have experienced what it is like to put in 40 or 45 hours this week and be paid minimum wage and then try to make a car payment, pay rent, buy food for the kids, and make ends meet. We cannot do that. No one in this Chamber would volunteer to do that, I expect. But there are a lot of people trying to do that because they want to pay their way. They want a decent job; they want an opportunity. They want to work. 
   That is why it is important in this circumstance for us to increase the minimum wage. Its purchasing power diminishes over time because of inflation. The value of the minimum wage has decreased for a lot of these families. Many of us know that poverty in this country is increasingly poverty of a single woman trying to raise a family. Many of us have met with those folks in our offices and elsewhere telling us the difficulties they are having. 
   In many ways, it is hopeful that both sides of the political aisle in this Chamber are talking about increasing the minimum wage. This is an important subject. We are both talking about this subject now in a serious way, and that is good. It ought to give hope to those at the bottom of the economic ladder who are trying very hard to make ends meet and have difficulty doing it on today's minimum wage. 
   There is a difference between the proposals. The minimum wage we are proposing will provide a minimum wage increase on January 1, 2000. The alternative plan will not. 
   We provide a $1 increase in the minimum wage over 2 years. The GOP plan does not. 
   We protect overtime compensation for 73 million working Americans who are entitled to it. The GOP does not. 
   We offset the full cost of the tax cuts, and there are some tax incentives and cuts in this proposal to help businesses that will confront some additional costs. We fully offset ours. The competing plan is mostly unpaid for. 
   We can go on down the list. We extend the welfare-to-work credit. The other plan does not. 
   We provide a work-site child care tax credit. The GOP plan does not. 
   We provide wage tax credits for small businesses located in the empowerment zone which, incidentally, is very important in our part of the country. These are zones, especially the empowerment zone in my State, which have as a criteria the outmigration of people. People who have left. This is not unemployment and poverty. That is one sign of economic distress. The other sign is a rural county that has lost half its population. People cannot find work, so they leave, and the county shrinks like a prune. 
   Empowerment zones create jobs and restore economic vitality and health in those areas. We include that in our proposal, but the GOP plan does not. 
   These are interesting and important differences between the two plans. I say this: At least we are on the right subject. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts has worked tirelessly on behalf of those at the bottom of the economic ladder who are struggling hard and valiantly trying to make ends meet. By proposing this minimum wage increase which, in my judgment, is long overdue, the Senator from Massachusetts does a real service. I hope at the end of this debate we will be able to adopt the Senator's amendment, 
   and I hope those who are working on minimum wage struggling to care for their families and create a future for themselves, on January 1 will be able to say: Yes, Congress did something that will help me and my family as well. 
   Madam President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor in a circumstance where I will not support the legislation that is before the Senate today. Before I describe the reasons for that, let me say I certainly admire the craftsmanship and the legislative skills of the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Maryland, the Senator from Connecticut, and so many others who have played a role in bringing this legislation to the floor. Frankly, I did not think they were going to get it done, but they did. 
   In the final hours of the Congress, they bring a piece of legislation to the floor--it is called financial services modernization. I know they feel passionately and strongly it is the right thing to do. For other reasons, I feel very strongly it is the wrong thing to do. I do not come to denigrate their work. We have a philosophical disagreement about this legislation, and I want to describe why. 
   This legislation repeals some of the major provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act named after Senator Carter Glass from Virginia, and Henry Steagall, a Congressman from Alabama, the primary authors. It will allow banks and security underwriters to affiliate with one another. It also repeals similar provisions in other banking laws to allow banks and insurance firms to marry up. It will permit many new kinds of financial services to be conducted within a financial holding company or a national bank subsidiary. 
   I want to describe why I think in many ways this effort is some legislative version of back to the future. I believe when this legislation is enacted--and it is expected it will be--we will see immediately even a greater level of concentration and merger activity in the financial services industries. 
   When there is this aggressive move toward even greater concentration--and the concentration we have seen recently ought to be alarming to all of us--but when this increased concentration occurs, we ought to ask the question: Will this be good for the consumer, or will it hurt the consumer? We know it will probably be good for those who are combining and merging. They do that because it is in their interest. But will it be in the public's interest? Will the consumer be better served by larger and larger companies? Bank mergers, in fact, last year held the top spot in the value of all mergers: More than $250 billion in bank mergers deals last year. That is $250 billion out of $1.6 trillion in merger deals. Of the banks in this country, 10 companies hold about 30 percent of all domestic deposits and are expected to hold more than 40 percent of all domestic assets should the pending bank mergers that now exist be approved. 
   After news that there was a compromise on this financial services modernization bill in the late hours, a compromise that there was going to be a bill passed by Congress, I noted the stock values of likely takeover targets jumped in some cases by more than $7 a share. That ought to tell us what is on the horizon. 
   Clearly this legislation is not concerned about the rapid rate of consolidation in our financial services industries. The conference report that is before us dropped even a minimal House bill provision that would have required an annual General Accounting Office report to Congress on market concentration in financial services over the next 5 years. Even that minimal step that was in the House bill was dropped in this conference report. 
   What does it mean if we have all this concentration and merger activity? The bigger they are, the less likely this Government can allow them to fail. That is why we have a doctrine in this country with some of our larger banks--and that ``some'' is a growing list--of something called ``too big to fail.'' A few years ago, we had only 11 banks in America that were considered by our regulators so big they would not be allowed to fail. Their failure would be catastrophic to our economy and so, therefore, they cannot fail. 
   The list of too big to fail banks has grown actually. Now it is 21 banks. There are 21 banks that are now too big to fail in this country. 
   We are also told by the Federal Reserve Board that the largest megabanks in this country, so-called LCBOs, the large complex banking organizations, 
   need customized supervision because their complexity and size have reached a scale and diversity that would threaten the stability of financial markets around the world in the event of failure. 
   Let me read something from the Federal Reserve Bank president from Richmond. This is a Fed regional bank president saying this:  
   Here's the risk: when a bank's balance sheet has been weakened by financial losses, the safety net creates adverse incentives that economists usually refer to as a ``moral hazard.'' Since the bank is insured, its depositors will not necessarily rush to withdraw deposits even if knowledge of the bank's problems begin to spread.  
   Because the bank is too big to fail.  
   In these circumstances, the bank has an incentive to pursue relatively risky loans and investments in hope that higher returns will strengthen its balance sheets and ease the difficulty. If the gamble fails, the insurance fund and ultimately taxpayers are left to absorb the losses. I am sure you remember that not very long ago, the S&L bailout bilked taxpayers for well over $100 billion.  
   Again, quoting the president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank:  
   The point I want to make in the context of bank mergers is that the failure of a large, merged banking organization could be very costly to resolve. Additionally, the existence of such organizations could exacerbate the so-called too-big-to-fail problem and the risks it prevents. Consequently, I believe the current merger wave has intensified the need for a fresh review of the safety net--specifically the breadth of the deposit insurance coverage--with an eye towards reform.  
   This bill addresses a lot of issues. But it does nothing, for example, to deal with megabanks engaged in risky derivatives trading. I do not know if many know it, but we have something like $33 trillion in value of derivatives held by U.S. commercial banks in this country. 
   Federally-insured banks in this country are trading in derivatives out of their own proprietary accounts. You could just as well put a roulette wheel in the bank lobby. That is what it is. I offered amendments on the floor of the Senate when this bill was originally here to stop bank speculation in derivatives in their own proprietary accounts and also to take a look at some sensible regulation of risky hedge funds, but those amendments were rejected. You think there is not risk here? There is dramatic risk, and it is increasing. This piece of legislation acts as if it does not exist. It ignores it. 
   A philosopher and author once said: Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. We have a piece of legislation on the floor today that I hope very much, for the sake of  not only those who vote for it and believe in it but for the American people who will eventually have to pick up the pieces--I hope this works. 
   Fusing together of the idea of banking, which requires not just safety and soundness to be successful but the perception of safety and soundness, with other inherently risky speculative activity is, in my judgment, unwise. 
   I do not usually quote William Safire. I guess I have done it a couple times on the floor of the Senate. I suppose we all look for things that are comforting to our point of view. But William Safire wrote a piece 3 days ago in the New York Times:  
   Americans are unaware that Congress and the President have just agreed to put us all at extraordinary financial and personal risk.  
   Then he talks about the risk. The risk of allowing the coupling of inherently risky enterprises with our banking system, that requires the perception of safety and soundness, I personally think is unwise. I do not denigrate those who believe otherwise. There is room for disagreement. I may be dead wrong. 
   It may be that I am hopelessly old-fashioned. But I just do not think we should ignore the lessons learned in the 1930s, when we had this galloping behavior by people who believed nothing was ever going to go wrong and you could do banking and securities and all this together--just kind of put it in a tossed salad; it would be just fine--and then we saw, of course, massive failures across this country. And people understood that we did something wrong here: We allowed the financial institutions, and especially banks in this country, to be involved in circumstances that were inherently risky. It was a dumb thing to do. 
   The result was, we created barriers saying: Let's not let that happen again. Let's never let that happen again. And those barriers are now being torn down with a bill called financial services modernization. 
   I remember a couple of circumstances that existed more recently. I was not around during the bank failures of the 1930s. I was not around for the debate that persuaded a Congress to enact Glass-Steagall and a range of other protections. But I was here when, in the early 1980s, it was decided that we should expand the opportunities for savings and loans to do certain things. And they began to broker deposits and they took off. They would take a sleepy little savings and loan in some town, and they would take off like a Roman candle. Pretty soon they would have a multibillion-dollar organization, and they would decide they would use that organization to park junk bonds in. We had a savings and loan out in California that had over 50 percent of its assets in risky junk bonds. 
   Let me describe the ultimate perversion, the hood ornament on stupidity. The U.S. Government owned nonperforming junk bonds in the Taj Mahal Casino. Let me say that again. The U.S. Government ended up owning nonperforming junk bonds in the Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City. How did that happen? The savings and loans were able to buy junk bonds. The savings and loans went belly up. The junk bonds were not performing. And the U.S. Government ended up with those junk bonds. 
   Was that a perversion? Of course it was. But it is an example of what has happened when we decide, under a term called modernization, to forget the lessons of the past, to forget there are certain things that are inherently risky, and they ought not be fused or merged with the enterprise of banking that requires the perception and, of course, the reality--but especially the perception--of safety and soundness. 
   Last year, we had a failure of a firm called LTCM, Long-Term Capital Management. It was an organization run by some of the smartest people in the world, I guess, in the area of finance. They had Nobel laureates helping run this place. They had some of the smartest people on Wall Street. They put together a lot of money. They had this hedge fund, unregulated hedge fund. They had invested more than $1 trillion in derivatives in this fund--more than $1 trillion in derivatives value. 
   Then, with all of the smartest folks around, and all this money, and an enormous amount of leverage, when it looked as if this firm was going to go belly up, just flat out broke, guess what happened. On a Sunday, Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board decided to convene a meeting of corresponding banks and others who had an interest in this, saying: You have to save Long-Term Capital Management. You have to save this hedge firm. If you don't, there will be catastrophic results in the economy. 
   The hit will be too big. 
   You have this unregulated risky activity out there in the economy, and you have one firm that has $1 trillion in derivative values and enormous risk, and, with all their brains, it doesn't work. They are going to go belly up. Who bears the burden of that? The Federal Government, the Federal Reserve Board. 
   We have the GAO doing an investigation to find out the circumstances of all that. I am very interested in this no-fault capitalism that exists with respect to Long-Term Capital Management. Who decides what kind of capitalism is no-fault capitalism? And when and how and is there a conflict of interest here? 
   The reason I raise this point is, this will be replicated again and again and again, as long as we bring bills to the floor that talk about financial services modernization and refuse to deal with the issue of thoughtful and sensible regulation of things such as hedge funds and derivatives and as long as we bring bills to the floor that say we can connect and couple, we can actually hitch up, inherently risky enterprises with the core banking issues in this country. 
   I hear about fire walls and affiliates, all these issues. I probably know less about them than some others; I admit that. But I certainly know, having studied and read a great deal about the lessons of history, there are some things that are not old-fashioned; there are some notions that represent transcendental truths. One of those, in my judgment, is that we are, with this piece of legislation, moving towards greater risk. We are almost certainly moving towards substantial new concentration and mergers in the financial services industry that are almost certainly not in the interest of consumers. And we are deliberately and certainly, with this legislation, moving towards inheriting much greater risk in our financial services industries. 
   I regret I cannot support the legislation. But let me end where I began because this is not one of those issues where I don't respect those who have a different view. I said when I started--I say as I close--there was a great deal of legislative skill exhibited on the part of those who put this together. I didn't think they were going to get this done, frankly. I wish they hadn't, but they did. That is a testament to their skill. 
   I don't know whether I am right or wrong on this issue. I believe fervently that 2 years, 5 years, 10 years from now, we will look back at this moment and say: We modernized the financial services industry because the industry did it itself and we needed to move head and draw a ring around it and provide some guidance, some rules and regulations. I also think we will, in 10 years time, look back and say: We should not have done that because we forgot the lessons of the past; those lessons represent timeless truths that were as true in the year 2000 or 2010 as they were in the year 1930 or 1935. 
   Again, I cannot vote for this legislation. My hope is that history will prove me wrong and that this will not pose the kind of difficulties and risks I fear it will for the American people. 
   One final point: With respect to the regulation of risky hedge funds, and especially the issue dealing with the value of derivatives in this country--$33 trillion, a substantial amount of it held by the 25 largest banks in this country, a substantial amount being traded in proprietary accounts of those banks--we must do something to address those issues. That kind of risk overhanging the financial institutions of this country one day, with a thud, will wake everyone up and lead them to ask the question: Why didn't we understand that we had to do something about that? How on Earth could we have thought that would continue to exist without a massive problem for the American people and for its financial system? 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, amendment No. 2402 deals with section 301 of the Trade Act. As a backdrop for this discussion, I wish to mention quickly several pieces of information. 
   First, we discuss the issue of trade with a backdrop of a trade deficit that is quite alarming. Almost everyone in this country now says a $25 billion-a-month trade deficit is unsustainable. The merchandise deficit is worse than this. But this is the trade deficit of goods and services. The trade deficit is spiking up, up, up, way up--a very difficult circumstance for this country. We must do something to address it. 
   What does this deficit result from? This chart shows imports and exports. We can see exports are a flat line, with imports spiking dramatically. 
   The section 301 trade law remedy, which I intend to discuss briefly in a moment, describes something that relates to a trade dispute we have not only with Canada but others, a state-sanctioned monopoly selling Canadian wheat. This is what has happened with respect to the shipment of Canadian durum wheat into this country. It was almost nothing and then spikes up. It came down when this country enforced a tariff rate quota against Canada. This is unfair trade by a state-sanctioned monopoly with secret prices. It is unfair to our farmers who have flat prices. We produce more than we can use or consume domestically, and we have an avalanche of Canadian grain coming into our country traded unfairly by a state trading enterprise. 
   Is this problem receding or growing? The first 6 months of this year is nearly double the first 6 months of last year. 
   Last year was a record high. This is just durum wheat, a small issue, but big in North Dakota and big for family farmers--just one issue. 
   What about a state trading enterprise or state monopoly that trades Canadian grain, or agricultural products to Australia, and decides they will have a trade relationship that doesn't play fair, for example, in Algeria? Assume that Canadians say: We will use our state trading enterprise and we intend to ship our grain to Algeria at 10 cents a bushel and take away the United States Algerian market. Is it fair trade? Is it actionable for the United States to file a 301 trade complaint? I think it ought to be. The law is unclear. 
   I propose with this amendment a simple process to clarify that section  301, a remedy in trade law, can be applied to predator pricing by state trading enterprises in third-country markets. Very simple. The law is completely unclear whether this now exists. I think it does; some people think it does not. In any event, I think it ought to. 
   If a state trading enterprise--for example in Canada, the Canadian wheat board--decides to push the United States out of a foreign market with predator pricing, is that not actionable by the United States? Of course, it should be. Our amendment clarifies that the actions, policies, and practices that are unreasonable and inequitable, that destroy market opportunities, are actionable under 301. 
   Anyone who is proud we have eliminated the fiscal policy deficit in our country--and I am among those--ought to be alarmed by this chart. Our budget policies have created a fiscal policy that is largely now in balance. We do not have growing, swollen Federal budget deficits, and that is a success; it belongs to everyone involved in public policy. However, this is a failure; this is a deficit that is running out of control. 
   The trade deficit is a very serious problem. We must remedy it. One way to remedy it is to be able to respond to unfair trading practices with remedies that work. This green book produced by the U.S. trade ambassador describes foreign trade barriers. In the bowels of this book rests the story about why our producers are unable to access foreign markets. It is a big, thick book, nearly 500 pages, country after country after country. One way to address these issues is to decide we are going to take action against those that discriminate against American producers with unfair trade practices. 
   A final point. I turn to Japan in this green book. Japan has agreed to gradually reduce tariffs on imports of beef, pork, fresh oranges, cheese, et cetera. Japan has a $50 to $60 billion trade surplus with us; we have a deficit with them, and it has gone on forever. Even after our negotiations on beef, if one buys a T-bone steak in Tokyo this afternoon, there is a 40.5-percent tariff on every single pound of beef that goes into Japan. It is unforgivable. This country cannot persuade our trade partners to trade fairly. 
   I ask we include in this piece of legislation something that strengthens section 301, that gives the United States a remedy to go after unfair trade practices. I hope the majority and minority will decide to accept this amendment and take it to conference. It is a small amendment. Nonetheless, I think it is very important to American producers--not just farmers but manufacturers, all producers. 
   I ask for some time to discuss this amendment with staff. Therefore, I ask that the amendment be set aside. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the picture I have displayed on the floor of the Senate is of an 11-year-old child named Jeanna North. Jeanna North was tragically murdered by a man named Kyle Bell. Kyle Bell was a previously convicted child molester, a violent criminal living in the neighborhood. This young girl, out on roller blades one afternoon on a quiet Fargo street, was abducted and murdered. 
   Kyle Bell was convicted of that murder. On October 13, Kyle Bell was being transported to prison and he escaped in New Mexico from a bus that was transporting him and nearly 30 other prisoners across the country. Kyle Bell, this convicted child murderer, escaped from a company called Transcorps. Transcorps is a private company. There are a number of private companies that states contract with to haul killers and criminals around the country. When you haul toxic waste around America, you have to meet certain requirements. When you haul circus animals around this country, you have to meet certain minimum requirements. But if you are a business holding yourself out to transport prisoners all around this country from State to State, there are no minimum requirements and no standards. Get yourself a minivan, hire your brother-in-law and two cousins and say you are in business and you want to haul a convicted child killer around the country. 
   The escape of this convicted child killer occurred in a circumstance where the bus transporting him, which carried over 30 people, pulled up to a service station to get gas. One of the guards apparently was fueling the vehicle, the other apparently might have been getting a hamburger at the Food Mart, and the third was asleep on the bus, and in the meanwhile this killer goes out through a hatch in the roof of the bus. Then the guards get back on the bus and for 9 hours that bus drove across the country, and they never knew this convicted killer had escaped. 
   He escaped in civilian clothes, incidentally--a convicted killer being transported across this country in civilian clothes. One would logically ask the question: If you are doing that, if you are transporting a convicted killer across State lines, why would you not have an orange prison uniform that says ``I Am A Prisoner''? Because there are no regulations, no standards. You can haul prisoners, including violent prisoners, across this country coast to coast and you do not have any standards to meet. I think that is wrong. If you are a company, a private company contracting to haul violent prisoners across this country, it seems to me you ought to meet minimum regulations, minimum standards. 
   In order to enhance public safety, I am going to propose later this week a piece of legislation that will require the Justice Department to establish standards that private companies effecting that transport must meet. When there is an interstate transport of criminals across this country, especially high-risk criminals, certain minimum conditions must be met. 
   Minimum standards on background checks for employees--is that reasonable? You bet. Minimum standards for the type of training an employee would have, who is transporting a violent criminal across State lines; restrictions on the number of hours that employees are on duty during a 24-hour period; minimum standards on the number of guards that must be present for supervising violent criminals; standards requiring that high-risk violent prisoners wear brightly colored clothing, clearly identifying them as prisoners; minimum standards on the type of restraint that is used when transporting these prisoners; and a requirement that private prison transport companies notify law enforcement officials of scheduled stops in their jurisdiction when they are hauling a cargo of violent prisoners. 
   These are standards that ought to be implemented. The murder of this young girl in Fargo, ND, by Kyle Bell is a tragedy. But it is a tragedy that is compounded by the escape of this murderer who now, this afternoon, is on the loose. God forbid he should harm or 
   kill someone else while he has escaped from custody. But this escape should  persuade us, as almost all law enforcement officials have told me, that there is a need for some reasonable standards or requirements. Even the private companies themselves have said, yes, there is a need for some basic standards. 
   I intend to introduce legislation that would allow the Justice Department to establish these standards and perhaps we will not again see an escape of a violent killer of this type. The U.S. Marshals Service also transports offenders or criminals across this country, and they have never lost a violent criminal during that transport. When private companies are contracting with States and cities to haul violent criminals, the American public ought to expect that if they pull up to a gas station someplace they are not pulling up next to a minivan that contains three or four convicted murderers who are being handled improperly, by ill-trained guards, sitting in civilian clothing, and potentially able to escape. 
   The American public should not have to accept that risk. We will not accept risks in the transport of toxic waste. We will not accept the transport, without standards, of cattle; or for that matter of circus animals. Neither should we accept the transport of convicted killers across this country without some basic minimum standard that would guarantee public safety.

   Mr. DORGAN. In response to the Senator from Nevada, when we had the debate in the Senate on the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, one of the questions we raised was about writing into the Constitution of the United States a practice of using Social Security trust funds for the purpose of balancing the budget; in other words, taking trust funds that were designated for Social Security, which came from the taxpayers' paychecks and put into a trust fund, and using them as other revenue, just as if it was any other dollar of tax revenue. We raised the question: Do you think it is appropriate to weld into the U.S. Constitution a practice as dishonest as that? These are trust funds, after all.

   Mr. DORGAN. Their answer was: We insist on doing it this way; we demand we change the U.S. Constitution by requiring that Social Security trust funds be counted as any other form of revenue for the purposes of computing our budget balance. We demand it, they said. 
   One of the meetings was in this Cloakroom, another back there, another on the floor. We said: But that is not an honest way of budgeting. If you did that in private business--if you have a company and you want to show how much profit you made last year, and in showing how much profit, you want to bring your employees' pension moneys into the bottom line and say that is the profit, if you do that, you are going to get 10 years of hard time in some prison. 
   We said: It is not appropriate to use Social Security trust funds and certainly not appropriate to lock it into the Constitution. 
   They said: We have to use them; it is the only way we can balance the budget. They said, back in the Cloakroom, to Senator CONRAD and myself: We will make a deal with you. We want to write into the Constitution that we can use the Social Security trust funds to balance the budget, just as other revenues, just take them out of the trust funds and use them as other revenues, and we will stop doing it in the year 2012.

   Mr. DORGAN. The year 2012 was not put in writing. We said that doesn't make any sense. 
   They have two stages of denial. First, we are not using Social Security, they said. Second, if we are, we will stop by 2012. 
   Then they said: If you don't buy 2012, we will actually put in this constitutional amendment that we will stop using the Social Security trust funds in 2008. And that is what they put in writing. I still have that deep in the bowels of my desk somewhere with their handwriting: We propose we stop using Social Security trust funds by 2008, but we insist on the right to do it until then. In fact, we want to put it in the Constitution of the United States.

   Mr. DORGAN. In our State and others, the majority party is running ads, and the ads are fundamentally dishonest. In political dialog, you have a right to say what you want to say even if it is fundamentally untrue. The ads in North Dakota by the Republican Party are saying the Democrats are stealing, taking Social Security trust funds, they are spending trust funds. In fact, just the opposite is the case. It is the majority party that is taking the trust funds. They demanded they be taken back in the debate on the constitutional amendment. In fact, they demanded the opportunities to take them and put it in the Constitution. 
   They are doing it and denying they are doing it and charging others. It is akin to the big bully on the schoolyard playground who blames somebody else: No, ma, those aren't my cigarettes; I was holding them for two other guys who were fighting. It is that approach.

   Mr. DORGAN. The Congressional Budget Office is an office that has historically been a nonpartisan office. It is supposed to be the scorekeeper.

   Mr. DORGAN. That is right. They said they wanted to have certain directed scoring adjustments. Let me give an example of what is a directed scoring adjustment. They were writing to the Congressional Budget Office to get comfort for what they were doing. Directed scoring adjustment is, if I went to an accountant and said: All right, I want you to certify for me what my checkbook balance is, but I direct you not to count the last 10 checks I have written in determining the balance. That is a directed adjustment. 
   Or I say: I want you to tell me whether there are any hills on the Earth, and for that purpose, will you assume that the Earth is flat. That is a directed assumption. 
   The Republicans used these directed assumptions and said to CBO: Using these directed assumptions, tell us, are we in good shape? 
   CBO: Yes, using those assumptions, you are in fine shape. Not using Social Security money, you are in good shape. 
   This is what Mr. Crippin, the head of CBO, says in response to Congressman Spratt who wrote to him:  
   As you requested, these estimates reflect the Congressional Budget Office's assumptions and methodology and exclude these directed scoring adjustments.  
   That is the little funny money put in--

   Mr. DORGAN. Right. This is an honest look. There are no games here; they haven't jimmied up the estimates on the baseline based on a request by anybody. Here is the honest look, and what they say is: Having done your 13 appropriations bills, Republicans in Congress, you have now spent $17 billion of the Social Security trust funds this year, and you will require a nearly 6-percent, across-the-board reduction in all spending--all spending--veterans' 
   health care, senior citizens, the WIC Program for infants and low-income women, the Head Start Program--you will require a nearly 6-percent, across-the-board cut in all spending in order to avoid your continued use or misspending of the Social Security surplus. 
   This is today's letter. I want to make this point: Those who are spending the money to put the dishonest ads on television this afternoon in my State ought to be ashamed of themselves. They ought to be ashamed. They know it is dishonest. This proves it is dishonest. But money in today's politics is speech. If money is speech, there are a lot of speechless people in this country, and that is regrettable. But the folks with the money can put a television ad on and say down is up, black is white, grass is purple--whatever they want to say, and they can, as they have done, ask somebody with directed scoring adjustments, tell me my bank balance if you don't count the last 10  checks; or tell me the Earth is flat if I insist the Earth is flat in the assumption. 
   They create a dishonest brand of politics in this country. Shame on those who do it.

   Mr. DORGAN. No; the Senator has stated it exactly as I said. Let me mention one additional point that relates to something about which the Democratic leader spoke. 
   One could say: Well, if you know this to be true--we know it to be true by the Congressional Budget Office today--why don't you do something about it? Why don't you bring an amendment to the floor of the Senate? 
   The point is, we can't bring an amendment to the floor of the Senate. The Senate is tied up, deliberately. We have what is called a legislative tree that has been created that would prevent those on our side from offering amendments. 
   If I might just take one additional minute. I grew up in a town of 300 people. We had an elderly widow in my town, kind of a disagreeable elderly widow. She had a huge crab apple tree in her front yard. And she was disagreeable enough to demand, although she had so many crab apples--she could have fed the whole town; they dropped on the ground--she demanded that children never pick her crab apples. So, of course, we had to wait until after dark to pick her crab apples. But she was only disagreeable with those she did not want to pick crab apples. Her friends, she would usher them in, and they would pick her crab apples. 
   I was thinking about the majority leader today and the tree. It is kind of like that disagreeable elderly woman in my hometown. He says: I want to create a tree here and decide--standing right over there on the floor--who can come in and pick the fruit from this tree. By the way, that doesn't include anybody from the Democratic side of the aisle--nobody. No one on that side of the aisle is going to pick any of my fruit. 
   Why? It is partisan. Everybody says: Well, this is all partisan with you. It is not partisan with us. It is partisan with those who want to run the Senate in a manner that says our friends are going to have full opportunity to bring their ideas to the floor of the Senate--and, after all, that is the only currency in this kind of institution: An idea, a good idea. The majority leader will say: The way I want to run the Senate is my friends have an opportunity to bring their ideas to the floor of the Senate; and we are going to have votes; but you in the minority will not, and may not, have that opportunity. 
   That is why we cannot allow that to continue. It is unforgivable to allow that to continue.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have watched with some interest in recent days the Senator from South Carolina holding forth on the floor of the Senate on trade issues. This isn't the first time. He has often come to the floor of the Senate to engage in interesting and robust debates about international trade. 
   I also noticed that the bill that is before us, the House bill dealing with African trade, the African Growth and Opportunity Act, if you read it, reads like a lot of trade deals we have dealt with. It is kind of a NAFTA for Africa approach with trade adjustment assistance, CBI, and other things added to it. 
   As I was thinking about all of this, I realized that nothing really changes very much. I guess it has been 4, 5, 6 or  7 years I have been here on the floor of the Senate talking about trade issues to no avail. The debate never changes. 
   Those who come to the floor proposing a new trade initiative will speak only about their new trade initiative. They will refuse to speak at all, or refuse to address the residue and the problems resulting from the trade bills we have recently passed, NAFTA being one, United States-Canada being another, and GATT being a third. You never hear anybody willing to tackle the problems. 
   I had a chart with me. It is lost in a pile of charts somewhere. But I wish I could show it. It shows the trade deficits. After several decades of ballooning Federal budget deficits and after getting those deficits under control, now we have another deficit. It is the trade deficit. The annual trade deficit on a chart is just spiking almost straight up. It is a devastating consequence of bad trade policy and a range of other things, but especially bad trade policy. Yes, the collapse of economies, or the difficulties of economies in Asia contribute to it, and there are some other things that contribute to it, but by and large this has been an abiding trade deficit that has been growing for a long period of time, and a chart would show a very significant spike in this deficit. 
   It is serious. Our current account balance deficit as a result of this trade deficit is going up and up, and it is unsustainable. We can't continue to do this. Yet there is no discussion on the floor by those who bring trade legislation to the floor to say, well, let's talk about what is happening; let's talk about our current experience with our trade practices. 
   It is not the case that I believe we should put a wall around our country, or we should restrict trade, or we ought to decide to in some way diminish trade. That is not the case at all. I believe, however, that after about 50 years of post-Second World War experience in trade, we ought to understand what is going on. For the first 25 years after the Second World War, our trade policy was exclusively foreign policy. They called it trade policy, but it wasn't trade policy; it was foreign policy. We used trade as a foreign policy instrument with which to help a range of other countries around the world. 
   That was fine. We could beat any country virtually on any set of circumstances and any competition with one hand tied behind our back. We were bigger, tougher, stronger, and more able to compete. And we could essentially create all kinds of approaches that would be helpful to other countries in foreign 
   policy, call it trade policy, and still win and still prevail. 
   But the second 25 years after the Second World War, things were different, especially recently. Our trading partners have become shrewd, tough, economic competitors. This is not any longer, and should not be, about foreign policy. It ought to be about trade policy, about what makes sense for our country's interests and how to engage in policies with other countries that are mutually beneficial, yes, to them and also to us. 
   As I listened to the Senator from South Carolina, I was thinking about something I told the Senate some many years ago. I had a young son who ordered an ant farm from a magazine. He is 12 now. I guess he was probably 5 years old. He saw this advertisement for an ant farm. It was a thing you ordered by mail. It was a container. It would hold sand. They sent you the container and the sand. They put the sand in the container. Then they sent you the ants separately. They said in the order to put the ants in the container. They said you should put that little vial of ants in the refrigerator for a while to slow them down a bit. 
   So my son got all of this in the mail. He put these ants in the refrigerator and slowed them down a bit. He poured them into his ant farm and then put the top on. For, I don't know, a month or two, we watched these ants in the ant farm. There must have been 100 or 200 ants in this little ant farm. You could watch them every day. They would go from one end of this little partition to the other hauling all of this sand back and forth, and back and forth, and nothing ever changed. I looked at those ants. I thought, I wonder what they are thinking, if they think; they just keep hauling this sand back and forth, and nothing ever changes. 
   I thought the Senate is similar to that, especially on trade policy. You could put a blindfold on and earmuffs on, and for 7 years nothing would change--at least it hasn't in the 7 years I have been in the Senate. Back and forth, back and forth, never a change. 
   Does anybody here have a debate about the provisions in NAFTA that lead to the terribly unfair trade in durum wheat? Did anybody ever hear of that? I have never heard of that. I have been down here and talked about it a lot. In fact, most people probably don't know much about durum wheat at all. 
   Probably many of the expert staffers working on trade have no interest in and no knowledge of durum. They have no knowledge of durum. They certainly have no knowledge of semolina flour. If they eat pasta, they are eating semolina flour and durum wheat. Eighty percent of the durum wheat in America is produced in North Dakota. Anyone working on trade issues in the Senate and eating spaghetti or lasagna might well be eating something that came from a North Dakota durum field. 
   After this country negotiated a trade agreement with Canada, we had a trade negotiator who reached an agreement with Canada and put it in writing to Members of Congress. He said in writing--Clayton Yeutter, our trade ambassador--there will not be an increase in the flow of grain back and forth across the border as a result of this agreement. That was a guarantee in writing to Members of Congress. It wasn't worth the paper on which it was written. It wasn't worth anything. The fact is, the trade agreement was enacted by Congress after it was negotiated. It was sent here and voted on by Congress and prevailed. I did not support it. 
   Immediately, we had an avalanche of Canadian durum coming across our border. That durum undercut our farmers' prices, took a couple hundred million dollars out of the pockets of our farmers in a year, and has happened time and time again. This past year was the largest amount of durum, over 20 million bushels in the first 7 months of this year; for 6 months, up over 80 percent. 
   People say it doesn't matter; that is technical; that is detail. That is fine for someone wearing a suit and tie, but try farming, raising durum, and having the price collapse and see what it does to your income and wonder whether it is important. Wonder whether you understood it and wonder whether you had a responsibility when you talk of trade the next time or talk of the trade problems you caused for the hard-working people in our country. Wonder about the trade problems you caused them by the previous trade agreements. 
   The same agreement, NAFTA, which has opened the floodgates for the grain coming in that has terribly hurt the family farmers, was advertised to Members, as the Senator from South Carolina knows, as being a trade agreement that would create several hundred thousand new jobs in our country. It didn't turn out quite that way. When NAFTA was negotiated with Canada, Mexico, and the United States, we had a trade surplus with Mexico and a small trade deficit with Canada--not so small but a trade deficit with Canada. So this Congress passes NAFTA, approves NAFTA. The trade surplus with Mexico has now been changed from a surplus to a $16 billion annual deficit just in the first 8 months of this year alone. The trade deficit with Canada has more than doubled. 
   In a study by the Economic Policy Institute, Rob Scott says NAFTA has resulted in a net loss of over 440,000 jobs in this country. 
   But the NAFTA supporters advertised that ``a lot of new jobs will be created.'' The fact is, a lot of jobs were destroyed. 
   ``It will be good for our country.'' In fact, big trade balances that were positive were turned to very large trade balances that are negative for our country. Yet the same folks continue to peddle the same merchandise on the floor of Senate. 
   Just make this trade agreement and somehow it will be better. My response is to say if we are going to talk about trade, I am perfectly willing to listen and be reasonable about all of these 
   things. I want to help Africa. I want to help the Caribbean nations. I want to reach out and do all those things. But,  I want it to be fair. I want our producers to have fair competition. I am willing to retain these, but I refuse to have people come to the Senate and say: Here is our agenda and we demand you respond to that. And we don't intend at all to address the problems we have created in the previous trade agreements. To us, they are irrelevant. We don't intend to address them. They don't matter. They don't exist, and we don't intend to talk about them. 
   The remedies that normally would have been available to fight the unfair trade have been traded away in previous trade agreements. Those who have lost their jobs and farms find little solace in those who say: ``We have a new agreement now and we don't intend to talk about the old problems.'' 
   It seems to me we ought to talk about some of the problems that exist in previous trade agreements and fix them. The quickest way for President Clinton and, for that matter, the committee chairman and the two managers of this bill, to have a thoughtful discussion about new trade initiatives is to agree to have a thoughtful discussion about the problems created by the old trade policies and begin to fix them. If we are not willing to fix some of the mistakes in previous trade agreements, we are not going to get consensus to move to new issues. I told the President the best way for him to get fast-track authority from the Congress is to show a willingness to fix the problems that have existed in NAFTA, the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement and GATT. 
   When a ship pulls up at a dock in California loaded with grain that is dumped in this country--clearly illegally--and there is no remedy to address it, our farmers say, how can grain be shipped from a European port to a dock in California and be sold for half the price of the grain that is being sold here, even after transportation is paid? How can that be? The answer is it is unfair trade and there is no remedy to deal with it and you can't stop it. 
   That is why producers in this country are saying to those who are pushing new trade agreements, help fix some of the trade problems we have. When that is done, we will listen. We will work with you. We will address some of these additional trade issues. It is not acceptable to simply ignore the misery, the suffering, and the difficulty that so many producers in this country experience because of unfair trade policies. It is not fair to ignore them. We must get our priorities straight. 
   I find it fascinating that some who have been so concerned about deficits during the years I have been in Congress are those who are the least concerned about trade deficits. Japan, $50 or $60 billion a year, every year. Want to buy a T-bone steak in Tokyo? Does anybody in this Chamber know what kind of a tariff will be imposed on a T-bone steak coming from the United States and sold in a Tokyo restaurant? Does anybody know the answer to that? I bet not. After a trade agreement with Tokyo in order to get more U.S. beef into Tokyo, we have a 50-percent tariff on all U.S. beef going into Tokyo which diminishes but snaps back if the quantity increases. Today there is a 40.5-percent tariff on every pound of American beef going into 
   Tokyo. 
   That is considered a failure in any set of circumstances in any trade negotiation. But our trade negotiators, when they reached that deal, thought they won the Olympics. They were feasting and rejoicing, breaking their arms patting each other on the back. It was a big deal. 
   It is a failure. A 40.5-percent tariff in foreign markets for our beef is a failure. After all of this posturing and genuflecting and trade talks, the average tariff confronting our products going overseas from the agricultural sector is nearly 50 percent. 
   We will have some discussions in Seattle in December with our trade negotiators. We have been talking with our trade negotiators and we hope very much for once we could win. Will Rogers once said, the United States of America has never lost a war and never won a conference. He surely must have been talking about our trade negotiators. 
   We must start standing up for the interests of American producers and American workers not in a way that prohibits competition. We can compete; our farmers can compete. They are willing to do that. But they sure are not willing to compete when the ground rules are not fair. 
   We end a negotiation with Europe on the issue of grain. Let me go back to grain because I represent a farm State. We didn't even cut European grain export subsidies that are multiples of ours. We say that is fair competition. I don't think so. In my hometown, that is not fair competition. It is the best they could get. The result is a trade agreement that is unfair, a trade agreement that hurts our producers. 
   Senator ROTH from Delaware is managing this bill. He is a Senator for whom I have a great deal of respect. 
   I have worked with him. I like him. We are friends. He comes to the floor and I am sure he believes strongly in this bill. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN, legislative giant and great thinker, comes to the floor. He believes strongly in this bill. The Senator from South Carolina believes differently. I believe differently in these issues. 
   The way to deal with them is to have amendments offered and have votes. One would think an elementary lesson in politics is that politics is a process of making choices. You make choices by voting. But we have this vineyard I described earlier that has been planted by the majority leader with a whole series of vines now. He has decided he is the gatekeeper of the vineyard. These are his vines. He will decide who comes through the gate and picks the fruit. His friends will be able to do that. ``My friends will get in, they will offer their amendments, but I will not allow any other amendment because that's a nuisance.'' 
   That is not the way to legislate. That is not an appropriate way to do business in the Senate. It is an appropriate way to do business in the House. The majority leader served there. I served there. We understand that. In the House, you have a Rules Committee, you have a 1-minute rule, you have a 5-minute rule, and everything happens by the clock. That is the way the House works. 
   When the framers of the Constitution created this Senate, they created a different body. I guess they cannot jettison the habits--they die hard--the habits of those who served in the House and who now want to control the Senate in the same manner. But the Senator from South Carolina, for example, has every right, in my judgment, to come to this floor, when this bill is before the Senate, to offer amendments and say to the Members of the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats: Here are my ideas. Here is the merit I ascribe to my ideas. Here is how I feel about them. Here is my passion. Let's have a vote about it up or down, yes or no. I am not afraid of that. 
   What we can do, it seems to me, is have a system in this Senate where we allow full, free, and open debate. Unfortunately, that does not always happen. So we have this legislative tree. 
   Earlier we had a filibuster on the motion to proceed. But we had cloture the motion to proceed. We will move on. Now we have this legislative tree which is totally unacceptable. At some point, I hope we can do this in a different manner. The best way for this Senate to act is for people with ideas to come together. 
   This week I worked with Senator BROWNBACK on a bill we introduced dealing with wireless telephones. I have been working with Senator CRAIG on a WTO trade caucus. I have been working with a range of others on the Republican side on legislation dealing with telecommunications. That is the best way to legislate: to find good ideas and work together to get them done. But that is not the way the Senate is working these days. In many ways that is regrettable because the public is not well served by this kind of parliamentary tactic we find ourselves in now. 
   I yield the floor and will listen to the Senator from South Carolina.

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I listened to the comments by my colleague from Oregon, Senator WYDEN, and he expresses, as do all Members of the Senate, our profound sadness over the death of our friend and our colleague, Senator JOHN CHAFEE from Rhode Island. 
   Senator CHAFEE was one of a kind. The 100 Members of the Senate, men and women who come from across the country, work hard and fight hard and get involved in a lot of public debate about some very controversial issues. We all have very different styles and different ways of approaching all of these issues, and JOHN's was unique. 
   Senator CHAFEE was in the Senate for a long while. He had achievements that will last forever. He was quite a remarkable Senator. He was, as the Senator from Oregon indicated, about as bipartisan a Senator as there was in this Chamber. He cared about results. He cared deeply about a wide range of public policy, including children, the environment, and so many other areas. 
   I used to visit with JOHN a lot about his grandchildren. JOHN CHAFEE's grandchildren played soccer with my children. The way to bring a gleam to Senator CHAFEE's eye was to go over to the area of the Chamber where he sat and talk about his granddaughter Tribbe and her soccer exploits. He so dearly loved those grandchildren and was so proud of them. 
   Senator CHAFEE was a war hero. He was a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School. Most important, he served this country in a very distinguished way. As proud as I have been to be able to serve in the Senate, one of the extraordinary opportunities to serve here is to be able to work with people such as the late Senator JOHN CHAFEE. I add my voice to those of so many other colleagues who come here today to say the Senate has lost truly a great Senator. I know all of us grieve with his family and loved ones and so many Americans across this country today. 
   Senator CHAFEE worked right through last week. Towards the end of last week, I asked Senator CHAFEE how he was feeling because he obviously was experiencing some difficult health challenges. But as was always the case, last week when I asked him how he was feeling he said, ``Oh, fine,'' because he was not someone ever to complain. They say hard work spotlights the character of people. Some turn up their sleeves, some turn up their nose, and some don't turn up at all. 
   When people think of Senator JOHN CHAFEE, they will always remember a unique Senator who always turned up his sleeves and said let's get to work together. The result of that is a legacy of accomplishment in the Senate in so many areas: The children's health insurance grant program; the CARE Independence Act; extending Medicare coverage to poor women, children, and disabled individuals; LIHEAP--so many areas. As the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, he was probably the leading voice in this country in crafting the Clean Air Act of 1990 which strengthened the pollution emission standards; the Safe Drinking Water Act--so many different areas of accomplishment. 
   But most of us in the Senate who had the privilege of working with him will not remember him so much for his accomplishments as we will his capacity as a human being. He was a colleague and friend. We will miss him dearly. I join with my colleagues today to say that. His daughter Georgia and son-in-law John have been dear friends for many years. I talked to his daughter today. She indicated, again, how proud she was of her father and how strongly she feels about the expression of sentiment today from Members of the Senate about her father and her father's work. We will all miss him. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today my colleague Senator BROWNBACK and I are introducing legislation that is designed to address a highly complex issue with respect the taxation of mobile telecommunications service. Although the issue is complex, the solution has a simple goal: to create a reliable and uniform method of taxation on wireless telecommunications services that works best for consumers. 
   Currently, the mobility of wireless telecommunications services makes the taxation by state and local jurisdictions a complicated and expensive task for carriers and consumers because questions arise as to whether the tax is levied in the location in which the call is placed or where the user resides. Because this situation is difficult to monitor, state and local jurisdictions the prospects of non-compliance and double taxation are also of concern. For example, a person driving between Baltimore, Maryland and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania can pass through 12 separate state and local taxing jurisdictions. In the two hours it would take someone to make that 100 mile drive, several phone calls could be made under a cloud of tax ambiguity that works for no one, not the consumer, not the carrier, and not the taxing jurisdictions. This scenario presents us with challenge to the traditional method of taxation in the face of the growing popularity of mobile communications systems. It is a case that needs to be changed. 
   The Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act is, in itself, an achievement. This legislation was developed through 3 years of dedicated, good faith negotiations between the industry and state and local government organizations. Rather than allow an unworkable situation to continue unresolved and rather than ignite a polemical political debate over a special interest solution, the industry and several state and local government organizations sat down and worked out a solution that satisfies all the stake holders. I extend my congratulations and gratitude to the leaders and staff members of the organizations that participated in the development of this consensus legislation.  
   Under this legislation, a consumer's primary place of residence would be designated as the taxing jurisdiction for the purposes of taxing roaming and other charges that are subject to state and local taxation. This legislation does not impose any new taxes nor does it change the authority of state and local governments to tax wireless services. It does, however, provide consumers with simplified billing, reduce the chances of double taxation, preserve the authority of state and local jurisdictions to tax wireless services, and reduce the costs of tax administration for carriers and governments. In the end, the consumer will benefit through this tax clarification legislation that is badly needed. 
   As many of my colleagues in the Senate know, I have been involved in many battles over the years where state and local governments have attempted to preserve their taxation authority as Congress has sought to preempt that authority on behalf of some special interest. I am very pleased to be in a position today to sponsor legislation which addresses a legitimate need to clarify and simplify state and local taxation in a manner that works for consumers, industry, and state and local governments alike. 
   I also want to express my gratitude to my colleague Senator BROWNBACK for his work on this measure. I hope that our colleagues will take note that Senator BROWNBACK and I stand together on this consensus, bipartisan legislation and join us to advance this bill expeditiously.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in a few days a small group of veterans will gather at Fort Benning, Georgia to commemorate one of the least known tragedies of World War II. 
   On Christmas Eve 1944, the Belgian troopship Leopoldville was transporting 2,235 American soldiers from the 262nd and 264th Regiments of the 66th Infantry Division across the English Channel. They were destined as reinforcements for units fighting the Battle of the Bulge. Many soldiers on board were singing Christmas carols as they watched the lights along the coast of liberated France. 
   The ship was designed to carry fewer than half the number on board, and the Belgian crew did not speak English. Reportedly, many of the American soldiers were not issued life jackets. Just five miles from its destination of Cherbourg, France, the Leopoldville was struck by torpedos from the German submarine U-486. Two and a half hours later, the ship capsized and sank. According to many survivors, the crew abandoned ship in the lifeboats and left the American soldiers to fend for themselves. Unable to free the ship's life rafts, many of the troops jumped to their deaths in the frigid heavy seas. The British destroyed HMS Brilliant saved some 500 troops. However, because it was Christmas Eve, no one else seemed to be around to help. By the next day, Christmas morning, 763 American soldiers were dead, including three sets of brothers. The dead represented 47 of the then 48 states. 
   Mr. President, seven of the victims were from my home state of North Dakota. Among them was my uncle, Pfc. Allan J. Dorgan. His body was never recovered, and neither were the bodies of 492 other soldiers who died in the incident. It was weeks before my family and the families of other victims heard the fateful knock on the door and were given the telegram that said their sons, brothers, uncles, or fathers were ``missing in action in the European Area.'' It took months more before a second telegram informed them their loved ones had been ``killed in action in the European Area.'' 
   Due to wartime censorship, the disaster was not reported to the news media. Survivors were told by the British and American governments to keep quiet about what happened. American authorities did not even acknowledge the sinking of the Leopoldville until two weeks after it went down. Later, after the war, the tragedy was considered an embarrassment and all reports were filed away as secret by the Allied governments. Some say that the American and British governments conspired to cover-up the incompetence involved in the incident. For whatever reason, details of the disaster were withheld from the public for over fifty years. Some of the victims' families never learned the truth about how their loved ones perished that night. 
   For over fifty years, the young soldiers on the Leopoldville were denied their due, and never accorded the honors and respect they deserved. Finally, a few years ago, thanks to the efforts of Leopoldville survivor Vincent Codianni, former New York City police investigator Alan Andrade who wrote a book about the incident, and the Veterans Memorial Committee of Waterbury, Connecticut, the U.S. Army agreed to provide a site for a monument to the tragedy. 
   The Leopoldville Disaster Monument was dedicated on November 7, 1997 at Fort Benning, the ``Home of the Infantry.'' On the monument, the names and hometowns of those members of the 66th Infantry Division who lost their lives on the Leopoldville and the names of those who survived the tragedy, but were later killed in action, are etched in stone. This was the first official recognition shown to any of the victims or their families. It was long overdue. 
   It is almost 55 years since the sinking of the Leopoldville. When the survivors and their families gather again this week in Georgia, they will honor their comrades who have passed away since their first reunion two years ago. I hope all my colleagues will join me in expressing our appreciation for their courage and for the ultimate sacrifice they made for freedom.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, over the past several years there has been a wave of corporate mergers and acquisitions in this country that is of historic proportions. Last year the dollar value of announced corporate combinations in the United States was more than $1.6 trillion. This exceeded the amount of all the mergers in the world the year before. 
   The big are getting bigger, the small are getting trampled, and this has large implications for the kind of economy we are going to have and--more importantly--for the kind of nation we are going to be. 
   This is apparent in rural America, where the elephants have been stomping with a special gusto. Control of the nation's food chain--from production and processing to packing and distribution--has been falling into fewer and fewer hands. Over a decade ago, the four biggest grain processing companies in the U.S. accounted for some 40 percent of the nation's flour milling. Today the figure is 62 percent. About three quarters of the wet corn milling and soybean crushing are controlled by  the four biggest firms--and about 80 percent of the beef. 
   This extraordinary concentration of economic power has large implications. It is draining the economic life out of rural America. In 1952 farmers received close to half of every retail food dollar. Today they get less than a quarter of that same dollar. From a pound loaf of white bread that costs 87 cents at the store, the wheat farmer gets less than 4 cents. Farmers are working harder than ever; but the reward for their toil is going to the corporate conglomerates, which offer farmers fewer options for marketing their products than at probably any time in this century. 
   While these corporations are showing record profits, farmers are forced to sell commodities such as wheat and pork, at Depression era prices. Thousands of farmers have gone under, and thousands more are barely hanging on. Farm auctions have become a grim feature of the rural landscape today, as has suicide. ``Everything is gone, wore out or shot, just like me,'' one Iowa farmer said in his suicide note. 
   When farmers go, our rural communities go. We lose the stable social structures, the generations of family ties, the investment in schools and churches, libraries and clinics. Independent business people, from implement dealers to insurance salesmen, go belly up. And what do we get for this human tragedy and social loss? The low prices on the farm have not shown up in corresponding decreases at the supermarket. The processors and packers are getting the money instead. 
   That's not the only source of the hardship in rural America. But it's a large one. The growing concentration of the nation's food chain into fewer corporate hands is something this Congress must address. 
   The Clinton Administration deserves credit for reviving antitrust enforcement from the dormancy of the previous administrations. But it is laboring under reduced budgets and a body of law that, as interpreted by court decisions, may not be up to the task. When the two giants of the grain trade, Continental Grain and Cargill, are permitted to merge, then one has to wonder if the hole in the screen has become so big that there's no screen left. 
   That's why I'm joining with Senator WELLSTONE in introducing legislation to impose a moratorium on large corporate mergers in the agriculture sector. The legislation would also create an independent commission to advise how to change the underlying antitrust laws and other federal laws and regulations to ensure a competitive agricultural marketplace and to protect family farmers and other family-sized producers. 
   A moratorium on large corporate agriculture mergers is needed to give Congress time to consider these important questions and craft a suitable response. If we wait it could be too late. We won't be able to advance the fortunes of family-based agriculture because there won't be much left. 
   Specifically, our bill imposes an 18-month moratorium on those large corporate mergers in the agriculture industry that would generally be required to make a ``Hart-Scott-Rodino" pre-merger filing with the Department of Justice. Such filings are triggered by a three-part test, one of which is that either of the two firms proposed for merger or acquisition have $100 million or more in net annual sales or assets. The Attorney General is granted authority to waive the application of the moratorium in ``extraordinary circumstances'' such as a merging firm's facing insolvency or similar financial distress. 
   The legislation also establishes a 12-member commission to study the nature and consequences of mergers and concentration in America's agricultural economy. The Commission members are appointed by the leaders in the Senate and House of Representatives after consultation with the Chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees. After completing its study, the Commission will submit to the President and Congress a final report that includes its findings on consolidation in agriculture and recommendations about how our antitrust laws and other federal regulations should be changed to protect family-based agriculture, the communities they comprise, and the food shoppers of the nation. 
   The family farmers of this nation are facing what could be the end game. The distortions and abuses in the agriculture marketplace have contributed to the loss of thousands of family farmers, and the grim foreboding that hangs over much of rural America. 
   This does not have to be. No harm will come from this moratorium. Agribusiness enterprises will continue to see record profits, if the market so permits. Farmers and food shoppers will not lose because the record is clear that concentration in the food sector does not benefit them. Ironically, this merger mania means less freedom and less choice--in a nation that is supposed to stand for them. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this moratorium, and antitrust review commission, and cast a vote for family-based agriculture and the health of rural America.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to make a couple comments about the conference report on Agriculture appropriations. Before I do, I would like to make a comment or two about the presentation just offered by my friend from Oklahoma. 
   The Senator from Oklahoma, as he always does, makes a strong presentation for something he believes very strongly in. I believe very strongly that he is wrong. I believe very strongly in the other side of the issue. Let me describe why just for a few moments. 
   The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty is a question presented to this country in this form: Will the United States of America assume the moral leadership that it must assume, in my judgment, to help stop the spread of nuclear weapons around the world? There are two nuclear weapons superpowers--the United States and Russia. Between us, we have roughly 30,000 nuclear weapons. Some other countries have them, and many other countries want them. There are many countries, there are rogue nations, and there are terrorist groups that want to have access to nuclear weapons. 
   The question of what kind of a future we will have in this world depends, in large part, upon the direction this country takes in assuming its responsibility to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. 
   We already decided 7 years ago, as a country, we will no longer test nuclear weapons. We made that decision unilaterally. Over 40 years ago, President Eisenhower said: We must have a Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty; we must do that. About 5 or 6 years ago, we began negotiating with other countries to develop such a treaty. Two years ago, President Clinton sent to the Senate a treaty that would provide a comprehensive nuclear test ban all around the world. 
   For 2 years, that treaty languished here without 1 day of hearings before the primary committee that it was sent to, the Foreign Relations Committee. I know there is disagreement on that, but I tell you, Senator BIDEN, who is the ranking Democrat of that committee, says there was not 1 day of hearings devoted to that treaty. 
   I understand some people want to kill it.

   Mr. DORGAN. Let me say this about the unanimous consent request. If you take a look at all the arms control treaties that have been offered to the Senate--the ABM Treaty, the START I treaty, the START II treaty, on down the line--and take a look at how many days of comprehensive hearings they had, No. 1, in the committee of jurisdiction and, No. 2, how many days they were debated on the floor of the Senate, what the Senator will discover is this treaty, that has been treated lightly, it is a serious matter--treated lightly by the fact that the majority leader said, even without comprehensive hearings, we will bring this treaty to the floor of the Senate and kill it. 
   It alone is the arms control treaty that has been treated in this manner. All other treaties were dealt with seriously with long, thoughtful, comprehensive hearings--day, after day, after day--and then a debate on the floor of the Senate--day after day--which involved the American people and public opinion; and then this country made decisions about those treaties. 
   I know there are some who have never supported an arms control treaty under any condition. They have not.

   Mr. DORGAN. Let me finish my statement. 
   They do not support arms control treaties. I respect that. I just think they are dead wrong. I have on my desk--I ask consent to show it again--a piece of a bomber. This is a piece of a Backfire bomber, a Russian bomber. Why is a Russian bomber in a circumstance where its wing was sawed off--not shot down, its wing sawed off? Because arms control agreements have reduced the number of delivery systems and nuclear weapons. 
   This part was sawed off a Russian bomber wing as part of the reduction of the threat under our arms control treaties. These treaties work. We know they work. That is why, without shooting down a bomber, I have a piece of a Russian Backfire bomber wing, just to remind us that arms control treaties work.

   Mr. DORGAN. I did not say that the United States and Russia are the only countries that have nuclear weapons. I said we have 30,000 between the two countries. Other countries have nuclear weapons as well, and many other countries aspire to have nuclear weapons. 
   The Senator from Oklahoma said something that is not the case. He said virtually every other country has weapons of mass destruction. That is not the case. The nuclear club, those countries that possess nuclear weapons, is still rather small, but the aspiration to get a hold of nuclear weapons is pretty large. A lot of countries--more than just countries, terrorist groups--want to lay their hands on nuclear weapons. What happens when they do? Then we will see significant threats to the rest of this world. 
   It is in our interest as a country to do everything we can possibly do to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Do we want Bin Laden to have a nuclear weapon? Do we want Qadhafi to have a nuclear weapon? Do we want Saddam Hussein to acquire a nuclear weapon? I don't think so. Arms control agreements and the opportunities to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons are critical. 
   How do we best do that? Many of us believe one of the best ways to do that is to pass this treaty, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. 
   We are going to have this treaty back on the floor, I think, for 3 hours today. I will make it a point to come and I will spend the entire 3 hours with the Senator from Oklahoma.

   Mr. DORGAN. This treaty was brought to the floor for 14 hours of debate. Name another arms control treaty that came to the floor with only 14 hours of debate. The Senator asks: Why didn't someone object? The burden is on us. Because the majority leader treated a serious matter lightly, the burden is on someone else. 
   The Senator from Oklahoma knows we objected the first time the Senator from Mississippi proposed it. He knows an objection was raised. The second time the Senator from Mississippi proposed it, he linked it to a time. If that is the only basis on which we had the opportunity to consider this treaty, so be it. But it is not treating a serious matter seriously, in my judgment. Name another treaty that has come to the floor of the Senate dealing with arms control, the arms control issues embodied in this treaty, trying to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, that has had this little debate and comes to the floor, despite what my colleague says, without having had 1 day of comprehensive hearings devoted to this treaty in the committee to which it was assigned? Those are the facts.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to speak about the Agriculture appropriations bill. The only reason I made these comments is, the Senator from Oklahoma was, once again, making statements. He is good at it. He feels passionately about these things. But I think, with all due respect, he is wrong on this issue. 
   This country has a responsibility to treat these issues seriously. This country has a responsibility to lead in the area of preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. We don't lead in that regard by turning down or rejecting this treaty. There was a coup in Pakistan yesterday; we are told. We don't know the dimensions or consequences of it. Pakistan is a nuclear power. Pakistan and India are two countries that don't like each other. They exploded nuclear weapons, literally under each other's chin, within the last year. Is that a serious concern to the rest of the world? It is.

   Mr. DORGAN. One thing I hate in politics is losing an argument I am not having. The Senator from Arizona cites the number of hours this treaty or that treaty was considered on the floor of the Senate. I will bring to the floor this afternoon the compendium of action by the Senate on the range of arms control treaties, START I, START II, ABM, so on. What I will show is that in the committee of jurisdiction, there were days and days and days of comprehensive hearings and the length of time those treaties were considered, in terms of number of days on the floor of the Senate, were extensive. It allows the American people to be involved in this discussion and this debate. This approach, which treats a very serious issue, in my judgment, too lightly, says, let us not hold comprehensive hearings. I remind the Senator that the request from the minority was of the majority leader to hold comprehensive hearings, allow consideration, and allow a vote on this treaty. That is not the course the majority leader chose. 
   Having said all that, I am happy to come back this afternoon. I feel passionately about this issue. We should talk about all the things the Senator from Oklahoma is raising. We haven't tested for 7 years, and we think this country is weaker because of it. I don't know how some people can sleep at night. North Korea is going to attack the Aleutian Islands with some missile. Our nuclear stockpile is unsafe, one Senator said the other day. The bombs in storage are unsafe. We have been storing nuclear weapons for over 40 years in this country. All of a sudden they are unsafe, on the eve of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.

   Mr. DORGAN. I will take 5 minutes. My friend, the Senator from Illinois, is waiting and the Senator from Mississippi, who manages the bill, has the patience of Job. I will not spend a lot of additional time. 
   I want to run through a couple charts, if I might. I want people to think through if this were their income, what their situation would be. Every one of you have a job; you have an income. If you have a business, you have some profit or an expected profit. Ask yourself what your situation would be personally if your job was to raise corn. This is what has happened to the price of corn; it has dropped dramatically. Think of what that would mean if that happened to your income. 
   What about if you are a producer out there, a family farmer raising some children and trying to operate a farm? You are raising wheat. Here is what has happened to your income. It has plummeted? 
   What if you are raising some kids and trying to operate a family farm and doing well and you are producing soybeans? This is what happened to your income. Again, a drastic reduction. 
   Do you know of any other business in which prices have fallen as much as for wheat, corn, soybeans? 
   Likewise, what if somebody said that the product you raise, a bushel of wheat, for example, as a percentage of the cereal grain dollar, was going to shrink by over half? 
   Take another example. Say you were raising hogs and not too long ago you sold a 200-pound hog and got $20 for it. Then that hog was slaughtered and the meat from that hog went to the grocery store and was sold for $350. There is something wrong with that picture. 
   Is there something wrong with the stream of income that goes to the person who actually raised that hog versus the amount of income that goes to the middle people who process it? Absolutely. 
   We could go through chart after chart, those of us who represent farm States. All of us know what the story is. The story is, our family farmers are in crisis. We have a farm bill that has an inadequate safety net. We have the collapse of grain prices in this country in an almost unprecedented way. We have the weakening Asian economy, which means fewer exports. We have concentration and monopolies in every direction, which cuts the farmer's share of the food dollar. 
   When Continental and Cargill are allowed to get married, as they just did, two big companies gathering together under one umbrella, it demonstrates that our antitrust laws don't work. Every direction the farmer looks, he finds a monopoly. Want to raise some grain and ship it on a railroad? You are held up for prices that are outrageous in order to haul it by the railroad. The same is true with virtually every other commodity such as selling wheat into a grain trade that is highly concentrated. In every set of circumstances, farmers have been injured. 
   And the result of all of these adverse circumstances coming together, especially the twin calamities of the collapse of commodity prices and weather-related crop disasters, means we have a full-scale emergency on our family farms. 
   This piece of legislation is not particularly good. I am going to vote for it, but with no great enthusiasm. I was one of the conferees. The conference met for a brief period of time. Senator DURBIN was a conferee, as well, and he will recall we met for a period of time, and one of the things we pushed for was to stop using food as a weapon. No more food embargoes. Guess what. That was our strong Senate position, but it is not in this report. 
   This report doesn't end the embargoes on food or end using food as a weapon. This report doesn't do that because the conference dumped it. We didn't do it because we were part of the conference, but the conference didn't meet. It adjourned in a pique and never got back together. We are told the Senate majority leader and the Speaker of the House cobbled together this bill, with some technical help. When we saw it again, it said we want to continue to use food as a weapon and keep embargoes on various countries around the world. 
   I am not happy with this bill. Let's provide income support to farmers, it says, after we pushed for that. But it says do it with something called AMTA payments. We are going to have people getting emergency payments who didn't lose any money because of collapsed prices; they weren't even farming. In fact, the payment limits have gone up. So it is conceivable that some landowners are going to get $460,000 without putting a hand to the plow. That is the new payment limit. Can you imagine telling a taxpayer in a city someplace that we want to help farmers in trouble, and they ask which farmers? Well, somebody is going to get a $460,000 payment whether or not they are actually farming. That is not helping America's family farmers. So there is a lot wrong with the payments provided by this bill. 
   Similarly, the disaster aid is only $1.2 billion and contains no specific line item for flooded lands. We know that amount shortchanges all the known needs. We know that is not going to cover the drought of the Northeast, the flooding from Hurricane Floyd and the prevented planting in the Upper Midwest--all of the disasters that need to be addressed across this country. But the combination of things in this legislation has put us in a position of asking if we are going to provide some help or no help. 
   We are in a situation where we have to say yes, we will vote for this package, but without great enthusiasm. This was done the wrong way. Most of us know that. We should have helped farmers who lost income because of collapsed prices and weather disasters, the people who really produce a crop. We ought not to have a $460,000 upper payment limit, and we ought not to have dropped the provision that says we are going to end embargoes on food and medicine forever. It was wrong to drop that. We know that. 
   I will have to vote for this conference report, without enthusiasm, because there is an emergency and a crisis, and some farmers will not be around if we don't extend a helping hand now. Never again should we do it this way. This is the wrong way to do it. It is not the right way to respond to the emergency that exists in farm country. 
   My friend, the Senator from Illinois, wants to speak. I thank him for his patience. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think there was a misunderstanding regarding the previous unanimous consent request. 
   My understanding is the Senator from South Dakota asked unanimous consent that the presentation by Senator BYRD and the discussion between Senator BYRD and the majority leader not come out of the allocated time. I think each side had 54 minutes remaining. The Chair indicated Senator BYRD spoke twice. Senator BYRD was recognized once and did not relinquish the floor. I am not suggesting there was anything deliberate, but I think there was a misunderstanding with respect to the time that should exist. I think this side should have had 54 minutes based on the unanimous consent request made by the Senator from South Dakota.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, who will acquire nuclear weapons in the months and years ahead? Which countries? Which groups? Which individuals, perhaps, will acquire nuclear weapons? Many would like to acquire nuclear weapons. Terrorist groups would like access to nuclear weapons. Rogue countries would like access to nuclear weapons. 
   The cold war is over, the Soviet Union is gone, the Ukraine is nuclear free; the two nuclear superpowers are Russia and the United States. Between us, we have 30,000 nuclear weapons. What responsibility do we have as a country to try to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries and to reduce the nuclear weapons that now exist? Well, we have a lot of responsibility. It is our requirement as a country to exercise the moral leadership in the world, to reduce the dangers of nuclear war, and stop the spread of nuclear weapons. 
   Some have never supported any arms control agreements. I respect that. They have a right to do that. I don't agree with it. I think it is wrong. Nonetheless, there are those who have never supported any arms control agreements. Yet, arms control agreements work. We know they work. 
   I ask unanimous consent to show a piece of a Russian Backfire bomber wing on the floor of the Senate.

   Mr. DORGAN. This is a piece of a wing sawed off of a Russian Backfire bomber. This bomber wasn't brought down from the skies with hostile fire. This bomber wasn't destroyed because of conflict. This piece of wing came from a Russian bomber because this country and the Russians have an agreement to reduce the number of bombers, missiles, and submarines in our arsenal, and reduce the number of nuclear warheads. 
   This other item is copper wiring, ground up from a Russian submarine that used to carry missiles with nuclear warheads aimed at the United States of America. Did we sink that submarine in hostile waters? No, it was destroyed and the wiring ground up by the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, under which the United States assists in the destruction of bombers, missiles, and warheads in Russia. We bring down the number of weapons in our stockpile; they bring down the weapons in theirs. The delivery systems are brought down as well. 
   Does arms control work? Of course, it works. We know it works. That is why I am able to hold the part of a Russian bomber here in the U.S. Senate. Of course, it works. There are some who have never supported any of this. They have that right. But, in my judgment, the decision not to support aggressive arms control efforts is inappropriate and wrong. 
   Now we are debating the issue of whether we will have a Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty--something that was aspired to by President Eisenhower nearly 40 years ago. A Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty was something that President Eisenhower lamented he was not able to accomplish. Forty years later--after years of negotiation--2 years ago, it was sent to the Senate, signed by the President, and asked to be ratified in the Senate. It was sent to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I know there have been debates about it, but there was not one hearing in that Foreign Relations Committee in 2 years on the CTBT. And then, with 10 days' notice, it is brought to the floor of the Senate for a vote. Some say, well, that is fine. That is a consideration. That is not thoughtful consideration; that is a thoughtless way to handle this issue. 
   This is a serious issue, a big issue, an issue with great consequence. Ten days, no comprehensive hearings--that is a thoughtless way to handle this issue. India and Pakistan have detonated nuclear weapons literally under each other's chin. They don't like each other. That is an ominous development for the world. The question of whether it could result in a nuclear exchange or a nuclear war is a very real question. Can we as a country intervene to say, do not explode these nuclear weapons, do not test nuclear weapons? Do we have the ability to say to India and Pakistan that this is a dangerous step? 
   Mr. President, we had better have that resolve. That resolve must come from us. 
   I have heard a lot of reasons on the Senate floor why this should not be ratified all from the same folks who have never supported ratification of any treaty that would lead in the direction of arms control. All of the arguments I have heard, in my judgment, are not relevant to this treaty. It is proposed that somehow this treaty would weaken our country. 
   Here is what would happen when this treaty is ratified. The number of monitoring stations across the world will go to well over 300. We will substantially enhance our capability to monitor whether anyone explodes a nuclear weapon. 
   Here is what we have now. Here is what they will have if the CTBT enters into force. 
   How on Earth can anyone credibly argue that this doesn't strengthen our ability to detect nuclear explosions anywhere on the Earth? It is an absurd argument to suggest that somehow ratifying this treaty will weaken our country. 
   The last four Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, all the senior military leadership now serving in this country, including Gen. Colin Powell, and previously retired Joint Chiefs of Staff support this treaty. Would they do so because they want to weaken this country? Of course not. They support this treaty because they know and we know this treaty will strengthen this country. It will strengthen our resolve to try to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. The Joint Chiefs of Staff say in a very real sense that one of the best ways to protect our troops and our interests is to promote arms control, in both the conventional and nuclear realms, arms control can reduce the chances of conflict.  
   Gen. Omar Bradley said, ``We wage war like physical giants and seek peace like ethical infants.'' 
   There is not nearly the appetite that, in my judgment, must exist in this country--and especially in this Senate--to stand up for important significant issues--serious issues. That is what we have here. 
   The military leaders say this treaty is in this country's security interest. The scientists, 32 Nobel laureates, the chemists, physicists, support ratification. Dr. Garwin, who I was out on the steps of the Capitol with last week, who worked on the first nuclear bomb in this country, says this treaty is in this country's interest. We can safeguard this country's nuclear stockpile, the scientists say; we can do that, they say. And the detractors say, no, you can't. These detractors--let me talk for a minute about this. 
   National missile defense: They say: Let's deploy a national missile defense system right this minute. The Pentagon and the scientists say we can't, we don't have the capability. Our friends say: No. We don't agree with you. You can and you have the capability. They say: We demand you do it, and we want you to deploy it. 
   On the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, the detractors say: Well, it would weaken this country because we can't detect nuclear tests and we can't maintain our stockpile. And the military leaders and the scientists say: You are wrong. We can safeguard our stockpiles. We can detect nuclear explosions. 
   This selective choosing of when you are willing to support the judgment of the best scientists in this country or the military leaders of this country is very interesting. 
   Last week, Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac, and Gerhard Schroeder, the leaders of England, France, and Germany, sent an op-ed piece to the New York Times asking this country to ratify this treaty. That ought not be the position this country is in. This country ought to be a leader on this issue. Now, we are being asked by our allies to please lead. We ought not have to be asked to provide leadership to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. What are we thinking of? 
   Last week, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee referenced comments from the Governor of my State on the floor of the Senate, saying he is worried that the nuclear stockpile is not safe and pointing out that we have nuclear weapons in our State. 
   It is an interesting and brand new argument that I hear. I have not heard anyone stand on the floor of the Senate in recent months saying we have a real problem with the safety of the nuclear stockpile. This is just a straw man. That is what this is. 
   I know the majority leader thought it was probably an interesting strategy to bring up the treaty without comprehensive hearings, without comprehensive discussions and debate, and without much of an opportunity for the American people to be involved in the debate on a Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, and then say we want to vote on it. We are going to kill this thing. 
   You know those who think that way I guess can grin all the way to the vote tally. But there won't be smiles on the faces of those around the world who rely on this country to be a leader in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. This country has a greater responsibility in this area, and we can exercise that responsibility by voting to ratify this Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are going to be voting on the cloture motion on the Agriculture appropriations conference report. I come without  great enthusiasm for this bill, although I admit there is much in this bill that is important and necessary. The process by which this conference report comes to the Senate is a horribly flawed process. 
   We face a very serious farm crisis. Part of this legislation deals with that crisis. This appropriations bill deals with the routine appropriations that we provide each year for a range of important things that we do in food safety and a whole range of issues at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and elsewhere dealing with agricultural research and more. But it also deals with what is called the emergency piece in the Agriculture appropriations bill to respond to the emergency in farm country these days. 
   We have seen prices collapse. We have seen flooding in North Dakota of 3 million acres that could not be planted this spring. We have seen some of the worst crop disease in a century. We have seen substantial problems with the import of grain coming into this country that has been traded unfairly. We have seen the shrinking of the export market with financial problems in Asia. The result has been a buffeting of family farmers in a very tragic way, many of whom are hanging on by their fingertips wondering whether they will be able to continue farming. 
   We attempted to include some emergency provisions in this piece of legislation. This legislation does, in fact, contain emergency help for family farmers. I wish it contained that help in a different manner than it does. It contains it in a payout called the AMTA payment. This bill will actually double the AMTA payment. 
   The problem with that is there will be a fair number of people across the country who will receive payments who are not even farming, are not even producing anything, yet they are going to get a payment. There will be people in this country who will get payments of up to $460,000. I expect taxpayers are going to be a little miffed about that. So $460,000 to help somebody? That is a crisis? That is not a family farm where I live. Taking the limits off, and allowing that kind of payment to go out, in my judgment, is a step backward. 
   Most important, the Senate passed, by 70 votes, a provision that says: Let us stop using food as a weapon. Let us no longer use food and medicine as part of the embargoes that we apply to those countries and governments around the world that we think are behaving badly. By 70 votes, this Senate said: Let us stop using food as a weapon. Let us not use food and medicine as part of an embargo. This conference report does not include that provision because it was dropped. That is a step backward, in my judgment. We ought to have adopted the Senate provision that says: Let us not use food as a weapon. Let us stop using food as part of an embargo. 
   There was no conference. It started. It went on for a couple of hours. The Senator from Mississippi, Mr. COCHRAN, who chaired it on our side, did the right thing. He opened it up for amendments. We had an amendment, had a vote, and the vote did not turn out right for some other folks in the conference, so they decided to adjourn. That was it. Never heard from them again. Then the leadership decided to put together this bill, and they coupled together a conference report. And so here it rests now for our consideration. I am not enthusiastic about it. 
   But having said that, I likely will support it because farmers need emergency help, and they need it now. I do want to say that as harsh as I was about this process--and it was an awful process--I made it clear some weeks ago, when I talked about this, that Senator COCHRAN from Mississippi was not part of the reason this process did not work. On our side, he chaired the conference. And he did, I think, what should have been done. He opened it up for discussion, the offering of amendments, and to hold votes. That is exactly the way conferences should work. I applaud the Senator from Mississippi. As always, even under difficult circumstances, he is someone with whom I enjoy working and someone for whom I have great respect. 
   But in this circumstance, we must pass some emergency help for farmers. This bill contains some of that emergency help. It fails to contain other things that I think are very important. It seems to me, all in all, on balance, this legislation will probably proceed forward; the President will sign it; we will get some help out to family farmers; and come back again and see if we can provide some additional assistance when prices collapse and when that assistance is necessary. 
   It is especially the case we will need additional disaster help. I do not think the $1.2 billion will do the job that is necessary all around the country to respond to disasters. Senator CONRAD has described on the floor, as have I, the 3 million acres that did not get planted this spring because of flooding. Those producers need help. To be a farmer and not to be able to farm, having all of your land under water, that is what I call a disaster. The amount of money in this bill is not enough to deal with all of these issues all around the country, so I think we are going to have to come back and add to that and try to provide the resources that are necessary. 
   But again, let me yield the floor because I know others would like to speak. I say to my colleague from Mississippi, I appreciate the fair manner in which he proceeded. 
   Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I hope the Senator would not put forth any unanimous-consent request. I hope we would simply have an agreement among the two leaders in the Chamber that they will alternate back and forth. The difficulty with a unanimous-consent agreement is you may get a circumstance where you have no one on one side and three or four speakers on the other side. 
   I think it is practical to manage it the way the Senator has suggested.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, for all the anxiety that is expressed in this Chamber about when we might vote and the consequences of that vote, I at least observe that we are finally on the right subject. This is an important issue. This is an important matter for the Senate to consider. There are big issues and then there are small issues. There are important issues and some not so important. Stopping the spread of nuclear weapons, in my judgment, is a big, important issue. 
   Will the United States of America be a leader, will it assume its moral responsibility in the world to provide leadership to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and reduce the risk of nuclear war? That is the question before the Senate. 
   Sadly, some in this Chamber answer that question by saying: No, not us, not now. In fact, some, if you look at their record on arms control agreements say: Not us, never. 
   This treaty is not so difficult to understand, despite the protestations of some. 
   Forty years ago, President Eisenhower called for a treaty of this type. Seven years ago, the United States decided we would unilaterally stop the testing of nuclear weapons. Nearly 5 years ago, our country was a leader in convening nations to negotiate a comprehensive test ban treaty. Two years ago, that Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was sent to the Senate for ratification. Not 1 day of hearings was held in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2 years--not 1. 
   Then abruptly, 10 days ago, we were told there would be 14 hours of debate and 10 days hence we would have a vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   That was not and is not a thoughtful way for the Senate to deal with this issue, especially an issue of this importance. 
   Now to the debate. Mark Twain once said when asked if he would participate in a debate: Absolutely, provided I can take the negative side. 
   They said: We have not told you what the debate is about. 
   He said: It doesn't matter, you don't need time to prepare for the negative side. 
   I will not ascribe those motives to those who are strongly in opposition to this treaty, but some of the charges and allegations made just seem, to me, to be preposterous. I heard an hour or so ago in this Chamber the term ``unilateral disarmament'' applied to the U.S. ratifying this treaty. What a preposterous charge, unilateral disarmament. 
   Let's look at who supports this treaty. I heard a discussion about Gen. Colin Powell. Gen. Colin Powell supports this treaty. He said so. We have the date, the time, the place, the statement. He now, apparently, in a telephone call he said he would like to defer the vote because of questions raised in hearings, hearings that were 2 years in the making. Gen. Colin Powell, General Shalikashvili, the last four Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Shelton, the present Chairman and the Secretary of Defense--all of whom say they support this treaty. Why? Because they believe this treaty protects this country's security interests. They believe this treaty is in this country's interest. 
   I will read some statements because those who come to the floor talking about the military consequences of this treaty need to understand to what all the senior military leaders in this country now testify. 
   The Joint Chiefs, the senior military leaders in this country, say:  
   In a very real sense, one of the best ways to protect our troops and our interests is to promote arms control. ..... In both the conventional and nuclear realms, arms control can reduce the chances of conflict. ..... Our efforts to reduce the number of nuclear weapons coincide with the efforts to control testing of nuclear weapons. ..... The Joint Chiefs support the ratification of this treaty.  
   Colin Powell and others in January 1998 said:  
   We support Senate approval of the CTBT.  
   Gen. Colin Powell supports the ratification of this treaty. We are told he wants the vote delayed. So that does not change the fact that he is on record saying he supports the ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   What about monitoring? We hear all this noise about if we ratify this treaty, countries will cheat. 
   Our military leaders--and certainly the scientists--but especially our military leaders say that if we ratify this treaty, we will have monitors all around the world. 
   I show the situation on these charts: Here are the monitors without ratification; here are the monitors with ratification. The number of monitors is dramatically enhanced. The ability to detect nuclear tests, detect cheating will be dramatically enhanced. No one that I know of can credibly or thoughtfully argue that we are not enhancing our capability in this country by ratifying this treaty. 
   What about the scientists? Thirty-two Nobel laureates in physics and chemistry, the most powerful intellects in this country were at the White House a couple of days ago. One who testified yesterday worked on developing the first nuclear bomb; one who testified the day before invented radar and then invented the laser--what do these scientists tell us about this treaty? They say: Ratify this treaty. This treaty is in the country's best interest. 
   Scientifically, they tell us that we can safeguard our nuclear stockpile; we can more effectively monitor tests around the world. They say, without equivocation: Ratify this treaty. That is from scientists. 
   What about the American people? Surveys show 80 percent of the American people say: Ratify this. 
   It is interesting to me, military leaders do not count; scientists do not count; the American people do not count. There is this cold war mentality, I guess, that nothing has changed. Some who have never supported an arms control agreement are back here again today saying this will not work either. 
   Other arms control agreements have worked, and we know it. We have seen  the destruction of nuclear weapons by sawing wings off bombers, by destroying missiles and warheads, and not by hostility but by arms control agreements that call for reducing the numbers of nuclear weapons. That has happened. These arms control agreements have been successful. This treaty will be successful if this Senate will ratify it. 
   The support of military leaders and scientists--and, for that matter, the American people--seems to matter little in this Chamber. The scientific opinion of the most respected scientists in the world are second-guessed by those who believe they can understand this issue in a matter of a day or two. 
   Thirty-two Nobel Prize winners, two seismology organizations, three current weapons lab Directors, the Secretary of Energy, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretary of Defense all have a common position on this country's ability to solve the scientific and technical tasks required in this test ban treaty; and all of them say that this treaty is in the country's interests. 
   The spread of nuclear weapons, that is what all this is about--stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. India and Pakistan detonated nuclear weapons not too long ago under each other's chin. These are two countries that do not like each other. Ought that not send some fear all around the world about the proliferation of nuclear weapons? 
   Or maybe some do not understand nuclear weapons. They think that they are just bombs. There is an Indian author named Arundahti Roy who is one of the most acclaimed young authors in the world right now. She writes about a nuclear attack and nuclear weapons. Let me read some of this for a moment. She talks about the sentiments of survivors of a nuclear attack:  
   What shall we do then, those of us who are still alive? Burned and blind and bald and ill, carrying the cancerous carcasses of our children in our arms, where shall we go? What shall we eat? What shall we drink? What shall we breathe? 
   ..... There's nothing new or original left to be said about nuclear weapons. ..... (But) under the circumstances, silence would be indefensible. Let's not forget that the stakes we're playing for are huge. Our fatigue and our shame could mean the end of us.  
   We have a responsibility as a country. Those who raise arguments I have heard today--I wonder how can they sleep at night, if they believe our nuclear weapons are unsafe. 
   A physicist yesterday said: We have had them for 40 and 50 years. We know how they work. We know how to safeguard them. We know how to keep them over time. Yet we have people on the floor of the Senate talking about the fact that the stockpile may not be safe. 
   One of my colleagues said: Drop some of them on your State. You think they'd work? Of course they would. You would not, in a million years, guess about whether it would detonate on your State if a nuclear weapon were aimed at your State. We know our stockpile works and is maintained at great cost. 
   Cannot monitor? Nonsense. That does not even deserve much of a response. Everybody says our monitoring will be enhanced. 
   Unilateral disarmament? Rubbish. There is nothing here that suggests that. This country already decided we were not going to test 7 years ago. 
   The question now is, Will we give others a green light to test? We decide that we won't test, but we will refuse to ratify a treaty that says to others: We don't want you to test either. 
   It is a curious set of circumstances by which this comes to the floor. 
   Every other arms control issue has been dealt with seriously. 
   The ABM Treaty: 8 days of Foreign Relations Committee hearings, and 18 days of Senate debate on the floor of the Senate. 
   The Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1988: 23 days of committee hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee; 2 days of Senate floor consideration.

   Mr. DORGAN. I am concerned about the funding level in the Senate bill for vocational education. While the Senate bill generally increases our investment in education, unfortunately funding for vocational education basic state grants would remain at the President's request of $1,030,650,000. 
   Funding for vocational education basic state grants has been virtually frozen over the last several years by both the Congress and the President. Consequently funding for vocational, career, and technical programs has not kept pace either with inflation or with funding for other education programs. In fact, if vocational education funding had simply kept pace with inflation over the last eight years, it would be $220 million greater than is being proposed for FY2000. I would suggest an additional $100 million in funding for basic state grants, which represents about a 10 percent increase, but realistically, I believe $50 million would represent a reasonable step in the correct direction.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if a lot of this debate isn't about some here running for cover on the Social Security issue. 
   Isn't it the case that several years ago, we had a very substantial debate about amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget? Isn't it true the author of the previous amendment and others were demanding on the floor of the Senate that we write into the Constitution the proposition that Social Security revenues ought to be able to be used to pay for other programs in order to claim a balanced budget? Isn't that the case? 
   If that is the case, how do they come to us now and say we don't want to use Social Security moneys for the operating budget when, in fact, they wanted to put it in the Constitution 3 years ago?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I attended an event in the White House at which 31 nobel laureates, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, four previous chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense, and the President, among many others, supported the ratification by the Senate of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
   The point was made in those presentations that this treaty is not about politics. It is not about political parties. It is about the issue of the proliferation or spread of nuclear weapons and whether the United States of America should ratify a treaty signed by the President and sent to the Senate over 700 days ago that calls for a ban on all further testing of nuclear weapons all around the world. 
   For some months, I have been coming to the floor of the Senate suggesting that after nearly 2 years we ought to be debating the question of whether this country should ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
   I have exhibited charts that have shown the Senate what has happened with respect to other treaties that have been sent to the Senate by various Presidents, how long it has taken for them to be considered, the conditions under which they were considered, and I have made the point that this treaty alone has languished for over 2 years without hearings and without discussion. 
   Why? Because there are some in the Senate who oppose it and don't want it to be debated or voted upon. 
   There are small issues and big issues in the course of events in the Senate. We spent many hours over a period of days debating whether to change the name of Washington's National Airport. What a debate that was--whether to change the name of Washington National Airport. That was a small issue. It was proposed that former President Reagan's name be put on that airport. Some agreed, some disagreed. We had a vote, after a debate over a number of days. The naming of an airport, in my judgment, is a small issue. 
   An example of a big issue is whether we are going to do something as a country to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Now a big issue comes to the floor of the Senate in the form of a request for ratification of a treaty called the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It is not a new idea, not a new issue. It started with President Dwight Eisenhower believing we ought to exhibit the leadership to see if we could stop all the testing of nuclear weapons around the rest of the world. It has taken over 40 years. Actually, 7 years ago this country took unilateral action and said: We are going to stop testing. We, the United States, will no longer test nuclear weapons. So we took the lead, and we decided 7 years ago we would not any longer test nuclear weapons. 
   The treaty that is now before the Senate, that was negotiated with many other countries around the world in the last 5 years and sent to the Senate over 2 years ago, is a treaty that answers the question: Will other countries do what we have done? Will we be able to persuade other countries to decide not to test nuclear weapons? 
   Why is that important? Because no country that has nuclear weapons can acquire more advanced weaponry without testing. And no country that does not now have nuclear weapons can acquire nuclear weapons with any assurance they have nuclear weapons that work without testing. Prohibit testing, stop the testing of nuclear weapons, and you take a step in the direction of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons around this world. 
   We have some 30,000 nuclear weapons in the arsenals of Russia and the United States. We have other countries that possess nuclear weapons. We have still other countries that want to possess nuclear weapons. We have a world that is a dangerous world with respect to the potential spread of nuclear weapons. The question is, what shall we do about that? What kind of behavior, what kind of response in this country, is appropriate to deal with that question? 
   Some say the response is to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I believe that. I believe that very strongly. Others say this treaty will weaken our country, that this treaty is not good for our country, this treaty will sacrifice our security. Nothing could be further from the truth. Nothing. Some say that--not all--have never supported any arms control agreements, never liked them. I understand that, despite the fact those people have been wrong. 
   Arms control agreements have worked. Actually, agreements that we have reached through the ratification of treaties have resulted in the reduction of nuclear warheads, the reduction of delivery vehicles. Some arms control treaties have worked. However, there are some who have not supported any of those treaties. I guess they are content to believe it is their job to oppose treaties. There are others who have supported 
   previous treaties who somehow believe this treaty is inappropriate. Perhaps they read a newspaper article last week that said there are new appraisals or new assessments by the CIA that suggest it would be difficult for us to monitor low-level nuclear tests. That article was wrong. The article in the newspaper that said the CIA has a new assessment or a new report is wrong. The CIA has no new assessment. The CIA has no new reports. I have talked to the Director of the CIA. No such report and no such assessment exists. 
   Do we have difficulty detecting low-level nuclear explosions, very low-level nuclear explosions? The answer is yes. But then, the answer is also: Yes; so what? Will the ability to detect those kinds of small explosions--explosions which, by the way, don't give anyone any enhanced capability in nuclear power or nuclear weaponry--will we be able to better detect those and better monitor those if we pass this Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty? The answer to that is an unqualified yes. 
   I have a chart to demonstrate what I mean. This chart shows the current monitoring network by which we attempt to monitor where nuclear tests may have occurred in the world. This bottom chart shows current monitoring. The top chart shows monitoring  that will occur after we have a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in place. Is there anyone who can argue that having this enhanced monitoring in place will not enhance our capability of detecting nuclear weapons tests? Of course it will. That is why every senior military officer in this country who has been involved in this--from the Joint Chiefs to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs to the other senior officers--have said passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is good for this country and will not jeopardize this country's security. They know and we know it will enhance this country's ability to detect nuclear tests anywhere around the world. 
   It baffles me that on an issue this big and this important, we have people who seem to not want to understand and debate the facts. I mentioned I have been on the floor for some months pushing for consideration of this treaty. Probably partly as a result of that, probably partly as a result of a letter that all 45 Members of the Democratic caucus sent to the majority leader saying we think the Senate ought to consider this treaty, we ought to have hearings, about a week ago the majority leader abruptly decided, all right, we will consider this Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; we will consider it by having a vote in a matter of 10 days or so. 
   We had held no hearings. This has not been a thoughtful process of consideration. We have not held comprehensive hearings; we have sparked no national debate. We will just go to a vote--as far as I am concerned, that is not a very responsible thing to do, but I won't object to that--go to a vote if that is what you want to do. 
   It is very interesting how those in this Chamber treat the light seriously and treat the serious lightly. If ever there was a case of treating serious issues lightly, it is this. We have a treaty dealing with the banning of nuclear testing in this world, negotiated and signed by 145 countries, languishing here for 2 years, and now in 10 days let's have a vote--and, by the way, we don't intend on having significant hearings. 
   The Senator from Virginia indicated he will have hearings. I applaud him for that. He is a thoughtful Senator, in my judgment; I respect him deeply. He disagrees with me on this issue. I have deep respect for him. I think it is appropriate there are hearings being held this week. I think they probably thought--some thought--you can't call this up for a vote without at least showing you will have some hearings. I am told the requests to have people testify at the hearings who support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was not met with great success. Who knows; we will see the record of that, I suppose, toward the end of the week. 
   Let me show what our allies have done with respect to this treaty. 
   We spent a lot of time on the floor of the Senate talking about NATO. We have been involved with NATO, in Kosovo and elsewhere. In fact, the Senate voted to expand NATO. NATO is an important security alliance. What have our NATO allies done with respect to this Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty? Most of them have already ratified it. Two of the NATO nuclear powers have ratified the treaty, England and France. NATO itself endorsed the treaty at the April 1999 conference. The United States has yet to ratify it. Some would say: Neither have China and Russia. Of course they are not NATO members. Neither have China nor Russia. That is true, they have not. They will, in my judgment, when this country ratifies it. They did when this country ratified the chemical weapons treaty. 
   My point is this: I think this country has a responsibility to provide leadership, moral leadership, on an issue this important. Are there questions that can be raised about this treaty? Yes. And every single one of them can be answered easily and decisively, every one. There is not a question that has been raised that casts a shred of doubt on what the outcome ought to be on the vote in this Senate on this treaty. If you believe this country has a responsibility to provide leadership to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and reduce the threat of nuclear war, then this Senate ought to ratify this treaty. 
   Perhaps it would be useful to quote President Kennedy who succeeded President Eisenhower. President Eisenhower, 40 years ago, said:  
   One of greatest regrets of any administration of any time would be the failure to achieve a nuclear test ban treaty.  
   President Kennedy, following President Eisenhower's lead, said the following:  
   A comprehensive test ban would place the nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest hazards man faces. It would increase our security. It would decrease the prospects of war. Surely this goal is sufficiently important to require steady pursuit, yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on responsible safeguards.  
   President Johnson said:  
   We shall demonstrate that, despite all his problems, quarrels and distractions, man still retains a capacity to design his fate rather than be engulfed by it. Failure to complete our work will be interpreted by our children and grandchildren as a betrayal of conscience in a world that needs all of its resources and talents to serve life, not death.  
   When Nikita Khrushchev, in discussions and dialog with President Kennedy, described nuclear war as ``a circumstance in which the living would envy the dead,'' that was almost 40 years ago, long, long ago, before we had arsenals of 30,000 nuclear weapons, some in airplanes, some on submarines, some on missiles, some in storage facilities, with many countries around the world wanting to achieve the opportunity to possess nuclear weapons. 
   We have very few opportunities to do work as important as will be done if the Senate ratifies this treaty. My expectation is that when we debate this treaty in the coming couple of days--the schedule is for a debate Friday and a debate the following Tuesday--at the culmination of 14 hours, we would discuss the advisability of the Senate ratifying this treaty. 
   There will be a lot of discussion by those who believe it is ill advised and by those who believe it is imperative the Senate ratify this treaty. 
   Let me make a couple of other comments that might describe some of this debate. The debate will not be about the American people's interests. According to surveys, 82 percent of the American people support a comprehensive nuclear test ban--82 percent of the American people. The debate, in my judgment, will not be about espionage by the Chinese. Some have said the Chinese espionage allegations at National Laboratories actually weaken the case for a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. In fact the Cox report, which was published earlier this year, pointed out that if China were a signatory to and were to adhere to the CTBT, its ability to modernize its nuclear arsenal would be significantly curtailed. 
   Let me put up the chart of the monitoring stations. After we ratify the treaty, let me ask if anyone in this Chamber could make the argument that we have less capability to monitor than we do now? No one can make that case. We will have more capability. And no one can make the case there is some new assessment or new report by the CIA that poses a danger, saying we can't detect tests of nuclear explosions. That is not accurate either. Despite the story in the newspaper, the CIA says there is no new assessment. The CIA says there is no new report. 
   Can we detect low-level explosions that have no consequence in the development of advanced weapons or the acquisition of nuclear weapons? The answer is no; we cannot detect those low-level explosions. And the response is, so what? So what? We could not 4 years ago; we cannot now. Have our abilities to detect been enhanced in the last few years? The answer is yes. But we will hear those charges nonetheless. I think it is important for people to understand the charges are without merit. 
   Today at the White House, 31 Nobel laureates were in attendance. These are those honored physicists and chemists who have won the highest awards, who have powerful intellects, the scientists who understand and evaluate these issues. One of those scientists who spoke today is Dr. Charles Townes. He is the man who invented radar during the Second World War for our airplanes, and the laser--a towering intellect. He spoke with passion about the need for this country to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
   These scientists almost uniformly indicate they have no questions about our ability to detect explosions of consequence. They have no questions  about our ability to require compliance with this treaty and detect cheating. In the front row of that meeting at the White House today were the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs; General Shelton, the current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs; Gen. David Jones, a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs; Admiral Crowe, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs--all of them were there to support this treaty. 
   Why? Because it weakens this country? No; of course that's absurd. It does not weaken this country. They were there because they know it strengthens this country. They know, from a security standpoint and from a military standpoint, the ratification of this treaty strengthens this country. 
   I know I have heard about briefings that are held which suggest that there is information that is not available to the American people that suggests something different. It is not the case. It is just not the case. I am sorry. I respect those who disagree with me. They are welcome to come to the floor of the Senate, and will, and they will debate. I am sure they will be persuasive, in their own way. But I am telling you in my judgment, there is nothing, there is nothing that would persuade the last four Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including Gen. Colin Powell, to support the ratification of this test ban treaty if they felt this treaty would injure this country. 
   Does anyone in this Chamber believe that Gen. Colin Powell is advocating ratification of a treaty that will weaken this country? If so, come and tell us that. Or perhaps we will have people come and say Gen. Colin Powell doesn't understand. Or, if he understands, he is misinformed. I don't think so. Not General Powell, not General Shalikashvili, not General Jones, not Admiral Crowe, and not General Shelton. All of them come to the same conclusion: This treaty will strengthen our country. The ratification of this treaty will strengthen the security of this country. The ratification of this treaty will allow us to better monitor whether anyone cheats on a treaty that is designed to ban nuclear testing. 
   Again, there is room for disagreement, but in my judgment there is not room for the Senate to say to the world: We quit testing in 1992 unilaterally, and our position is we quit testing, but anyone else out there, our message is: You go ahead; we do not want to impose the same limitation on you; we have quit testing nuclear weapons, but we do not want to impose the limitation on you. 
   We have two countries that have nuclear capability: India and Pakistan. They do not like each other much, and they are neighbors. They share a contentious border. Earlier this year, they each exploded a nuclear weapon literally under each other's chin. That should provide a sober warning to the rest of this world that we need to stop nuclear testing and need a ban on nuclear testing, especially to the Senate, a senate in a country that possesses the best capability of leadership in the entire world on this issue. The proliferation of nuclear weapons and the willingness to use them, the willingness to test them, is a very serious issue. It is a big issue, and this Senate has a responsibility to address it. 
   It would be unthinkable for me to see this Senate proceed in the manner it now appears to be proceeding, and that is to take an issue this important and to blithely say: All right, it's been here 2 years; we have not cared much about it, and a week from Tuesday, we will bring it up and kill it because we do not believe in arms control; if you don't like that, that's tough luck. 
   That is not a responsible way to legislate. I did not object to bringing it up on Tuesday. There was a unanimous consent request. I did not object to it. If that is the only way to get a vote, as far as I am concerned, so be it. But it is not a responsible way to legislate. All of us know better than that. We know better on issues this important that the way to legislate is to take a treaty that has been signed by 154 countries, and have a series of hearings. We should have men and women across this country weigh in on this issue, have a robust, aggressive, thoughtful, interesting, exciting debate, and then the Senate should vote. That is not what has happened here. We know that. 
   Two years have passed, and this treaty has been in prison. This treaty has not seen the light of day. I know we had a Senator saying that is not true, there have been hearings. Senator BIDEN came to the floor to refute that. There have been no hearings. This week, there have been a couple of hearings. The Senator from Virginia just talked about hearings. He is a man for whom I have great respect. I only regret he is on the other side of this issue. 
   Everyone in this Chamber knows better than to proceed with this issue in this manner. This has great consequences all around the world. This country has a responsibility all around the world. Everybody in this Chamber knows better. That is not the way you handle a treaty of this importance, by standing up and saying: If you want a treaty, then let's do it in 10 days, and if you don't like it, tough luck. 
   If that is the only opportunity presented to the Senate to decide we are going to lead the world in arms control and say to the rest of the world we have quit testing nuclear weapons and we want you to as well, we are going to ratify the treaty, that is fine. 
   If there are those who stand up and say: We do not support a ban on nuclear testing; in fact, we ought to test more; we do not want to send a signal to India and Pakistan not to test; we do not want to send a message to Russia and China to ratify the pact, they can say that. That is the democratic way. But they will not say it with my vote. It is the wrong direction for this country. It is not leadership. It is an abdication of leadership, in my judgment. I hope in the coming days we will find a way to see if we cannot have a more thoughtful approach to this country doing what it ought to do. 
   I want to conclude with one additional chart that has some quotes which I think are important. This is the Joint Chiefs of Staff Annual Posture Statement 1999, responding to the question raised by those in the Senate who say the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will injure this country's preparedness and security. Nonsense. It says:  
   In a very real sense, one of the best ways to protect our troops and our interests is to promote arms control. ..... In both the conventional and nuclear realms, arms control can reduce the chances of conflict. ..... Our efforts to reduce the numbers of nuclear weapons coincide with efforts to control testing of nuclear weapons ..... and the Joint Chiefs support ratification of this treaty.  
   I want to hear in this debate from those who believe that the Joint Chiefs of Staff, heading the military services in our country, have somehow concluded they want to support something that injures this country's defense. It is preposterous. The Joint Chiefs of Staff support this because they understand it will enhance this country's defense; it will make this country and this world more secure. 
   Gen. Colin Powell, General Shalikashvili, Adm. William Crowe, and Gen. David Jones said the following:  
   We support Senate approval of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty together with six safeguards under which the President will be prepared to conduct necessary testing if the safety and reliability of our nuclear deterrent could no longer be verified.  
   This treaty has safeguards. Gen. Colin Powell says he supports this treaty. It will not injure this country's security or preparedness. I do not think we have to go further on the floor of the Senate. We can have folks come over here and raise their fists, get red in the face, the veins in their necks can bulge, they can hyperventilate, and they can speak loudly about their vision of what this might or might not do with respect to this country's military preparedness. But when they are done, I will ask them to go visit with Colin Powell, I will ask them to visit with General Shelton or the Joint Chiefs of Staff and try to reconcile the position the military leaders in this country have taken with respect to this treaty to the allegations made without a good basis on the floor of the Senate about this treaty. 
   We are given 14 hours, starting Friday and continuing Tuesday, to debate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. If that is the procedure for debate that exists at the end of this week, then I will be here, and I intend to speak at some length, as will my colleagues, Senator BIDEN and many others, who feel strongly about this.  
   I look forward to engaging in this debate. I know there are some who are concerned, upset, and nervous about heading toward a vote that looks as if we probably will lose. But I say 
   this: At least we are on the right subject for a change. At least we are talking about the right issue for a change. If talking about the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty takes goading the majority into saying to us: We are going to give you 10 days with no hearings, essentially, and then we are going to force you to vote and defeat this treaty because that is what we want to tell the world about our position on nuclear weapons and arms control, that is fine with me because we are talking about the right subject. 
   If we do not ratify this treaty now, we will ratify it next year, and if we do not ratify it next year, then we will ratify it the year after. Because at some point, when 82 percent of the American people want arms control to reduce the spread of nuclear weapons through the ratification of this treaty, and when the Joint Chiefs of Staff say it will not injure the security of this country, at some point the American people will say: We want to have our way on this issue, and we will impress our way on this issue by having the Senate come to this Chamber and vote for ratification. If not now, later. But at some point, the American people will demand this country provide leadership in reducing the threat of nuclear war and reducing the spread of nuclear weapons. 
   The Senator from Virginia, Mr. WARNER, is on the floor. I mentioned a couple of times--I did not mention his name--but I referred to him as ``the Senator from Virginia.'' 
   I say to Senator WARNER, I mentioned--when I think you were not on the floor--one of my great regrets is that you are not with us on this issue because I have great respect for you and your abilities. I also appreciate the fact that some hearings are being held this week. 
   But I confess, as I have said, I think this is not a good, thoughtful way to deal with something this important. I am not talking about the Senator's hearings. I am talking about, after 2 years of virtually no activity, saying: All right. Ten days from now we're going to have a vote. In the meantime, we'll cobble together a couple hearings and then figure how we get there, and vote the treaty down, and tell the world that is our judgment. 
   I do not think that is a good way to do it. I think that is treating the serious too lightly. I do not think it is the best we can do. The better way for us to have done this, in my judgment, is to have decided we would hold a comprehensive set of hearings over a rather lengthy period of time, develop a national discussion about the import and consequence of a treaty of this type, and then have the Senate consider it. That is not what is being done. 
   If we vote next Tuesday, I am here and I am ready. I am ready Friday and Tuesday to debate it. But I very much wish this had been dealt with in a much more responsible way. By that comment, I do not mean to suggest the Senator from Virginia is in any way involved in that. I, again, appreciate the fact that he is holding some hearings this week, hearing from people who are weighing in on both sides of this issue. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, the Senator from North Carolina objected to my being recognized following his statement on the floor. The Senator from North Carolina, as I understand, is propounding a unanimous consent request that the Senator from Georgia be recognized, following which he be recognized. I ask consent I be recognized following the Senator from North Carolina.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I don't object to the Senator from Georgia speaking. I don't object to the Senator from North Carolina speaking. I simply ask if the Senator from North Carolina gets consent to be recognized, that I get consent to be recognized following his presentation. As I understand it, he has objected to that; is that the case?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from North Carolina, for whom I have great respect, it is not and will never be my intention to prevent him from speaking on the floor. That was not the purpose of the unanimous consent request or the objections. 
   I have talked to him personally about this issue. He feels very strongly about it, as the Senator from Delaware indicated. The Senator, who is the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has a right to feel very strongly about his position. I respect that very much. This is an issue that is very important to this country and, in my judgment, to the world. 
   We have a circumstance where 154 countries have become signatories to something called the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Forty-seven countries have ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. This country has not. 
   Mr. President, 737 days ago or so, this treaty was sent to the Senate by this administration; 737 days later we have not acted on this treaty. Some feel very strongly this treaty is not good for our country. The majority leader made that case. The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the Senator from North Carolina, makes that case. They have strong feelings about it. I respect that. Other people have strong feelings on the other side, including myself. 
   I believe strongly this country has a moral responsibility in the world to lead on the question of the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. Not many countries have access to nuclear weapons or possess nuclear weapons. Many would like to. How do we prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in this world, at a time when the shadow of nuclear tests recently made by India and Pakistan suggest there is an appetite for acquisition of nuclear weapons and testing of nuclear weapons? Two countries that do not like each other and share a common border explode nuclear weapons literally under each other's chins. Shouldn't that tell us there are serious challenges ahead with respect to nuclear weapons and the spread of nuclear weapons? I think so. 
   A unanimous consent request was propounded by the majority leader to bring up the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty next week. As far as I am concerned, it is all right with me. I have been suggesting it ought to be brought up for a debate. It probably would be better if there was a hearing first and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and other respected folks came and set out their views and then, a couple of days later, debate it and vote on it. That would probably be a better course. 
   Even in the absence of that, as far as I am concerned, bring it up. The Democratic leader said he thought 10 hours was probably not enough time. The majority leader said in response we can  perhaps lengthen that. Maybe, based on that discussion, there can be an agreement today. I hope so. This ought to be brought up for a vote. I do not think the objection by the Democratic leader was an objection to say it ought not be brought up. He was concerned about time. It occurred to me from the response of the majority leader that can be worked out. In any event, as far as I am concerned, bring it up next week. Let's have a debate next week and a vote next week. 
   Twenty-one nations have ratified this treaty since the beginning of this year. Most of our allies have ratified this treaty, but we have not. Some say it is dangerous, as the majority leader alleged today, using the term ``dangerous'' for this country. Others say it is not in this country's interest, that it will weaken this country, leave us unprotected. 
   Let me describe some of the support for this treaty, going back to President Eisenhower who pushed very hard in the final term of his Presidency to get a treaty of this type. General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, supports this treaty and 
   testified recently again in support of the treaty. Four previous Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--General Shalikashvili, Gen. Colin Powell, Admiral Crowe, and Gen. David Jones--also endorse that same position, that the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is good for this country and ought to be ratified by this Senate. 
   Does anyone really feel Gen. Colin Powell, General Shalikashvili, and General Shelton would take a position that they think will weaken this country? Are they the extreme left? Are they the folks who, on the extreme of politics in this country, believe we ought to disarm? I do not think so. The Secretary of Defense supports this treaty and believes it ought to be ratified. I would not expect that he and Colin Powell and Admiral Crowe and all of those folks would do so unless they felt very strongly that this treaty is in this country's interest. 
   A former Member of this body, Senator Hatfield, someone for whom I have the greatest respect, offered some sound advice on this subject. Senator Hatfield, incidentally, was one of the first servicemen to walk in the streets of Hiroshima after the nuclear strike on that city. I want to read what former Senator Hatfield said to us. He said:  
   It is clear to me that ratifying this treaty would be in the national interest, and it is equally clear that Senators have a responsibility to the world, to the Nation and their constituents to put partisan politics aside and allow the Senate to consider this treaty.  
   He, perhaps better than anybody in this body, understands the horror of nuclear weapons, having walked the streets of Hiroshima after the strike on that city. 
   I quoted the other day Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union who warned that in a nuclear war the living would envy the dead. 
   The question for this country is, Will we stand and provide world leadership on the issue of the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons 
   or will we decide it is not our country's responsibility; it is someone else's responsibility? Let England do it. Let France do it. Let Germany do it. Let Canada do it. 
   We are the only country in the world with the capability of providing significant leadership in this area. We must, in my judgment, ratify this treaty. 
   There are safeguards in this treaty. I will not spend much more time discussing it right now because we are on another piece of legislation, and that is important, too. But I make these comments because the safeguards in this treaty are quite clear. 
   This is not a case where this country will ratify a treaty that, in effect, disarms us. We are not conducting explosive tests of nuclear weapons now. We have unilaterally decided--7 years ago--we are not exploding nuclear weapons. 
   What contribution would be made by a test ban treaty? Simply this: If you cannot test your weaponry, you have no notion and no certainty that any weapons you develop are weapons that work. We have known for 30 and 40 years that the ability to suppress the testing of nuclear weapons will be the first step, albeit a moderate step, in halting the spread of nuclear weapons. This, in my judgment, in fact, is not a moderate step--this is a baby step. 
   If we cannot take this baby step on this important treaty, how on Earth are we going to do the heavy lifting that is necessary following this that will lead to the mutual reduction in the stockpile of nuclear arms? Tens of thousands of nuclear arms--30,000 nuclear weapons between us and Russia alone. 
   How are we going to reduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons and halt the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries and reduce the threat that comes from the nuclear weapons tests that occurred in Pakistan and India? How on Earth are we going to provide the leadership that is necessary, the tough leadership that is necessary in these areas if we cannot take this small step to ratify a treaty that has been signed by 154 countries now, and that makes so much sense, and that our Joint Chiefs of Staff have said represents this country's interests? How on Earth are we going to do the tough work if we cannot take this first step? 
   I have a lot more to say on this subject. I have expressed to the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, it is not my intention to be an irritant to anybody in this Chamber personally. I do not ever intend to suggest that someone who believes differently than I do is taking that position for any other reason except for the passion they have about this country and the policies they think will strengthen it. 
   But we have a very significant disagreement about this issue. It is a very significant and important issue. I believe in my heart very strongly this country has a responsibility to lead in the right way on this matter. 
   My hope is the unanimous consent request propounded by the majority leader--if there is more time needed; and the majority leader indicated that he was agreeable to that--my hope is that before the end of today we will have an agreement on when it will be brought to the floor, and then let's have a robust, aggressive, thoughtful debate so the country can understand what this means. Then let's have a vote and decide whether this country decides to ratify this important treaty that has been discussed for some 40 years--whether this country will take the first step that will help 
   halt the spread of nuclear weapons around the world.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Virginia. One of my deep regrets is that he does not support this treaty because I have great respect for him and have worked with him on a number of matters. He truly knows this area and studies this area. There is room for disagreement.  
   But I say, again, that Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Colin Powell, General Shalikashvili, General Shelton, and so many others have reviewed all of the same material--much of it secret material, secret documents--and have come to a different conclusion, believing that this treaty is very important for this country and that it is very important to ratify this treaty. 
   But my hope mirrors that of Senator WARNER, that when we have this debate, we will have a debate about ideas and about the kind of public policy that will benefit this country and the world, the kind of public policy that will allow us to continue to be strong, to have the capability to defend our liberty and freedom, but the kind of policy that will also provide leadership so this country can help prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in the years ahead. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was in the appropriations markup yesterday when the Senator from Washington was preparing to offer the amendment she now describes on the floor of the Senate. I asked the question at that point during the discussion whether the product from the Appropriations Committee that was brought to the committee yesterday, and now to the floor, would, in fact, require or allow or cause the firing of up to 30,000 teachers that had been previously hired under this program. I asked the question, I think, a couple of times, trying to understand, is there a deliberate effort to say we don't want to have a program with national goals or aspirations to reduce class size by hiring more teachers; we don't want to have that program. Is that the goal, to not have that program any longer? 
   I was not able to get an answer to that. But we now have the program. Is it not correct we have a program in which we in Congress said we will authorize and fund to try to reduce class size around this country in our public schools by adding some additional classroom teachers? We know that works. Study after study tells us that works, that it improves education. A teacher in a classroom with 30 students has substantially less time to devote to those students than a teacher in a classroom with 15. We know that. We know it works in every way to have smaller class sizes. 
   This Government already decided it wanted to have a program of that type. We funded it and authorized it last year. 
   Unless the amendment offered by the Senator from Washington is adopted, is it not correct that all across this country, we will see the dismissal of teachers who are now in the classroom helping reduce class sizes, improving education, because the resources will not be available any longer to fund that? And will that not be a significant step backward in our goal to improve public education in this country?

   Mr. DORGAN. But is it not also correct--I continue to ask a question of the Senator from Washington, Mr. President--when we had this discussion yesterday, there was a proposal that perhaps a second-degree amendment would be offered, and they said: Well, we will offer some money that is in the form of kind of a block grant--they do not call it that--where they send some money back to the school districts and say: By the way, do what you want with this because we don't have any goals or aspirations with respect to how it ought to be used. 
   In other words, they say: Let us retreat from this program of reducing class size by hiring more teachers and improving 
   education that way; let's decide we will send money but have no national goals. 
   Isn't that the case with respect to what was attempted yesterday before you decided to withhold your amendment for the floor of the Senate, that the second-degree amendment would have said: OK, we will provide some money, but we want to back away from the commitment of reducing class size as a part of solution to improve education?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I may further ask the Senator from Washington, this issue is not new. Is it not the case that this issue has been debated for some long while? President Clinton proposed in a State of the Union Address some long while ago this national goal of improving our country's education system by reducing class size; that is, reducing the number of students each teacher would have in the classroom, and decided there are sort of niche funding areas where we can play a role. 
   It is true that most education funding comes from State and local governments. It is the case, and always should be, that those who run America's schools are our local school boards and those that make education policy in our States are the State legislatures. That is the case. No one suggests that ought to be different.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DORGAN. But it is also the case we can provide niche funding in certain areas through national goals we establish to dramatically improve education, and one of those methods is to say if we had more teachers, we could reduce the size of the classroom, the number of students per class. We know from study after study that dramatically improves the ability of students to learn in school. 
   The recipe for a good education is not a mystery at all. You have to have a  good teacher, you have to have a student willing to learn, and you have to have a parent willing to be involved in that student's education. Those are necessary ingredients for education to work. 
   What about this notion of a good teacher? You have to have a good teacher and put that teacher in a position of teaching well in a school that is functional, not in a crumbling school or a crumbling building that is in desperate need of repair, and we know of plenty of those and are working on that, but also in a classroom that is not overcrowded.

I am a member of the Appropriations Committee, and I watched what he did yesterday in the area of education and health care and a range of other areas, where he tried to take resources that were rather limited and make the right investments with them. There are many areas on which I applaud the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa. I think they deserve our accolades and applause for their work in a number of areas.

   Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from New York talked about the 100,000 teachers program, the program to try to reduce class size all around this country and improve schools, improve learning as a result. 
   I came from a markup of the appropriations bill that will provide the resources for various education functions. We had a discussion in that markup on this subject. It is the case, as the Senator from New York indicates, that unless something affirmatively is done, we will come to the next school year and 25 or 30,000 teachers across this country, teachers in every State, will get a pink slip saying: You are not any longer hired under this program. 
   Last year, during the negotiation over the budget and appropriations between President Clinton and the Republicans and Democrats in Congress, a program was both authorized and funded that said it shall be the objective in this country to reduce class size and provide teachers to help accomplish that. Why? Because we know kids learn better in smaller classes. Does a kid have more attention from the teacher and more individualized instruction in a class with 15 or 16 students than with 30 students? The answer is, yes, of course. From study after study, in State after State, we understand it makes a difference in a child's education to reduce class size. 
   Unless this Congress continues to fund that effort, up to 30,000 teachers will be fired. Isn't it the case that this program was authorized last year and appropriated last year, almost 1 year ago now? And the bill that will come to the floor tomorrow, by the way, will propose that we not fund that, that we decide not to fund that program; isn't that the case? And isn't it the case that we will have to wage a fight on the floor of the Senate for an amendment that affirmatively says: We as a country want to retain and continue this objective of reducing class size to improve education and improve the opportunities of young children to learn in schools?

   Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from New York is correct. There is a circumstance in the markup document that we saw today, and that we took action on this afternoon, that says there will be money available, if authorized. But, of course, the authorization committee is not going to be on the floor reauthorizing elementary and secondary education. It sets up a circumstance where they know and we know they will not continue this program to reduce class size. 
   How do you reduce class size? You hire additional teachers. We don't have a large role in education at the Federal level. Most of elementary and secondary education is handled locally. Local school boards, State governments, and others decide the kind of education system they want. What we have done is establish national objectives. One of our objectives is to say we can improve education, we know how to improve education, if we can devote more resources to teachers in order to have more teachers and reduce class size. 
   Walk into a classroom bursting with 30 children. Then ask yourself, does that teacher have the same capability to affect each of those children's lives that a teacher who is teaching 15 children would have in the same classroom? The answer is, no, of course not. That is why this is so important. 
   There is nothing much more important in this country than education. Almost everything we are and everything we have been and almost all we will become as a country is as a result of this country deciding education is a priority, that every young child in this country shall have the opportunity to become the best they can be. 
   I walked into a school one day in North Dakota. I have told about it on the floor of the Senate. A little third grader--this was a school with almost all young Indian children--whose name was Rosie said to me: Mr. Senator, are you going to build us a new school? Regrettably, I couldn't say yes; I don't  have the money. I don't have the authorization. I don't have the capability. But she needs a new school. One hundred and fifty kids, one water fountain, and two bathrooms crammed in a building that in large 
   part is condemned. These kids need new schools. They need smaller classrooms, better teachers. 
   How do we do that? We devote resources to it. If we have $792 billion to give in a tax cut over the next 10 years, maybe there ought to be some money to care about Rosie and to care about other kids crammed into classrooms across this country, classrooms that are too crowded, classrooms where learning isn't accomplished, where we know it can be accomplished if we have more teachers and reduce the size of the classroom. Isn't that the substance of this debate? Isn't that why it is important?

<TEXT>
   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are debating a continuing resolution for 3 weeks. The continuing resolution, which probably doesn't mean much to a lot of people, commonly called a CR here in Congress--means we continue the appropriations level of those appropriated accounts that now exist for a time until the appropriations bills are debated and voted on by the Congress. 
   Normally, we should do that by September 30, and then, by October 1, the new fiscal year starts. When the new fiscal year starts, the new appropriations bills which we have passed come into effect and provide the funding. Because we have not passed, finally, between the House and the Senate, appropriations bills from the conference reports, we don't have funding that is assured for the coming fiscal year. Therefore, there will be a continuing resolution. 
   Why haven't we passed the appropriations bills coming out of a conference with the House of Representatives? The answer is, simply, we have not been able to do that because the money doesn't exist to fit all of the priorities in the budget that was passed by the Republicans this spring. 
   We can have a long debate about priorities: What is important and what isn't; what works, what doesn't; what we should do and what we should not do for the future of this country. Earlier this year, we had a debate in part about that with respect to the budget. I said then that 100 years from now, when we are all dead and gone, those who want to evaluate what we were about, what we thought was important, what our priorities were, can take a look at the Federal budget and evaluate what we decided to invest in, what we wanted to spend money on. Did we decide education was a priority, health care, health care research, food safety, or family farmers? Go down the list; there are literally hundreds of priorities. One could evaluate what people thought was important by evaluating what they decided to put in their budget and then what they decided to fund. 
   The two largest appropriations bills have been held until the end of this Congress because the money didn't exist to fund them. We have budget caps that everyone in this Chamber knows do not now fit. We finish appropriating money for defense and a number of other agencies and then come to the remaining appropriations bills and are told: You have to do a 17-percent, 27-percent, or 30-percent across-the-board cut in all of these other issues: education, health care, and more. 
   That is not something anyone would bring to the floor of the Senate. So we start doing creative financing. The majority party said: We can solve this problem by creating a 13th month. 
   That was one of the ideas last week or the week before. We can just describe a 13th month. If you could just have a 13th month, then you could move money around and pretend you had solved the problem. 
   Well, the Washington Post wrote about that and said ``GOP Seeks to Ease Crunch with 13-month Fiscal Year.'' That didn't work real well because nobody knew what to call it. Of course, folks immediately described it as smoke and mirrors and not a very thoughtful approach. 
   The Wall Street Journal wrote this article: ``GOP Uses Two Sets of Books.'' It describes ``double counting.'' Of course, that doesn't work real well either. Double entry bookkeeping doesn't mean you can use the same dollars twice. Some described a new accounting system using two sets of books. That hasn't turned out to work real well either. 
   Now we have what is called ``virtual money.'' I heard somebody described funding for a ``virtual university'' that Governors want to create. I thought that was appropriate. We now have a ``virtual funding'' scheme for the largest appropriations bill. We will see how that works. 
   This process, at the end of this session of Congress, is about as disorganized and messy as any I have seen in the years I have served in Congress. This isn't the way to do the Senate's work or the country's work. The thoughtful way to do it is to pass appropriations bills, one by one, during this year when they should be passed, go to conference, reach accommodations and compromise between the House and Senate, between Republicans and Democrats, between the Congress and the President, and then fund the programs that are important for this country's future. 
   None of that is happening. Earlier today, the majority leader indicated on one of the very important appropriations bills that I care about--the Agriculture appropriations bill--that the conference was ``ongoing.'' He said, in response to the Senator from Minnesota, the conference is underway. I pointed out that the conference isn't underway. I am a conferee. That conference hasn't met for a week. 
   I went back to my office after pointing that out to the majority leader and I read this memo that was sent to all conferees. This is from a staff person with the Republican majority on the conference dealing with agriculture. Mind you, there is not much that is more important as an issue to my State, North Dakota, than agriculture and the health of family farming. We face a very serious crisis with the collapse of grain prices, and dried up trade markets, and a whole range of issues, such as sprout damage with our grain, and just a range of issues. We are in a real crisis. 
   We passed a bill on August 4 in the Senate to try to respond to the needs of family farmers. Then, for 6 or 7 weeks, there was this foot dragging with nothing happening. We finally went to conference last week, and it was adjourned abruptly and there has been no meeting since. 
   The majority leader said the conference is meeting. It isn't meeting. After I had that dialog with the majority leader, I received this today from a staffer, a Republican staffer, on the conference, apparently:  
   As of this morning, the Senate Majority Leader signed off on a package which was offered from the Speaker--  
   Speaker of the House--  
   to resolve our stalled agriculture appropriations conference.  
   It is interesting that the majority leader signed off on a package offered by the Speaker. If that is so, I have not seen the package; I never heard of it. There have been no meetings. 
   Is there a group in this Capitol that is deciding what is going to happen outside the purview of the conference? Does the majority leader plan to tell us what is in this package he signed off on? Is it his decision or the Speaker's decision that conferences do not matter anymore? Can they make decisions about family farmers, agriculture, disasters, and farm emergencies without including input from those of us who represent farm States? Is that what is happening? 
   It says:  
   The conference will not reconvene and all items are closed.  
   I am one of the conferees. We haven't met for a week. We are in the middle of  a full-scale crisis and disaster on America's family farms. A week ago, we had 100,000 hogs floating dead in the Carolinas, a million chickens, untold cattle, crops devastated up and down the east coast from Hurricane Floyd. You think they don't have a disaster? You think they don't have a crisis? That needs to be addressed in this conference. How is it going to be addressed? Who is going to do it? 
   The conference was adjourned. Do you know why it was adjourned? Because some on the conference--on the Republican side in the House--didn't like what we did in the Senate with respect to embargoes on food and medicine. What we did, in a bipartisan way, with Senators ASHCROFT and DODD, was say that we ought not ever use food as a weapon again. We are sick and tired of it. Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Cuba, you name it--when you slap an embargo on countries that are not behaving well and you include in that the cut off of food and medicine to those countries, you shoot yourself in the foot. We all know it. We have known it for 40 years. This Senate, by 70 votes, said it is time to stop that--no more food embargoes or using food as a weapon. 
   Well, we got to conference and the Republicans on the House side didn't like that, and so they adjourned and haven't met since. Now I am told, by notification of a staffer, that the conference is over, the conference will not reconvene, all items are closed and, as of this morning, Senate Majority Leader LOTT has signed off on a package that was offered from Speaker HASTERT to resolve our stalled appropriations conference. 
   That is some bipartisan way to run a Senate or a Congress. It shortchanges America's family farmers, and it shortchanges those of us who serve here who are supposed to have an opportunity to serve on these conference committees. In my judgment, it really turns a blind eye to the needs of rural America. 
   We will discuss this at some greater length, but we have to do a continuing resolution now--that is what this debate is about--because this bill wasn't done. This bill wasn't done because we have been stalling for months and months because they didn't feel they had the money to do it. Then we have full-scale emergencies arise with the collapse of grain prices, Hurricane Floyd, a drought in some parts of the country, and, finally, it is decided we have to do some kind of a bill and then it gets into conference, and we have all these folks who can't decide to agree, so they just quit. The majority leader and the Speaker made a decision on how this is going to go, and they will bring it to the floor. 
   That is not satisfactory to me and my colleagues, a number of whom serve on this conference committee and have waited for that conference committee to be called back into session. That is not the way to do business. A CR is not the way to do business, and we all know it. I am not going to object to a 3-week continuing resolution. I will vote for it. I told Senator DASCHLE I will vote for it. But we all know it represents a failure of this Senate to get its business done on time, a failure of the Senate to describe the right priorities and support them. 
   I hope this is the last of those kinds of failures. I hope that at the end of 3 weeks, we will have had the opportunity to debate, offer amendments, and consider a range of opinions in this Chamber on a range of issues, going from education to farm policy, and more. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that the time be charged equally to both sides.

   Mr. DORGAN. I was in the Chamber and I heard the presentation by the Senator from Missouri and wanted to make a brief comment and end with a question. 
   The proposal that was offered in the Senate by Senator ASHCROFT and Senator DODD said it is inappropriate to continue to use food as a weapon and that food and medicine ought not be part of embargoes that we apply against other countries for bad behavior. That proposal was passed by the Senate overwhelmingly, as the Senator from Missouri just described. The Ashcroft-Dodd provision once and for all would break the back of those who continue to want to use food and medicine as a weapon. What a wonderful thing it would be to have that happen. I was so delighted when it passed the Senate. Unfortunately, the Senator from Missouri correctly describes what happened in conference. 
   We, in the conference on the Senate side, insisted on the Senate provisions--that is, the Ashcroft-Dodd provision that says no more food and medicine being used as a weapon or used as part of embargoes or sanctions. We said we insist on that position. 
   It was clear that had there been a vote of the House conferees, they would have voted in favor of the Senate position. That was clear. So what happened? They decided to adjourn rather than allow the House conferees to vote. That was a week ago. A week later, the conference has not met. I have received an e-mail, I say to my colleague from Missouri. I will read a sentence or so from it. 
   This is e-mail is from a staff person dealing with the appropriations conference. It was sent to me as a conferee: As of this morning, the Senate Majority Leader signed off on a plan which was offered by the Speaker of the House to resolve the stalled agriculture appropriations conference. 
   It describes what was resolved, one of which was to drop the Ashcroft-Dodd provision which, in effect, says, let's discontinue these sanctions on food and medicine. 
   Then it says: The conference will not reconvene and all items are now closed. 
   My point is, this is not a way to run this place. We didn't have input. We didn't have opportunities, after the first vote in which the Senate insisted on the provision by the Senator from Missouri, the Ashcroft-Dodd provision. After we insisted on that provision, which passed overwhelmingly here, the conference adjourned. And then some other people who are unnamed and who are unknown to me met someplace--I know not where--and made a decision that we have a different approach. They essentially said here is what you are going to have, and all items are closed, and you have no opportunity to debate it. 
   That way of doing things is not good for family farmers, not good for this country. It is not a good way to make public policy. 
   I ask the Senator from Missouri, as I close--and I thank him very much for allowing me to interrupt his statement--is it not the case that when the Senate passed this with 70 votes and then by unanimous vote following that, that we felt in the Senate we had finally broken the back of this effort to always use food and medicine as weapons? We finally said to the country, it is inappropriate; we are going to stop it once and for all. Isn't it the case that if we had had a vote in the conference, from all that he knows, that that vote would have overwhelmingly said we support 
   this position to stop using food and medicine as a weapon, and we can make this public law, but, in fact, it was short-circuited somewhere, and that short circuit really shortchanges our country? That it shortchanges the public policy the Senator from Missouri was proposing?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was pleased to hear the remarks of Senator CONRAD about the Community Builders Program at HUD. I echo all of the comments he made about the difference that HUD made in the lives of the people in the Red River Valley who suffered so immensely from the massive flooding that occurred a couple of years ago. 
   I am on the Senate Appropriations Committee, and we had a discussion about the Community Builders Program. I share the feeling Senator CONRAD has expressed on the floor of the Senate about that program. It seems to me we ought to find a way to continue to fund that program. These are people all across this country who are making a difference, men and women who give new energy and new vitality to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. I think it is a step backward for this Congress to say that program doesn't work. We know it works. We know firsthand its value. We understand its contribution in our communities and other communities across this country. 
   I placed a statement in the RECORD a couple of days ago about this subject. I was pleased to have my colleague describe this in more detail, its functioning in the context of what we experienced. 
   I ask the Senator if he doesn't believe, in the end process, in the overall scheme of the amount of money that is spent and invested by the Congress, if the funding for the Community Builders isn't almost an asterisk of an amount, but so significant in terms of what it means to the new direction in HUD and to the capability of HUD to provide new energy and new vitality to these programs. Is it not the case that funding for this program can be done easily, without cost to other programs, but in a way that will make it an incredibly important investment in HUD in the long term?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments about the subject of education. 
   We will have two votes later today on two competing resolutions offered by the majority leader and the Democratic leader here in the Senate on the subject of education. I would like to make a couple of comments about that general subject. 
   Some long while ago, I was touring refugee camps as a member of a hunger committee in the House of Representatives. One of the camps I recall visiting was on the border between Honduras and Guatemala. 
   At the United Nations High Command for Relief Operations camp that they were running there on the border of Guatemala, I saw a lot of impoverished people who had been forced to leave their homes and were living in the camp. I visited with some of them through an interpreter. One older fellow, probably in his seventies, could not speak English but he motioned with his hands for me to come with him. 
   So I followed him about 20 paces or so back to this area where he was living in a tent with so many others. The refugees at this camp had cots to sleep on, and this fellow reached under his cot, and from among his meager belongings, which would have fit in one small knapsack, he pulled out a very small book. Then he grinned a rather toothless grin. He had only a few teeth in his mouth, but his smile was a mile wide as he held up this book to show me. The interpreter who had walked with me into that tent said: He wants to show you the book he is learning to read. 
   Here was a man living in a refugee camp, sleeping on a cot, in a tent with many others with only a meager subsistence who was proud to show a visitor that he was learning to read. The book he held up to show me was the Spanish equivalent of a ``See Spot Run'' book. In halting Spanish, he read a couple of pages, and the interpreter interpreted what he was reading for me. 
   I have always remembered those circumstance because there on that dirt floor, in that tent, in that refugee camp, this fellow in his seventies was enormously proud of being able to learn to read, even though he was on his first primer book. 
   This story illustrates for a lot of people how important it is to be educated and to have opportunity. How does it happen that opportunity exists in some societies and not in others? How does it happen that we in America have been so fortunate while some others have not? 
   I have told my colleagues before that one of the first visits I made when I came to Congress was to the oldest Member of Congress at the time, Claude Pepper. He was then in his late eighties. Above the chair in his office were two photographs autographed to him. The first photograph was of Orville and Wilbur Wright making the first airplane flight. Orville Wright had autographed it to Congressman Claude Pepper before he died. Beneath it was an autographed picture of Neil Armstrong walking on the Moon, also autographed to Congressman Claude Pepper. 
   I was struck by those two gifts from the first persons who learned to fly and then from the first person to fly to the Moon--autographed pictures that occurred in the span of Congressman Pepper's lifetime. 
   What was it that caused that explosion of knowledge, learning, and technology? The answer: Education. It was our education system that said to every young boy or girl in this country: You can become whatever you want to become. You can be a physicist, a scientist, a doctor, a barber, a mechanic. You decide what you want to become, and our education system allows your young minds to flower and to develop their full potential. 
   How is it that in our country we invented the television, we invented the computer, we invented plastic, radar, the silicon chip, we learned to fly, we  flew to the Moon, and now we splice genes? That all comes from education. 
   This education system of ours is not perfect. Through public education in America, we have decided there will be universal opportunity for all children and our obligation is to maintain a public school system to provide that opportunity for all. In our public schools in this country, we have about 53 million students who went to school this morning, 53 million children in kindergarten through high school, and that number is going to continue to increase. Our challenge is to have education policies that invest in our schools to make sure those children are attending good schools. 
   When they walk through the door of a school, we want to make certain children have a good learning environment. Yet we have crumbling schools across this country. I have spoken on the floor at length about some Indian schools I have visited that no one in this Chamber would want their children to attend, but there is not enough money to invest in fixing these crumbling schools. What are we doing to attract and retain the best teachers? Do we have enough money to do that? 
   Some say these things are too expensive. Yet in the Senate we have folks saying, although we cannot increase education funding, we have enough resources to provide a $792 billion tax cut over 10 years. That is our priority, they say. But we do not have enough money to fund this Federal investment in education. In fact, what has happened is that the $792 billion tax cut is only possible if we put a squeeze on domestic discretionary spending that means there is not enough money to fund education. 
   My colleagues on Friday described the consequences of the Republican actions. The Republican budget allocation for education, which is 17 percent lower than the 1999 levels, would provide 5,246 fewer new qualified teachers, 50,000 students would be denied afterschool and summer school programs, 142,000 children denied access to Head Start, 100,000 students denied Pell grant awards, and the list goes on because there is not adequate funding to do that. 
   Some of us believe there are certain obligations we have to maintain a strong public education system. To do that, we have put forward a proposal that does not cost very much but that would allow the refurbishing and remodeling of 6,000 public schools nationwide. Many of these schools across the country were built after the second world war and many of them are in desperate need of modernization and repair. This is a need not currently being met, and we have proposed a method to meet it. Helping local communities to reduce class sizes by being able to hire more teachers, ensuring teachers get the professional development they need to stay on top of their subject matter, increased funding for special education, and providing 1 million more children with access to constructive afterschool programs--all of these are important ingredients for developing a public education system we can be proud of and one that continues to work. 
   There is a big difference in these proposals and what those on the other side of the aisle have proposed. I am proud to be part of a political party that has always viewed education and investment in this country's children as a priority. There are some people serving in the Senate who have said let's abolish the Federal Department of Education. They have stopped actively trying to do that because they know it is massively unpopular with the American people and so we do not hear much from them anymore. But that is what they believe; that is what they would like to do. They have a right to that belief. I respect that, but I disagree with it profoundly because this country's future progress and opportunities rest on our ability to educate our future, our young children. It is our responsibility to educate our children in good schools with good teachers in classrooms that are safe. 
   I hope that, when we vote on the education resolutions before us this evening and when we continue to discuss this issue in the days ahead, we might reach a consensus among everyone in this Chamber that education ought to be the engine driving the budget train. It ought not be the caboose on this appropriations train, it should be the lead car. Education ought not be dealt with as an afterthought. It ought to be the priority for this Congress. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. I make a point of order a quorum is not present.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to take some time to talk about a couple of items that are related to the desperate crisis facing America's family farmers. One, what the conference committee on Agriculture Appropriations, of which I am a member, is doing--or, as is more accurate, not doing--to help them. Second, I want to talk to the issue of the burgeoning growing trade deficit. 
   I will talk for a moment about the Agriculture appropriations bill which is now in conference between the Senate and the House. I am a conferee. The Senate passed its version of that bill and included roughly $7.4 billion in emergency help for family farmers because prices have collapsed and farmers are in desperate trouble. We passed that on August 4. 
   Weeks and weeks went by and nothing happened. No conference. No meetings. Then last week, those of us who are conferees met with the House of Representatives. Then the Chair called an adjournment. The Members of the House called an adjournment, and we have not met since. Nearly a week later, and there has been no meeting since. 
   Why? They are all hung up on the House side of the conference with respect to the question of whether we should retain embargoes on food and medicine. 
   The answer to that is simple: Of course not. Of course we should not retain any embargoes on food and medicine. That is what the Senate said. By a vote of 70, the Senate said let us stop using food as a weapon. 
   We have used food as a weapon against Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea--you name it. We have embargoes. I do not have any problems with embargoes against countries that are behaving badly, but the embargo should not include food. Why would you want to include food and medicine in embargoes that hurt the poor folks around the globe, the people who need the food and medicine? 
   I have always maintained that when we put an embargo on food shipments anywhere in the world, it is the equivalent of shooting ourselves in the foot. When you do it for 40 years, it is almost unforgivable. It is one thing to shoot yourself in the foot; it is another thing to take aim, hit it, and then brag about it. That has been the policy. 
   The Senate, by 70 votes, said: No more; we are going to break the back of food embargoes; we are going to stop using food as a weapon; over; finished; done. 
   We went to conference, and the House of Representatives said: No, we want to continue using food as a weapon in some circumstances. The result is, we have not even been meeting in that conference, and the emergency help that is needed for family farmers around this country is not getting done because the conference is not meeting. 
   Hurricane Floyd roared up the east coast, and I am told that there are over 100,000 hogs floating belly up dead in floodwaters, along with a million chickens, untold heads of cattle and horses. There are crops underwater, devastated, and gone. The folks down in that region who were so badly hurt by Hurricane Floyd are flat on their backs wondering how they are going to get through this. How they will get through it depends on this Congress deciding whether it will extend a helping hand saying: When a natural disaster strikes, we want to help you. 
   Other farmers in my home state were flooded out this spring. Over three million acres of farmland did not get planted early this spring, and family farmers who did get acres planted have discovered that if they got a crop, it was, in many cases, a bad crop with sprout damage. If they got a good crop  and hauled it to the elevator, they were told by the grain market their crop was not worth anything because prices had collapsed. 
   The bill before the conference committee is a bill that provides from the Senate side, not the House side, emergency help for collapsed prices and disaster relief for the massive loss of livestock and for prevented planning. All of those issues are critical for family farmers. If this does not get done, we will have family farmers going belly up in record rates in the next couple of months. 
   It is unfathomable to me that we have this interminable delay in something that is so urgent. There wasn't a delay in passing a $792 billion tax cut that we could not afford, spending $792 billion in tax breaks over 10 years based on the premise that we might have surpluses in the future. We do not have surpluses yet. All we have are projections by economists. 
   Nobody knows what is going to happen in the future, but we are told to expect surpluses for 10 years. So before the first real surplus exists, we have folks rushing to the Senate Chamber to cut nearly $800 billion in taxes. There was an urgency to do that, a real urgency. We had to get it done immediately. But, of course, on the issue of providing disaster relief to family farmers, there is not quite the urgency, at least not for some. 
   There is a crisis in farm country. This deserves a response now. The conference ought to be meeting. We ought to pass emergency relief. We ought to pass disaster relief. We ought to extend a helping hand to farmers of this country to say: You matter. We care and want to help you get through these tough times. 
   Let me turn to the other issue that is related to the family farm crisis, the trade deficit. Last week, we heard from the Department of Commerce. We see in the newspapers that the trade deficit has gone up once again to a record high of $25.2 billion last month alone. 
   What does that have to do with farmers? It means we are selling less overseas than we used to. We are importing much more from other countries. 
   Here is an example of what is happening with our trade deficit with Canada. Mr. President, on this chart, 1998 is in blue; 1999 is in red. There was nearly a doubling of the trade deficit with Canada in one year, a dramatic increase in the trade deficit with Mexico, and a dramatic increase in the trade deficit with the European Union. Of course, these are much lower than the trade deficits that exist with China and Japan. We have huge trade deficits with China and Japan. 
   In addition to all of this, our family farmers in North Dakota who are hurting so badly are suffering from a massive quantity of durum wheat being shipped into our country, in my judgment illegally, by the Canadians. Last year saw the largest amount of durum wheat imports, and in the first 6 months of this year, the level of imports is 80 percent above that. 
   What is being done about all of this? Senator BYRD, Senator STEVENS, and I and others were able to establish a Trade Deficit Review Commission last year. That Commission is now meeting to make recommendations on the trade deficit. Otherwise, this matter has met with eerie silence. We do not hear anything from the administration. We do not hear anything from Congress about this issue. 
   This is a very serious issue that could easily undermine this country's economic growth. We have to do something about it, and we have to do something now. One of the things we ought to do is expect this administration to stand up and take action against unfair trade, which is part of this. I will show you what they have done. 
   We have a trade dispute with Europe, and the trade dispute actually is about a couple of things. One is beef, which is legitimate. The second is bananas. We do not produce bananas in the United States. We have American corporations that get bananas from the Caribbean and want to ship them to Europe. Europe does not want the Caribbean bananas, so we have a trade dispute on behalf of American corporations that are shipping to Europe something we do not produce. 
   So we are right and they are wrong. On the merits we are right. 
   It is always surprising to me. We fight so hard over bananas. How about durum wheat? Durum wheat deals with semolina flour. Semolina flour is made into pasta. When you eat pasta, you are eating something from the wheat fields, often in North Dakota. What about standing up for those producers? We stand up for banana producers in the Caribbean. What about standing up for wheat producers? 
   What have we done now? We have done nothing about the unfair trade from Canada, but we have taken tough action against the Europeans with respect to the banana and beef hormones cases. We said to the Europeans: You better watch it. We're going to take action against you on Roquefort cheese. That is tough. You whip somebody with Roquefort cheese. You can have a big fight. 
   Or even better, we are going to take action against your Roquefort cheese and chilled truffles. That is strong action. This is going to scare the devil out of the Europeans. 
   Do you know what else we are going to do? We have decided we are going to take action against goose livers. If that does not scare the Europeans, it will at least scare the geese. Goose livers, chilled truffles, Roquefort cheese--and finally tough action against animal bladders. That is not all. There are some regular things as well. 
   If we are going to get tough on trade--and I have been waiting for this a long time--maybe we can get tough on durum wheat. But, no, not us, not our trade ambassador. We get tough on goose livers. Maybe I missed the point. Maybe everybody in the world will miss the point. 
   If we can't stand up and insist on fair trade, on open markets overseas--and, yes, on fair trade at home, to be sure--if we can't do that, this country will never get this trade deficit under control. 
   The trade deficit is huge and growing. Almost everyone understands that it is dangerous. It is unsustainable. It will inevitably result in a weakened dollar and higher interest rates and less economic growth. This country must get a handle on the trade deficit. 
   I have sent a letter to President Clinton once again and said to the President: If this trade ambassador is not willing to take action against the Canadians, replace the trade ambassador. The Canadians are just one issue. Replace the trade ambassador if she will not take action. 
   This ambassador has the authority to self-initiate a trade complaint, and ought to do so. If the failure to do so at USTR is due to the ambassador, get an ambassador who will. 
   We are willing to get tough with the European over bananas--that we do not produce here. 
   Forgive me for being cynical. Forgive me for wondering if there is some common sense around here. How about standing up for things that matter in a way that says to our trading partners: This country demands action. This country demands open markets. This country demands fair trade. This country demands a stop to dumping in our marketplace. This country demands an end to unfair trade at secret prices by State trading enterprises that would not be legal in this country. 
   How does this relate to farmers? As I said before, family farmers must find a foreign home for much of what they produce. Regrettably, our trade policy has now produced very large trade deficits for two reasons. One is because foreign markets have evaporated, dried up, been reduced in size. 
   It is true that no one in the Congress or the administration caused the Asian crisis. I understand that. Yet there are other problems--the failure to enforce fundamental trade laws, the failure to enforce NAFTA, the negotiation of incompetent trade agreements; and then the failure to even live up to those incompetent agreements. This is not, in my judgment, something 
   that we should be expecting from our trade representatives. 
   Mr. President, I know my colleague from Utah is seeking recognition. How much time remains, if I might inquire?

   Mr. DORGAN. Let me take about 2 or 3 additional minutes. I know my colleague has things he would like to say to the Senate, as well. 
   Let me conclude by saying this. I regret coming to the floor and talking in these terms about the trade ambassador's office or about the administration. I think the trade strategy of this  Congress is abysmal, to the extent we have one--and I guess largely we do not because you do not hear anybody talking about a trade strategy except myself and a couple others. 
   It is this Congress that passed NAFTA. It is this Congress that passed the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement. It is this Congress that passed the WTO. I didn't vote for any one of the three. But we helped cause these problems, and we ought to help solve them. 
   This administration has a responsibility, and so does this Congress. And this Congress bears responsibility for the farm policy, the underlying farm policy that relates in some part to this trade policy that is such a significant failure. 
   Our President has been very helpful in trying to push for a disaster and emergency package that will be helpful to family farmers, to save them from catastrophe, the catastrophe of collapsed prices. 
   How would anyone in this Chamber, how would anyone in this country like to do business when someone says to you: By the way, your income is going to be changed this year. You say: How is that? And they say: You are going to receive depression-era income. We are going to adjust your income to depression levels. 
   That is what has happened to family farmers. How many here would like to lose 40, 60, or 80 percent of your income and be told that is the way the market system works? It is not the way it works in a country that cares about producing on the land with a network of family farms. 
   Europe does not do that. Europe has 7.5 million farms. And it says: We want you to stay on the farms because we want to have a healthy rural system in our country, with small towns that are thriving and family farms that are making a living. 
   That happens in Europe. It happens because they have public policy that demands it. This country does not have comparable public policy. I hope that it will someday soon. 
   This Congress must create that public policy. This President will lead in that direction. That is what he believes. This President is strong on those issues. I criticize this administration on trade. On farm policy, this administration has been very helpful. 
   It is this Congress that is dragging its feet. As a member of the conference committee, I hope very much that we will soon get back to work on an emergency and a disaster package to respond to the desperate needs of family farmers. 
   I also hope this administration will take action, aggressive action, to deal with these trade problems. I hope the administration and Congress will understand the gravity of the trade deficit and the gravity that the unsustainable increase in our current account deficit poses to this country's economy. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his courtesy. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, about four years ago I hosted NASA Director Dan Goldin at the University of North Dakota where he met with representatives from universities in Montana, North and South Dakota, Idaho and Wyoming. We felt it was important to meet with Mr. Goldin to explore ways in which NASA satellite data could be  helpful to the public in a region which has always seemed so far removed from the activities of NASA. 
   Over the course of these four years, I believe NASA has been very impressed with the innovations of this group, called the Upper Midwest Aerospace Consortium. UMAC's primary focus has been to make NASA data useful to the public, particularly farmers, ranchers, resource managers, educators, and small businesses. For example, noxious weed detection through the NASA satellite data has had an astounding effect on eradicating and stemming the spread of noxious weeds on cattle rangelands; wheat farmers have planned their fertilizer applications to optimize their crop yields; and teachers and teacher-educators have prepared geographic information systems that bring modern spatial technologies to rural classrooms. 
   All of these innovations and uses have been the result of three grants that UMAC has won competitively through NASA's peer review process. The organization has now proven its value in a region where NASA's presence had previously been nearly nonexistent. It has reached the juncture where it must achieve the stability that only a long-term commitment by NASA can ensure. 
   Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Maryland and Ranking Minority Member of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee is well acquainted with the value of NASA's presence in her own state. Now we in the upper Midwest have developed the nucleus for NASA to create a center which would support and advance NASA activities in our region. 
   The report accompanying this bill contains language urging NASA to consider creating a permanent center in the upper Midwest. While it is difficult to find funds in this bill for this purpose, I would urge the Senate to provide $1 million during conference on the bill toward the establishment of UMAC as a permanent entity to continue its work with NASA and the public.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Community Builders Program. Community Builders are providing an important customer service, and have been a key component of HUD's outreach efforts in rural states like North Dakota. As Mayor Carroll Erickson of Minot said: ``Through the Community Builders, HUD has become more accessible to communities such as Minot and to rural states like North Dakota. This program is very effective and it should be retained.'' Or, as Grand Forks Mayor Pat Owens said: ``HUD's increased outreach and consultation with non-traditional smaller communities is absolutely the right direction.'' 
   Mr. President, the Community Builders program was part of HUD's successful reorganization effort. Community Builders in North Dakota provide technical assistance that is absolutely vital to rural communities. Those who have used the program have praised it as an example of government's ability to provide helpful, efficient customer service. 
   It would be a shame, Mr. President, for this successful program to be terminated even as it is starting to yield results. I urge the conferees to strongly support this program. I urge them to enable HUD's Community Builders to continue their important work of serving America's rural and urban communities.

   Mr. DORGAN. I have listened with some interest not only to the Senator from Nevada but to other of my colleagues who are speaking about the issue before the Senate. I know the Senator from Nevada is talking about the budget problems we have. The fact is, we don't have enough money for education, health care, and a range of things. That is why we have not had the appropriations bills brought to the floor for those areas. The Senator from Nevada is talking about those issues. 
   The issue that has been raised by the Senator from California is the issue of royalties paid with respect to the extraction of oil. My understanding of this issue--and I know there has been a discussion of it at some length here--is that in integrated oil companies, where you have oil companies raising oil and then selling it to themselves, the value of the oil they are pulling from the ground is an issue they largely decide and report to the Government and say: By the way, that oil didn't have much value; therefore, I am not going to pay you much in royalties. 
   So when the folks get out there and look at these sweetheart transactions from companies which own each other, one to another, they discover that this oil has been radically undervalued, and the interests that have been denied the rightful opportunities here are the American public; the American people haven't gotten their royalties. They have not received the fair amount of royalties. When the oilers go look at this, they say, you can't do that, you can't undervalue this, and therefore cheat the public out of what is theirs. 
   I guess the dispute here is a circumstance where someday we want that to continue to exist: Let them continue to sell oil to themselves, and price the way they want to, and avoid paying royalties. 
   The Senator from Nevada makes the point that when we do that, we end up not getting the money we should get for the American public, and these royalties belong to the public. Second, we don't have the resources we need, then, to make the investments in children, health care, and other things. That is the point, I think, the Senator from Nevada makes. 
   I find it interesting. I was a State tax administrator in the State of North Dakota before I came to this body, and I will give you another example that is almost exactly like this. We had to value railroads. We had to establish a value on railroads for tax purposes. The railroads said to the State of North Dakota, well, the value of the railroads is computed by describing all of the stock and all of the debt, assuming you bought all the stock and assumed the debt. That is what the railroads told the State. The railroads said: By the way, the value of our stock is par value, which is printed on the certificate. Of course, that is not the value of the stock. But for many years the State of North Dakota accepted par value on the stock as representative of the value of the railroad. They radically underpaid their taxes because of it. 
   When I became tax administrator, having taken a look at that, I decided that was not going to stand. Of course, the railroads didn't like it at all when we changed the method. That is exactly what is at stake here with respect to the oil companies. They sell oil to themselves and underprice it so they can avoid paying royalties to the American people, who are owed these royalties, and they don't want this interrupted. They say: We don't want to change the way we are doing this; we like it. Of course they like it, because they are not paying the royalties they owe to the American people. 
   The Senator from Nevada makes the point that it is not fair.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to let my colleagues know that I am a cosponsor of S. 1473, the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities Act. I believe this bill is an important step in the right direction, though I still have serious concerns about the discrepancy of funding levels between rural and urban Empowerment Zones. 
   First, let me say I strongly support the Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Community concept. Areas that are designated as Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities combine tax credits and social service grants to promote long-term economic revitalization. These communities take a grassroots approach to revitalization by building partnerships with local government, non-profit groups and the private sector--thus allowing the federal government to support the work done on a local level. 
   The problem, Mr. President, is that Round II Empowerment Zones are not fully funded and are not receiving the same tax benefits as Round I Empowerment Zones. Will Rogers once said, ``I don't make jokes. I just watch the government and report the facts.'' I'm afraid this holds all too true for those who have struggled to see the Round II Empowerment Zones live up to their expectation. When the Griggs/Steele Empowerment Zone in eastern North Dakota was designated a Round II Empowerment Zone last year, the federal government made a commitment to help leaders in these communities create jobs and economic opportunity. Unfortunately, however, this Empowerment Zone still hasn't received one dime of federal funding. Those who live in the Griggs/Steele Empowerment Zone are now beginning to question the commitment of the federal government to make good on its promises. 
   I am co-sponsoring this bill because I think Congress has a responsibility to do the right thing and fully fund Round II Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities throughout this country. Having said that, I am very concerned about the discrepancy in funding between rural and urban areas. Like far too many proposals we debate here in Congress, this bill disproportionately grants much more funding for urban areas than rural areas. Of the $1.75 billion this legislation would provide over 9 years, urban areas receive almost 86% of the total funding. Although I recognize that we've made some progress and narrowed the gap that existed between rural and urban areas in the original proposal, I hope we can do more to help rural areas of this country currently facing so many challenges to economic prosperity. 
   Despite my concerns about the bill on these grounds, I am cosponsoring this legislation because I recognize that Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities need this funding in a timely manner to accomplish the economic revitalization the federal government promised. I will continue to work to ensure that rural Round II EZ/ECs receive the full funding and tax benefits they deserve.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today there was an announcement by the Commerce Department about this country's monthly trade deficit. This month our trade deficit in goods and services surged to a high of $25.2 billion just for the month. If you are just worried about manufactured goods, it's much higher than that; but for goods and services, the trade deficit was $25.2 billion just this month. It is the 7th consecutive month. We have a very serious trade deficit problem and nothing seems to be being done about it. 
   I want to show my colleagues a chart that describes what is happening with both exports and imports in this country. Incidentally, this will be met with a large yawn tomorrow in the newspapers. I assume the daily papers here in Washington, DC, will go to the same so-called experts for comments about what is causing the trade deficit. They will give the same comments they have given month after month, year after year. In fact, in the old days they used to say that the reason we have a trade deficit is because we have a fiscal policy deficit and as soon as we get rid of the budget or fiscal policy deficit, we will not run a trade deficit. Of course that is not the case. The trade deficit continues to grow at an alarming pace, even when the Federal budget deficit is largely erased. 
   The question is whether this Congress and this administration will decide that the current trade policy, which is drowning this country in red ink, will be changed and if so how it will be changed. I find it interesting that we are now headed towards a World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, in late November and early December. During that first week of December, our trade officials will go to Seattle and talk with representatives from other countries around the world, talking about our trade policies. If ever there was a need for this country to decide its current trade strategy is unworkable, it is now, at this moment. 
   I thought it would be interesting to talk a little bit about what our trade officials have been doing while this huge trade deficit continues to explode. Recently, this country got angry with the European Union for, among other things, the European Union's refusal to lower barriers to the import of bananas into Europe. We do not produce bananas, but large American companies produce bananas in the Caribbean. They wanted to ship these bananas into Europe, but Europe didn't want their bananas. 
   This got us upset, so this country is taking tough action against Europe. We said, Europe, if you don't shape up this is what we are going to do. We are going to impose 100 percent tariffs on your products and selected the products we want to impose 100 percent tariffs on. 
   We went through a similar dispute with the European Union over imports of beef with growth hormones. And we imposed 100 percent tariffs on selected products. Let me show you what they are, among others: Roquefort cheese. That is getting tough, imposing a 100 percent tariff on Roquefort cheese. Goose livers--that's going to scare the devil out of the Europeans, a 100 percent tariff on goose livers. How about chilled truffles? That is getting tough. And animal bladders. 
   So this country cranks up all its energy because we can't get 
   bananas we don't produce into Europe. In our dispute over beef hormones, we decide that we are going to clamp down on goose livers, truffles, and animal bladders. That is a trade strategy? I don't think so. If down at Trade Ambassador's office, down at Commerce or elsewhere, you want to do something to help this country's trade balance, then get serious about it. Do something to stand up for this country's producers. Force open foreign markets and demand--literally demand--other countries to stop the dumping of products into our marketplace below their acquisition cost, injuring our producers. 
   I have talked for a moment about goose livers, truffles, Roquefort cheese and animal bladders. Let me talk about something that is a bit different--durum wheat that is being hauled into this country from Canada in record supply. In North Dakota we produce 80 percent of all the durum produced in America. Durum, by the way, is ground into semolina flour and then turned into pasta. If you eat pasta, you are likely eating something that came from a field in North Dakota. Guess what is happening? Our farmers are losing money hand over fist, and at the same time Canadian farmers are dumping massive quantities of durum wheat into our marketplace, undercutting our farmers and injuring them badly. 
   What are we doing about it? Nothing. We don't lift a finger. We are willing to go to war over truffles and goose livers. We are willing to take tough action against the Europeans with Roquefort cheese. Do you think anybody will go to the northern border and decide to stop unfair trade coming into this country, injuring our family farmers? No. Not with this trade strategy. 
   This Congress and this administration need to understand that this is a very serious problem. Today's announcement of a $25.2 billion trade deficit for the month of July suggests again that we must take additional action. As we head towards the December meeting of the World Trade Organization, and as we see this morning's announcement about the trade deficit, I hope meetings here in the Congress, and with the administration, will allow us to develop a trade strategy that better represents this country's economic interests, stands up for this country's producers, and demands open foreign markets. 
   Mr. President, I know the Senator from Vermont wants to speak on the bill that is going to be pending so at this point let me yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, with respect to the question offered by the Senator from Florida, my understanding is that the caps established in the Balanced Budget Act represent aggregate caps and one can have individual subcommittees coming out with spending levels, and if those spending levels in the aggregate, with all the subcommittees, exceed the caps, you have a problem. 
   This particular subcommittee has worked very hard to try to produce an appropriations bill that is responsible. 
   Nearly one-half of all Federal law enforcement is in this particular subcommittee. People do not understand that. But Customs, Secret Service, and a range of other law enforcement activities to fight drugs and crime exist in this bill. 
   Almost one-half of Federal law enforcement is in this piece of legislation. 
   I will not repeat what the Senator from Colorado described about what we did in the subcommittee. But I think it is responsible and thoughtful and most every Member of the Senate thinks it is a pretty good investment. 
   One of the things we didn't do in this piece of legislation is fund courthouse construction. Does there need to be some money invested in courthouses around the country to rehab some old courthouses and rebuild some? Yes, but we simply didn't have the money. We were short of resources. We had to make some difficult choices. That was one of them. It is not that the Senator from Colorado and I believe there is not a need; there is a need. But we just weren't able to respond to that. 
   I would like to add to his comments with respect to the work that has been done both in the Senate and in the House of Representatives on this bill. 
   On my staff, Chip Walgren, Barbara Retzlaff, and Dylan Presman did excellent work, and Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin, and Lula Edwards of the majority staff have done wonderful work. 
   It has been a pleasure to work with Senator CAMPBELL. He is easy to work with. He is thoughtful and wants to do the right thing. It is a pleasure to work with someone with that kind of interest. 
   The subcommittee bill is a piece of legislation that strengthens the Government's commitment to fight drugs and crime, and the Department of the Treasury, as I indicated, has a critical law enforcement role. That is funded in this piece of legislation. 
   One of the pieces of legislation inside this bill is called the GREAT Program--Gang Resistance Education and Training Program. 
   One day not too long ago, I was invited to go over to Anacostia to a junior high school for a ceremony where some young kids were graduating from the GREAT Program, the Gang Resistance Education and Training Program. This is a school, by the way, that has had significant gang problems and a great deal of crime. 
   One of the police officers who is assigned to that school full time came to the meeting we had on Capitol Hill. He was describing the problems in that school--horrendous problems. We called to see if perhaps the GREAT Program could be taken to that school because they weren't participating. That program was taken over to the school, and the first graduates received their diplomas. 
   I went over that day with the commissioner. It was really quite remarkable. It is a wonderful program to invest in to try to educate young people about the dangers of gangs and drugs and crime. 
   Part of this legislation is to make the right kind of investments to prevent activities in this country that we know are destructive. 
   This piece of legislation continues to reform the IRS. It modernizes the Federal Election Commission. Several pieces we have put in this bill are the first steps in modernizing the FEC --the first steps that have been taken for a long, long while. 
   I commend this legislation to my colleagues. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will approve the work of this subcommittee. The conference with the House was difficult, but I think it produced a result that is fair and one that will merit the support of the Members of the Senate. 
   Again, I thank Senator CAMPBELL, who I think does a remarkable job, and his staff and the staff that has worked so hard on my behalf on the legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Minnesota yielding for a question. I suppose some people get irritated about those of us, Senator WELLSTONE, myself, Senator CONRAD, Senator HARKIN, and others who come to the floor to talk so much about the plight of family farmers. But at a time when our newspapers trumpet the growing economy and the good news on Wall Street with a stock market that keeps going up, at the same time we have a full-scale crisis in rural America with grain prices for family farmers in constant dollars being about where they were in 
   the Great Depression. 
   I held a meeting with Senator WELLSTONE in Minnesota. I held a hearing with Senator HARKIN in Iowa. During the August break we held a hearing in North Dakota under the auspices of the Democratic Policy Committee, and we heard the same thing we have been hearing; that is, we have a serious problem with low prices. You cannot solve this without dealing with prices. Farmers are paying more for what they purchase and getting less for what they sell. 
   I wanted to just mention two items and then ask the Senator from Minnesota a question. We had a Unity Day rally in North Dakota; 1,600 farmers came. The most memorable moment, I guess, was from a fellow named Arlo, who was an auctioneer. He told of doing an auction sale at this family farm. A little boy came up to him at the end of the sale and grabbed him by the leg, and with tears in his eyes, shouted up at him, he said: You sold my dad's tractor. 
   The auctioneer, named Arlo, he kind of put his hand on the boy's shoulder to calm him down a bit. The boy wasn't to be calmed. He had tears in his eyes. He said: I wanted to drive that tractor when I got big. 
   That is what this is about. The mother who lost her farm, who wrote to me and said during the auction sale her 17-year-old son refused to come out of the house to help with the auction sale, refused to come out of his bedroom. That was not because he is a bad kid, but because he so desperately wanted to keep that family farm and was so absolutely heartbroken and could not bring himself to participate in the sale of that farm. That is the human misery that exists on today's family farms. 
   They are the canary in the mine shaft, with this kind of economic circumstance. Somehow there is a suggestion that what matters in this country is the Dow Jones Industrial Average and not a beautiful wheat field or cattle in the pasture or a hardware store on Main Street. Somehow it is just all numbers and it doesn't matter whether we have a lot of farmers or a couple of corporate farms. 
   I ask the Senator from Minnesota during his travels--I know Senator WELLSTONE was not only in Minnesota but all around this country in August at farm unity rallies--if he heard anyone, anywhere, believing the so-called Freedom to Farm bill made any sense at all? That is the Freedom to Farm bill that pulls the rug out from under family farmers and says it doesn't matter what the market price of grain is,  you operate the market. You don't need a safety net. A lot of other folks in the country have safety nets, but the farmers are told, no, you don't need a safety net. 
   Did the Senator find anybody in this country who said: I wrote that bill, I stand behind that bill, that bill makes good sense, and that bill is working?

<TEXT>
   Mr. DORGAN. If I can further inquire of the Senator from Minnesota, he is going to be joined and is joined by a number of our colleagues who insist we do something about this farm problem. It is not satisfactory to watch the auction sales occur across the heartland of this country. If you take a look at what is going on in our country and evaluate where we are losing population--I have a map I have shown many times on the floor of the Senate where I have outlined in red all of the counties that have lost more than 10 percent of its population, and we have a huge red circle in the middle of America. Those counties are losing population. 
   We are depopulating the farm belt in this country because somehow we are told the future of agriculture is the future of corporate agriculture, corporate agrifactories. We can raise hogs by the thousands; we can raise chickens by the millions; we do not need real people driving tractors; we do not need real people living on the land; corporations can farm America from California to Maine. 
   When that happens, if that happens, this country will have lost something very important. I do not know whether the Senator from Minnesota has read Richard Critchfield. He is an author who has passed away. He was from Fargo, ND, originally. He went on to become a world-renowned author. He wrote a lot of books about rural America. One of the things he wrote about was the refreshment of family values in this country always rolled from family farms to small towns to big cities. The seedbed of family values was always coming from America's family farms--raising a barn after a disaster, the pie socials, the gatherings on Saturday in the small town to celebrate the harvest, the family values that come from living on the land, raising food for a hungry nation, raising children in a crime-free environment, building a school, building communities, building churches, building a way of life. 
   Somehow we are told those are values that do not matter. What matters is the marketplace, the market system, so if huge grain companies decide when a farmer plants a crop and harvests a crop and takes it to the market that the crop is not worth anything, that is the way life is. 
   At the same time that farmer is driving a crop to the elevator and told the food does not have any value, we have old women climbing trees in the Sudan foraging for leaves to eat because they are desperately on the verge of starvation. There is something broken about this system. Family farmers are told with the Freedom to Farm they are free. Are you free from monopolistic railroads that overcharge? They do. In our North Dakota, our Public Service Commission said they overcharge over $100 million just in our 
   State, and most of that is from farmers. 
   Are you free of grain trade monopolies that choke the economic life out of farmers? They are not free from that. 
   Are you free from mergers and concentrations so that in every direction a farmer looks they find two or three firms controlling it all? Do you want to fatten up a steer and ship the steer to a packing plant? Good for you because you have three choices that slaughter 80 percent of the steers in America. 
   Do you think that is a deck that is stacked against you? Or how about this, free from trade agreements that stack the deck against family farmers? Try to take a load of durum wheat into Canada. I did once. We had millions--12 million bushels--of Canadian durum wheat shipped into this country undermining our market in the first 6 months of this year alone. 
   I went up with a man named Earl in a 12-year-old orange truck with 200 bushels of durum. All the way to the border, we found these trucks with millions of bushels of wheat coming south. I know I have told the story before. If people are tired of hearing it, it does not matter to me a bit. I will continue talking about it because it talks about the fundamental unfairness of our trade. 
   We got to the border with Earl's orange truck and 200 bushels. We were stopped at the border because you cannot get that American durum into Canada. Why? Because our trade agreements that have been made by trade negotiators who have forgotten who they work for are incompetent trade agreements that sold out the interests of family farmers in this country. Farmers have every right to be very angry about it and ought to demand it changes. 
   Those are a few areas--mergers and concentration, grain trade, railroads, bad trade agreement, and a Freedom to Farm bill that says price support for farmers do not matter much. We know how wrong that is. 
   The question for this country of ours is this: We ramped up as a nation a few years ago to save Mexico in times of serious financial crisis. Will a country that is willing to ramp up its effort to save a neighbor, will a country that is willing to commit $50 billion to save Mexico decide that it is worth saving family farmers in times of crisis? We have people who say it is not worth that, we ought not take the time, we do not have the ability, we do not have the money, we do not have the ideas, they say. 
   This is not rocket science. It is easy. I say, change the Freedom to Farm bill to a bill that says how about freedom to make a decent living. If you grow food and are good at it, there ought to be a connection between efforts and reward. We ought not have the notion there are minimum wages and minimum opportunities and all kinds of  other safety nets across the country, but for families who stay on American farms and raise their kids and support small towns, there is nothing but a bleak future because corporations are taking over what they do, and that is just fine for the future, some will say. 
   It is not fine for the future. This is about who we are as a country, who we want to be. It is about the soul of this country, and if this country, as Thomas Jefferson used to say, does not care about broad-based economic ownership and opportunity for the American people, then it will quickly lose its political freedoms as well. 
   Political freedom relates to economic freedom. Economic freedom comes from broad-based economic ownership, and nowhere is that more important and more evident than in the production of this country's food. 
   I ask the Senator from Minnesota one question: Isn't it the case that there are 7 million people in Europe farming who get a decent price for their farm product because the countries of Europe have been hungry and have decided, as a matter of national security and economic and social policy, they want families living on the farm operating European farms? Isn't it the case that is the policy in Europe--and God bless them and good for them--and that policy is contrasted with folks, some in this Chamber, who say that ought not be the policy? Our policy ought to be to say whatever happens happen; if corporations farm America, that is fine. Isn't that the case? Isn't that the dichotomy of the two policies?

   Mr. DORGAN. If my colleague will yield, this is remarkable. I was eating Grape Nuts, actually, when I read that this morning. That is not always a pleasant experience unless you have plenty of sugar. And then you get the newspaper and you read a headline that says, ``GOP Seeks to Ease Crunch With 13-Month Fiscal Year.'' 
   I am thinking to myself, I have been around this place for some time and have grappled with a lot of fiscal policy problems. If we had thought of this a long while ago, we would not have all of these problems. If you have a problem, just change the calendar. 
   That would raise of course the question of what to name this new month. I suppose if they were really serious they could do what all the sports stadiums do, and just sell the name. How much money could you raise with a Microsoft month or a US Airways month? I suppose there are all kinds of possibilities along this line. But I think most people would look at this and say that it is not very serious governance--when you have a problem you cannot fix you create another month and then pretend you fixed it. 
   Some State legislative bodies have a rule that they must adjourn by a particular time. So what they do occasionally, is to take a black cloth and cover  the clock. Now we have budgeteers who think the way to solve a fiscal problem is to add another month to the calendar. 
   I don't know. We hear a lot of Byzantine and bizarre suggestions in this Chamber from time to time. But this one has to rank right up there. As a young schoolboy in the southwestern ranching country of North Dakota, I learned the days of the months through a little ditty. We all know it. Perhaps now it should be changed:  
   Thirty days hath September, 
   April, June, and November, 
   All the rest have 31, 
   Except the Republicans, 
   They have an extra month.  
   This is going to be confusing to a whole generation of schoolchildren if the GOP decides they are going to mess with the calendar. 
   We have had the lunar calendar, the solar calendar, the Gregorian calendar--I assume my colleague explained much of the history of the calendar. Perhaps the creative minds here in the Senate will make history when they try to find their way out of the corner into which they have painted themselves. 
   Let me yield the floor at this point to my colleague from North Dakota.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have had an opportunity to discuss this a bit, the gimmickry of doing all of these things. I was talking to my colleague, Senator BYRD, who has spent a great deal of time on the floor telling us about Roman history. We were just discussing the front page of this morning's newspaper with the headline about the easing of the fiscal crunch by creating a 13th month. Senator BYRD indicated that Julius Caesar in trying to reconstruct the calendar, somewhere around 46 B.C., decided he was going to have a 15-month year. Senator BYRD knows about all of these things. He has given wonderful lectures on the floor of the Senate about the rich history of the Roman Empire. 
   I just now learned this from our distinguished colleague. So apparently, I would say to Senator CONRAD, what we are discussing today has been done before. Julius Caesar did it, and he added 3 months to the calendar, apparently.

   Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield, there is nothing to stop the Senate at 13 months. This relates to the whole aging process, which I think would be of great interest to a number of Senators. If this Senate enacted a longer year, and perhaps went to 15, 18, or even 19 months, we would have folks running for election who are 75 years old but who could claim they are only 68.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall object on behalf of Senator DASCHLE, the Democratic leader. But before doing so, I would like to point out the Senate passed S. 1467, which is a 60-day extension of the airport grant program. We have dealt with this issue of the reauthorization act for some long while. 
   In fact, in the Commerce Committee on which I and the majority leader both serve, we have passed S. 82. It has been waiting to be brought to the floor of the Senate for debate. The process that is described by Senator LOTT would, in effect, prohibit Senators from debating this issue on the floor of the Senate. Because the House passes an omnibus bill and attaches it to the 60-day extension, the Senate does not have the opportunity to debate. It means people who have amendments they would like to offer, perhaps, to the bill that we wrote in the Commerce Committee will not have that opportunity. This will then be decided in conference. That is not appropriate and not something we could agree to. 
   But I do want to say, and I expect the majority leader probably disagrees, this process has been abysmal. We have a system in this country with radical expansion of the number of people flying. The FAA is an organization that desperately needs some assistance and some predictability and consistency with a reauthorization they can count on. We should have done this long ago. Passing 60-day extensions doesn't serve anybody's interest. 
   Several days on the floor of the Senate would resolve this from the standpoint of the larger reauthorization bill and move this process forward. I will be forced to object to the unanimous consent request for those reasons, the request offered by the majority leader. I do so object, and then I would like to offer a unanimous consent request on a different way to accomplish the same result. But I object to the unanimous consent request by the majority leader.

   Mr. DORGAN. If I might ask the majority leader for the opportunity to offer a unanimous consent request? 
   I ask consent the Senate disagree to the House amendments so the message on this bill can be returned to the House this afternoon. That would enable the House to recede from its amendment and send S. 1467, the short-term extension bill the Senate passed on August 2, to the President immediately for his signature. This would ensure this process would continue, local airports would be able to receive the estimated $290 million in funds due through the end of this fiscal year, and do that until the Senate has had an opportunity to consider the FAA reauthorization bill. We should do that. Senators have that right. It ought to be a priority. I hope we can accomplish that. I make this in the form of a unanimous consent request.

   Mr. DORGAN. I observe on March 8 the Commerce Committee took action on S. 82, which is the reauthorization of the FAA. So we have had a substantial amount of time elapse. I think the Senator from Mississippi agrees with me that the number of people using the aviation system in this country has expanded dramatically. The capacity is being substantially taxed in many ways, and we really do need to pass a reauthorization bill. It is critically important that we get at this business. I respect the difficulty of time that a majority leader has to deal with, but this is a big issue, the issue of safety and protecting the system by which we have an aviation transportation system in our country, one that we are very proud of but one that desperately is waiting for and needs a reauthorization bill passed by the Senate. We ought to have the opportunity to debate that in the Senate, get to conference, and we ought to make this a priority.

I observe that Senator DASCHLE and Senator LOTT had conversations about the specific language in the proposal. My understanding is there are meetings, in fact, scheduled midday today to review the language. I expect there may be some opportunity to come to some common understanding on language that will be acceptable. There has been no such agreement at this point. While these discussions are ongoing, on behalf of Senator DASCHLE, I object.

   Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, but I would like to make a couple of inquiries of the majority leader. 
   I ask the majority leader about the issue of scheduling the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for debate in the Senate. While I have asked that, let me make an observation. The majority leader just described the difficulties the leadership has, both the majority leader and the minority leader, in scheduling business before the Senate. I respect that. I do not think he is crying wolf. It is a difficult problem. 
   I once saw a juggler juggle a potato chip, a bowling ball, and a chain saw that was running. It occurred to me that one was light, one was heavy, and one was dangerous. That is probably the kind of juggling act Senator LOTT and Senator DASCHLE are required to do weekly and monthly. 
   The distinction of understanding what is light and heavy and what is dangerous, for that matter, is a very important distinction. Let me describe something I think is very heavy in terms of a public issue and public policy. That is the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty signed by 152 countries and sent to this Senate 718 days ago without one hearing. 
   I believe so strongly--and I know the Senator from Mississippi knows I spoke earlier this week on the floor about it --that we have a responsibility to provide leadership in the world on the issue of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. This treaty is a baby step in that direction. 
   So far, we have not been able to get even 1 day of hearings on this treaty. I believe very strongly that this is one of those heavy public policy issues which is important for our country and important for the world. I want very much to have some assurance that we are going to have an opportunity to debate and vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty at some point. 
   I inquire of the majority leader where we are with respect to that treaty, why we have not been able to have hearings, and when we might expect some action on the floor of the Senate with respect to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

   Mr. DORGAN. Further reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, but I do want to respond to a couple of the comments that were made. We should not rush into this. No one would ever accuse the Senate of speeding on an issue such as this--718 days. It is very unusual that we have not had an opportunity to act on this treaty after 718 days without even 1 day of hearings. So no one will accuse the Senate of rushing to judgment on this issue. 
   It is an uncertain and difficult world. That is precisely why it is important to address this issue. This country has no moral standing, or very little moral suasion to be going to India and Pakistan and saying to them: Do not detonate additional nuclear weapons. Sign and ratify this treaty. The fact is Russia and China, and others, wait on us. 
   The majority leader talked about a piece in today's newspaper written by Charles Krauthammer. 
   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD a much better piece on this same subject that appeared two days ago in the Washington Post in the form of an editorial supporting the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and reserve the right later to ask at some time to include an even better piece that will be in response to today's Krauthammer article this morning that I and some others will try to write for the Washington Post.

   Mr. DORGAN. I guess I heard the majority leader indicate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is tied up with several other treaties, and he equated it to a stool that has a bunch of legs to it--at lease three legs. But I say this: this is not a stool and not legs that connect. There is no connection between the Kyoto treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The U.S. has already decided we are not testing nuclear weapons. We have not tested since the early 1990s. 
   I would love to have a long debate about this. I feel strongly that the treaty is needed in order to prevent others from testing and in order to prevent others from believing they have acquired nuclear weapons that work, because you cannot believe they work unless you have tested them. If we have a regime in which the world decides, through leadership from this country and others, that it will not test nuclear weapons any longer, we will have taken a step to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
   We can have that debate and should have that debate. But we have not even had the first day of hearings. What I heard the Senator from Mississippi say, I think, is that he has encouraged the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations to hold hearings, to hold hearings on this treaty. 
   The reason I ask the question is I don't want to add to your burdens--you have plenty--but I indicated earlier this week I certainly will be prepared to add to your burdens and the burdens of Senator DASCHLE when you try to schedule this place because this is one of those heavy issues, important issues. We ought to have the opportunity to consider this issue as a Senate. 
   So I ask the Senator from Mississippi, will we be able to expect hearings will be held in the Foreign Relations Committee 
   on this subject, and, if so, when?

   This is a very controversial matter but very important and one I believe the Senate ought to be entitled to debate. Based on the majority leader's response, I will look forward to further discussing with him next week. 
   Let me say I appreciate the fact he has initiated an effort to ask that we have some hearings held in the Senate. I think that is movement, and that is exactly what should happen.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Maine is waiting to speak on the floor. Let me just take 2 or 3 minutes. I will be mercifully brief. I wanted to make a couple of comments, however, before we discontinue this session for the week, especially in light of the comments that were just made by my distinguished colleague from Texas. 
   We have returned from an August recess in which most of us spent a great deal of time in our home States around America talking to our constituents about their hopes and their dreams and their aspirations. 
   One of the things I found in North Dakota is that people believe very strongly that if this country is blessed with better economic times--and we certainly have had good economic times in recent years--that produce a budget surplus, we ought to as a 
   country decide to use a significant part of that surplus to reduce the Federal debt. If during bad economic times you increase the Federal debt, during good economic times you ought to reduce the Federal debt. 
   We have a $5.7 trillion Federal debt. We have been very fortunate to eliminate the yearly Federal budget deficit, but we still have this debt that we have run up as a country over many years. It seems to me that one of the best thing for America's future to use some of the expected future surplus to reduce this debt. 
   But it is important in the context of a discussion of the type we just heard about tax cuts to understand the following: There is not yet a surplus. There are only economists who estimate in the next 10 years we will have a surplus. These are economists who don't know what will happen in the future. They do not have the foggiest notion. They are giving us an educated guess. 
   Prior to the last recession in America, 35 of the 40 leading economists said in the next year we will have sustained economic growth. In fact, almost all of the leading economists were wrong. The next year we had a recession. 
   A friend of my mine described the field of economics as psychology pumped up with a little helium. That is probably a pretty good description. I, in fact, taught economics for a couple of years. Economists are telling us that we will have 10 years of economic good times and therefore very large budget surpluses. On that basis, we have people in this Congress who say: Well, if that is the case, let us enact a very sizable tax cut. 
   So the Congress enacted a $792 billion tax cut over 10 years, this despite the fact that we don't yet have a budget surplus, we only have projections of budget surpluses. 
   I voted against the $792 billion proposed tax cut. It is, in my judgment, unwise to cut taxes and therefore decrease revenues when we don't have actual surpluses, only projections. There is plenty of time in the future to deal with surpluses, if in fact they exist. And if we can't agree on how to deal with them and the best of all worlds will occur, it will mean that the Federal debt is reduced because Congress doesn't decide what else to do with the surplus. 
   It is interesting that with all of this discussion in August back home around the country, I think most Members of the Senate discovered that their constituents believed that to rush to propose a very sizable tax cut with only an economic projection over the next 10 years was not a very thoughtful or appropriate way to deal with this country's fiscal policy. 
   We have had good fiscal policy in this country that has given some people the confidence that we are doing the right things. Almost 7 years ago, we had an enormous annual Federal budget deficit. It was $290 billion, and it was growing. Now it is gone. Why? Because this Congress had the courage to say we are not going to put up with that anymore. We are going to change direction and strategy. And we did. We had a vote. By one vote in the Senate, we changed this country's fiscal policy. It was a tough vote and a political vote. An easy vote would have been to say: Don't count me in on that. It actually raised taxes on income for some folks. Don't count me in on that. That is unpopular. Well, count me in. I voted for it. I am proud that I did. It was the right thing. This country was on the wrong track. 
   We changed the approach to fiscal policy and said to the American people that we were willing to do tough things. We were willing to make tough decisions. Guess what happened. The American people, I think as a result, have more confidence in the future. This entire economy rests on the mattress of confidence. If they are confident, they do certain things. If they are confident, they buy a car, they buy a home, they take a vacation, and do  the kind of things that move this economy along. If they are not confident about the future, they decide not to make those decisions, they decide to withhold this purchase, or that purchase, and it affects the economy. 
   What we did about 7 years ago dramatically changed the fiscal policy of this country. This country has had unprecedented economic expansion, and a huge and growing Federal budget deficit is now eliminated. 
   What remains is the Federal debt that occurred from all of those years of spending. The question is, What should we do about that? The answer for many in this Senate who voted to pass a tax cut was to say what we should do about that is essentially ignore that; let's provide a very large tax cut right now just based on projections by economists who often cannot even remember their home address. That is not good policy. I am pleased that I voted against it. 
   I think most Americans believe that the right approach for this Congress is to continue on this path we are on of good solid fiscal policy, believing that if and when we have true, good economic times and significant budget surpluses, a major part of that ought to be used to reduce the Federal debt. 
   What greater gift can we give to America's children than to eliminate the Federal debt of $5.7 trillion? 
   Let me thank my colleague from Maine. She has been most patient. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on October 6, 7, and 8, there will be a meeting in Vienna, Austria. It will be among countries that have ratified something called the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. That treaty is embodied in this document I hold in my hand. 
   Now, what is the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty? It is a treaty negotiated by a number of countries around the world; 152 countries, in fact, have signed the treaty and 44 countries have ratified the treaty. It is a treaty designed to prohibit any further explosive testing of nuclear weapons anywhere in the world, at any time, under any condition. 
   This treaty ought to be an easy treaty for this country and this Senate to ratify. But we have not done so. At a time when India and Pakistan explode nuclear weapons literally under each other's chins--these are two countries that don't like each other--at a time when we have evidence of more proliferation of nuclear weapons into the hands of countries that want access to nuclear weapons with which to, in some cases, defend themselves, perhaps in other cases to terrorize the rest of the world, this country ought to be exhibiting leadership. It is our moral responsibility to provide leadership in the world on these issues. This country ought to provide leadership on the issue of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
   We have not ratified this treaty. At the meeting in Vienna, countries that have ratified it will participate in discussing the implementation of this treaty, and this country will not be an active participant. Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, Canada, Italy, Norway, Poland, and France will be but we will not. We are the largest nuclear superpower on Earth and we have not ratified this treaty. 
   What about nuclear weapons and nuclear war? I was in the presence of a nuclear weapon recently at a military installation. If you stand a foot or two away from a nuclear weapon and look at it, it is a relatively small canister-looking device that, upon explosion, will devastate portions of our Earth. 
   Going back nearly 40 years to an address by John F. Kennedy, he said something about nuclear weapons. In fact, he quoted Nikita Khrushchev:  
   Since the beginning of history, war has been mankind's constant companion. It has been the rule, not the exception. Even a nation as young and as peace-loving as our own has fought through eight wars. A war today or tomorrow, if it led to nuclear war, would not be like any war in history. A full-scale nuclear exchange, lasting less than 60 minutes, with the weapons now in existence, could wipe out more than 300 million Americans, Europeans, and Russians, as well as untold numbers elsewhere. And the survivors, as Chairman Khrushchev warned the Communist Chinese, ``the survivors would envy the dead.'' For they would inherit a world so devastated by explosions and poison and fire that today we cannot even conceive of its horrors.  
   This country and Russia have 30,000 nuclear weapons between them. Other countries want nuclear weapons, and they want them badly. To the extent that any other country cannot test nuclear weapons, no one will know whether they have a nuclear weapon that works. No one will have certainty that they have access to nuclear weaponry. That is why the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is so critical. 
   Now, where is it? Well, it is here in the Senate. It has been here 716 days, with not even 1 day of hearings. Not one. Virtually every other treaty sent to the Senate has been given a hearing and has been brought to the Senate floor and debated and voted upon. The issue of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the stopping of explosive testing of nuclear weapons is not 
   important enough to be brought to the Senate floor for a debate. It has been over 700 days. Not 1 day of hearings. 
   In October, this country, which ought to be the moral leader on this issue, will not be present as a ratified member at the implementing meetings for this treaty. Shame on us. We have a responsibility to do this. There are big issues and small issues in this Congress. This is a big issue and cannot be avoided. 
   Now, I am not here to cast aspersions on any Member of the Senate. But I waited here this morning to have the majority leader come to the floor--and he was not able to come to the floor--to describe the agenda this week. When  he comes to the floor, I intend to come to the floor and ask him when he intends to bring this treaty to the floor. If he and others decide it will not come to the floor, I intend to plant myself on the floor like a potted plant and object. I intend to object to other routine business of the Senate until this country decides to accept the moral leadership that is its obligation and bring this treaty to the floor for a debate and a vote. 
   In a world as difficult as this world is, when countries such as India and Pakistan are detonating nuclear weapons, it is inexcusable, when so many other countries are trying to gain access to nuclear weapons for themselves, that this Senate, for over 2 years, has not been willing or able to allow a debate on a treaty as important as is this treaty. The banning of nuclear explosive testing all around the world at any time, anyplace, anywhere is critically important for our future, for our children, and for their children. 
   Now, my colleagues know--at least I hope some know--that I am fairly easy to work with. I enjoy the Senate. I enjoy working with my colleagues. I think some of the best men and women I have had the privilege of working with in my life are here on both sides of the aisle. I have great respect for this body. But this body, in some ways, is very frustrating as well because often one or two people can hold up something very important. In this circumstance, I must ask the majority leader--and I will today when given the opportunity when he is on the floor--when will we have the opportunity to debate this Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   That meeting in October should not proceed without this country providing a leadership role. The only way that can happen is for us to have ratified the treaty. China and Russia have not ratified the treaty; that is true. They are waiting on this country. India and Pakistan are now talking about detonating more nuclear weapons; that is true. They are asking others to implore one or the other to ratify this treaty. Both countries are waiting for this country's leadership. What kind of credibility does this country have to go to India and Pakistan and say to them, ``You must ratify this treaty,'' and when they turn to us to say, ``Have you?'' we would say no? Somehow, the Senate could not, in 700 days, even hold 1 day of hearings on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
   We have to do better than that. I am sorry if I am going to cause some problems around here with the schedule. But frankly, as I said, there are big issues and there are small issues. This is a big issue. And I am flat tired of seeing small issues around this Chamber every day in every way, when the big issues are bottled up in some committee and the key is held by one or two people. Then we are told: If you do not like it, tough luck; you don't run this place. It is true, I don't run this place, but those who do should know this is going to be a tough place to run if you do not decide to bring this issue to the floor of the Senate and give us the opportunity to debate a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. This will not be an easy road ahead for the Senate if you decide that this country shall not exercise the moral leadership that is our responsibility on these matters.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think Senator CONRAD makes the most compelling presentation in the Senate on these budget matters. The charts he has used today have been extraordinary in their description of the folly here with respect to this plan. 
   I want to ask the Senator to go back to a couple charts with respect to those who made predictions some years ago because I thought that was very telling. The practice of augury in old Roman times was that the high priest would read the flights of birds and the entrails of cattle in order to evaluate the future. 
   We have some folks who are practicing augury in the Senate. They are the prophets who have described to us how wonderful this plan is. I know the Senator used, a bit ago, the same kind of descriptions from these same prophets 7, 8 years ago. 
   Could the Senator refer to that again, because I think that is most telling who brings this plan to the Senate, and what were their predictions previously?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to come and visit on the proposal on the floor briefly. I was trying to think of a word to describe all of this, and I was thinking of a story I had heard about Daniel Boone, who was a great Kentucky backwoodsman. 
   He was most at home in the backwoods and known for his long hunts, traipsing through the backwoods of Kentucky without a compass. He was asked once if he had ever been lost. Daniel Boone said: No, I can't say I was ever lost, but I was bewildered once for 3 days. 
   I thought of that term ``bewildered.'' I cannot think of anything that better describes my reaction to conservatives bringing a plan to the floor of the Senate that is so unconservative and so risky for this country. It is enough to bewilder the entire country, to see people who say they are conservatives decide that it is not their intent to help pay down the national debt during good economic times, it is not their intent to try to conduct the business we need to conduct to deal with the big challenges of Social Security and Medicare and the demographic time bombs that exist in those programs, it is not their intent to do that. Their intent is to package up a nearly $800 billion tax cut before we have had the first dollar of surplus and say for the next 10 years they are going to have this sort of riverboat gamble with this fiscal policy. 
   Let's talk just for a bit about where we are and then where we have been. 
   What is happening in this country? First of all, the country has an economy that is the envy of the world. Unemployment is down, inflation is down, home ownership is up, personal income is up, the welfare rolls are down, crime is down, economic growth is up, and the budget deficit is about gone.  
   Go back about 8 years. What was happening in this country then? A $290 billion annual deficit that was continuing to rise and economists predicted they would see these deficits rise forever into the future. We had a Dow Jones Industrial Average that had barely reached 3,000. We had a sluggish, anemic economy; job growth, 1988 to 1992 was one of the worst 4-year periods in history; unemployment rates, 7.1 percent annually from 1981 to 1992; median family income fell by $1,800 in a 4-year period; real wages were falling; welfare rolls were increasing. 
   Have things improved in this country? You bet they have improved in this country. They have improved because we passed a new fiscal policy, passed a plan in the form of legislation in 1993. Some of our colleagues predicted it would throw this country into kind of a train wreck and ruin the economy. The economy was in big trouble back then. It is much improved now. We all understand that. 
   In fact, today's newspaper is really interesting. A tiny little article on page 5 says:  
   Treasury plans to buy back debt.  
   My Lord, that ought to be on the front page with 3-inch headlines:  
   Treasury plans to buy back debt.  
   This country has $5.7 trillion in debt, and when we started with this plan we had a $290 billion deficit in that year alone, and it was expected to continue to grow. Now we have a balanced budget, and the Treasury is beginning to buy back debt. 
   If we have surpluses that economists say they can see well into the future, what do we do? During tough economic times, it seems to me, a country always borrows money. How about during good economic times? Does a country pay it back? Does this country say, in giving that rare gift to the young people in this country: We will reduce the Federal debt; we ran it up during tough times, but in good times when we have a surplus, we will reduce the Federal debt? No, that is not what the majority party says. The majority party says: Here are our choices. Big tax cuts, most of it going to the upper-income folks; nothing for Medicare extension; nothing for education and other key investments; nothing for Social Security solvency; nothing for debt reduction. They say big tax cuts. 
   How big are the tax cuts? Here are the pie charts. The top 
   1 percent of income earners in this country get a $46,000 tax cut, and the bottom 20 percent get $24. Is that surprising? No. It is the same tired, chronic problem that always is brought to us in the Senate when the majority party writes a tax bill. 
   This is a bar graph. You can barely see the bottom 60 percent. They only get $138; the top 1 percent, $46,000. 
   How about this Social Security issue? This plan also raids the Social Security program after the first 5 years. That is a plain fact. 
   What are our choices? The enduring truth of this country's existence for a number of decades has been two things: One, a cold war with the Soviet Union; and, two, a budget deficit that seemed always to grow worse. For four or five decades, that was the enduring truth that was overhanging all of our choices. Now the Soviet Union does not exist, the cold war is over, the budget deficits are gone, and everything has changed. 
   Economists predict surpluses well into the future, and I said before these are economists who cannot remember their home phone numbers or addresses and they are telling us what is going to happen 3 years, 5 years, 10 years into the future. God bless them, maybe they are right, maybe not. Forty of the forty-five leading economists the year prior to the last recession predicted it would be a year of economic growth. So economists do not always hit the mark. Economics, as you know, is psychology pumped with a little helium, an advanced degree, and then they give us projections. Our friends on the other side say just projections, that is enough, just projections alone will compel us to pass a bill that will take $800 billion and put it in the form of tax cuts, the substantial majority of which will go to the wealthiest Americans, and they will decide to take that gamble with the American economy. 
   It is their right. They have the votes. We do not weigh them here, we count them. And when you count up the votes, they win. But it is a risky riverboat gamble for this country's economy. Those who have been giving us the most advice about this plan of theirs and how wonderful it is for our country are the very same people who were so fundamentally wrong 8 years ago. 
   Now they say: We have a new plan. I say: What about your old one? It seems to me what we ought to do is make rational, thoughtful choices. Yes, there is room for a tax cut if we get the surpluses that the economists predict. 
   The first choice, it seems to me, ought to be, during good economic times you pay down part of the Federal debt. That is the best gift we could give the children of this country, and that would also stimulate lower interest rates and more economic growth. 
   The second choice for us to decide as a country is, we are going to confront a demographic time bomb in Medicare and Social Security, and we must confront it; let's use some of these surpluses to do that. 
   Third, let's also make sure our investments that make this a better country and better place in which to live are provided for. Yes, education, health care. Does anybody really believe it is going to help this country to have massive cuts in a program such as WIC, the investment we make in low-income pregnant women and children? Does anybody think massive cuts in those kinds of programs or massive cuts in Pell grants for poor students to go to college are going to help this country? I don't think so. That is where this plan leads us. 
   Our choices, in my judgment, are use this projected surplus when it exists to make a real dent in this country's debt and, second, let's have some targeted tax cuts, but after we have committed ourselves to extend the solvency of Social Security and extend the solvency of Medicare. Then let's make sure those programs that invest in human potential really do work; those programs in education and health care that make this a better country, let's make sure those programs are provided for as well. 
   To develop a plan that implicitly assumes--and, yes, it 
   does, no matter how much they decry that is not part of what they are doing--that implicitly assumes you are going to have 20-, 30-, and up to 40-percent cuts in programs that we know in this country work, that strengthen this country and improve this country and invest in the lives of people in this country in a very positive way, makes no sense at all. 
   My colleagues have used charts to describe this tax proposal. There is, it seems to me, no chart that is better than this chart, which is where we were and where we are going. I hope we will decide to vote against this tax cut and have a more sensible fiscal policy as we go forward. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes, and I think my colleague, perhaps both of my colleagues, would like to add a comment. 
   My hope has been, and still is, that we will have a bipartisan solution to this issue today. This is not such a solution. 
   A number of discussions have taken place with a number of Senators from both sides of the aisle. We face the same crises: collapsed prices in rural America and a drought that is spreading across our country. 
   There is not a Republican or a Democratic way to go broke on the family farm. It is just human misery and tragedy that allows those to lose their hopes and dreams and lose their farms because of economic collapse in Asia or price collapse in the U.S. or the worst crop disease of a century or a wet cycle that means 3 million acres can't be planted in our State this spring. It is not the farmer's fault. So we need to do something. The question is, What do we do? 
   We have had several different plans. This is the third, I guess, that will be voted on in the Senate. It is short on disaster aid, as we know. We know there is a disaster occurring. Turn on the television set and listen to the newscasts. They say it is the worst drought in a century in some parts of this country. We might as well be prepared to face that. We ought to add some of that to this legislation. 
   Second, my colleague, in his presentation of the amendment, talked about dollars going to producers immediately. As we all know, AMTA is going to get dollars to people who aren't producing. That is one of the problems.  AMTA is a payment scheme based on 1991 and 1995 production history. They are going to be sending money to the people who aren't producing anything. 
   One other point: My expectation is that this amendment does not change the payment limits. I wonder how many of my colleagues know that the potential, under this approach--and I am able to be corrected, if I am inaccurate--the potential under this approach is to pay $460,000 essentially to a farmer, $460,000 as a new payment limitation. The $80,000 payment limit under current law is doubled. So for AMTA and LDPs, the potential is $460,000 for a producer. 
   Who wants to tell a wage earner in some community someplace that we want you to pay taxes so we can give a little help to family farmers? And by the way, some might get $460,000. What kind of a payment limit is that? How does one describe this as help to family-sized farms? 
   We don't need to help agrifactories in America. We don't need a Department of Agriculture. We don't need a farm program. If our future is in agrifactories, we don't need to construct these kinds of programs or have a Department of Agriculture, for my money. 
   The purpose is to try to protect and help and nurture family farming as an enterprise in this country because it strengthens our country. But $460,000 in payment limits? A potential farmer will get $460,000? What kind of nonsense is this? My expectation is that it is still part of the amendment. My hope is that we will still have an opportunity for a bipartisan solution today. 
   Those of us who come from farm country, in both the Republican and Democratic Parties here, serve the same interests, have the same desire, and have the same passion to try to help family farmers get through this troubled period. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator CRAIG, Senator BREAUX, and others on the floor, in opposing this amendment. 
   I find it interesting; whenever we talk about sugar, we talk about the ``world price,'' which doesn't have any relationship to anything of importance. The people who describe ``world price" are people who go to a sidewalk sale in front of a store and pick up some odds or ends that somebody is trying to sell at 90 percent off list price and then say: Look what I bought this for; this is the price for that product. 
   No, it is not; it is a sidewalk sale. 
   The same is true with sugar. Most sugar is traded country to country by long-term contract. Very little sugar is moved on the open market. That which is represents an overhang and surplus and represents the dump price or the surplus price. Those are the facts. 
   Somehow there is a notion we should be the victims in this country as a group of producers; whatever the lowest common denominator is, we ought to ride the elevator to the bottom with everybody. Calling the price of sugar on the world market the world price is a misnomer. Most sugar is traded by contract, and it is traded in circumstances where at least you get back the cost of production and a decent profit. 
   This price they are talking about, don't be fooled by it. It doesn't mean anything. It is not related to the production of sugar in this country. 
   Now, who is producing sugar? I find it ironic that in the middle of this discussion about the farm crisis, in the middle of the discussion about the plight of families out there struggling to survive, when the Asian economy has collapsed, exports are down, and prices have collapsed, and in my State we have had the worst crop disease in 100 years, and my State had 3 million acres that could not be planted because it was too wet this spring, we are told there is one part of the farm program that ought to be dismantled. 
   At least this is a part of the farm program that works and has historically worked. It doesn't cost Federal money. It doesn't cost the taxpayer anything. It provides stability of sugar prices for the American consumer. It provides some modicum of stability for the producers. 
   Who are the producers? Family farmers. I was in a room with 1,000 of them in Fargo, ND. These are folks who work on that tractor in the winter, get it all ready, and then take all the risk  to put the crop in, plant those beets, take the risk of the harvest, and take the risk through their cooperative. These are good people, and they are going through tough times. The last thing in the world we ought to do is pull the rug out from under those people who are producing our beets and cane and decide we should dismantle this program. 
   There is so much in the farm program that doesn't work, and I have been on the floor for days talking about it. Why go to the part of the farm program that has worked historically to help the producer and say, by the way, let's find something that does work and get rid of it? It doesn't make any sense at all. 
   Let me conclude by saying this is about family farmers as far as I am concerned. 
   It is not about the theory of sugar production or a sugar program or a world price. It is about providing stability for consumers, yes but it is about providing stability of income for some families that are trying to make a living on the land in this country. It is not easy for them. This program is helping them without cost to the American taxpayer. This program has helped them without injury or cost to the American consumer. 
   This program is well conceived and well constructed, is contributing something, and is an asset to American family farmers in this country. The last thing in the world we should do, and the last time we ought to do it, would be to get rid of the sugar program at this point in this debate on the farm program. We ought to preserve the sugar program. We ought to fight for it and preserve it because it works. We ought to do that in the context in which we are working today, to help family farmers in other ways as well, with the disaster program, the response to the farm crisis, and perhaps a change in the underlying farm law at some point in the future. 
   But this is narrow. This is an amendment that says let's get rid of the sugar program. I was unaware of this amendment until an hour or so ago. I did not see any organization developing in the Congress or in the Senate to say let's have a discussion about this. This is a program that has worked so well. Then we have an amendment and then debate for an hour. I think that describes the difficulty. 
   Let us support the sugar program. Let us defeat this amendment. It is important for family farmers in this country to do so. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, my hope is that we are able to find a way this afternoon to adequately deal with this question of disaster relief. I know Senator COCHRAN has just reoffered and now modified the proposal he made previously. We had a tabling vote on that proposal and the tabling vote did not prevail. So we know at least somewhat where the votes are on the Cochran proposal. 
   He has modified it, as I understand, to include $400 million with respect to crop insurance. My hope is that we can move beyond this proposal, which I think is short on what is necessary, to a couple of additional proposals that we may be able to agree to with respect to procedure at least. 
   This proposal that is now before the Senate does not provide assistance for disaster relief. We now see, in every television and radio newscast that we turn to or refer to on the front pages of the papers, the worst drought in this century in some parts of our country. We know disaster relief is going to be necessary because of this drought. We ought to begin to get a start on that in any emergency package we pass dealing with family farmers. 
   There are a number of other things that are left out of the proposal that has just been offered. My hope is that we can, in the next couple of hours, improve this package to the point where most of us believe it does what we believe it should do for family farmers. 
   I want to mention, again, we are not on the floor dealing with an agricultural disaster or agricultural crisis issue because of something farmers have done. It is not their fault the Asian economies have collapsed. It is not the farmers' fault in my State that they have suffered the worst crop disease of the century. It is not their fault we have 3 million acres that couldn't be planted this spring because of wet conditions. Incidentally, that would not be dealt with in the Cochran proposal, flooded lands and so on. This is not the fault of family farmers. 
   We have faced a very serious problem at this point. There is a responsibility for the Congress to help. This is the appropriate place to do that. This is the Agriculture appropriations bill. We have been discussing this now for a number of months. The collapse in the grain and commodities and livestock markets have been spectacular and have been noticed by everyone who cares about the farm economy and family farmers. This is not a surprise to anyone that we are dealing with this question now. 
   While there may be disagreements on the floor of the Senate about exactly how to do it, I think in the end, when we finish this afternoon, we should have been able to pass a piece of legislation dealing with the farm crisis that provides opportunity and hope to family farmers. If we just kick it around a bit and just tune it up a little bit so that it looks better or sounds better or appears better but doesn't provide the kind of help necessary for family farmers, this has all been wasted effort. If we are not able to provide a reasonable safety net and/or during tough times some emergency help that gives family farmers a chance to get from here to there, that gives them a chance to feel that there is some hope for the ability to continue farming, then we haven't accomplished anything at all. 
   The test, then, this afternoon is not whether we pass the proposal before us. That proposal is insufficient. It doesn't meet the needs. The test is whether we can pass one of a couple other proposals that we will, I hope, shortly make in order by consent that will be debated under short time considerations and then will be voted upon. 
   Those of us from farm country understand every day the dichotomy about this economy of ours. We hear about all of the wonderful things in the American economy. Yet in farm country, we see a near total collapse of rural communities, rural counties, and the economies of family farming. We understand this Congress 
   cannot say it doesn't matter. It does matter in this country. 
   I am not going to revisit all the history of the current farm bill, but the philosophy of the current farm bill is that family farmers in this country shall be transitioned out of the farm program. Farm programs shall cease to exist at some point and the transition payments shall allow farmers to get from here to no farm program. 
   The folly of that is to believe that family-sized farms out there by themselves, trying to float in this sea of uncertainty, with all of the potential adverse effects of weather and grain markets and all of the other catastrophes that can befall a family farmer, that they can do this by themselves. When grain markets collapse and grain prices fall to half, that doesn't matter because family farmers can manage that. 
   That is folly. They can't manage that. Family farmers will not make it. They won't make it across this price valley unless Congress extends a helping hand. The helping hand ought to be an investment in this country, an investment in a disaster package that says family farmers matter to this country in many different ways, and we want to try to give them the capability and the hope that they can survive beyond this price catastrophe. 
   I say again, as I close, the current amendment which is before the Senate is deficient in many ways. It falls far short of doing what is necessary in the area of flooded lands, for example, and many other areas. It simply doesn't offer the kind of support we need in rural America to respond to the current disaster and to respond to the current crisis with respect to the collapse of farming commodity prices. 
   Most deficient is the fact that the underlying amendment doesn't address the disaster issue at all that is now enveloping large parts of our country and devastating family farm producers. 
   Madam President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in an attempt to try to find a solution to the issue of providing relief during this farm crisis, I am offering an amendment, in the second degree, on behalf of myself and Senator HARKIN and other Members here on the Senate floor. 
   As Members of the Senate will recall, the proposal we offered yesterday was a proposal that called for $10.7 billion in crisis relief. That $10.7 billion has been modified in this second-degree amendment, and is $9.837 billion. We have reduced it nearly $1 billion by making adjustments in a range of accounts. 
   The accounts include emergency short-term land diversion, disaster reserve--a number of different programs that we have adjusted, that we have thought it appropriate to adjust in order to try to find a compromise that would cost less but still provide significant support and help to family farmers. 
   My colleague, Senator HARKIN, and I have worked, along with Senator CONRAD and Senator DASCHLE, Senator JOHNSON of South Dakota, and others, to see if there is some way we can provide for legislation that will offer assistance at a level that is greater than that which now rests with the underlying amendment. 
   I had indicated previously that the amendment offered by Senator COCHRAN does not deal with disaster issues. There isn't money for disaster issues in that piece of legislation. There isn't money for flooded lands. There are a number of deficiencies in that amendment, and it simply does not reach the level that is necessary to address this farm crisis. 
   So in an attempt to see if we can find some middle ground, in an attempt to offer an amendment that is almost $1 billion less than we had offered previously, by making adjustments in about seven or eight categories, we are trying to see if we can get a favorable vote on this amendment. 
   This amendment, if it should fail, as I understand it, will be followed by one additional amendment. 
   But let me at this moment call on my colleague from Iowa who has joined me in offering this amendment. 
   Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DORGAN. I will reserve the remainder of my time in the event the manager wishes to speak at this point. 
   Mr. President, if Senator COCHRAN does not have a speaker, let me then finish by saying that while I think the proposal that was offered today is improved by Senator COCHRAN--adding the $400 million for crop insurance improves it--as we indicated yesterday, it is not sufficient. It does not provide help for disaster. 
   It provides payments directly to farmers using AMTA. AMTA might sound like a foreign language to some people, but AMTA is a mechanism by which payments are made to people based on a 1991-1995 crop history, and we will have payments going to people who aren't producing anything. All of a sudden, they will open their mailbox and get a check. We will have payments made to people who aren't in trouble at all because AMTA is disconnected from any relationship to production. 
   We have proposed that the payments go with respect to a loan deficiency payment that relates to production, relates to people who are not able to receive the adequate price they need for their commodity. It tries to say let us use scarce public money here, Federal tax dollars, where they might be invested and do the most good. 
   It doesn't make much sense to throw a 5-foot rope to somebody drowning in 30 feet of water. One can say thanks for the rope, but it didn't save anybody. What we need to do at the end of today is to have said: Well, we have done something to try to address the farm crisis, collapsed commodity prices, collapsed livestock prices, devastating crop disease in some parts of the country, devastating drought in others, and flooding in yet other parts of the country. We need at the end of the day to say we have put together a package of help that says to those family farmers trying to do business under those circumstances: You have a chance here to survive. You can make it across these price valleys. 
   Putting together an inadequate package and then just going home is not solving problems. It is just prolonging the day, probably by a month or 2 or 6 months, by which farmers might have a chance to make a decision later that they are going to have to be out of business. 
   That is not what we want to do for farmers. Family farmers are important to this country. I come here with a real passion for family farming. It is because I grew up in a rural area of this country and I know what it takes to raise livestock. I know what kinds of efforts and passions people put into trying to operate a family farm. I see now the tears in the eyes of family farmers who stands up at meetings with me and say: I am losing the farm. This is a farm my grand-dad operated and my dad operated, and I am losing it. I am not a bad farmer, I am a good farmer, but I can't make it with Depression-era prices for wheat and corn. I just can't make a living that way. 
   Members of the Senate couldn't make a living that way. People on minimum wage couldn't make a living that way. Nobody can make a living when their prices collapse. Is there anybody you know of who has half the income they used to have a couple years ago and are doing well? I don't think so. That is what this is about. 
   Are we going to invest in family farming? Are we going to extend a helping hand to say, you matter, we want to help you, or are we going to pass a bill that is inadequate and say, we passed it, so credit us for passing a bill? 
   I hope my colleagues will take a close look at this compromise, $9.837 billion, nearly $1 billion less than that which we offered yesterday. My colleagues, Senators HARKIN and CONRAD and others, sincerely hope we will be able to accept this as a compromise and then understand that we have done something significant and real, something helpful to America's family farmers and for America's family farmers. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, of those items that my colleague, Senator COCHRAN, described as having been reduced, in most cases, they were reduced from a level of funding that we thought was necessary. But I say that, in almost every case, these items have no entry on the underlying amendment. There isn't any money available in the Cochran proposal that the Senate has considered. 
   So it is true, we have had to reduce some accounts. But whatever is left is certainly more than exists in the farm crisis package that has been offered today by my colleague. 
   I hope that our colleagues will look at this in the spirit in which it is offered and believe that a compromise is important and necessary and believe it is far better during a farm crisis to try to extend the helping hand to people who are producing and provide help, because prices have collapsed for that which they have produced, than it is to concoct another approach that says: Let's just send checks out there and hope some of them get in the right mailboxes. That is what AMTA is and what it does. That is why it is not effective. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Chairman for his longstanding support of agricultural research and, more specifically, of the human nutrition research programs of the Agricultural Research Service. 
   Emphasis in human nutrition research at the USDA is designed to maintain a healthy populace and avoid the problems and substantial costs of diseases linked to poor dietary choices. Many diseases such as diabetes, cancer, osteoporosis, cataracts, and others, could be nearly eliminated with improved nutrition research and education. 
   The President's budget requested $20.25 million for the Human Nutrition Initiative, but because of significant constraints resulting from the allocation, the bill provides only $1.5 million. Of the $53 million originally requested for the program, $48.5 million is still needed. 
   These funds would reconcile production agriculture, which provides America the most abundant and safest food supply in the world, with consumer demands for a wholesome diet to enhance health, reduce illness, and improve the quality of life. 
   Does the Chairman agree that because of the critical nature of funding for the program the Human Nutrition Initiative is a subject that should be evaluated in greater detail during conference on this bill?

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to take note of the superb performances given yesterday by the Emter family of Glen Ullin, North Dakota, on the Capitol lawn and later at the Kennedy Center. The Emters were here in Washington as part of the Millennium Series being sponsored by the Kennedy Center. When the Kennedy Center asked me to make a recommendation of a group from North Dakota that might exhibit some of the cultural heritage of my state, the Emter family was a natural and immediate choice. 
   One obvious reason was their outstanding musical accomplishment. The Emters are button accordionists. Mr. President, the button accordion is a unique instrument, brought to America by settlers from Austria at the turn of the 20th century. Button accordions have been in this country for nearly 100 years, and have helped make polka one of America's most loved traditional dances. In North Dakota even today you'd be hard pressed to find a wedding reception or barn dance where a polka wasn't played and the entire room doesn't pour onto the dance floor. Accordion music may not have the popular following that it did before the advent of rock and roll, but its lyrical and nostalgic flavor still tugs at the heartstrings of this Senator and many other folks of my generation who grew up watching our parents polka the night away across the American Legion Hall dance floor, at Ted Strand's barn or at Hardmeyer Hall. 
   The Emter Family--parents Renae and Roger (who met at a polka dance), 18 year old son Adam, and three daughters Angelina, 16; Alida, 15; and Abigail, 13--has performed all over North America, from county fairs, church functions and Oktoberfests to national television and radio appearances. They have taken top honors at a number of international button accordion competitions. They are truly accomplished. 
   I have to tell you though, Mr. President, that it isn't just for their musical achievement that the Emter Family deserves our recognition and honor today. That's because this is a great family. Their presence on stage tells you this, the way they interact with one another and everyone around them tells you this, the message in their music tell you this. They are good people that exemplify the steadfast, positive attitude of the vast majority of rural America's families. They live in Glen Ullin, in southwestern North Dakota, a part of the state that has seen one of the most significant decrease in population. Times are desperate for many families in this region of my state, along with rural areas in most of our farm states. These people have every reason in the world to lose faith, to have negative attitudes, to let frustration get the best of them and give up. None of us could fault them for that. But, Mr. President, most of these families don't despair. They look forward, they continue to work incredibly hard, they still pack the American Legion Hall to dance the polka once and awhile. The Emters are a symbol of hope in these areas of our country, Mr. President, and I want to thank them for sharing that hope with us yesterday through their music and their presence in Washington.

   Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from New York is correct. That is one of the distinctions between these two pieces of legislation. As the drought spreads across the eastern seaboard and other parts of the country and begins to devastate producers there, there needs to be some disaster relief. We have two pieces of legislation proposed today, one of which has no disaster relief at all, even in the face of this increasingly difficult drought. 
   So the Senator from New York, speaking on behalf of producers who are hard-hit in New York, is certainly accurate to say that the amendment we have offered provides drought relief and the alternative does not.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is not about Republicans and Democrats. I start by saying to my colleague from Iowa that I hope, whatever comes from all of this debate, at the end of the time we can, as Republicans and Democrats, find a way to provide appropriate relief to people who are hurting. There is not a Republican or a Democratic way to go broke on the family farm. The destruction of hopes and dreams on the family farm is something that is tragic and something to which we need to respond. 
   This is not of the family farmers' making. They didn't cause prices to collapse or the Asian economies to have difficulty, and they didn't cause a wet cycle or crop disease. It is not their fault. We must, it seems to me, respond to it. But it is appropriate, I think, for there to be differences in the way we respond. There is a philosophical difference in the way we respond. Also, there has been a difference in the aggressiveness and interest in responding. I know that if this kind of economic trouble were occurring on Wall Street or in the area of corporate profits, we would have a legislative ambulance, with its siren, going full speed in trying to find a solution. It has not been quite so easy because it is family farmers. 
   Darrel Sudzback is an auctioneer from Minot, ND. Blake Nicholson, an  Associated Press writer, wrote a piece the other day. He said:  
   Darrel Sudzback likens farm sales to funerals. He said, ``If you don't know the deceased, you are not likely to get emotional.'' But more often than not these days, auctioneers must help a friend or a neighbor sell off a lifetime of hard work. Marvin Hoffman says, ``It just hurts me to do this. When they hurt, I hurt.'' With many families [Mr. Nicholson writes] sliding deeper into an economic nightmare, the number of farm sales in North Dakota continues to rise. ``It used to be,'' one auctioneer said, ``that a farm auction was kind of like a social event, a joyful event when somebody was retiring.'' Julian Hagen said that he conducted auction sales for 43 years, but he said, ``Now there is a different atmosphere at auction sales. If people know that a man is forced out, that is not a good feeling. It is tough to deal with when you have known a family farmer for quite a few years, and now they have to give up a career or property they have had in the family for generations. I try to stay as upbeat as I can. Bankers in north-central North Dakota say that area has been hit by 5 years of flooding and crop disease, and many farmers have been forced off the land.  
   People need to think of this problem in terms of not only lost income, but assume you are on a farm and you have a tractor; you have some land; you have a family; you have hopes and dreams. You put a crop in the ground and see that this is what has happened to your income--to your price. 
   Then on top of that, add not only collapsed prices, but add the worst crop disease in this century--the worst in a century in North Dakota. On top of that, add a wet spring so that 3.2 million acres--yes, I said 3.2 million acres--of land could not be planted. It was left idle. Add all of those things together, and you have a catastrophe for families out there struggling to make a living. 
   Will Rogers was always trying to be funny. He used to talk about the difference between Republicans and Democrats. He said on April 6, 1930, ``Even the Lord couldn't stand to wait on the Republicans forever.'' 
   He was talking about the farm program. 
   There is a difference, it seems to me. There is a difference between Republicans and Democrats in how we construct a solution to the disaster and the crisis, and how we feel the underlying farm bill should be changed. 
   Will Rogers also said, ``If farmers could harvest the political promises made to them, they would be sitting pretty.'' 
   I want to talk a bit about those political promises--the political promises given farmers early on to say that we want to get rid of the farm program as we know it in this country, get rid of the safety net as we know it, and create something called ``transition payments'' under the Freedom to Farm bill. 
   I mentioned yesterday that the title was interesting to me. Sometimes titles can change how people perceive things notwithstanding what might be the real part of a proposal. Early on when people began to sell insurance in this country, they called it death insurance. You know, death insurance didn't sell too well. So they decided that they had better rename it. So they renamed it life insurance, and it started selling. It was a better name. It is a product that most Americans need and use. 
   It is interesting. What is in a name. The name for the farm bill a few years ago was Freedom to Farm. We passed a Freedom to Farm bill. The wheat price slump on this chart may be unconnected, or maybe not to Freedom to Farm. 
   Here are the wheat prices before--Freedom to Farm--and wheat prices since. Chance? Happenstance? Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe we face a circumstance in this country where the underlying farm bill was never designed to work and allowed for collapsed prices. Maybe that is the fact. 
   I want to begin with a bit of history. 
   About 40 years ago, a biologist by the name of Rachel Carson wrote a book that in many ways changed our country. It was called ``The Silent Spring.'' The book documented how the products of America's industrial production were seeping into our country's food chain. The modern environmental movement was also from Rachel Carson's book, ``The Silent Spring.'' 
   Today we face another ``silent spring'' in this country. Like the first, it is of a human making. But it is not about birds, and it is not about fish. It involves our country's independent family farmers and producers. It involves our social habitat--the farm communities of which family farmers are the base. 
   We know that family farmers are hurting. In fact, many would consider it an extraordinary year if they had any opportunity at 
   all to meet their cost of production. I know of cases that break my heart--people who have fought for decades, and now are losing everything they have. What is worse is that some opinion leaders are starting to throw in the towel. They say, well, maybe family farming is a relic of the past. Maybe it is not of value to our country anymore. Maybe it is time to do something else. 
   I don't buy that at all. I think one thing we can say about the future is that people will be eating. The world's population is growing rapidly. Every month in this world we add another New York City in population. Every single month, another New York City in population is added to our globe. We know there is no more farmland being created on this Earth. It doesn't take a genius to put those two together.

   Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from Maryland. He is talking about a drought which is devastating part of our country even as collapsed prices have been devastating wheat farmers and the grain farmers in my part of the country. 
   I want to respond to some things that were said earlier today that somehow we are not as efficient as we need to be as family farmers. 
   In my judgment--and I think the evidence supports this--the family farmer in our country is as productive as any in the world. It supports our rural communities in ways that corporations never will and never can. 
   Family farmers have faced hard times before. This is not something new. The history of farming is a history of difficulty. But never before has the Federal Government done so little to help and so much to push the producer off the edge. 
   On top of the floods that we have talked about and the drought and the slump in the foreign markets, our farmers are facing a plague of deliberate public policies--yes, established here in Washington--that undermine their economic interest. They face trade agreements designed for the convenience of food processors rather than food producers. They face a ``see-no-evil'' posture toward antitrust enforcement that has left family farmers selling into controlled markets that dictate the terms to them. On top of that, they face a 1996 farm bill that fundamentally doesn't and can't work. 
   There is a larger issue than dollars and cents; namely, the kind of country we are going to be. 
   It is not fashionable to raise all of these issues. We are supposed to keep our mouths shut and cash in on the stock market which has done quite well. But the Founding Fathers didn't create this country primarily to be an engine of stock market riches or rising gross domestic product. They created this country to promote a way of life based on freedom and democracy and independent producers in contrast to the aristocracy they left behind in Europe. 
   The concept of independence and freedom was rooted in the land, and they couldn't conceive of these things being separate. 
   Wendell Berry, a farmer, testified recently in Washington at a hearing that I chaired. He said:  
   Thomas Jefferson thought the small land owners were the most precious part of state, and he thought government should give priority to their survival. But increasingly, since World War II our government's manifest policy has been to get rid of them. This country is paying a price for this. That price doesn't show up on the supermarket shelves but rather our Nation's spirit and our character.  
   Independent family-based agriculture produces more than wheat, beef, and pork. It produces a society and a culture, our main streets, our equipment dealers, our schools, our churches, and our hospitals. It is the ``culture'' in agriculture. Take away family-based producers and all that is left are calories. That is a radical change in our country. I am not talking about rural sentimentalism or nostalgia. It is something we know from experience. Rural communities work. They have so many of the things the Americans all over this country say they want, including stable families, low crime rates, neighborliness, a volunteer spirit. 
   In my hometown of Regent, ND, they still leave the keys in the car when they park on Main Street. Try doing that here. Many Americans have plenty of food on their tables, but what they feel is a growing dearth of the qualities that they want most are the qualities that farm communities represent. It would be insane, in my judgment, to stand by and let these communities wither on the vine by neglecting the economic base that sustains them. 
   Yes, the Nation's financial establishment is enthused about that prospect. It can't wait to turn hog barns into agrifactories and more. However, that will not advance this country's interests. We can't stop bad weather and we can't stop unruly markets, but we can change Federal policies that turn adversity into quicksand for family farmers. 
   I listened to a ringing defense of the current farm program. I listened to one of my colleagues who was an economist, and I mentioned before I used to teach economics but was able to overcome that and go on to think clearly. There is an interesting debate among economists about all of these issues. First, is there a crisis? Listening to part of the debate this morning one would think there is nothing wrong on the family farm. Is there a crisis? Would anyone in this country be feeling there is a crisis if this is what happened to their income? If any sector of the American economy had this happen to their income, would they consider it a crisis? The answer is, of course. 
   I had a farmer come to a meeting who farmed the lands that his granddad farmed, his dad farmed, and he farmed. He stood up and said: For 23 years, I farmed this land. His chin began to quiver and his eyes began to water. He could hardly speak. He said: I'm going to have to leave this farm. 
   Anyone could tell he loved what he did. He was going to lose the farm that his granddad, dad, and he had farmed for those many decades. Is that a crisis? I think so. 
   In my State, add to the fact that incomes have collapsed because of price collapses, 3.2 million acres were not planted because of wet conditions in the spring--3.2 million acres. A young boy wrote some while ago and said: My dad could feed 180 people and he can't feed his family. 
   Is that a crisis? Of course. 
   Why the crisis? I mentioned collapsed prices and a wet spring and the worst crop disease in the century in our part of the country. This notion of a farm bill that says the free market shall determine what happens in agriculture, by cutting the tether and turning it all loose, finds you scratching your head and wondering, gee, why didn't this work out the way we thought? Because the market isn't free. It never has been free and never will be free. 
   That bill that says we will transition farmers out of any help, over 7 years that bill transitions farmers into a marketplace that is fixed. Does anybody know what kind of tariff we have putting beef into Japan at this moment? I guess it costs $30 or $35 a pound to buy T-bone steak in Tokyo. Does anybody know what tariff exists on beef going into Japan? Very close to 50 percent. That is a failed free market by any definition anywhere. That is after we reached an agreement with them 10 years ago. 
   How about China? They consume half the world's pork. Are we 
   delivering a lot of hogs into China? No, we have a $50 billion to $60 billion trade deficit with China and we are not exporting enough hogs into China. 
   What about wheat in Canada? No. I drove to the border of Canada with a truck and couldn't get the wheat into Canada. I stopped at the border, and all the way to the border, semitruckload after semitruckload after semitruckload was coming into this country, hauling Canadian grain into our country and undercutting our farmer's prices. We sit at the border trying to go north, you can't. The border coming south is flooded by millions  of wheat acres, unfairly subsidized, sold to us by a Canadian wheat board. It is a state monopoly and would be illegal in this country, with it's secret prices. Our trade officials downtown wouldn't lift a finger--never have and never will--to deal with the unfair trade practices. 
   I mention Japan, China, and Canada. I could list other countries for an hour, but I won't. Then we say to the family farmers, operate in a free marketplace. That is what we have created, a marketplace that is fundamentally corrupt with respect to fairness to our family farmers. 
   My colleague this morning, Senator CONRAD, talked about the Europeans subsidizing exports to the tune of ten times our subsidies. Is that fair competition? I don't think so. 
   Over and over and over, if it is not just unfair competition in selling, selling into our marketplace with products that ought not be allowed, produced with growth hormones or produced with chemicals that we wouldn't allow to be used in this country on animals or grains--that happens every day in every way. 
   We produce canola in this country and we are prevented from using a chemical on the canola that we would purchase from Canada because that chemical can't be allowed into the country. However, the Canadians can use that chemical on their canola, plant the canola, harvest it, and ship it into Belfield, ND, to put it at a crushing plant, crush it, and put it into our food chain. 
   My farmers say: Why is that the case? What is going on here? 
   What is going on here is family farmers have been set up in every single way, set up for failure. 
   I heard this morning what was being proposed here was socialism. I heard what was being proposed here was being proposed by a bunch of leftists. I heard what was being proposed here was being proposed by people who don't believe in the principles of economics. I sat here and thought, that is novel; an interesting, pithy new political debate calling people socialists or leftists. Or maybe it isn't so new. Maybe it is just a tired, rheumatoid, calcified debate by people who can't think of anything else to say. 
   Deciding to stand up and help family farmers in a time of crisis and trouble is socialistic? Are you kidding me? It is everything that is right about the instincts of this country. 
   When part of this country is in trouble, the rest of the country moves to help. I wasn't there, but in the old wagon train days when we populated the western part of this country with wagon trains, one of the first lessons learned was don't move ahead by leaving somebody behind. That is an indelible lesson. The same is true with this country and its economy. Don't move ahead by leaving some behind. When family farmers are in trouble, we have a responsibility to help, not crow about socialism and leftists. What a bunch of nonsense. 
   The fact is, the same kind of debate includes this: We are no longer the most efficient in farming. I heard that this morning. We are no longer the most efficient in farming. Nonsense. Show me who is better. Tell me who is better. I am sick and tired of this ``blame America first'' notion. We lose because we are no longer the most efficient. Tell me who is more efficient anywhere else in the world. Stop blaming this country first for everything. 
   If we had a free market, if we had open markets, if we had fair competition, if we didn't have policymakers setting up family farmers for failure, and if they paid as much attention to the family economic unit--which apparently has no value to a lot of folks in this country--as we do for the corporate economic unit, maybe we would see some policies that would say to family farmers, you matter in this country's future and we want to keep you. 
   I do not understand much of this debate, except we face the requirement to do two things, and we need to do them soon. First, we must respond to a farm crisis. That is the purpose of the two bills on the floor of the Senate today. We do it in very different ways. 
   As my colleague from New York mentioned, the majority party bill doesn't even respond to any part of the disaster; there are no disaster provisions at all. Of course, we have a substantial part of this country now facing a serious drought, so it is a very serious problem. We have very different ways in which we provide income support to family farmers. The majority party follows the Freedom to Farm bill, which of course is a total flop, total failure. It gives payments to people who are not producing. It says: You are not producing; you are not in trouble; you don't have any crop; here's some money. What kind of logic is that? It doesn't make any sense. 
   We propose a mechanism by which we provide help to people who are producing and are losing money as a result of that production, trying to provide help to shore up that family farm. Our position is simple. When prices hit a valley, we want a bridge across that valley so family farmers can get across that valley. We want to build a bridge, and other people want to blow up the bridge. But if we don't take the first step to provide some crisis and disaster relief and then follow it very quickly in September and October, as I discussed with my colleague from Iowa and others, with a change in the underlying farm bill, we will not have done much for farmers. 
   Farmers say to me: We very much appreciate some disaster help, but it will not provide the hope that is necessary for me to plant a crop and believe that I can make it. We need a change in the farm bill. We need a safety net that we think has a chance to work for us in the future.

   Mr. DORGAN. The payment mechanism is called an AMTA payment or a transition payment. This would actually enhance the transition payment. The purpose of a transition payment, by its very name, is to transition family farmers out of a farm program. It said: Whatever your little boat is, let it float on whatever 
   marketplace exists out there. The problem is, they declare it a free market when in fact it is a market that is totally stacked against family farmers. So family farmers cannot make it in this kind of system. 
   This farm bill that provides transition payments is a faulty concept. Yet even for disaster relief, they cling to this same faulty concept of moving some income out largely because, I think, they are worried, if they do not cling to that, somehow they will be seen as retreating from the farm bill. I would say: Retreat as fast as you can from a farm bill that has put us in this position on wheat prices. 
   You may think it is totally unfair to say wheat prices have anything to do with the farm bill. I don't know. Maybe this is pure coincidence. Maybe it is just some sort of a cruel irony that we  passed a new farm bill and all these prices collapsed. But the point is, I was hearing this morning discussions from people who were standing up to say things are really good on the family farm. I did not look closely at their shoes to see whether they had been on a family farm recently. They looked as if they were wearing pretty good pants and shirts and so on. It occurred to me, if things are so good on the family farm, why are we seeing all these farm auctions and all this misery and all this pain and agony with family farmers losing their lifetime of investment? Why? Because prices have collapsed. Things are not good on the family farm. The current farm bill doesn't work. 
   People stand here--I guess I can listen to them--they stand here for hours and tell us how wonderful things are and how much income the current farm bill is spreading in rural America. I would say, however much income that is, it does not make up for the radical, total collapse of the grain markets. What has happened is, we have a payment system that says, under Freedom to Farm, when prices are high, you get a payment that you do not need, and when prices are low, you don't get a payment that is sufficient to give you the help you need.

   Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator from Iowa, the answer to that question is, clearly, farm income is collapsing. It is collapsing with grain prices, with commodity prices generally, and family farmers are put in terrible trouble as a result of it. Many of them are facing extinction.

   Mr. DORGAN. Let me make one final point, and then I will relinquish the floor. I know my colleagues wish to speak. 
   This is a map of the United States. This map shows in red the counties of our country that have lost more than 10 percent of their population. It shows where people are moving out, not coming in. We have cities growing in various parts of America, but in the center of our country, in the farm belt of our country, we are being depopulated. People are leaving. My home county, which is about the size of the State of Rhode Island, was 5,000 people when I left, in population. It is now 3,000. The neighboring county, which is about the same size, the size of the State of Rhode Island, had 920 people last year. The fact is, people are moving out. Why? Because family farmers cannot make a living. 
   We have had other farm policies that have not worked. I mean we have had Democratic and Republican failures. Both parties have failed in many ways in farm policy. 
   It is just the circumstance today where we have farm prices, in constant dollars, that are at Depression level; and we have a farm program that, like it or not, was offered by the majority party that does not work. It does not work at all in the context of what our needs are to try to save family farmers. 
   We will have two votes today: One on a disaster package or a price relief package that offers more help, and one that offers less; one that offers some help for disaster relief, and one that does not. 
   A whole series of differences exist between these proposals. My hope is that at the end of this day the Senate will have agreed to the proposal that Senators DASCHLE, HARKIN, CONRAD, myself, and others have helped draft and that we will be able to send a message of hope to family farmers, to say, we know what is happening, we know we need change. This is the first step. The second step, in September or October, will be to force a fundamental change in our underlying farm policy. 
   Madam President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator can emphasize disaster relief. As the Senator indicated--and I knew this--the previous initiative we voted on by the majority party, and was not tabled, that did not include disaster relief. We know disaster is occurring. Drought is spreading across the country. Disaster relief is necessary. Is it the case that the proposal we just voted on had no disaster relief and the proposal we will vote on at 5 o'clock, which you and I and so many others helped draft, does include disaster relief; is that not a significant difference?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this afternoon at 3 o'clock we will begin debate on a farm disaster relief plan that will be offered by Senator HARKIN, myself, Senators CONRAD, DASCHLE, and others. I think this will be, for those of us from farm country, one of the most important pieces of legislation addressed by this Congress this year. I know that unless one lives on a family farm, it is probably pretty hard to describe the farm crisis, but I thought I would read a couple letters from my constituents in North Dakota. 
   Before I do, I am reminded of the story the former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee used to tell. Kika de la Garza was his name. He used to talk about agriculture and food by telling a story about nuclear submarines. He said he met with all these folks from the Defense Department and they told him about the wonders of these nuclear submarines the United States had. They told him about all of their provisions and all their fuel and their capabilities and their speed and their distance. And he said, well, how long can a nuclear submarine stay under the sea? And the admiral says: Until the food runs out. It was Kika de la Garza's way of pointing out that food, after all, is the essence of most of our existence, and we are a world, a rather fragile, large globe--as seen by the astronauts who leave our Earth and go into space--of diverse interests, diverse people. 
   However, one thing that seems constant in this world is that we read that so many people go to bed hungry--especially children, but so many people across the world go to bed hungry. Somewhere around half a billion people go to bed with a serious ache in their belly because they do not have anything to eat. Malnutrition and lack of good nutrition among billions of others exists around the world. 
   Then we go to the farm belt in the United States where a family is struggling to make a living on the family farm and find that its farmer loaded some grain on the truck and took it to the elevator and the grain trade said to the farmer: Your food does not have any value. Our grain trade assesses the value of your food as relatively meaningless. The farmer wonders about that because we live in such a hungry world. How could it be that what we produce in such abundance has no value?  
   That is what our farmers wonder. Let me talk just about these farmers in the context of their words. This is a letter from a woman in the central part of our State whose family farms; she farms. Here is the kind of plaintive cry that exists from a proud and hard-working people in our country, family farmers who take enormous risks, risk everything they have to try to make a living with seeds they plant in the ground. They do not know whether they will grow; they do not know whether the natural disasters will occur--insects and hail and rain too much, too little. They don't know what will happen with this money they have invested in the soil. If they finally get their crop and they escape all of those problems, they get the crop off the ground and take it to the elevator, they don't know whether there will be a price that allows them to get a return for that crop. 
   Those are the kinds of people who live on our family farms. They are the people who create the backbone of our society in our country. They are the people who together build a small community where they trade and do business. They build our churches in those communities. They create charities. They do the things together in a community that we forget about sometimes in our country. What is it that makes this country work at its roots? It is entrepreneurship, it is family farming, it is a sense of community, and it is a sense of sharing. 
   Here is a family farm. This woman says in her letter to me:  
   We aren't asking for a free ride, just the possibility of surviving. We are private people and we bear our pain alone, and we don't discuss the true situation out here on the family farm with anybody. Our neighbors are all in the same shape. The spirit of North Dakota will be gone with these people and their farms. We cannot survive without a reasonable income. How much longer will it be before people understand that we are trying to feed our family, and pay for basic necessities? But with today's income we are not saving money for retirement. We are not going on trips. We are not enjoying any of the fruits from our labor. We are slowly but surely going broke.  
   A man who lives in southeastern North Dakota on the family farm says:  
   It sometimes brings a tear to my eye that maybe in a year, maybe two years, I will not be around in family farming to matter anymore. This won't be easy to explain to my three young daughters. This is where I wanted to bring them up, in a rural setting of life that I was used to and that I understand. If it happens, I hope they read in their history books that it wasn't because their dad was a dumb man. It was because it was caused by policy and giant concentration of companies who want dominance.  
   Or, from a woman named Susan, whose letter I have read previously on this floor. She lost her husband, and she had to sell their family farm. Prices had collapsed.  
   I had an auction last week to sell the machinery so that I could help pay off some of the debts that incurred after 26 years of farming. I have a 17-year-old son who would not help me prepare for auction and did not even get out of bed the day of the auction sale because he is so heartbroken that he cannot continue to farm this land.  
   This is a 17-year-old boy who is not a bad boy. It is just that he couldn't get out of bed to watch the auction sale of his farm because he couldn't bear to see the loss of his dream and his families' dream. He wanted to be a farmer as well. 
   She said:  
   My husband was an excellent manager, fully educated. He chose to farm rather than live in a big city. He had a job once with Motorola. He wanted to raise his children in a place with clean air, no crime, and good schools. He worked very hard physically and emotionally to make this farm work. And its failure was no fault of his. Something is seriously wrong with our country when we will sacrifice the family farm for a political system and an entire way of life for hundreds of years.  
   Her point is that farmers at this point are not at fault for what is happening. The world is hungry. Most people need food. We raise it in great abundance, and family farmers are told that what they produce doesn't matter. 
   I would like to use a couple of charts that show the dilemma that family farmers are facing not only in my State but around the country. 
   I show this chart because some people might wonder, well, what is all this farm crisis about? I ask anyone who looks at this chart--this chart shows prices received by farmers for wheat. Most of the farmers in my part of the world are wheat farmers. Put minimum wage in this chart, if this had happened with the minimum wage; put corporate profits on this chart, if this had happened to corporate profits--what do you think the outcry would be? Put congressional salaries on this chart. If this had happened to congressional salaries, what would the outcry be? 
   This represents the income farmers are receiving from their products when the price of every other thing is increasing. The income received by farmers is collapsing. 
   For purposes of comparison, let me compare the price of corn and wheat with what farmers received for those commodities during the middle of the Great Depression. With the price adjusted over time, ask yourself: What do farmers get now relative to what they got during the Great Depression? 
   Take a look at it in 1998. These are the worst farm prices price adjusted for 50 years. Families cannot make a living in this country in these circumstances. 
   I am tempted to go into a long discussion of so-called Freedom to Farm. I didn't vote for it. It was a terrible piece of farm legislation. Some loved it. Some voted for it. Some still support it. Certainly it has a wonderful name. 
   It reminds me of the people early on who sold insurance. 
   They called it ``death insurance.'' Many years ago they sold ``death insurance.'' Do you know something? Death insurance didn't have a very good name for it. It didn't sell very well. Nobody wanted to buy death insurance. So what did they do? They changed the name to ``life insurance.'' It is a better sounding name, and it sold much better. 
   So we had a farm bill called Freedom to Farm. What a nice sounding name with bankrupt policies that said family farming doesn't matter much in whatever the market system says with respect to agriculture. 
   There has never been a free market in agriculture, and never will be. 
   Do you think the European countries whose citizens have gone hungry will decide it doesn't matter whether they have family farmers? They will never make that decision. They will always have a farm program that insists on price supports for families on the farms in Europe. 
   The point is that this country has decided by itself that family farming as a concept doesn't matter to its future; that whatever the market decides is what our future shall be. If the market decides that corporate farms shall farm from California to Maine, so be it. 
   The problem with that is that all across this country we will have yardlights turned off and families leaving the farm. The economic arteries that they provide to the small towns will be closed and dried up, and those small towns will be boarded up. The people will be leaving small towns. We will see the collapse, the total collapse, of a rural lifestyle. 
   The author Critchfield, who was a wonderful, world-wide, world-renown author, who actually grew up in Fargo, ND, said that family values have always been nurtured on the family farms in this country, and the refreshing small towns rolled to the cities from many family farms. It was always a seedbed of family values of nurturing and helping and working together. We will lose all of that because some people say it doesn't matter. 
   We are having a debate this afternoon at 3 o'clock. It is critically important. This matters more than most people in this country will ever know. I hope that with my colleagues we can easily pass a disaster bill in the first step, and in the second that we can then pass a revision of the underlying farm bill, and say to farmers: You have a future. We want to provide you hope and help because we think you matter to our country. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. I want to address the question to the Senator from Iowa. The discussion we had about income support for family farmers in the nature of a disaster program being income support in the form of a transition payment or AMTA, the whole notion of a transition payment is to transition farmers out of a farm program into the free market. 
   This chart shows what has happened to the price of wheat since 1996. This chart is similar to the corn chart and the price of corn which the Senator from Iowa shared. This is what has happened to the so-called ``free market'' for wheat. The price of wheat has collapsed. The notion of a transition was philosophically by those in this Chamber who said let's transition people out of a farm program. 
   Isn't that the base of an AMTA payment?

   Mr. DORGAN. This is the right subject and the right time; we are debating the right issues. The Senator said it well. We have an economy that is growing and prospering, more people are working, fewer people are unemployed, fewer people on welfare, inflation is down. So many good things are going on in this country, but in rural America family farmers are in desperate trouble through no fault of their own. 
   If any group of Americans found their income had collapsed, or if the salary for Members of Congress had fallen where income for family farmers had fallen, we would have dealt with this immediately and a long time ago. The same is true with corporate earnings. 
   However, we are here through no fault of the family farmers but because they are trying to do business in a marketplace where prices have just collapsed. If we don't take action soon, we won't have many family farmers left across the bread basket of the country.

   Mr. DORGAN. I think the points being made here are important to understand. If all we do is to pass a disaster relief package and do nothing to change the underlying farm bill, we will not have addressed problems in a way that gives family farmers hope that there is a future. 
   Let me ask the Senator about the underlying farm bill. The underlying farm bill, the Freedom to Farm bill, has put us in a position where payments were made to farmers early on when farm prices were very high and farmers didn't need those payments. Now, when farm prices have collapsed and farmers need a bigger payment, they are still getting the same payment or a lower payment than they were getting when prices were high. 
   In other words, there is a disconnection with respect to need. Freedom to Farm, was it not, was a transition payment. It was to transition them out of the farm program. That was the philosophical underpinning of the farm bill. 
   Is it the judgment of the Senator from Iowa that while we do this--and it is urgent that we must do this, pass some disaster relief bill--that we also must accompany that with a change in the underlying farm bill, sooner rather than later, because if we do not, those farmers who are making decisions about the future will have to decide there is no hope ahead? 
   Freedom to Farm means there are lower price supports even when prices collapse. Isn't it true that this must be the first step in a two-step process?

<TEXT>
   Mr. DORGAN. Payments, as I understand them, have gone too far in the current farm bill, the underlying farm bill; too high in the disaster programs. Perhaps both programs should be adjusted lower. My understanding of the program that has been offered earlier today, by the majority party, is with the triple-entity rule, the payment limits would effectively, under that rule, be about $460,000--under their disaster package. In my judgment, that is too high. In my judgment, we should craft a farm program and craft disaster programs that target help for family-size farms. If that is not what it is about, my feeling has always been, if we are not targeting help to family farmers, we don't need a Department of Agriculture. The only reason to have all of this is to help family farmers.

   Mr. DORGAN. If I might again just inquire, I had computed it under the three-entity rule, what they could achieve. If I have missed part of that and they can achieve $460,000, it simply makes the point; $300,000 is too much. Mr. President, $460,000 is way out of bounds. We ought to be trying to get a reasonable amount of support during this price collapse to family-size farms. 
   I come from ag country, but I will not support giving $300,000 to anybody in farm country. We don't need that. That is not what a farm program ought to be about, in disaster help or in regular help, when prices collapse. That is not supporting a family-size farm; that is spending taxpayers' money in support of farm operations far in excess of family farms. That doesn't make any sense to me. 
   Again, when I inquired of the Senator from Iowa, I was thinking of the repeal of the three-entity rule. If there is another device that goes above the $300,000, that simply compounds the aggravation with respect to who is going to get this money and how much. Let us find a way. 
   I ask the Senator from Iowa, isn't our job here to craft a decent disaster bill, first, that gets the most help possible to family-size farms and, second, to decide we must follow it quickly by saying the current farm bill doesn't work, that is obvious to everyone--obvious because we have to pass disaster bills every year now--and we should change the underlying farm bill in the same way that provides real help to family farmers so when prices collapse they have a chance to survive?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, about a tax issue that is important to farm families across the country. 
   The Senate is on record in this year's budget resolution as supporting legislation to end the disparity between family farmers and their urban and suburban counterparts with respect to the $500,000 capital gains inclusion for homes sales that Congress passed in 1997 by expanding it to cover capital gains from the sale of farmland along with the farmhouse. Under current law, farmers receive little or no benefit from the existing capital gains exclusion because farm homes away from town often hold little or no value. 
   It is my understanding that the chairman is supportive of the effort to end this tax inequity and will work to include this family farmers capital gains fairness proposal in conference should the final tax bill include other capital gains tax relief.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, what a remarkable debate. At a time when so many Americans think so much in politics is fuzzy and they can't see much of a difference between the two parties, this is a bright-line test. There is a radical difference in terms of what we stand for and what we fight for and what we have passion to change. I want to describe a little of that difference. 
   But first I want to go back to what some would call ``the good old days.'' Let's go back to the year just before we passed, by one vote, the bill that increased some taxes for a few people in this country, cut some taxes for others, cut some spending, and put this country back on track with an economic plan that resulted in where we are today. 
   In 1993 I voted for that package. We did not get one vote from the other side of the aisle--not one. It passed by one vote in the House, one vote in the Senate. We did not get one vote to help us from the other side of the aisle. 
   In fact, some on the other side of the aisle stood up and said: If you pass this, this country is going into a depression. If you pass this, it will ruin the American economy. It will throw people out of work. It will injure this country. Well, we passed it anyway. 
   Do you remember those days? The Federal deficit then was $290 billion and growing. We had nearly 10 million Americans out of work, looking for a job. The Dow Jones Industrial Average just barely reached 3,000. Inflation was double what it was last year. There were 97,000 business failures. 
   Then we passed a piece of legislation that put this country back on track--over the objections, I might add, of the folks who bring----

   Mr. DORGAN. Of course I remember that. There were predictions of doom, saying, if you pass this, you are going to throw this country into a tailspin. 
   This is a country that had a $290 billion deficit, an anemic economy, with 10 million people out of work. This is a country that desperately needed a change in direction. We made it without the help of one vote from the other side. 
   Frankly, I thought a couple of the folks you referenced were going to do a half-gainer off the Capitol Dome, they were so upset about us changing the fiscal policy of this country. But we did it.  
   Guess what happened. Guess what happened. This country's economy has seen robust economic growth. Seven years later, we do not have a budget deficit. No, we do not have a $290 billion, and growing, budget deficit. We have a budget that is nearly in balance. Economists are predicting surpluses for the next 10 years--I might point out, the same economists who predicted in the early 1990s we would have a full decade of sluggish, anemic growth in this country. 
   I mentioned yesterday these are the same economists who can't remember their home phone number or address telling us what will happen 3, 5, and 10 years from now. We ought to be careful about these predictions. We do not have a budget surplus yet. The 10 years of estimated $3 trillion surpluses do not exist, and we have folks on the floor who are breathless to try to deal with them through tax cuts.

   Mr. DORGAN. The economy has performed in a way no one expected. But we knew that the direction this country was headed in was wrong--$290 billion in a year in deficits, and heading up; more inflation, more people out of work. And we proposed to change the fiscal program for this country. 
   It took some guts to vote for it because it was not very popular. But I said to the folks I represent: Don't blame me for voting for that. Give me credit for it because I stand behind this program. We did what was necessary to put an end to these Federal budget deficits and to put this country's economy back on track--over the objections of a lot of folks in this Chamber who today are telling us they have a new vision, a new idea. 
   We have heard their ideas. An old fellow in my hometown--a small town--once told me: Never buy something from somebody who is out of breath. 
   There has been an almost breathless quality to the efforts by the majority party, for 6 months, to get to the floor as quickly as they could with their tax cuts. 
   If this is a battle of the pie charts, I say you win, we just give up. Here is a pie chart. Let me just show you. Let us just right at the start of this discussion say: You win; this is your pie; if it is a battle of the pie charts, you get the pie award. Republican tax breaks: $23,344 for the top 1 percent of the income earners. So you win the pie award. 
   Of course, these folks down here, they pay taxes, too. They all go to work. They pay payroll taxes. Eighty percent of the people in this country pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes. 
   But you breathlessly run to the floor of the Senate with a bill that says let's cut income taxes, because that allows you to give a huge portion of this pie to the largest income earners in this country. In the meantime, there are folks working today for the minimum wage, $5, $6, $7 an hour, who pay a payroll tax, a big tax, pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes. Are they going to get a tax cut? No; they don't count because they ``don't pay taxes.'' They are not taxpayers according to this strategy and this kind of philosophy. That is what is wrong with it. 
   Let me just run through a couple charts. 
   One of my colleagues showed this earlier this morning. I want to show it again. 
   The bottom 60 percent of the income earners, under this plan, will get $141 in tax breaks a year; the top 1 percent, $23,344 a year. And people say: How dare you tell us this benefits the rich. How dare we? It happens to be the fact. 
   As I said, so much of politics is fuzzy. But you do not need strong glasses to see this chart. There is nothing fuzzy about this. If you decide you do not want to do this, then do not do it. It is easy to amend your bill. If it is not your intention to give the bulk of the tax cut to the wealthiest Americans, then do not do it. But do not complain to us that we are calling attention to it when you do it. If you do not stand behind it, then change it. 
   My problem is this: I don't understand what conservatism means anymore. I thought being conservative would be to try to put this country at a lower risk with respect to future opportunities and its future economy. Conservatism apparently means put the country at higher risk. If you see a glimmer of a prospect of an estimate by an economist that there might be a surplus, rush to the floor of the Senate and propose a three-quarters-of-a-trillion-dollar tax cut. Is that conservative? 
   It was a perfect symmetrical proposition that, on the floor of the Senate yesterday, the first vote was to waive points of order that would exist against their bill, waive points of order for a conference report that has not yet been written, for a conference that has not been held. That was, in my judgment, in perfect symmetry to the proposition they bring to the floor to provide tax cuts, paid for with surpluses that don't yet exist. What perfect symmetry. But how perfectly awful as public policy to do that and put the country at this risk. 
   We have some choices. The choice is that we have good economic times in the future. Let us all hope and pray we do because that is good for this country. More people are working. Fewer people are on welfare. The country is growing, less inflation. It is a wonderful opportunity we have in this country. But the same people who opposed the fiscal policy that got us here have decided they want to create a new fiscal policy and a new strategy that puts all of that at risk. They know we are heading towards a serious problem.

   Mr. DORGAN. We are heading toward a demographic time bomb in both Social Security and Medicare. The question is, If these surpluses exist, what shall we do with them; reduce the Federal debt? That has gone from $1 trillion to $5.7 trillion in two decades. Reduce the Federal debt? The answer of the Republicans is no. How about extend the solvency of Social Security because we know we face this problem. Older people living longer; fewer people working to support them. Extend the solvency of Social Security? No. How about extending the solvency of Medicare? No. 
   The only answer coming from that side of the aisle is take three-quarters of a trillion dollars, package it up, put a huge bow around it, and then bring it to the floor of the Senate, and then complain about a pie chart that shows they have cut out the biggest piece for the wealthiest Americans.

   Mr. DORGAN. Well, the Senator knows the economy not only did not collapse and crash and go into a depression as a result of our new fiscal policy; the economy blossomed and grew and everything changed. The deficits were gone. The deficits were at $290 billion and growing. We changed the fiscal policy. 
   A number of our friends stood up and said: You do this and you are going to collapse this country's economy. In fact, the fellow who has offered this amendment is an economist, taught economics. I taught economics in college. I have been able to overcome that and lead a reasonably productive life, but economists can argue forever about all these things. 
   The question is whether we are going to put the country at risk by moving away from a fiscal policy that we know works and taking three-quarters of a trillion dollars from surpluses that do not yet exist and giving big tax breaks. 
   This amendment is the House tax bill. I want to read for the author something he probably heard me read yesterday.

Let me make the case, with regard to the House tax bill and, similarly, the Senate bill, Kevin Phillips, a Republican columnist, said the following:  
   We can fairly well call the House legislation the most outrageous tax package in the last 50 years. It is worse than the 1981 excesses. You have to go back to 1948.

   Mr. DORGAN. The point I am making is this: This is not a Democrat talking. This is a Republican saying this. We all know what is in this legislation. This legislation is a piece of legislation that does what is always done by the same suspects that bring this to the floor. They are always shading, not just shading, they are galloping towards the highest end of the income ladder to provide very significant cuts. The folks on the lowest rung of the ladder, they pay payroll taxes and they are told they don't count. So the lowest 20 percent are going to get a $22 tax break; the top 1 percent, $23,300. 
   So the question is, when you stand up and say that is unfair, what is unfair? That we are telling people what is in your bill? Is that unfair? Do you want to change the bill? Do you deny this? Do you want to change the bill? Offer an amendment, I will support the amendment to change the bill, but 
   don't say it is unfair when we tell people what the tax cut is going to be--$22 for the lowest 20 percent of the American people, and the $23,300 for the top 1 percent--because you have decided that people who pay payroll taxes don't count as taxpayers and you don't intend to give them any help. It is the folks at the upper end of the income ladder who are going to get huge tax breaks from the income tax system.

   Mr. DORGAN. Well, that is the case. 
   I submit this: In a quiet moment, in a secluded corner, in a private conversation, most Members of the Senate who are supporting this three-quarters-of-a-trillion-dollar tax cut would admit that a better approach for this country and its future and certainly its children would be to use anticipated surpluses, first, to begin to pay down the Federal debt. If during tough times you run up the debt from $1 trillion to $5.7 trillion and then in good times you say, but we can't pay down the debt, there is something fundamentally flawed about that strategy. 
   I think if you take all the politics and fuzz out of this and get in a quiet corner, those who are really conservative and have conservative values about these issues as embodied in the fiscal plan we passed in 1993, I think they would admit that we ought to take some of this surplus and reduce Federal indebtedness. I think they would also admit there is not an intention to kick 100,000 kids off of Head Start or to decimate the education program. Yet that is where we are headed, on auto pilot, because this surplus is garnered by those who want to package it up in a tax cut that predominantly benefits the upper-income folks. 
   We ought to do the right thing. The right thing, it seems to me, for our children's sake, is to tell them we are going to begin using some of this to reduce Federal indebtedness, and for our children's sake, that we are going to use some of this to extend the solvency of Medicare and Social Security, two programs that have made this country a much better place in which to live for millions and millions of Americans. We ought to do that. All of us know we ought to do it. Regrettably, we are on the floor in a perverted process. Reconciliation was never intended for this process--never. 
   Yet, we are here because it muzzles us up with a 20-hour debate and does not allow a full debate about fiscal policy and tax cuts. And I say to those on the other side, you will get your bill and have your votes and you will pass a bill. But, in my judgment, you will put this country at risk because you are spending, through tax cuts, surpluses that do not yet exist, just as yesterday you wanted to waive points of order on a conference report that had not yet been drafted. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday on NPR's ``Morning Edition,'' Kevin Phillips, a Republican author and commentator, had some interesting comments, and I wonder if the Senator from South Carolina had an opportunity to hear this Republican commentator discussing the House of Representatives tax cut.  
   Tax bills often deal with Pie in the Sky. The mind boggling ten-year cuts passed late last week by the House of Representatives however deserve a new term: Pie in Stratosphere.  
   He points out that the top 1 percent would get 33 percent of the tax cuts; the bottom 60 percent get only 7 percent of the tax cuts. 
   I thought the last paragraph of this Republican commentator was interesting:  
   We can fairly call the House legislation the most outrageous tax package in 50 years. It's worse than the 1981 excesses, you have to go back to 1948, when the Republican 80th Congress sent a kindred bill to President Harry Truman. Truman vetoed it, calling the Republicans bloodsuckers, with offices in Wall Street. Not only did he win reelection, but the Democrats recaptured Congress. We'll see if Bill Clinton and Albert Gore have anything resembling Truman's guts.  
   This is from a Republican commentator. He points out the amount of these tax cuts extending 10 years into the future, by economists who predict these surpluses; economists who can't remember their phone numbers and their home addresses are telling Americans that in 3, 5, 10 years in the future we will have big surpluses. What do we do? The House of Representatives says: Give most of the surpluses back to 1 percent of the people.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will come to the floor and comment generously about this fiscal policy issue of $792 billion of tax cuts over the next 10 years. We don't have surpluses yet. We have economists who tell us we will have surpluses and when these surpluses will exist over the coming 10 years. We have an appetite for trying to figure out what we want to do with all these surpluses that have not yet materialized. 
   Economists at the start of this decade in the early 1990s predicted almost universally that we would have a decade of slow, anemic economic growth and continued trouble. Going back 8 years, we had a $290 billion fiscal policy deficit. The Dow Jones industrial average had not yet reached 3,000, or it had barely reached 3,000. We had sluggish growth. In 1999, the budget deficit is largely gone. The Dow is somewhere close to 11,000. We have robust economic growth and economists predicting wonderful economic news as far as the eye can see. These are economists--who can't remember their telephone numbers or their home addresses--predicting what will happen, 3, 5, and 10 years in the future. 
   The result is people seize on these surpluses and say: Let's give three-quarters of $1 trillion in tax cuts, nearly one-third of which will go to the top 1 percent of the income earners in this country. I will have a lot more to say about that in the debate which will ensue during this week. My colleague, Senator DURBIN, just read Kevin Phillips' comments that were on NPR yesterday morning. I think they were right on point. I hope we can spend some time discussing those as well. 
   I want to talk about another deficit, one that both parties have been largely ignoring. It is called the trade deficit. 
   I have here a Washington Post article that appeared last Wednesday, July 21, ``U.S. Trade Deficit Hit Record High in May.'' This was written by Paul Blustein. Paul is the Washington Post reporter who writes their trade stories. Any time you see a trade story, it will be by Paul Blustein. He will talk to the same three or four people. They will comment in each article, and month after month the trade deficit worsens. 
   We have a very serious problem. We tackled the budget deficit, and wrestled it to the ground. Now, we largely don't have a fiscal policy budget deficit. It is gone. That was tough, hard work. But the trade deficit is growing and at an alarming rate. 
   It is interesting that this story in the Washington Post actually says that we have a trade deficit that is a record deficit, ``thanks to America's unflagging appetite for foreign goods.'' The Post, in this story, finds all of this both ``heartening'' and ``worrisome'' for the U.S. economy. 
   Heartening because so many Americans are feeling so prosperous that they are buying an ever-rising amount of imports. 
   I am more struck by the ``worrisome'' aspects of this trade deficit. One of those was highlighted by the Post article, with the Japanese deciding that their central bank should intervene with respect to the value of the yen against the dollar--to manipulate the value of the yen in order to influence continued exports to the United States. 
   What is happening to the trade deficit? This chart shows record trade deficits month after month. It means we are buying more from abroad than we are selling abroad. It means we are running a current accounts deficit that will some day be repaid by a lower standard of living in the United States. 
   There is a lot of disagreement among economists but none about that. 
   A trade deficit must at some point be repaid in the future by a lower standard of living in the country that experiences the trade deficit. 
   Here is a chart that shows the growing U.S. trade gap, exports and imports. You will see what is happening to the U.S. exports on this softening bottom line. And you will see what is happening to the level of U.S. imports and the massive red ink that represents indebtedness that burdens this country. Should we worry about this indebtedness? The answer is, yes, of course. Should we do something about it? Absolutely, and sooner rather than later. There is now in law a commission called the Trade Deficit Review Commission. This is a piece of legislation that I authored and was cosponsored by Senators BYRD, STEVENS, and others. This Commission has been impaneled and is now beginning its work. But we have a responsibility as a country to respond to this trade deficit and to do so aggressively. 
   Another chart shows the deficit with respect to specific countries. Japan: We have had a trade deficit with Japan forever, it seems. This trade deficit is robust and growing, and continues to grow to record levels. 
   It used to be that economists would say that we have trade deficits because we have been running budget deficits. When you run budget deficits, you are going to run trade deficits. The budget deficits are gone. Why is the trade deficit worsening? Yes, with Japan, with Canada, and it is worsening with Mexico. 
   We used to have a trade surplus with Mexico. We were able to turn that into a deficit very quickly because we negotiated a trade agreement with Mexico that was incompetent. We have incompetent negotiations by bad negotiators that resulted in bad trade agreements and higher deficits with respect to Mexico. We turned a surplus into a deficit. 
   China: What is happening with China is a very substantial runup of the trade deficit in just a matter of about 8 to 10 years. 
   What do we do about all this? I am concerned, obviously, about not only the general trade deficit, which weakens our manufacturing sector, but also with respect to the economic stars in our country, the family farmers. Agricultural trade balances have worsened. Our agricultural trade balance with Europe declined sharply between 1990 and 1998. In Asia and Europe, our agricultural trade balance has changed in a manner that is detrimental to family farming. 
   Going back to the issue I mentioned on the previous chart of our individual bilateral trade relations with China, Mexico, Canada, and Japan, you will see that we are continuing to run trade deficits that are alarmingly high. Yet no one wants to talk about it, and certainly no one wants to do anything about it. The minute someone says let's take some action, someone else will say: You are proposing a trade war. What on earth can you be thinking about? 
   This country had better think about itself for a few minutes. It ought to turn inward and ask: What does this red ink mean to the U.S. and its future? 
   Even Mr. Greenspan, who is prone to understatement, indicated that this cannot be sustained for any lengthy period of time. This country must worry about its bilateral trade relationships with the countries I just described. It also must worry about its general trade strategy, which results in huge trade deficits and in the kind of trade relationships, which I think will make this country's citizens increasingly angry and anxious. 
   Incidentally, these trade deficits are much higher than the Washington Post reports. The trade deficit in the Post represents the combination of goods and services. If you look at trade deficits in goods, it is much higher than this. That relates to the question of what is happening to the American manufacturers. 
   Let me talk about farmers specifically for a moment. Our family farmers around the country are suffering through a very 
   serious crisis. The bulk of that is because prices have collapsed on the grain market, even though the stock market is reaching record highs. The grain market has collapsed, and farmers are told their food has no value. 
   Another serious part is that, even though we produce more than we need and we need to find a foreign home for our grain, we discover that grain floods across our borders and livestock floods across our border, especially from Canada and other parts of the world, undercutting our farmers' interests. Why? Because we had incompetent negotiators negotiating incompetent trade agreements. They have resulted in increasing trade deficits in this country.  
   The story behind the headlines is the injury that is caused to family farmers, to the manufacturing sector, to that part of America's economy that has produced the strength of this country today. That strength will not long exist if we don't do something about the trade deficit. Those who talk about tax cuts for 10 years, anticipating future economic growth and future economic surpluses, will not see those develop and will not experience that growth unless we do something about this exploding trade deficit. You cannot sustain long-term economic growth when you run a $21.3 billion deficit in one month. It wasn't more than a couple decades ago that we ran a trade deficit of a couple billion dollars in a quarter of the year. Wilbur Mills, who used to be chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, called special meetings to talk about emergency tariffs to be put on goods to reduce the debilitating trade deficits. Now they are $21 billion a month and growing in a very significant way. 
   We need the Administration and the Congress to understand that the underlying trade negotiations and trade agreements we have had with a number of countries, including NAFTA and GATT, have undercut this country's interests. They do not work. They sell out the interests of family farmers in this country. They injure our manufacturing sector. I am not suggesting putting up walls and retreating. I want our producers to be required to respond to competition. But our producers cannot and should not be expected to respond to competition when our producers have one hand tied behind their backs by unfair trade agreements. 
   Finally, I want to talk for a moment about what happened last December with the U.S. Trade Ambassador announcing a deal with respect to the Canadian trade issue. They have all kinds of agreements that, as I said, weren't worth much. We just allowed them to put a bunch of points down on a piece of paper. I reviewed that deal, and nothing much has happened. In fact, our trade situation with Canada grows worse. Our agricultural economy grows worse. Prices have continued to collapse. Family farmers continue to be injured and, at the same time, we have durum and spring wheat, cattle and hogs flooding across the border, most unfairly traded and most in violation of the basic tenets of reciprocal trade. Yet, nothing happens. Nobody lifts a finger to say let us stand up on behalf of your interests and take the actions you would expect the Federal Government to take to insist on fair trade.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the vote that has been called on this issue, I assume, is a vote that will come to the Senate because some are inconvenienced or upset by amendments that have been offered by those on the Democratic side of the aisle. These amendments have dealt with a range of issues we think are very important: Education, health care, agriculture--a whole series of issues we think need to be addressed. Because we have not been able to address them on authorization bills, we have offered amendments on appropriations bills. 
   As the Presiding Officer and my colleagues know, the precedent stemming back from a vote some while ago in the Senate allows us to do that. That might be inconvenient for the majority because it allows us, then, on an appropriations bill, to offer an amendment and have a debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights, for example. Or it may allow for us to have a debate on the agriculture disaster relief bill. They may not want to do that, but they cannot deny the members of the Democratic minority in the Senate the right to amend an appropriations bill. So the proposal is to change the rules back to where they used to be in order to prevent amendments of the type I have just described from being offered to the appropriations bills. 
   I thought it would be useful today to just go through a list of bills that describe the way the Senate has been operating in recent years and describe why many of us have felt it necessary to try to add legislation to appropriations bills. Let me just go through a list going back to 1997 and 1998. 
   The Family Friendly Workplace Act, S. 4. This bill, as it was described on the floor of the Senate, sought to give employees more flexibility with their work hours. Senator PATTY MURRAY sought to propose an amendment to give employees 24 hours a year of current family medical leave so they could take time off to go to school conferences and other things. But cloture was filed so that amendments could be offered. The purpose of the majority was to say: We want to debate S. 4. It is our bill. We want to debate it and we do not want the inconvenience of having amendments that we believe are not appropriate or germane to the bill. So what we want to do is put the bill on the floor and file cloture and prevent the Democrats from offering amendments. 
   On the Education Savings Act for public and private schools, they had the same approach: Bring the bill out here, file cloture and say: We want to debate this bill. It is our agenda. But we do not want you to be able to offer the amendments you want to offer. 
   The Federal Vacancies Reform Act, the same thing; Child Custody Protection Act, same thing. If we go through a list of these, we see what has happened is the majority leader has set himself up, it seems to me, as a kind of House Rules Committee in the Senate, saying I am going to bring a bill to the floor, and I am going to fill the legislative tree, as they call it, and create a mechanism by which no one else can move. It is a legislative straitjacket. No one else will be able to offer amendments. 
   Then the majority leader has said to us, on occasion: All right, I have a bill. I have filled the tree, come to me with your amendments, and if I approve and think we ought to debate them, I will allow you to debate them; if I don't, I will not. 
   That is not the way the Senate works. The Senate is a very inconvenient place and not a very effective or efficient place in the way it disposes of legislation. But that happens to be the way George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin and Mason and Madison anticipated this place should work. 
   Remember the description about the Senate being the saucer that cools the coffee? They did not intend the Senate to work the way the House works, to have a Rules Committee to mandate that only certain amendments will be allowed, and then there will only be a 
   certain amount of debate allowed, and it will all go very efficiently. That is not the way they intended the Senate to work. Yet that is exactly the way the majority leader has anticipated the Senate should work now for some long while. 
   If we had this rule in place last year, for example, the Senator from Nevada knows we would not have been able to offer the agriculture relief package we offered and got attached to the agriculture appropriations bill. The first portion of the farm crisis relief package was done in the Senate as an amendment that I and Senator CONRAD offered to the agriculture appropriations bill. It would not be allowed under the rule change that is now being proposed by the majority leader. 
   So we have a circumstance where the majority has decided that it really wants to debate its agenda. I understand that. If I were on their side, I would want to debate their agenda. They have a right to do that; that is their right. I will vote every day to support their right to do that. But then they say: Not only do we want to debate our agenda, we want to prevent the other side from offering amendments that relate to their agenda. 
   That is not appropriate. It is not the way the Senate should work. The reason we have had to offer amendments to appropriations bills is because authorization bills have not been passed. When they do come to the floor, the majority leader decides he does not want amendments offered to authorization bills. 
   Let me give one example, if I might. Does anybody know anything about the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization bill? That is an important  bill. It describes how we run the airways in this country--the control towers, the safety of air transportation. Do you know we just passed the other night, by unanimous consent, a 2-month extension of the FAA bill? I will bet there are not 10 Senators who know we passed, by unanimous consent, a 2-month extension. Why did we pass a 2-month extension? Because we should have passed an FAA reauthorization bill in the last Congress and it did not get done because we have a huge fight going on.

   Mr. DORGAN. That is exactly what is happening in the Senate, and it causes some heartburn for many people who understand how the Senate has traditionally worked and ought to work. This is not the House. We do not have a Rules Committee which decides what amendments should be offered. I know some want to change this into a body that operates identically to the House of Representatives, but it is not the way the Framers of this Government decided how it should work. 
   I want to go back for a moment to this issue of the FAA reauthorization bill. It describes our problems. We are not passing authorization bills. They are all hung up with big disputes here and there, and when one does come to the floor, the folks who bring it to the floor fill up the legislative tree and decide they do not want the rest of us to be able to offer amendments. That is a big problem. If the Senate were operating the way it should, I do not think there would be any concern about whether or not you could legislate on an appropriations bill. But because the Senate is not operating the way it should, the Democrats are largely prevented from offering amendments in most cases. 
   And motions to shut off debate before debate starts, or even before the first amendment is offered, have now become routine. Think of that again. The filing of motions to shut off debate, even before the first amendment is filed, has become routine in the Senate. 
   If you went back to that little room in Philadelphia where they wrote this Constitution, I will bet they would be aghast at that. When Mason and Madison and Franklin and George Washington, talked about what kind of a framework they wanted to describe for governance of this country, they created a Senate that was deliberately inefficient. It required things to slow down a bit and that there to be a lengthy public debate about what ought to happen and what is good and what is not good public policy. They did that deliberately. 
   Now we have all these folks who say we do not want the Senate to be able to consider, for any length of time, these issues. We do not want amendments to be offered; we want this place to be kind of a slam-dunk, highly efficient mirror image of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
   That is not what it ought to be. 
   I know outside this Chamber this notion of rule changes and rule XVI sounds like a foreign language. 
   I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this must sound like a foreign language to people--rule XVI, legislating on appropriations bills, germane. It is not a foreign language. It is about whether folks have the right to stand at these desks and engage in debate and offer amendments. 
   This desk I am standing at is the desk that was sat in by Robert La Follette, the great, popular Senator from Wisconsin. In fact, I am told on May 29, 1908, they tried to poison Robert La Follette at this very desk. The Senate historian sent me information about that. He had been filibustering and had been on his feet for some 8 hours or so, and he put a glass of eggnog to his lips and spat the eggnog and claimed he had been poisoned. There is a lot of mystery about that circumstance. It was at this desk in 1908 that a great, popular Senator in the middle of a filibuster suffered that indignity. 
   Having heard that story now and seen the evidence from the Senate historian, I am probably not likely to filibuster anytime soon. At least if I do, I will not from this desk. 
   The point is, back in the old days, the way the Senate used to work, and the not so old days even going back 10, 20, 30 years, the Senate was a deliberative body. Its ability to debate was not choked by someone filing cloture motions before anyone else had the opportunity even to offer an amendment. That is not the way the Senate should work. 
   The change in rule XVI allowed us to offer legislative amendments on appropriations bills. That is necessary only because the Senate is now being operated in a way that, in my judgment, was not intended at all by the framers of the Constitution and certainly was not the way it was run for the first 180 years or so of its existence.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we now turn to another agenda in the Senate. By direction of the majority party, we turn to the subject of tax cuts. It is a corner that we have navigated before in this Congress. I was thinking that it might be useful to have had Daniel Webster in this Chamber to say to Members, as he said many years ago: ``Necessity compels me to speak the truth rather than pleasing things. I should indeed like to please you, but I prefer to save you, whatever be your attitude toward me.'' 
   It certainly must be pleasing to say to constituents that we would like to give tax breaks as far as the eye can see, upwards of a half a trillion, three-quarters of a trillion, and some say $1 trillion. What a wonderful thing. 
   This country is doing quite well. Its economy is moving ahead with significant health. Unemployment is way down. Inflation is way down. There are a lot of things in this country to be thankful for. 
   Part of the reason to be thankful for that is, in 1993, some of us in Congress had the vision to steer this country to a different course. If we remember, in 1993, we were facing a $290 billion Federal deficit--$290 billion. The economists told us that for the rest of the decade we would have anemic economic growth and deficits. 
   We passed a piece of legislation in this Congress. I voted for it. I was proud to do so. When people said: We're  going to blame you for voting for that, I said: Don't blame me. Please give me credit for it. I won't run away from that vote. 
   It was a tough, hard vote. It increased some taxes, mostly on those in top 1 or 2 percent, and it cut some spending. It was tough economic medicine, but it signaled to the country we were going to put this country back on track with a responsible fiscal policy that would lead someday to a balanced budget. 
   We passed that by one vote in the House and one vote in the Senate--one vote. We did not get one vote from the majority side--not one. We provided all of the votes to pass that legislation at that point. We were widely criticized for it. In fact, we had Members on the other side predict that it would lead to a depression; it would lead to massive unemployment; it would collapse our economy; it would be awful for our country. 
   This country has had unprecedented economic growth, declining unemployment and low inflation. There are more people working and there is more home ownership. And now we find, instead of a $290 billion budget deficit, budget surpluses ahead. 
   What happens at the first sign of surplus from this bridge on the ship of state? At the first sign of surplus, the majority party decides it is time to abandon the bridge and go down and get the champagne, pop the corks and pass out money to everybody--well, not to everybody--pass out money to all the friends from the ship's crew. 
   Let's talk about what all this means. 
   They rely on some vision for the next 10 and 20 years that we will have surpluses forever. Of course, this comes from economists that cannot remember their home phone number--telling us what is going to happen 3, 5, and 10 years from now. Those in the majority party say: Because we have all of this good economic news, although we didn't participate in helping make that happen--we voted against that economic plan in 1993--we are now deciding we are going to offer tax breaks of unprecedented size. 
   This is what is proposed. 
   The tax breaks that will come to the floor of the Senate and will be on the floor of the other body today have as their priorities that we will not provide any money to make Medicare solvent. We won't provide any money for our domestic priorities: education, health care, defense, and other key investments. We will provide no money for debt reduction. One would expect when times are good, we ought to be able to begin reducing the indebtedness we incur when times are bad, but there is no money for debt reduction and no money for Social Security solvency. We are going to have a tax cut of $792 billion. 
   That is the GOP priority. That is not new. That has always been their priority. It is full speed ahead on our priority, and everything else can wait. 
   If you have a pie and you show who get the tax breaks, here is how the pie gets cut. If you are in the top 1 percent of the income earners of this country, you get this large piece. If you are in the next 4 percent, between 95 and 99, you also get a large piece of the pie. But the lowest 20 percent of the income earners of this country get this little sliver, just a crumb off the corner. It is always the same, and it never changes. The big tax breaks go to the upper-income folks, and the rest are left with tiny crumbs, if any at all. 
   This chart shows the same thing. The top 1 percent get a $23,000-a-year average tax cut. The bottom 60 percent of the wage earners in this country get a $139 a year tax cut. This chart shows what is going to happen over the next 20 years. The period of time 2000-2004, 2005-2009, the cost of the GOP tax grows substantially. In the second decade, it literally explodes. It will head us right back to the same circumstance we had before of huge Federal deficits. 
   This chart shows the same thing in a different style. These are back loaded, exploding tax breaks that benefit the upper-income folks and will, in my judgment, lead to very significant risks for this country. 
   I will ask this question over and over again: If this is your priority, just tax cuts above everything else, and tax cuts that go largely to the upper-income folks in this country, do you decide, then, that Head Start, for example, is not important because the domestic discretionary portion of this budget is fixing to be shrunk like a prune? You look at the kind of cuts that are necessary in all of the programs that make this a good country, the investment in our children, the investment in nutrition, the investment in health care, you will find massive cuts in all of those programs in order to pay for tax breaks that say to the folks in this country: We believe if you are in the top 1 percent, you ought to get $22,900 back in tax refunds each year because we think you contribute the most to this country. And if you happen to be in the lowest 20 percent of the income earners of this country, we have designed a plan that says you are going to get about a $1.59 a month. 
   Is that surprising? No. It is the GOP plan from the beginning of political time. It is what they have always proposed. It is what they always fight for. It is always at the expense of every other priority. 
   We are going to have a big debate about this and should have a big debate. I believe some tax cuts are appropriate, if they are fashioned the right way and they don't put this country's economy at risk. But I believe they ought not come at the expense of Head Start, education, health care and so many other key priorities, and especially paying down the debt during good economic times and making sure we extend the life and solvency of Medicare and Social Security. That ought to be part of the priority that comes out of this Chamber as well. That is what we will try to force in this debate on tax breaks in the coming days. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DORGAN. I wanted to ask the Senator from Illinois if it is not the case that the proposal by the Republicans for very significant tax cuts, much of which will go to the upper income folks, would mean that they have nothing for debt reduction? Isn't it the case that in tough economic times--for example, when we passed the Deficit Reduction Act in 1993, with no help from the other side and not one vote even--in tough economic times your debt increases? During good economic times, you ought to reduce the debt. Isn't it the case that this fiscal policy plan of theirs provides nothing for debt reduction during good economic times? Is that fiscal conservatism?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I'm pleased to join Senator DURBIN in introducing estate tax relief legislation to boost immediately to $2.6 million the amount of family business assets that can be transferred to the next generation without loading up that family business with a large tax debt. I feel strongly that we must prevent our estate tax laws from hindering the transfer of family farms, ranches and other small businesses to the next generation of family members who would continue to operate them. We made some important changes to the estate tax laws in the last Congress to make it easier for children to take over a family business when a parent dies and keep the business going. But these changes did not go far enough. 
   Family-owned enterprises are a source of social stability and cohesion in this country. They generate jobs and wealth. Yet in far too many cases, the estate tax laws exert pressure on the children and grandchildren who inherit a modestly-sized family business to sell it, or a large part of it, to pay off those taxes. Our tax laws should encourage enterprises to stay in family ownership, with all the benefits that brings to our communities and to the nation. Yet frequently today the estate tax laws do the opposite. 
   Congress took some steps in a major tax bill in 1997, which I supported, to enable family farms, ranches, and other small family businesses to be passed along to the next generation without being loaded up with massive estate tax debt. The 1997 bill changes estate taxes in two basic ways. First, the legislation increased the unified estate and gift tax exemption from $600,000 to $1 million over a period of years. Second, it provided a new exemption from estate taxes for qualifying family businesses, valued up to $1.3 million, that are passed down to the children and grandchildren who will operate the farm or business. This new exclusion is the result of a bipartisan effort in Congress to encourage business enterprise that is based on the family unit. 
   However, Senator DURBIN and I believe that the $1.3 million family business exclusion needs to be substantially increased, and we suspect that a number of our colleagues in the Senate share this view. We are proposing such an increase today. 
   Our legislation is simple and straightforward. It doubles the dollar value from $1.3 million to $2.6 million of a family business that may be transferred to inheriting family members without an estate tax obligation. This will be a great help to families that want to pass along a small business, which might have been the family's major asset for decades, to the kids to operate following the death of a parent. 
   Estate tax relief for family businesses is not a partisan issue. It is important for the survival of our nation's family businesses, and it should be a priority for any tax cuts that Congress enacts. 
   This is not however a proposal to reduce estate taxes for every rich person in America. We see no need to enact a big new benefit for the nation's trust fund babies. It should go to where the need is greatest, and where the economic and social benefits will be greatest as well. That means small family businesses. 
   In the end, we hope that some additional estate tax relief will be enacted to sustain family-owned businesses and farms, which make up the backbone of our economy. We believe that our approach takes a large step in that direction. We urge our colleagues to cosponsor this much-needed legislation.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Ray Zink, North Dakota Department of Transportation Deputy Director for Engineering, retired June 30. In his 40 years with NDDOT, Ray has had a long-standing dedication to providing the best possible transportation system for the people of North Dakota at the lowest possible cost. 
   Ray Zink joined NDDOT in 1959 as a draftsman, and after subsequent promotions, he became chief engineer in 1982. Ray worked successfully with four NDDOT directors, three governors, and both political parties. Governors, legislators, and others in political positions have trusted Ray throughout the years and respected his integrity and judgement. 
   Ray has held several key positions in AASHTO (the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials), and because of his expertise and the respect accorded him, he has been invited to represent AASHTO and the FHA (Federal Highway Administration) at highway symposiums in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and Johannesburg and Durban, South Africa. 
   As North Dakota's chief highway engineer for 17 years, Ray Zink can claim the following accomplishments: 
   Helping to build one of the finest highway systems in the nation: Because the state is so large and people live so far from each other, North Dakota requires an extensive highway system to move people and commodities. However, it lacks the population base to support the system it needs. In spite of this, Ray Zink has led NDDOT to create an excellent highway system, by listening to the public, relying on sound engineering practices, and industriously using every penny of funding in the most effective way. 
   Using Federal aid as quickly as possible: North Dakota has always matched and used every dollar of federal aid available to it. Under Ray's leadership the state has spent federal aid as quickly and efficiently as possible, because every delay reduces the effectiveness of the funding through inflation and further highway deterioration. In rural America, our roads are critical to keeping us connected to our farms, our jobs, our families, and our cities. 
   Instituting North Dakota's low-load program: To help funnel more funds to where they were most badly needed, Ray initiated the low-load program. Highways with very low truck traffic are designated ``low-load highways.'' They receive basic maintenance and periodic seal coats but are not candidates for other improvements. This lets NDDOT direct its resources to heavily-traveled highways that need more attention, which means that the entire highway system is in better shape and will deteriorate more slowly. 
   As NDDOT maintenance engineer and chief engineer, Ray Zink has helped create and maintain these vital links between towns and cities and farms, and we are grateful for his careful guardianship.

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the Senator from Alaska has offered, on behalf of Senator DASCHLE and Senator LOTT, a resolution dealing with the issue of the apparent tragedy that has befallen John F. Kennedy, Jr., Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and Lauren Bessette. 
   I want to make a comment about that because I know that, along with most Americans, this weekend when we heard the news of the disappearance of John F. Kennedy, Jr., along with his wife and sister-in-law, most of us were quite shocked and deeply saddened by the news. 
   This was a young man whose life had such bright promise. He was born the son of a young, new President of the United States. That President's life was cut short by assassination just 3 years into his term. 
   I and countless thousands of other young Americans were inspired by John F. Kennedy, by his energy and by the passion and ideals of his administration. The experience of being in high school and college and watching the emergence of this new, energetic, young President on the scene in this country was something that inspired many young Americans towards public service. That includes my early interest in public service. 
   When John F. KENNEDY was assassinated, I think most of us who were called to public service, or at least were called to an interest in public service back in that period, believed there was kind of an unfinished nature to the legacy of his administration and his Presidency. 
   I think many thought over the years that this young man, John F. Kennedy, Jr., was in some way destined to complete that legacy of public service. 
   Now another tragedy has visited this family, that has already given so much to this country, and has taken from us this wonderful, unique young man. I want to join with all of my colleagues in extending our sympathies to our colleague, Senator Kennedy, to the entire Kennedy family, and to the Bessette family. This is a very difficult time for all of them. I know all Members of the Senate probably already have individually sent those messages to that family. 
   I have said on other occasions in the Senate, that there is a lot of public debate that goes on that people see between Members of the Senate and they tend to think there is a lack of personal relationships that exists in the Senate. Nothing could be further from the truth. When something happens to the family of a Member of the Senate, others here whose life's work brings us all together, care deeply. 
   When I lost a daughter a few years ago, I recall Senator HATCH sending me a white Bible and coming to visit with me. Senator BYRD sent me one of the most beautiful pieces of prose I have ever received, and so many other Senators expressed their sympathies. That is the way it is in the Senate. I know Senator KENNEDY and his family are going through a very difficult time, and our entire country reaches out to them now to express our deepest and most profound regrets and sympathies.

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I want to discuss an item of very significant importance that has brought me to the floor of the Senate several times and brings me here again today. That is the issue of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
   I earlier mentioned President John F. Kennedy. President John F. Kennedy was very interested in a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. I want to describe why that is the case and relate it to the comments made by my colleague dealing with China in which he talked about accountability and responsibility. I agree with those terms and in most cases with the use of those terms on the floor of the Senate. 
   It was 54 years ago last Friday that the first nuclear explosion took place on this Earth; the first nuclear bomb was detonated 54 years ago last Friday. Virtually everything changed because of it. 
   Following the detonation of a nuclear device it was used to end the Second World War. Eventually nuclear weapons led to a cold war with the Soviet Union in which both sides began to stockpile thousands and thousands of nuclear bombs and nuclear weapons of various types. Presidents of the United States started talking about the need to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons, to keep them in as few hands as possible among the countries of the world. Many countries aspired to have nuclear bombs, nuclear weapons. However, it was obviously in the interests of the safety of humankind to try to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of those who aspired to have them. 
   President Eisenhower, in May of 1961, spoke about a ban on testing nuclear devices. If you can't test a nuclear device, you don't know whether you have one that works. A test ban effectively means that anyone who claims to have a nuclear weapon cannot claim to have a nuclear weapon that works because they will never know. 
   That is the value of a ban on testing, a ban that was aspired to as long ago as President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who said the following:  
   Not achieving a test ban would have to be classed as the greatest disappointment of any administration, of any decade, of any time and of any party.  
   He left office deeply disappointed that even in those early days long before the buildup of nuclear weapons existed so 
   aggressively across the world, he was profoundly disappointed at not getting the test ban. 
   President John F. Kennedy got a test ban in place in 1963 dealing with atmospheric tests. The ban on atmospheric tests in 1963 was partially successful. He desired a total ban. He said:  
   A test ban would place the nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest hazards man faces....... It would increase our security, it would decrease the prospects of war. Surely this goal is sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit, yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital and responsible safeguards.  
   Now, since that time, we have seen more nations achieve the ability to build nuclear weapons and the ability to deliver them. We have seen our country and the Soviet Union stockpile tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. It is quite remarkable, the United States and Russia, together, currently have more than 30,000 nuclear weapons. China has nuclear weapons. The number, to the extent we know, is classified. But, it is a minuscule amount as compared to 30,000. We know from recent events that India and Pakistan both have nuclear weapons. Both have exploded nuclear devices literally beneath each other's chin--and these are two countries that don't like each other. Two countries with a common border, with a great deal of animosity, both testing nuclear devices in a provocative way. Other countries aspire to achieve or to obtain nuclear weapons. 
   What are we doing about all of this? There is a treaty that has been negotiated over a long period of time--in fact, ultimately over decades--and signed by 152 countries. It is a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. That comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty is a treaty which prohibits the testing of nuclear weapons, it bans the explosive testing of nuclear weapons all across this world. 
   We have had some experience with treaties: arms control and arms reduction treaties, the START I treaty, Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, SALT I, START II, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. A whole series of treaties have been considered and negotiated and ratified by the Senate. 
   This treaty, the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, was negotiated and signed and sent to the Senate a long while ago--665 days ago; 665 days ago a treaty that this country negotiated and signed was sent to the Senate to be ratified. 
   What has happened with previous treaties? The limited nuclear test ban treaty in 1963 was sent to the Senate and considered in 3 weeks; the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty in 1972 took 3 months; the ABM Treaty took 10 weeks; the ABM Treaty protocols, 14 months; Conventional Forces in Europe, 4 months; START I, 11 months. 
   The comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty was sent here over 665 days ago and it has yet to have had a first day of hearings in the Committee on Foreign Relations in the Senate. 
   Why? Why would a treaty that is so important to this country languish for nearly 2 years without even an hour, not a day of hearings?  
   We are, as a world, in a much better position than we were some years ago in the middle of the cold war when the Soviet Union and the United States were headlong in an arms race, building and deploying tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union is gone. The cold war is over. The arms race has largely diminished. 
   One thing remains constant: Many other countries around the world want to obtain nuclear weapons. 
   Many countries around the world want to obtain delivery systems to deliver nuclear weapons. They are testing medium-range and long-range missiles. They are trying to find ways to produce or obtain the materials necessary to build a nuclear device. This country, in the middle of all of this, must provide leadership. 
   It is our responsibility to provide that leadership. We are the remaining nuclear superpower. Russia has nuclear devices to be sure, but Russia is not a world power of the type the United States is at this point. We, as a country, must exert some leadership, and one step in the right direction towards diminishing the opportunities for other countries to achieve reliable nuclear weapons, is to quickly ratify this treaty, the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. 
   The decision of this country to drag our feet is almost unforgivable. It sends a signal to others around the rest of the world--to China, Russia, India, Pakistan and others--that this is not all that important; it is not a priority to the United States. It ought to be. Everybody in this Chamber ought to come to the floor to demand that this be brought before the Senate. It has languished for almost 2 years in the Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate. It ought to be brought to the floor, and we ought to have a debate on it. 
   In October of this year, the countries who have ratified this treaty will be meeting to discuss implementing the treaty. They will apparently be meeting without the United States as an active participant. It is wrong, in my judgment, for this country to decide that it is not going to provide the leadership necessary on this treaty. The rest of the world looks to us, waits for us, and the Senate is dragging its feet. I understand the committees in the Senate have a great deal of authority and power. I recognize that, but it seems to me there is a compelling national interest that should require this country to lead, and require this Senate to ratify the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. 
   I want to, with one additional chart, point out what was said by Secretary of State Albright:  
   .....this is the longest-sought, hardest-fought prize in arms control. And it is a price not yet fully won. For American leadership, for our future, the time has come to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty--this year, this session, now.  
   I heard my colleague from Alaska talk about Chinese espionage at the National Labs. That is an unsettling and a very serious issue. It raises all kinds of questions about the safeguarding of nuclear secrets, about how much and what kind of secrets might have been obtained by those who were spying on behalf of another country, and did these secrets allow that country or those countries to build higher yield or smaller nuclear devices. 
   I do not know the answer to those questions, but the words ``accountability and responsibility'' were used repeatedly in discussing that issue. Accountability and responsibility--it seems to me those two words are appropriate; in fact, those two words are exactly what we ought to talk about with respect to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   Accountability and responsibility--if this country is responsible, and if this country is going to be accountable for its leadership in the world, the leadership away from the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the leadership toward a safer world, one with fewer nuclear weapons rather than more nuclear weapons, then this country will take the lead now on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It is not the case, as some have argued, that the China espionage issue actually undercuts ratification of this treaty. In fact, that issue strengthens the need for this treaty. It strengthens the need for this treaty. 
   To suggest--and there was a recent article in the Wall Street Journal suggesting there is a linkage--Chinese espionage is why we ought not ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is nonsense. In fact, these allegations of espionage, in my judgment, 
   underscore why this treaty ought to be ratified and ought to be ratified now. 
   To the extent that China believes it may have acquired the opportunity for better nuclear warheads, it will never know that unless it is able to test them. And as a signatory to a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, it cannot test without violating the treaty. 
   I will be participating in a press conference tomorrow with others in the Senate during which we will announce a recent public opinion poll that has been done on this issue which shows widespread public support to ratify this comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. I hope that perhaps with some pressure and some thoughtfulness on the part of all Members of the Senate, we will be given an opportunity to debate and vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty soon. 
   Again, I understand how this system works, but it is not a system that ought to work in the regular way for something as important as this: limiting the spread of nuclear weapons. This country ought to take the lead in preventing it, and it ought to do so now. It is just plain wrong for the Senate to drag its feet on a treaty of this importance. A treaty negotiated and signed by 152 countries, waiting to be ratified for almost 2 years, and not even have 1 hour of hearings. That is wrong and everybody in this Chamber should know it is wrong. 
   I do hope my colleagues will join me in calling for the Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate to bring the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty before the Senate.

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have been talking about what I hope the agenda of the Senate will be in the next weeks as we turn from the Patients' Bill of Rights, which consumed all of last week and which was a fairly hard-fought debate. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, I hope, will be a part of that. 
   As I indicated on Friday, I also feel very strongly that the majority leader and others in this Senate must put at the head of the list of items for consideration a piece of legislation that will deal with the emergency needs of family farming. 
   The economy has collapsed in rural America, and we cannot wait. It requires this Congress to act and act soon. We have a farm bill that is largely bankrupt. It does not provide support during tough times. It pulls the rug out from under family farmers even as market prices have collapse. This Congress must do two things: first, pass an emergency bill; and, second, rewrite the farm program in a way that says to family farmers: You produce food the world needs, we care about that, and we are going to help you across price valleys when they occur. 
   I will speak more about that later this week. Madam President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today is an anniversary that almost no one will  recognize. It was 54 years ago today that the first nuclear explosion occurred at the Trinity Test Site in New Mexico. Mr. President, 54 years ago today we saw the first nuclear explosion on the face of the Earth. At that time, of course, we developed nuclear weapons because we were locked in a life and death struggle with the Axis powers. We developed nuclear weapons to end the most destructive war the world had ever seen, the Second World War. We then got involved in a cold war with the Soviets and we saw the buildup of thousands and thousands of tactical and strategic nuclear weapons, warheads, and delivery vehicles. 
   I want to tell you what President Dwight D. Eisenhower said towards the end of his term about the spread of nuclear weapons. He said not achieving a test ban--that is, a ban on the testing of nuclear weapons--``would have to be classified as the greatest disappointment of any administration of any decade of any time and of any party.'' That belief, expressed by President Eisenhower, was echoed by President John F. Kennedy, who stated that a comprehensive nuclear test ban would ``increase our security; it would decrease the prospects of war.'' He said, ``Surely this goal is sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit.'' 
   That was the late 1950s and the early 1960s. We still do not have a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in force, but we are close. Almost 3 years ago, this country, the United States, along with over 100 nations, signed a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The President sent that treaty to the Senate 662 days ago. What has happened? What has been done with that treaty? Nothing. Not a hearing. Not a minute, not an hour, not a day of hearings, not one hearing on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
   The only way another country in this world who wants to develop nuclear weapons can have some guarantee that they have nuclear weapons that work is if they can test them. That is true of China; it is true of any other country. A test ban treaty in which this country provides leadership, signs and ratifies it, is a significant step towards removing the dangers of the proliferation of nuclear weapons around the world. We ought to do this. We ought to be able to do it soon. 
   I used a chart on the floor of the Senate recently in which I showed the number of days it took to ratify treaties. No treaty that I am aware of languished here for over 600 days except this treaty. 
   We have a responsibility to lead in this country with respect to this treaty, and we are not leading. This treaty is before the Senate. The committee has a responsibility to hold a hearing and give the Senate the opportunity to debate the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. There is precious little discussion about it. No one seems to know it is here. It has been here almost 2 years. 
   Next week, several of my colleagues and I are going to hold a press conference to announce the results of a recent bipartisan poll that will demonstrate, once again, overwhelming support for this treaty. This chart shows the support all across this country from last year's poll. Overwhelmingly, the American people support a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
   It has been negotiated, it has been signed, but it has not been ratified. Why? Because it was sent to the Senate over 600 days ago and there has been no debate about it, no discussion of it to speak of, and there has not been 1 minute of hearings held on this treaty. This Senate ought to have the opportunity to debate and to vote on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
   I reach back to President Eisenhower to make the case only because I want to demonstrate how long the desire for a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty has been around--decade after decade. 
   Most recently, when India and Pakistan detonated nuclear weapons, virtually under each other's chins--and these are countries that do not like each other much--it should have sent a signal to all of us that we need to be concerned about the proliferation of nuclear weapons. How do we manifest concern? By expressing leadership. How do we express leadership? By bringing a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty that has been negotiated and signed before this body for ratification. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one only needs to open a newspaper or turn on a television set to a news program in this country, the United States, to understand we are experiencing a wonderful economy, a wonderful turn of events. This has lasted a long while. Most people are working. Inflation is down. Budget deficits have evaporated. The country is growing. The economy is doing better, and there is a lot of good news. 
   In addition to the general economic news, the stock market is in a kind of go-go mood reaching record highs. These breathtaking heights in the stock market are coupled with stories about young people involved in the Internet who are making millions before they are old enough to shave. That is wonderful. 
   There are a lot of people doing well in this country because of the economy. But there are some who are left behind and left out. We ought to pay attention to some of these storm clouds. I am speaking especially about family farmers. They are this country's economic all stars and have been for some long while. They are suffering silently, but they are suffering in a very significant way today. This Congress has a responsibility to do something about it. 
   Let me read a letter that I received from a farmer in North Dakota a day or two ago. He says:  
   As a family farmer and rancher, it doesn't seem to me there are many people who care much about us anymore. It sometimes brings tears to my eyes that maybe in a year or two I won't be around in farming anymore. This won't be easy to explain to my three daughters. I wanted to bring them up in a rural setting. If it happens I can't farm, I hope they read in the history books some day that it wasn't because their dad was a dumb man. It was caused by policy and giant concentrations of companies who want world dominance.  
   This farmer, who worries about losing his farm and worries about how he will explain that to his three daughters, worries about not being able to raise his daughters on the family farm. He says it is not his fault. And it isn't. 
   I want to describe what this man is going through. 
   Another farmer wrote to me and said:  
   I'm sitting at the kitchen table at 3:30 in the morning. It is spooky quiet out here these days, neighbors going broke, moving away, family farmers can't make it. My family is asleep and I don't know how long I will be able to hang on to this family farm.  
   Let me describe what these farmers face. While the stock market reaches record highs, here is what happens to the price of wheat. Those family farmers see their income declining in a very significant way. No one else is experiencing declining income. CEO salaries aren't going down; they are going up, up, up--way up. The stock market is going up to record highs. Yet if you are raising wheat and you are a family farmer, you have seen your income collapse. 
   What if you are raising corn? Exactly the same thing. Your income is collapsing. 
   What if you are raising soybeans on the family farm? The same thing. The income is collapsing. 
   What share are you getting as a family farmer of the retail food dollar? Collapsing. 
   In the spring, you borrow some money, you buy some seeds, you fix up the tractor, plant the seeds, and hope they grow. You worry about insects; you worry about crop disease; you worry it will hail; you worry that it won't rain enough, or maybe too much; and then at the end you may get a crop. If you get a crop, you worry when you will get it off the ground. After you have combined it and harvested the crop, you put it on the truck and drive to the elevator, only to be told the grain trade says that the crop produced has no value. We are going to pay you $1.50 or $2 a 
   bushel less than it cost to produce. 
   You sit in the truck as a family farmer, knowing you took all of these risks, that your family is depending on you, and that the world is hungry. You hear the stories. You hear that in the Sudan a million people face the abyss of starvation and old women climb trees to forage for leaves because they have nothing to eat. 
   The grain trade says the food we produce has no value. Farmers scratch their heads and say: I guess it is because the public policies in this country say that family farmers don't count. Family farmers don't matter.  
   That is what angers family farmers the most. They produce something of enormous importance to the entire world and are told it has no value. They are told that the farm bill is fundamentally bankrupt. The Freedom to Farm Act passed by this Congress several years ago is totally bankrupt. It ought to be repealed immediately. 
   Trade agreements, negotiated by trade negotiators who have done a terrible job and were totally incompetent, sold our farmers down the river. 
   So family farmers have a right to ask the question: Why can't we expect from this Congress, this Administration, and this country, a decent opportunity to make a living, a decent price for the food we produce, and a decent deal from trade agreements that are negotiated with other countries? Why can't we expect this country to stand up for family farmers? 
   A group from some farm States met this morning. We talked about how we will mobilize efforts to try to begin to provide two things. One, we need some emergency help--an emergency disaster relief bill to offset the income collapse which family farmers are facing. Second, we need a change in the farm program. We decided to seek a meeting next week with President Clinton at the White House. We will try to make sure this Administration proposes a robust disaster program and joins in proposing to change the underlying farm program to provide decent income support for family farmers when prices collapse. 
   Next week we will try to do that, meet with the President, and develop an emergency bill to provide disaster relief. Senator HARKIN and I proposed such a bill in the appropriations subcommittee. Senator CONRAD has proposed a number of ideas on how to provide disaster relief. I expect we will have to propose disaster relief somewhere in the $10-billion-plus range. 
   This Congress has a responsibility to respond to this issue and to do it soon. 
   Second, to change the farm bill so family farmers have a safety net. Others in this country have a safety net. But somehow the suggestion was made that we can just pull the safety net out from under family farmers and that would be fine. Nobody will care. Families care. Farmers care. I do not want anybody standing up in this Chamber saying they are profamily and then turn a blind eye to the needs of family farmers. That is what has been happening. 
   If there were fires or floods or tornadoes that hit our part of the country and devastated all the buildings, the economy and the infrastructure, we would have folks rushing out there with help. We would have FEMA all set up in big buildings and tents, getting people in to give help. Everybody would be helping. In fact, you wouldn't even need a tornado. If some hogs got sick with a mysterious disease, we would have the entire Department of Agriculture trying to find out what was wrong with the hogs. Only farmers can see their incomes collapse. 
   In our State, the incomes collapsed 98 percent in 1 year. Ask yourself, could your family stand a 98 percent loss in income? Could any Members of the Senate stand a 98 percent loss in their paycheck? Can wage earners stand a 98 percent loss in their wage? I don't think so. That is what happened to farmers in my State. 
   The question is, who is going to respond, when are they going to respond, and when is this country going to care whether we have family farmers left in our future? The answer for me is soon. The answer for me is now. Next week, we must expect to make progress with the President; yes, with the majority party and the minority party working together to try to provide disaster relief, No. 1, and a long-term safety net, No. 2. 
   I want to tell you about a fellow named Tom Ross who did something that I thought was unique in Minot, ND. Tom Ross is a newscaster with KMOT television. He got 48 acres just north and east of Minot, ND. He got some partners, and he planted 48 acres of durum wheat. His partners were experts in this area, seed companies, chemical companies, the Research Extension Service and so on. In 1997, they determined exactly what it cost, exactly what they planted, and exactly what they harvested, and what the outcome was. They did this on television to try to demonstrate the plight that family farmers were facing. Let me demonstrate what it was. 
   In 1997, they planted 48 acres, and they lost $50 an acre. This is with all the experts weighing in with Mr. Ross, the newsman, saying here is how we do it. They did it, and they lost $50 an acre. Next year, they planted the same 48 acres and they lost $1,930 an acre. So in 2 years they have lost almost $2,000 an acre on 48 acres of land. If you farm 1,000 acres, which is about an average size farm, slightly smaller than an average size farm in the farm belt, you would have lost $50,000 just in that first year. 
   This year, Mr. Ross planted 48 acres of roundup ready canola. Last week, I stood out in that field just northeast of Minot, ND. We will see what happens this year. Given the price, given the circumstances, they expect they will lose some money this year. 
   The point is that on 48 acres with controlled circumstances and all of the experts to help, you have massive losses of income over three years. This is multiplied by every family farmer across the farm belt. Why? Because prices have collapsed, and family farmers have no safety net, at least not a safety net that is available to help them survive. 
   This is a unique experiment, and it shows in the clearest way possible that this is not about whether family farmers are good farmers. They are the economic All-Stars in our country. The project that KMOT did in Minot, ND, demonstrates that when prices collapse, family farmers do not have a chance to make a decent living and someone has a responsibility to help. That someone is this Congress, this Senate, this President. And the time is now; not later--now. If we want to save family farmers for this country's future, we must take action now. 
   On Monday, I am going to talk about a paper that was just released by the Economic Policy Institute written by Robb Scott, ``The Failure of Agriculture Deregulation,'' describing the failure of Freedom to Farm, the failure of our trade policies, and the selling down the river of family farm interests in this country by people who should have known better. I will describe that in more detail on Monday. 
   We do not have time to waste. We do not have time to wait. We must act and do so with great effect to try to help family farmers. The fellow who says I may not be able to farm anymore, at least is farming now. A whole lot of folks sold out long ago, and more are selling out every month and every week. 
   A woman called me recently and said her 17-year-old son would not come down to the auction sale when they were forced to sell. She says it is not because he is a bad kid. This young boy stayed up in his bedroom because he was brokenhearted. He wanted to farm that land so bad and take it over from his dad at some point. He knew when the auction sale was held that it was over for him. His dreams were gone. She said he was so brokenhearted he simply could not come down and participate in the auction sale of the family farm. 
   That is happening all across the northern plains, all cross the farm belt. At the same time, the stock market shows record highs, and we hear about this robust economy. The economic all-Stars in this country, who produce so much of what the world needs, are being told what they produce has no value and their existence does not matter. Shame on this country if it does not stand up now and decide that family farmers have value. What they produce has enormous value, and family farmers are important for this country's future. 
   I am betting the energy exists with this President and this Congress to finally turn the corner and say we need to make a change. We need trade agreements that stand up for the interests of farmers. We need a safety net that says when farmers' incomes drop 98 percent, we stand to help because we care about you and your future.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is Thursday and most of the week we have seen amendments and offerings from the majority party that do little or nothing for the vast majority of Americans. 
   The Gregg amendment before us, however, is an amendment that would do something. It would prevent accountability. It would say that patients have no right to expect accountability on the part of HMOs and the insurance companies.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I guess my favorite Will Rogers quote is the old one that we all know. He said, ``It ain't what he knows that bothers me. It is what he says he knows for sure that just ain't so.'' 
   I heard a lot of discussion today about facts and about whose side is right. In fact, we just heard the two stages of denial on the central argument of the Republicans against our real Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   The first stage is that States provide all of this protection, so we shouldn't have to do it. And when informed the States don't do it, they say, well, that might be true, but the States could do all of it if they wanted to. That is the second stage of denial, of course. 
   Let me talk again about some of the people involved in this debate, if I might. This is, after all, fundamentally about patient care. It is not a debate about theory. 
   I want to talk about Ethan Bedrick once again. This young boy pictured here was born under very difficult circumstances. During 
   his delivery, the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck and consequently, he was born with cerebral palsy and a condition called spastic quadriplegia. He can't get the rehabilitation services he needs to help him because his HMO says there is only a 50-percent chance of his being able to walk by age 5 and that chance is insignificant. The HMO called a 50-percent chance of being able to walk by age 5 a minimal benefit. His parents appealed and appealed. Guess who they appealed to--the same people who turned them down. 
   We know that in 31 States there is no right to an independent, external appeal. The Republican plan says that Ethan Bedrick and citizens in 31 States are denied coverage. Denied. That is the fact. Dispute it if you can, but those are the facts and they are stubborn. 
   Or what about Jimmy Adams. Jimmy Adams doesn't have hands or feet today because his folks had to pass three hospital emergency rooms before they got to the fourth hospital where the HMO would pay for his emergency care. On the hour-long trip to the further hospital, his heart stopped beating. They were able to revive him, but too much damage had already been done by the lack of circulation to his limbs. This young child lost his hands and feet due to gangrene. 
   Our opponents say, young Jimmy Adams can stop at any emergency room under the Republican bill. Sorry; not true. The Republican bill doesn't cover over 100 million people, and there are 12 States that have no protections with respect to emergency room care. 
   With respect to Jimmy Adams, or a Jimmy Adams of the future, the Republican plan says this: Denied. 
   What about this young fellow born with a severe deformity? Dr. Greg Ganske, our Republican colleague over in the House, does reconstructive surgery. He surveyed his colleagues, and 50 percent of them had HMOs deny reconstructive surgery for young patients with birth defects such as this. 
   Here is the picture Dr. Ganske used when he described the kind of circumstances these children live with. 
   What about an appeal for this young fellow? What about the access to the specialist services needed? The Republican plan says ``denied'' to this young child--denied. Under the Republican plan--and in 38 States--there is no provision for access to specialists for reconstructive surgery. 
   Those are the stubborn facts. 
   Let me show you the bright morning of hope for a young child who was born with a cleft lip who has had access to the appropriate reconstructive surgery. This is the same child I just showed you. 
   Here is the way this child looks with reconstructive surgery. What a world  of difference this makes in a young child's life. 
   This is called patients' rights. 
   Some say it doesn't matter; we don't need it. We say these rights are critical to the health of the people in our country. This is about children, men, women, families. 
   Would anyone in here, if this were your son or daughter or your parent, really stand up and say let the States protect his or her. Would you really vote against these basic protections, such as access to specialists, if it were your child's health on the line? You know the answer to that. Of course, you wouldn't. 
   We just heard a fill-in-the-blank speech from about three people. You could fill in the blank. Over and over, in debate after debate, year after year, the subject changes, but the mantra remains the same: Let the States do it. 
   During the debate to create Medicare we heard the same thing: We don't need Medicare; let the States do it. 
   On minimum wage--Let the States do it. 
   On protections for residents of nursing homes--Let the States do it. 
   On efforts to create a safer workplace or prevent child labor--Let the States do it. 
   That speech has been given in this Chamber for 150 years, and it is so tired, rheumatoid, and calcified that I don't want to hear it anymore. 
   We have had to fight for every step, for progress on such issues as creation of the Medicare program, a safe workplace, and minimum wage. Tonight we are fighting for something called a Patients' Bill of Rights. All along the way, we see people digging in their heels saying for lots of reasons that they don't want to do it. 
   We need to do it for these children. No longer shall we deny them the rights they deserve in our health care system.

But there are 120 million who are not covered. If one says those who are not covered are covered by a State, we must point out that 38 States do not have provisions that guarantee access to specialists. I want to make the point.

   Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator yielding. I was standing here listening and thinking of Mark Twain. He was asked to engage in a debate at one point. He said: Fine, as long as I can be on the opposing side. 
   They said: We haven't told you what the subject is. 
   He said: It doesn't matter. Being on the opposing side 
   doesn't require preparation. 
   There is no preparation here. We do not have a Republican on the floor at the moment. I am sorry, Senator JEFFORDS is here. 
   You can fill in the blank. It would not matter if you talk about managed care, minimum wage, clean air. You can talk about Medicare, you can talk about child labor laws, and there will be the same folks coming to the floor saying: It is not the Federal Government's responsibility; let the States do it.  
   The Senator from Massachusetts made the point that most of the people are left out of the Republican plan. If people wonder if it is us against them, here is a USA Today editorial. It says: ``100 million Reasons GOP's Health Plan Fails.''  
   That is how many people the proposal will leave unprotected. Judging from the health insurance reform package announced this week by Senate Republicans, at least the title is correct. The proposal is called the ``Patients' Bill of Rights,'' and if you are waiting for this perfunctory plan to protect you, you'll need to be patient indeed. Many of the plan's key protections are restricted to the 51 million Americans who get their insurance through self-insured plans, subject to Federal regulations, but another 100 million or so whose health plans are subject to state regulations are excluded.  
   The same editorial points out, as the Senator from Massachusetts has, that most of the States do not have these protections. 
   These folks who come to the floor and say the States already have the protection--access to nonnetwork providers, 35 States do not have that. I just do not understand. Instead of coming to the floor and being honest and saying: We have no interest in this bill, all we want to do is obstruct, we have no interest in passing anything similar to that. Instead of doing that, they come with all these fuzzy shells. You wrap a package. It looks to be the same package that is sitting across the desk, but it has nothing in it. That is what is happening. Amendment after amendment is an empty shell, a package with nothing in it.

   Mr. DORGAN. Senator KENNEDY has been talking about the issue of the number of Americans who would be covered under these two competing proposals. The point I have made in the past in quoting the USA Today editorial is the same point that a number of us have made: The fact is, our opponents' plan does not cover most of the American people. They say: Well, the States provide protection for those their bill leaves out. But the facts do not bear that out. 
   My preference would be that if they do not want to legislate in the area of health care, just say that. Do not make a pretense of coming over here and saying, we support all these issues, we support each and every one of them but then vote against the kinds of reforms that will really accomplish them. 
   My understanding is that the amendment we just agreed to by Senator SNOWE on the issue of breast cancer covers everyone in the country. Why cover all Americans on just that issue? Apparently you are willing to provide some protection for everyone on only that one issue but you are unwilling to cover everyone when it comes to all of the other issues. I do not understand that. 
   I wish I had the time to again show you the pictures of real victims of our current system to illustrate that this debate is not about theory; it is about real people. Unfortunately, I do not have the time. But this debate is about what kind of treatment patients will get in a health care system that in some cases--not in all, but in some cases--has put profits ahead of patients' medical needs. 
   Some in this Chamber say these stories don't matter. We stand with insurance companies. We stand with profits, and we don't believe patients need protection. 
   Others of us believe very strongly that it is time to provide the kinds of protections on a uniform basis that patients ought to expect when they purchase insurance or when they receive insurance through their employer. 
   Again, to those who have spent this week fuzzing up this debate, if you don't like the Federal Government legislating in this area, just say that. Don't bring a bunch of empty vessels to the floor of the Senate and then pretend they do something because you know better.

   Mr. DORGAN. Every group. And the proposal deals with care by specialists, emergency care, OB/GYN. It covers the vast array of the American people. 
   Then we have amendment after amendment that is kind of like decoration. It is kind of like the paint and the chrome and the hood ornaments to try to dress things up and make it look like it is something, but it is a vehicle without an engine. 
   The engine is what we have produced on the floor in terms of a bill that says we are going to do something real for patients who are not getting the health care they need. So we will give them some protection. 
   The response we get is to come out here with some empty vessels and some dressing up of some empty vessels saying: We share your concern and so here is how we address it. 
   On the issue before us, isn't it the case that when someone stands up and says: Women have a right to get treatment by their OB/GYN, except when they offer the proposal, it is a right for only some women, but a right that will be denied to most women? Isn't that the case?

   Mr. DORGAN. One additional question: Wouldn't it be the case that if the Senator from Nevada brought to the floor a tax proposal, or a spending proposal for that matter, that costs $3 or $5 billion, our friend would chase you off the floor and say: If you are bringing something to the floor that is not paid for, come on, that violates all the rules of the Senate? 
   Yet we just heard from our friend from Oklahoma that this provision provides tax incentives. It is going to cost billions of dollars. How are you going to pay for it? Well, we don't pay for it in this bill, but we have an intention to pay for it at some point along the way. 
   Do you think our friend from Oklahoma would let you get by with that, bringing a provision to the floor that says we are going to have a tax incentive and you are not going to pay for it, but you will come up with an answer later?

   Mr. DORGAN. Obviously, the Senator is talking about the budget that was passed by the Senate on a partisan basis. I did not support that. It is not the right approach to have substantial veterans' health care cuts. The Second World War veterans are reaching a time when they need maximum health care that was promised them. The right approach is not to cut veterans' health care. The need is to increase it. Getting back to the point, we have an amendment that was offered, which we had not previously seen, that suggests it will provide some protection. In fact, it denies that protection to the majority of the American women. It doesn't guarantee it, in any event, and provides tax cuts that are not paid for.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday I described a case dealing with emergency rooms which I understand my colleague referred to in his remarks. I want to go back to that case because I think it describes the difference between our two proposals with respect to protections for emergency room treatment for patients. 
   I described the case of little Jimmy Adams. This is a picture of Jimmy. This is a picture of a young, healthy Jimmy tugging on his big sister's shirt. 
   Here is a picture of Jimmy Adams after he lost both his hands and both his feet because he couldn't get care at the closest emergency room. 
   This is what happened. He was sick with a 104 degree fever. His mother called the family HMO. Officials there said you must go to a certain hospital in our network. So his parents loaded Jimmy up at 2 o'clock or so in the morning and started driving. They had to drive past the first hospital, the second hospital, and then drove past the third hospital. Finally they got to the hospital the HMO asked them to take Jimmy to. By that time, Jimmy's heart had stopped. They brought out the crash cart, intubated, and revived him. Regrettably, however, he suffered gangrene, and his hands and his feet had to be amputated. 
   Why didn't they stop at the first emergency room? Because they couldn't; the HMO said they won't pay for that. Why didn't they stop at the second hospital emergency room or the third? The HMO won't fully pay for that care. So they drove over an hour with a young, sick child who, because he didn't get medical treatment in time, lost his hands and his feet. 
   Now, my colleague says the Republican plan will solve little Jimmy's situation. Regrettably, it will not. Yes, the Republican plan will provide that that family could stop at that first hospital for emergency care, but it also allows the HMO to penalize the family financially for doing so. It allows the HMO to establish a financial penalty for this family to stop at out-of-network hospitals. 
   If their bill doesn't do that, I want to see it. As I read the Republican proposal, they say: We have protections here. 
   In fact, they don't have protections. In virtually every area of the two proposals on managed care, we see exactly the same thing. They have an emergency room provision. Is it better than currently exists? Yes, it is better. Does it solve the problem? No. This family would have been told: If you stop at the first emergency room with Jimmy, we will impose a penalty upon you. We have the right to impose a financial penalty for going to the nearest hospital emergency room. 
   If the other side wants to prevent that, I say, join us in supporting the Graham amendment, because we prevent that. We provide real protection for families with respect to emergency room treatment. Our amendment won't allow an HMO to say: Take that sick child to an emergency room but, by the way, you have to go to an emergency room four hospitals; if you stop sooner than that, we will penalize you. 
   That doesn't make any sense to me. 
   This issue is not about theory. It is about real people like Jimmy. It is about what the two pieces of legislation say regarding patient protection. My colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, described the differences between the two bills on emergency care. He asked the questions and didn't get the answers, because satisfactory answers don't exist with respect to our opponents' proposal. Their proposal is, in fact, a shell. It does not offer the protections that we are offering in the proposal before the Senate.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have not seen the specifics of this amendment, but I have heard the description. It is interesting to hear this discussion of costs because we already have experience on this issue. The President has implemented the Patients' Bill of Rights for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. This is already in place for Federal employees around the country. And we know what it costs; we don't have to guess. It costs $1 a month. CBO says the patients' protection bill will cost $2 a month. We know it costs $1 a month in the Federal employees health insurance program. 
   The costs that are described by my friend from Oklahoma are inflated for reasons I do not understand. We know what it costs. It costs $1 a month in the Federal health benefits program, because it is already implemented, and the Congressional Budget Office says it will cost $2 a month for our Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Let's talk about costs from a different angle for a moment. I find it interesting that, when people talk about costs, they do not talk about the costs that have been imposed upon American citizens who need health care but are denied it by their HMO even though they have paid their premiums in good faith. What about the costs imposed on this young boy who was taken past three hospitals to go to the fourth because the family's HMO would not allow him to stop at the first. What is the cost imposed on that young boy who lost his hands and feet or the young boy I described yesterday whose HMO denied him therapy because it said a 50-percent chance of walking by age 5 is a minimum benefit? 
   Or let's talk about other costs, costs on the HMO side. 
   Let me read a table of the 25 highest paid HMO executives. I wonder if there is any interest or concern about their salaries while we are withholding treatment for people under the aegis of cost cutting. Let me list some of the 25 highest paid CEO executives. 
   Annual compensation, 1997: one CEO makes $30.7 million, another has a $12 million salary, a $8.6 million salary, a $7.3 million salary, a $6.9 million salary--these are annual salaries--$5.7 million, $5.3 million, $5.2 million, $5.1 million, all the way down the list of the 25 highest salaries.

Twenty-five companies: $61 million in unexercised stock options, on top of the salary, for one person in 1997, $32.7 million, $19.9 million, $19.0 million, $17 million--all the way down the list of 25. 
   It is interesting when people talk about costs. Is there any interest in this, any interest in talking about $35 million, $37 million, $38 million in unrealized stock options?

   Mr. DORGAN. Oh, yes. One of them, for example, makes well over $30 million. Another is over $40 million. Of course that is a substantial amount of money. 
   The only point I am making is this: There is a lot of money and a lot of profit in this system. This has a lot to do with profits in for-profit medicine. On the other side, on the counterbalance, is the care for patients. Some people objected yesterday because we cited examples of patients who have been mistreated. They said this debate is not about individual patients. Of course it is. That is exactly what it is about. This debate is not about theory, it is about what kind of health care patients are going to get when they need it. 
   When your child is sick, what kind of treatment is your child going to get? Or if your spouse has breast cancer and your employer changes HMO plans, will someone say--I ask for 1 additional minute by consent--you cannot keep your same oncologist, you have to change doctors, even though you are in the midst of treatment? If your child needs to go to an emergency room, will someone say: We're sorry, you can't go to the one 2 miles away, you must go to the one 20 miles away? These are the kinds of issues, real people with real problems, that this debate is about. 
   That is what this is about. 
   Every health organization in the country supports our bill. USA Today, in an editorial said: If you want a Patients' Bill of Rights from the Republican plan, you had better be patient because it doesn't provide a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   There is a difference in these plans. At least we are on the right subject. But while we are on the subject of cost, let's talk a little about who is making the money here--$30 million, $20 million, $15 million in annual compensation--and then you talk to us about cost. We can't afford $1 a month to provide protection to Jimmy Adams so he can go to the nearest emergency room when he is desperately ill? Of course we can do that.

   Mr. DORGAN. I have come to the floor to speak on another issue, but I watched the entire soccer game on Saturday. It was exciting and wonderful. I also thought about the fact that it is an example of a regulation that works. Title IX says: Equal opportunity; you must provide equal opportunity in academics and athletics. 
   Before title IX, of course, there was not equal opportunity. I think Saturday's game was such a testament to the regulations and requirements from title IX that have improved athletics and academics in this country.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are now turning to a 4-week period here in the Senate in which we will work, prior to the August recess, on a range of issues--today beginning with the Patients' Bill of Rights, and then turning to appropriations bills and other matters.  
   I want to call to everyone's attention two issues that are of vital concern that I think ought to be and must be part of the Senate agenda. The first is an issue dealing with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is something that has been before the Senate now for some long while. Efforts to achieve a nuclear test ban treaty originated with President Eisenhower. It has been around a long time. This President, after long negotiations through many administrations, finally signed the treaty. It has now been sent to the Senate for ratification. But it has languished in the Senate for 658 days, during which time there has not been even a hearing on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
   I will put up a couple of charts to describe the circumstances with this treaty. 
   The rule in the Senate requires that the Senate should consider treaties as soon as possible after their submission. 
   In fact, the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963 was considered by the Senate in 3 weeks; SALT I, 3 months; the ABM Treaty, 10 weeks; ABM Treaty Protocols, 14 months; START I, 11 months. 
   We have had the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty before the Senate for 658 days with not even a hearing. I think that is a shame. This treaty ought to be part of this Senate's agenda. If we do not have a hearing and do not ratify this treaty by the end of September, we will have only a limited role when a conference is formed in October of the countries that have ratified this treaty to discuss its entry into force. It does not make any sense to me. 
   This country ought to lead on issues concerning the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. One way to lead on those issues is to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It does not make any sense for the treaty to have been signed, negotiated and sent to this Senate, and then to have it languish for all of these days. 
   I would like to put up a chart which shows a concern that some of the critics have. They say: Well, gosh, with all this Chinese espionage, the last thing we want, is to do something with respect to a treaty on banning nuclear tests. 
   The Cox report on the Chinese espionage makes references to the CTBT. The report says it will be more difficult for the Chinese to develop advanced nuclear weapons if we have this treaty in place. If the People's Republic of China violated the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by testing surreptitiously to further accelerate its nuclear development, we could detect it given the monitoring system imposed by the treaty. If the Chinese are signatories to the treaty and the Russians are signatories to the treaty--and they are waiting for us--and we can stop testing, the only conceivable way they could validate any kind of nuclear stockpile is through the use of advanced computers. The restrictions imposed by the CTBT make it extremely difficult or impossible to improve nuclear weapons designs except by high performance computers. 
   The Cox report appears to make the point that it is more important for us to restrict the shipment of advanced computers to the Chinese. 
   The point is this--we deserve an opportunity to debate the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. We should have done so long ago. I don't mean to argue the merits of it on the floor today. 
   My hope is, we will not go through July as if this treaty doesn't exist. It was negotiated, signed, and has been before the Senate over 600 days. There hasn't been one hearing. There ought to be a hearing. It ought to be brought to the floor so the American people can, through this Senate, debate that treaty. 
   Finally, support for the nuclear test ban: 75 percent, 74 percent, 85 percent, 80 percent, these are national polls over time, always consistently high support for this kind of a treaty. This Congress has a responsibility. I say to my colleagues who really don't want to do this: You have a responsibility to the country to do this. I hope that in the month of July we can make progress in passing this Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me turn to an additional issue I believe Congress and the President must consider in the month of July. It deals with the urgent farm crisis that exists in farm country across America. 
   If there was a massive earthquake, a series of tornadoes, fires, or floods across the Midwest, we would see Congress, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, virtually everyone involved through the Federal agencies responding immediately. The President would likely fly out and view it. Congress would send emergency help. Federal agents would be there en masse setting up offices to help. 
   Yet in farm country we have a crisis that is just as real, not as dangerous to human health or human life as a tornado or a flood, perhaps, but just as real and just as dramatic as natural disasters. 
   The chart here shows what has happened to the price of wheat since 1996. You can see what has happened to the price of wheat. We have mostly wheat farmers up in our part of the country. The price of wheat has collapsed like a lead weight. Ask yourself: If your income collapsed, if a Senator's income collapsed like that, do you think there would be howls of protest? Do you think that would be an emergency? How about the minimum wage, if it went down like this? How about if the stock market looked like this? Do you think there would be a problem in this country? Of course, there would. 
   This is a huge problem in the farm belt. Family farmers are finding themselves on the precipice of going broke in record numbers. I had a call this morning from a family farmer who nearly choked up on the phone saying: I don't think my son and I can continue. We can't continue when prices have collapsed. We don't have the income to continue family farming. 
   For them it is a dream, a lifestyle, a way of life. It is not just a business. 
   This Congress, while prices have collapsed, largely is content to sort of meander around and talk as if it were theory. It is not theory. It is a crisis. 
   This chart shows what is happening across the farm belt. The red indicates the counties that have lost more than 10 percent of their population, 1980-1998. Take a look at the red. What does that show? The middle part of America is being depopulated, especially now with prices collapsing, people moving out and not in. 
   The question is, ``What are we going to do about that?'' Congress has a responsibility to do something about it and so does this President. This Congress passed the Freedom to Farm bill. The presumption of Freedom to Farm is, we will reduce support prices and you rely on the marketplace. If the marketplace has collapsed prices, there has to be a safety net. If you don't have a safety net, you won't have family farmers left. 
   Freedom to Farm hasn't worked, and this Congress needs to understand that and do something about it. The President also has a responsibility. He signed the Freedom to Farm bill. He complained a little about it when he signed it, but he signed it and said: We will make some improvements. 
   The Freedom to Farm bill hasn't worked. Our trade policies are bankrupt and not working. Concentration of agricultural industries means that farmers face monopolies in every direction. All of these combined together are conspiring to leave this country without family farmers in its future, and that will be, in my judgment, a massive failure for America. 
   In the month of July, in the coming 4 weeks, the President has a responsibility, in my judgment, to come to Congress with a bold approach in dealing with this issue. Congress has a responsibility to deal with it, as well, in a bold manner. 
   I know some in Congress say: We don't intend to do anything until the President sends us something. They didn't have that reticence about adding $6 billion to the defense bill. When the emergency bill came up for defense, they said: We don't care what the President said. We think he should have $6 billion more. 
   This is a joint responsibility. The Congress needs to act and the President needs to act. We need to do it together, and it needs to be done now.  Not later, now. If we don't take action soon, we won't have family farmers left. We won't have to worry about an emergency family farm bill because there won't be family farmers around to respond to. 
   Again, if there was an earthquake or a flood or fire or tornado or perhaps even some hog disease, as Will Rogers used to say, you'd have all the Federal agents coming out to talk about the hog disease. They would want to know, ``what is happening here and will it spread to other hogs?'' 
   One way to get attention, it seems to me, is for Congress and the President to decide that this is a farm crisis. It is in my part of the country, with the collapse in prices and the natural disaster that has kept about 3 million acres from being planted in North Dakota because it was too wet. The floods and the worst crop disease in this century, all piled on top of family farmers' shoulders at a time when prices are collapsed. To add to their burden, we have a trade agreement that allows the Europeans to spend 10 times as much on their farm program as we do and undercuts prices on sales to foreign governments. We let them do that in excess of ours--we won't even use our export program for reasons I don't understand--at a time of mounting burdens on family farmers in a way that is fundamentally unfair. 
   We had better decide as a country that family farming matters to our future. If we don't, they won't be around. When they are not around, corporations will farm our country coast to coast. The price of food will go up and this country will have lost something and every small town will have lost something important. 
   This is not just about farmers. It is about small towns and Main Streets and boarded-up business and economies that are empty shells in a lot of our small communities. 
   My message is very simple: We have a responsibility this month. We have a responsibility now, all of us, and so does the President, to have a meeting. I want the White House to have a meeting on this with Republicans and Democrats. I want us to come together with an emergency package that responds to the farm crisis, does it boldly, does it in a way that helps real family farmers, and does it in a way that gives family farmers some hope that their future is a future in which they can make a decent living raising America's food supply. 
   If I might make one additional point: We have to rely on foreign markets as well. We produce more food than we consume in this country. Yet I heard last week that the amount of imported food in this country has doubled in the last 7 years. 
   We had protests at the Canadian border last weekend. It is unfair the level of imports coming from Canada. The thing I don't understand, however, is the grain market, all these folks that worship at the altar of the marketplace in the grain market. The grain market says to our farmers: Your food that you produce has no value. Yet all the testimony we hear from all around the world, Sudan included, tells us that old women are climbing trees foraging for leaves to eat because there is nothing to eat. We know that a substantial portion of the world's population goes to bed at night with an ache in their belly because of hunger. 
   It makes no sense for us to be told that our food has no value when people go to bed hungry each night. I want the White House and the Congress together to boldly respond to this issue in the coming weeks. This 4-week period is critical. We must put this on the agenda in a bipartisan way and do so boldly. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are finally going to have a debate on the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. It will not be a debate about theory. It will not be a debate about past proposals for health care reform. It will be a debate about real protections for real people in this country. 
   We have two plans before us. 
   One is a patients' protection act that we have offered that has the support of virtually every health care organization in this country. 
   The other is a piece of paper with a name--just a name, just an empty vessel--that pretends that it provides protection but in fact it doesn't. 
   Let me describe, if I might, some of the details of these plans. I want to be very brief, but I want to do it by talking about protections for people. 
   This young boy's name is Ethan. Ethan was born in 1992 after a difficult birth. During his delivery, oxygen was cut off from Ethan, so he was born with significant problems that required special therapy. But the HMO denied the special therapy for Ethan because they said the probability of him being able to walk by age 5--a 50-percent potential of being able to walk by age 5--was insignificant. They called a 50-percent chance of being able to walk insignificant. 
   So corporate profits take precedence over patients' protection, and Ethan does not get the therapy he needs. 
   Or let me show you another example. Dr. GANSKE, a Republican in the U.S. House, used this chart to show a young child with a serious facial birth defect, a cleft lip. No one looking into the face of that young child could say that correcting this birth defect should not be done. 
   Yet Dr. GANSKE did a survey of reconstructive surgeons and found that 50 percent of the doctors who had patients like this have had the corrective surgery denied by HMOs. These HMOs said this procedure was not ``medically necessary.'' 
   Would any parent in the world believe that this is not ``medically necessary''? 
   Dr. GANSKE, a Republican Congressman from the U.S. House, certainly doesn't believe that. He has been a champion for this kind of patients' protection act. 
   Here is an example of what a young child with that deformity can look like after reconstructive surgery. 
   Isn't that wonderful? Is that a ``medical necessity''? You bet it is. Of course, it is. But health insurance only works if patients get what they pay for. 
   Dr. GANSKE sent something around the other day that I pulled out in preparation for this debate. I want to describe this just briefly because I think it illustrates the difference between an empty vessel with the same title and a patients' protection bill that gives real protection to real people.  
   At 3:30 in the morning, Lamona Adams found her six-month infant boy, Jimmy, panting, sweaty, and moaning. He had a temperature of 104. So she phoned her HMO to ask for permission to go to the emergency room.  
   You have to do that, by the way--get permission to go.  
   The voice at the other end of the 1-800 number told her to go to Scottish Rite Hospital. ``Where is it?'' asked Lamona. ``I don't know--find a map,'' came the reply. It turns out that the Adams family lived south of Atlanta, Georgia, and Scottish Rite was an hour away on the other side of the Atlanta metro area. 
   Lamona held little Jimmy while his dad drove as fast as he could. Twenty miles into the trip while driving through Atlanta, they passed Emory University Hospital's ER, then Georgia Baptist's ER, then Grady Memorial's ER. But they pushed on to Scottish Rite Medical Center--still 22 miles away, because they knew that if they stopped at an unauthorized hospital, their HMO would deny treatment and they would be left with the bill. 
   They knew Jimmy was sick, but they didn't know how sick. After all, they weren't trained professionals.  
   They pushed on to where the HMO said they could stop.  
   With miles yet to go, Jimmy's eyes fell shut and wouldn't open. 
   Lamona frantically called out to him. But he didn't awaken. His heart had stopped.  
   Imagine Jimmy's dad driving as fast as he could to the ER while his mother is desperately trying to keep him alive. 
   They finally pulled into the emergency room entrance. Jimmy's mother leaped out of the car and raced into the ER with Jimmy in her arms calling, ``Help my baby! Help my baby!" 
   They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation while a pediatric ``crash cart'' was rushed to the room. Doctors and nurses raced to see if the miracles of modern medicine could save his life. 
   He was intubated and intravenous medicines were given and he was cardiopulmonary resuscitated again. He was a tough little guy. He survived despite the delay in treatment by his HMO. But he didn't survive whole. 
   He ended up with gangrene in both his hands and feet, and the doctors had to amputate both of Jimmy's hands and feet. 
   This is a picture of little Jimmy before his illness, and then afterward. His folks drove past three hospital emergency rooms because the HMO said he had to go to the fourth one miles and miles and miles away. And this young boy has no hands and no feet now because of that.  
   We have two plans on the floor. 
   One of the plans, our bill, says that families have a right to the emergency care they need at the nearest hospital. 
   The other plan says they offer such a right--until you read the fine print. The other side will tell you they have a good plan, but they have an empty vessel. 
   On the issue of emergency care, little Jimmy, his parents, and others across this country will understand that it doesn't improve care when HMOs are allowed to determine which emergency rooms they will allow patients to stop at to get emergency treatment for these children. 
   My point is this: We are going to debate theory all week. But it is not theory that is important. What is important is children like Jimmy, children like Ethan, or children like this little boy who has a severe birth defect of the face and was told by an HMO that this deformity need not be fixed. 
   We know that is not right. 
   This debate is about profits, patient care, insurance companies, and the rights of patients who are sick. 
   I think at the end of the day and at the end of this week all of us will see that there are two plans. One is supported by virtually every medical and consumer group in the country because they know it allows real protections to allow doctors to practice medicine--not an insurance accountant thousands of miles away making decisions about patients' health care.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have sat and listened quietly and patiently to the debate over this amendment. I was thinking to myself that, if ever there were an Olympic sport for sidestepping, I surely have seen some gold medal winners this afternoon. The issue in this amendment is, whom does this piece of legislation protect? Whom does the Patients' Bill of Rights protect? 
   Some people view this debate as a debate between a bunch of wind generators in blue suits, and they do not know whom to believe. So here is an editorial from USA Today--not from Republicans, not from Democrats. The headline of this USA Today editorial reads: ``100 Million Reasons GOP's Health Plan Fails. That's How Many People Proposal Will Leave Unprotected.'' Let me read what it says:  
   Judging from the health insurance reform package announced this week by Senate Republicans, at least the title is correct. The proposal is called the Patients' Bill of Rights. If you are waiting for this perfunctory plan to protect you, you'll need to be patient indeed, many of the plan's key protections are restricted to the 51 million Americans who get their insurance through self-insured employer-sponsored plans subject to direct Federal regulation. But another 100 million or so whose health plans are subject to state regulation are excluded.  
   Again, USA Today says this plan is an empty shell. This plan does not match the needs the American people ought to expect will be met. 
   I have heard debate this afternoon I would have expected 100 years ago in this Chamber. Back in the years when suspenders and spittoons adorned this Chamber, you would have heard exactly the same debate on every issue. Meat inspection? Let the States do it. The Federal Government should not be involved. Pollution control? Let the States do it. Nursing home regulation? Let the States do it. Minimum wage? The Federal Government should not be involved. That is a debate a century old, and it is old and tired. 
   The question here is, What kind of legislation are we going to pass that protects American families? Are we going to pass a bill that includes the 100 million people their side leaves out? You were told to be careful of stories about children who tug at your heart because somehow that is not reflective of the whole issue. Jimmy, here, is never going to stroke his mother's face, may never be able to shoot a basket. He has no arms and no legs. Why? Because in the middle of the night when 6-month-old Jimmy was desperately ill, his dad had to drive past the first hospital, drive past the second hospital, drive past the third hospital, in order to get to the hospital they approved for this little boy to get emergency treatment. As a result, he lost his hands and his feet. Our opponents bill does not provide a guarantee that this young boy would have gotten emergency treatment at the first, second, or third hospital. No such guarantee exists in their plan. If it did, it would not apply to 100 million Americans. 
   They say don't let these stories affect you. That is what this is about. It is about patient care. It is about real people. It is about Jimmy, it is about Ethan, it is about the people I have talked about on the floor of the Senate. 
   Let me conclude just by pointing out the differences in titles. They brought a bill to the floor of the Senate with the title the Patients' Bill of Rights. That is the same name as the piece of legislation we authored. Ours contains real protections; theirs does not. 
   Abe Lincoln was debating Douglas, and he could not get Douglas to understand his point. Finally he said to Douglas: Let me ask it this way. He said:  
   Tell me, how many legs does a horse have?  
   And Douglas said,  
   Four, of course.  
   Abe said,  
   Now if a horse's tail were called a leg, how many legs would a horse have?  
   And Douglas said,  
   Five.  
   And Abe Lincoln said,  
   No, that's where you are wrong. Simply calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg at all.  
   You can call this proposal that has been offered by the majority party whatever you like, but it does not make it a patients' protection act. As USA Today says in its editorial, if you think you are going to get protection from the Republican patient protection plan, you had better be patient, because it leaves out 100 million Americans. There is a lot of misinformation that has been given on the floor of the Senate today and a lot of sidestepping on the important issues. But I say when this debate is over, do not, as the Senator from Oklahoma suggests, dismiss the concerns and stories that are raised about individual people. After all, the only question really important in this debate is how it affects the individual patients, the men, women, and children who seek treatment in our health care system. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I do not oppose the motion to proceed. I expect the Senate will perhaps vote unanimously to proceed on this issue, but I do want to give some historic perspective to this issue of a lockbox. 
   I proposed a lockbox amendment in 1983. I offered an amendment the day  when the Ways and Means Committee passed the Social Security reform package in 1983. I said: If we do not put this extra Social Security money away, it will be used as part of the operating budget and it will not be saved. My amendment lost in the Ways and Means Committee in 1983. So this is not a new idea. 
   One of the interesting things about this debate is, it was not too many years ago that we debated a constitutional amendment to balance the budget in the Senate. I voted against that, and the constitutional amendment lost by one vote. I went through some very interesting times politically back home and across the country because I cast a vote that defeated the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. 
   One of the points I continued to make in the Senate as we debated that--and I was accused of talking about gimmicks and using gimmicks at that point--was the constitutional amendment to balance the budget was written in a way that said all revenue that comes into the Federal Government shall be considered revenue for the purposes of the budget. There was no distinction between Social Security moneys and other moneys; it is all operating budget revenue. To the extent we require a balanced budget, it means we can use the Social Security money as ordinary revenue and then we can claim we balanced the budget. I said that is writing in the Constitution the invitation to continue doing what we have been doing, which is looting Social Security. 
   What I heard in response was no. There were three stages of denial: 
   First, we deny we are looting Social Security. That was the first stage of denial. 
   The second was: Well, even though we deny it, if, in fact, we are doing it, we promise to quit. 
   And the third stage of denial was: We insist we are not doing it, but if we are doing it, we promise to quit. And if we can't quit it, we will at least taper off. 
   Those were the three stages of denial in the Senate. 
   Because those of us who said, we will not write into the Constitution an amendment that permits forever the use of Social Security trust funds as part of the operating budget, we were told: Well, would it be all right if we said we will keep using the Social Security trust funds for the next 12 years? I said: No, that would not be all right. So that was the debate back a few years ago. 
   Now we come to a debate today, and the folks who then called our position on Social Security revenues a gimmick are now proposing a lockbox. I say, I think we should have a lockbox. But I do not think you ought to do a lockbox in isolation. I think you should have a lockbox with respect to the Social Security revenues so they cannot be used for ordinary operating revenue. That money is taken from workers' paychecks. It is called Social Security dedicated taxes. It goes into a dedicated fund and ought not be available under any circumstances for any other purposes. That is the point we made on the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. 
   I have some charts here, that I will not use, that describe what was told to us during that debate: Gee, you're standing up talking about gimmicks. Of course you have to use the Social Security money as part of the regular budget in order to balance the budget. You can't balance the budget without using Social Security money. 
   History, of course, shows that was nonsense. But here we are, and the question is the lockbox. We ought to have a lockbox. We ought to do several things at the same time, however. Because I worry. I see this week Reuters has a press story: ``How Republicans Propose $1 trillion in tax cuts.'' If you do a lockbox on Social Security revenues only and then say, all right, now we have locked away Social Security revenues only, and we propose $1 trillion in tax cuts, the question in two areas is: What have you done to extend the life of Social Security? And what have you done in this fiscal policy to extend the life of Medicare? 
   Unfortunately, the answer in both cases could be, you have done nothing to save for Medicare; and while you might have given $1 trillion in tax cuts, you may have done nothing to extend, even by 1 year, the Social Security program. 
   So let us do a couple of things. Let us do--together--a lockbox. I support that. I was ridiculed for it back in the constitutional amendment debate, but I have always supported it. I supported it going back to 1983 when I offered the amendment to do it in the House Ways and Means Committee. But let us not just do the lockbox. Let's do the lockbox the right way. Secondly, let us make sure that some of the additional revenue that is available extends the life of Medicare and extends the life of Social Security. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.

   Mr. DORGAN. This would provide a guarantee that the revenue stream for Social Security is available only for Social Security; that is, the tax money that is available for it goes only into the Social Security trust fund and can be used only for that purpose. 
   But it would do two other things as well. It would say, 
   let us use some additional resources not just for a $1 trillion tax cut but also to extend the life of Social Security and the life of Medicare. Doing both of these things, I think, will give the American people the reassurance that both of these programs, which have been so important in the lives of so many Americans in this country, will be available for many years to come. 
   I do not think, as I said when I started, there will be a debate here on whether we should proceed. Let's proceed. I expect the motion to proceed will carry, perhaps unanimously. We will have a debate on the lockbox issue. 
   But my point is, let us not debate that in isolation. Let us debate it with the eye on this ball: That we need to extend the life of Social Security and extend the life of Medicare, even as we do what we should have done long ago; and that is, make certain that no Social Security revenues are used for any purpose other than the solvency of the Social Security system itself. That is what workers expect. That is the basis on which money is taken from their paychecks and put into a dedicated tax fund. That is what senior citizens expect from this program, which was a solemn promise made to them many decades ago. 
   I thank the Senator from New Jersey for the time. I look forward to the debate following the motion to proceed.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will ask that a letter from Barry McCaffrey, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, be printed in the RECORD. General McCaffrey has written to me and, I am sure, the chairman of the subcommittee because he is concerned about the funding level for the National Youth Antidrug Media Campaign. 
   As we indicated yesterday, that campaign will be funded in the subcommittee mark at $145.5 million. That is about $49 million below the administration's request. 
   General McCaffrey has a number of observations about that and makes the point in his letter that he hopes, in this process between the Senate and the House, somehow those funds might be restored to full funding at the President's request.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, also, to add to the comments made by Senator CAMPBELL, I believe we had something in the neighborhood of 20 amendments that were filed. The unanimous consent agreement required that amendments be filed by noon today. This subcommittee on appropriations has now, I believe, close to 20 amendments, perhaps 21 amendments, that have been filed. It is, I know, the intention and the interest of the leadership--the majority leader and Senator DASCHLE as well--to move ahead and finish this bill and finish some other business today. 
   My hope is that Members who have offered amendments--in fact, all the amendments have been filed on behalf of other Senators by Senator CAMPBELL and myself. I hope very much that those who asked us to file an amendment on their behalf will come now to the floor and offer those amendments so we can proceed to get through this piece of legislation. 
   Of the 20 amendments, some likely will be worked out, some will perhaps need votes. Senator CAMPBELL is absolutely correct, this is the right time for people on whose behalf we have offered these amendments to come to the floor and begin debating them.

   Mr. DORGAN. I will use time allocated by Senator CAMPBELL. 
   Mr. President, it is a rare occasion when I rise to oppose an amendment on alcohol offered by my colleague from New Jersey. I just heard the moving comments by the Senator from West Virginia. On almost every other occasion on the Senate floor, I have supported their initiatives. The .08 national standard on drunk driving, I have supported it. You name it, I have supported it. 
   My mother was killed by a drunk driver. I have been in an accident caused by a drunk driver in which the car I was driving was totaled. 
   Senator BYRD described graduation parties. My cousin's son Jesse was at a graduation party one night--the night before he was to graduate from high school--a wonderful young boy, great golfer, slight of build, a handsome young man--and at midnight got in the wrong car, a car driven by a young man who had had too much to drink. They drove across a railroad track and were hit by a train, and that young boy lost his life. 
   I know about the scourges of alcohol. I know about drunk driving. I know about the disease of alcoholism. I also know about the issue of illegal drugs in this country and want to tell a story about that, if I might. 
   I visited Oak Hill Detention Center recently, within the last matter of weeks. Oak Hill Detention Center is not too far 
   from this building. It is a half-hour drive. It houses some of the toughest young criminals who have committed crimes on the streets of the District of Columbia. These are kids, in many cases tough, hardened criminals but still kids. 
   I met a young man who at age 12 was dealing drugs and was addicted to hard drugs on the streets of the District of Columbia. He was shot a number of times, picked up, and convicted of armed robbery. At age 12, he was selling and addicted to hard drugs. 
   Across the table from him sat another young man who, at age 12, was also dealing drugs and convicted of armed robbery. Across the table was a young girl who, at age 13, was on hard drugs and selling drugs and had a baby--all in the first year of her teenage life. 
   The security fellow in one of the areas of the Oak Hill Detention Center said to me--and I could tell he liked these kids; he cared about these kids; he knew them, knew them well--said: You know, these are tough kids. These are kids who have done wrong, in most cases have had a tough life, but they are still kids. He said: What I regret most about this job is going to their funerals. There are too many funerals. After they serve their time at the Oak Hill Detention Center and they are back on the streets--too often relapsing back on hard drugs--I go to their funerals. 
   The common element to the discussions I had at that Oak Hill Youth Detention Center was hard drugs--addicted to drugs at a very young age and then followed a life of crime, and in most cases violent crime as well. 
   This country has a problem with drugs. One approach to addressing this problem was recommended by the administration and some in Congress to say: We know that television has an influence on people's lives. Television advertising, hundreds of billions of dollars of television advertising has an influence on what people buy, what they wear, how they look, and what they sing. If it has that kind of influence, can we use television in a way that can influence people with respect to drugs and how they view drugs? 
   So the proposal was to put together a $1 billion program over 5 years to do intensive drug education television advertising. I support that. 
   This year, this subcommittee cut the funding for that by $50 million. In other words, there will be $50 million less than was requested for it and $50 million less than was spent last year on this program. 
   This program ought to be allowed to work so we can determine with what effectiveness we can change people's vision and view about drugs, especially young people. We are in the third year. We need to allow this to work. 
   Cutting this program by $50 million was the last thing we wanted to do, but the budget allocations would not allow us to fully fund it. 
   Now we are told by our colleagues, we want to add other things to it. I will support in an instant a proposal brought to the floor of the Senate that says let us do something of exactly the same scale on alcohol. I will support that in an instant. A $1 billion program over 5 years to educate young people about alcohol, we ought to do that. But I don't think, having cut this program by $50 million this year--understanding that when you talk to young people anyplace in this country who have been involved in violent crime, you will find out that the origin of that and the genesis of much of that behavior comes from addiction to drugs--now is the time to both cut this program by $50 million, which is what has happened in this subcommittee, and then also add other responsibilities to that program. 
   I indicated that my family was visited by the horror of the phone call late at night saying that my mother had been killed. Others in my family have been victims of drunk driving accidents. I understand all that. But the subject here is about drugs. 
   I have spoken on the floor about six times of a person I am going to speak about just briefly again, Leo Gonzales Wright. A young attorney with, I am sure, great hope and stars in her eyes moves to Washington, DC, to practice environmental law. In her early twenties, her name was Bettina Pruckmayr. Bettina Pruckmayr ended her life in this town with the kind of horror that is not visited upon many. She stopped at an ATM machine, was abducted by a man named Leo Gonzales Wright, and stabbed over 30 times by this violent felon. 
   Who was Leo Gonzales Wright? A man addicted to drugs, a man high on drugs, a man who had been convicted of murder before, let out of prison on patrol, tested positive for drugs but not put back in prison. 
   What do drugs mean? What do drugs do? It means that people on our streets, who are addicted to drugs and are willing to commit violent acts, murder innocent people like young Bettina Pruckmayr. 
   The origin of this is the problem of drugs. It is a very significant problem. The attempt was to decide whether we could alter behavior, educate young children with $1 billion in a 5-year program of advertising dealing with drugs. I happen to think that makes sense. We have tried a lot of different things. It makes sense to try this. 
   Does it make sense to do a lot more on alcohol? Absolutely. I am willing to support that and do that. I don't think, however, it ought to be used to dilute this effort. This effort is an effort that is in its third year. We have already had to dilute it by reducing funding $50 million. 
   I say to my colleague, with whom I voted on every occasion on this issue, let us find another way to fund this program and I will be with you. I understand the scourge of alcohol and alcohol addiction, the carnage it causes on American roads, and the devastation it causes to American families. I also think those who spoke about that with such gripping emotion today probably could tell us stories that they understand the carnage caused by drug addiction in this country to hard drugs and the number of families whose hearts ache tonight because their loved one was killed by someone high on drugs, addicted to drugs for a 
   number of years in a circumstance where perhaps, had we done things differently, had we done things better, had we had more influence on those lives, we might have avoided having that person addicted to drugs and, therefore, committed to a life of crime. 
   That is what this effort is about. It is what General McCaffrey and the Office of Drug Control Policy, it is what we are trying to do in a 5-year period. I think we ought to continue to do that. 
   One final point: One of my regrets, standing as I am today, is a woman  named Karolyn Nunnallee, whom I consider a good friend. She is the national president of the Mothers Against Drunk Driving. She and her organization very strongly support the Lautenberg amendment. I almost never have disagreed with Mothers Against Drug Driving. I think they have done more in this country than most any other organization I know to influence and alter behavior dealing with the issue of drunk driving. I regret very much not supporting them on this issue. 
   For reasons I have already stated, I think we ought to stay the course on this question of drug addiction and education dealing with drug addiction among America's youth. At the same time, I want to join in and support in any way possible the efforts of Senator LAUTENBERG and Senator BYRD and others to add money to transportation bills on drunk driving issues, to add money to health bills on drunk driving. I will support a billion-dollar program in 5 years. Sign me up. But don't dilute this program. Let us let this program work to see, at the end of 5 years, whether we have altered the behavior and substantially changed the determination by some young people in this country to understand more about drugs. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make just a couple of concluding comments, again reiterating I am really quite uncomfortable in the position of opposing Senator LAUTENBERG. But I do not think this is a forced choice of the type he suggests we make; I do not think this is a choice that we ought to be required to make. One might at some point put together a program, which I would fully support, to say let us do $1 billion advertising in 5 years, targeted to Americans, especially America's kids, dealing with alcohol abuse. I would support that. Then one would say, perhaps, coming to the floor of the Senate: This program you have dealing with alcohol abuse, why doesn't it include drugs? Or, Why doesn't it include addiction to smoking cigarettes? I would support that as well. 
   But we ought to do them as programs we can measure and evaluate. The program we are talking about now is a program dealing with drugs. It is 3 years into the program. People say: Why doesn't it include alcohol? Let's do a program on alcohol. I will support that. 
   The story I told earlier, about going to the Oak Hill Detention Center and seeing these young children, kids on drugs who were convicted of violent crimes, do you know the other thing about their stories? In every case, they were 12 or 13 years old and they were addicted to drugs, selling drugs, shooting people, committing armed robbery, being involved in violent crimes; and the other common denominator in every single case was they had parents addicted to drugs. They came from homes, often with only a single parent, in which that parent was addicted to drugs, died at a young age, and was an abusive parent because of being addicted to drugs. There is a common denominator. 
   This program is a program designed to say to America's youth, through drug education by television commercials: Don't do drugs. We know television advertising works. We all use it. Hundreds of billions of dollars a year are spent on television ads to convince people to listen to certain kinds of music, wear certain kinds of jeans, to buy certain kinds of food. We know it works. I think it will work with respect to this issue of drugs as well. 
   We are 3 years into the program. I will support gladly, and with great excitement, a program on alcohol. I have supported every initiative dealing with alcohol abuse and drunk driving in this Senate. I will support it as well dealing with the addiction to cigarettes. The targeting of alcohol and cigarettes, both legal products, to this country's youth, is unforgivable. 
   But this is a separate issue. We have a campaign underway. It is 3 years in progress. It is designed very deliberately to change the understanding and the culture dealing with drugs. I think it has a chance of working. So let us do that. We had to cut it $50 million this year alone just on this issue. Let us allow this to work. At another time I will be happy to join my colleague from New Jersey and others in designing an identical program dealing with alcohol abuse.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Colorado will yield, let me make one final observation. He mentions the issue of alcohol. He comes from a particular perspective, being a Native American. 
   I want to tell him just about two people, and I will do it in 30 seconds. I toured a hospital one day. He talks about fetal alcohol syndrome. A young Native American woman had just given birth to a baby. The woman was an alcoholic. The baby was born with a .21 blood-alcohol content, a young baby born dead drunk. This woman, having had a third baby, wanted nothing to do with that child, didn't want to see that child. That child will probably have fetal alcohol syndrome. 
   But I was down at a hospital not far from this building and I saw babies born from crack-addicted mothers, and I saw babies born drug addicted, addicted to hard drugs. The doctors told me what those babies are like as they try to shed this addiction, being born of mothers who had taken drugs during this pregnancy. 
   We have problems in all of these areas. I do not deny that. But this program deals with drugs. I think it has a chance of working. I hope we can allow that to happen with this vote.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I'm joined by Senators LOTT, DASCHLE, NICKLES, REID, MURKOWSKI, and twenty-one other distinguished colleagues in introducing the ``Main Street Business Incentive Act of 1999,'' which addresses a gap in the current law that is impeding the improvement of many of our small town Main Street businesses. Specifically, the bill would raise the income tax expensing provision for small businesses in current law from $19,000 to $25,000 this year. The bill also would expand the provision to cover investments in commercial buildings and structural improvements. 
   Mr. President, small businesses are the economic anchors of Main Streets in small and large communities throughout our country. They provide jobs, sponsor local charities and little league teams, and enable people to purchase their daily necessities without driving long distances. Without small businesses, we wouldn't have communities, which is why Congress has adjusted the tax laws in numerous ways over the years to encourage investments that enable them to grow and thrive. 
   For example, many businesses have to depreciate the cost of new equipment purchases--which is to say, they deduct these costs over a long period of years. Small businesses, by contrast, can ``expense'' up to $19,000 in purchases of such assets. They deduct the cost entirely in the first year. That maximum amount will increase to $25,000 in year 2003. This tax provision is helpful to many small businesses because it enables them to write off the investment immediately and so bolsters their cash flow. 
   However, this expensing provision is not as helpful as it could be and needs to be. Specifically, it does not include investments that small businesses make in improving the store front or the building in which they conduct their business. In many small towns, the local drug store, shoe store or grocery store doesn't have much need of new equipment. But it does need to improve the store front or the interior, and generally spruce things up. 
   Such investments are good for our Main Streets. They improve the appearance of both the business and the town. Yet under today's tax law, if a small business owner improves his storefront, he has to spread the cost of the investments for tax purposes over 39 years, which is the depreciation schedule for commercial real estate. The result is a large economic hurdle for many of these small businesses. 
   There are Main Streets all across our country that were built or refurbished thirty, forty or fifty years ago and now need investment and improvement. The Tax Code should encourage this. A simple way to accomplish it is to allow the expensing of up to $25,000, not only for equipment and machinery, but also for small business investments in store fronts and business locations. The motel, the gas station, the hardware store or barber shop ought to be able to ``expense'' that amount of investment in their property. That's what my legislation provides. 
   This would be a significant benefit to America's small business and I think would result in a significant improvement in America's communities and main streets. This legislation is supported by a number of small business-oriented trade groups including the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), NFIB-North Dakota, the Small Business Legislative Council, the North Dakota Association of Realtors and National Association of Realtors. 
   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this much-needed legislation.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, REAP International operates a school linkage program between North Dakota and the Russian Republic of Buryatia. In the past, this program has resulted not only in the establishment of close personal relationships, but also provided community based assistance and sustainable development to this important region of the Russian Far East. REAP International's school linkage program between North Dakota and Buryatia is all the more critical when one considers the setbacks that the U.S.-Russia relationship has suffered in the wake of NATO's actions against Serbia. In addition, the failure of the Russian economy has left many Russians disillusioned, and there are those in the Russian leadership who would take advantage of that disillusionment in order to reverse the free market reforms already underway in Russia. We must not let that happen. One way to prevent it is to help Russian youth to understand and reap the benefits of a stable, free market economy through student exchange programs. 
   Student exchange programs often promote long-lasting relationships between institutions and communities. Does the Senator agree that these programs also play an important role in strengthening ties between countries?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in light of the hour and especially in light of the statement made by my colleague from Colorado, the chairman of this subcommittee, I will be mercifully brief. But I do want to say this bill, the fiscal year 2000 Treasury and general government bill, is one that we have worked hard to bring to the floor of the Senate in a manner that we think is fair and relates to the limits that were imposed upon us. The chairman and I believe the allocation level, obviously, could have been greater in order to allow us to have provided some additional funding to some areas of the bill, but we are restricted by budget rules and by the allocation that was given us. 
   I would like to say working with Chairman CAMPBELL has been a pleasure. He is easy to work with. His staff, Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin, and Lula Edwards have worked hard to ensure this bill has been well crafted, as has been the work of Barbara Retzlaff and Chip Waldren, who have been working with me on this legislation. 
   Senator CAMPBELL has described the major highlights of this bill, so I will not repeat that at this hour of the evening, but I do want to address a couple of brief issues. 
   One, the issue of courthouse construction. Members of the subcommittee are well aware of the judiciary's continuing need to have some court space available to conduct their business and to move cases to settlement. We know that. Regrettably, there was not enough money in the allocation to this subcommittee to provide for courthouse construction. The President did not request courthouse construction nor was it funded in this bill. Budgetary constraints were the major factor with respect to that but not the only factor. Another reason we believe it would be somewhat precipitous to approve funding for the design and construction of many new courthouses prior to the AOC's completion of its comprehensive review of judiciary space is we think that review ought to be done first. 
   The committee was pleased to receive the Administrative Office of the Court's May 28 letter confirming the award of a contract to a consulting firm to analyze and evaluate the judiciary's long-range planning process, their courthouse design guidelines, their program policies and practices, and the funding mechanisms and responsibilities. But the committee is concerned that the completion date for that report will be well after the date by which the administration must complete action on their 2001 fiscal year budget request. We anticipate having that report before we would complete action on fiscal year 2001 budget decisions and appropriations decisions here in the Congress. I believe that is important because we have received information which indicates that 11 of the 16 courthouses for which the AOC requested funding in the year 2000 deviated from the Judicial Conference of the United States Court Design Guide. 
   For example, magistrate and bankruptcy courtrooms were increased from 1,800 usable square feet to 2,400 usable square feet, a 33-percent increase. Total courthouse circulation space increased from 20 percent to 30 percent. Individual courtrooms were routinely being provided for individual senior district judges for more than 10 years, and the list goes on. 
   I believe some of those excesses in the construction program resulted in some of the past funding delays. None of us believe a funding moratorium is the best way to maintain an important Federal asset program, so I hope the construction review will be completed and we can proceed in the future with a construction program. 
   Second, I want to discuss very briefly the issue of the Office of National Drug Control Policy National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. That is a long way of talking about the media campaign that has been going on in this country on the issue of drugs. This is the third year of that funding, funding of over one-half of a billion dollars that has been provided for this initiative. 
   I would like to say I support this initiative. I think the power of advertising is well recognized. Appropriate advertising and advertising that is well done dealing with a message to our young people in this country, ``do not take drugs,'' is an appropriate way to send that message. 
   I worked with the subcommittee to ensure that adequate funds were provided this year for that campaign to be effective. I do not believe that halfway through the campaign it is time to dilute the message. 
   I know there will perhaps be an amendment offered dealing with alcohol. No one is more concerned about the issue of alcohol consumption, drunk driving, and alcohol abuse in this country than I. But I do not want to dilute what we are doing on the antidrug campaign with this alcohol issue at this point. There are other venues, other ways, other programs with which we can confront the drunk driving and alcohol abuse issue, and we will. 
   This year we were not able to fully fund the television campaign dealing with the antidrug message. We have had to cut that some. We would have liked to have funded all of these issues in a manner that fully funds the budget request, but we did not have the money to do that. There simply were not the available resources to accomplish that. We have been forced to make certain cuts. 
   My hope is perhaps some of these can be in conference, perhaps some additional budget allocation will be made available as we proceed through this process. 
   Again, the work done by Senator CAMPBELL, his staff, and our staff has produced a good piece of legislation. I hope we can move through it rather quickly tomorrow and preserve the bulk of what we have done to fund these very important programs.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is the responsibility of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to consider treaties submitted by the President as soon as possible after their submission. Normally, most treaties are considered within a year of being submitted. The President of the United States transmitted the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty to the Senate on September 23, 1997. 
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has not held a single hearing on this important Treaty in the 646 days since the President sent the CTBT to the Senate for its consideration. In comparison, the START I Treaty was ratified in 11 months, the SALT I Treaty in 3 months, the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty in 4 months, and the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 3 weeks. 
   As of today, 152 countries have signed the CTBT, including Russia and China, and 37 countries have ratified the Treaty. The world is waiting for the United States to lead on this issue. I hope my colleagues will urge for this Treaty's rapid consideration.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Secretary of Defense has described our military action in Kosovo as the most accurate application of Air Power in history. The men and women of the 5th Bomb Wing, Minot, North Dakota, were critical to that effort, and the citizens of this state and our entire country are justifiably proud of their efforts. 
   The B-52 bombing raids on Yugoslavian positions on June 7, 1999, undoubtedly hastened the decision by Yugoslavia to sign the NATO peace agreement ending the conflict. As the Washington Post reported on the significance of the strike, ``Two days later, Yugoslav generals formally agreed to withdraw all forces from Kosovo.'' The Washington Post Article entitled, ``NATO's Most Lethal Airstrike Ended a Battle, Perhaps a War,'' reported that the B-52 attack on Mount Pastrik was the turning point in the Kosovo conflict. 
   Like the ``Linebacker'' operations in Vietnam, the unmatched striking power of the B-52 bomber convinced the enemy that negotiation was preferable to suffering the business end of over 70,000 pounds of munitions. The crews of the B-52 bombers that carried out their missions in Kosovo proved the anecdote again, ``That bomber pilots make history.'' 
   In recognizing the efforts of the crews and support personnel of the 5th Bomb Wing, we cannot forget the sacrifices made by the families and loved ones left behind. Today's professional All-Volunteer Air Force is a different organization than the one that preceded it. More times than not, when an Air Force member deploys, he or she leaves behind a spouse and small children who depend on them, who miss them, and who pray for their safe return. We in the Senate owe a debt of gratitude to those brave families who  lovingly support the men and women of our Armed Forces. 
   Mr. President, in every conflict following the Korean War, the B-52 bomber has delivered the most debilitating blows to our enemies. As demonstrated in Yugoslavia, the B-52 is still capable of delivering the initial strikes in a conflict with stand-off weapons, and then executing decisive strikes on fielded forces with a range of munitions. 
   The United States Air Force's plan to fly the B-52 bomber well into the next century is a tribute both to the aircraft and the innovative crews that continue to demonstrate the decisive capabilities of the aircraft. Most importantly, as long as the Air Force has men and women like those who serve in the 5th Bomb Wing, this nation sleeps well protected.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand yesterday there was a press conference on the Capitol lawn. They brought in some big, shiny farm tractors and a group of folks held a press conference, with the tractors as a background, wheezing and moaning about the agriculture appropriations bill, saying somehow that bill is getting held up and it will hurt family farmers. 
   I advise my colleagues, if we had invoked cloture as the majority leader and others wanted with respect to that bill, we would have been prevented the opportunity to offer an amendment on the floor dealing with the farm crisis, an amendment that provides some basic income support to family farmers during this urgent farm crisis. We would not have been able to do that. 
   Voting yes on cloture, on a bill that the majority leader pulled off the floor and then brought back on a cloture motion, would mean there is no opportunity to vote for some kind of income support package for family farms while there are collapsed prices. We have tried to get that before this Congress. 
   I sat downstairs at midnight in the emergency conference on appropriations between the House and the Senate. Senator HARKIN and I offered an amendment that would have provided about $5.5 billion in emergency help for family farmers during this collapse of farm prices. We lost on a 14-14 tie vote. Then we tried in the appropriations subcommittee and lost there on a partisan vote. 
   We intend to offer the amendment on behalf of family farmers on the floor, saying when prices collapse, if this country cares about family farmers, if this Senate is indeed profamily and cares about family farmers and wants to have some family farmers in its future, then it will pass an emergency package to respond to family farmers' needs during this price collapse. We wouldn't have been able to do that if we voted to invoke cloture. We would not have been able to offer the amendment. Now we have people saying somehow those who voted against cloture have disserved the interests of farmers. 
   The agricultural appropriations bill that came to the floor is a piece of legislation that funds USDA; it funds the research programs and the other programs at USDA. It takes effect October 1. It does not take effect for months. 
   The delay of the bill is not going to injure, in any way, family farmers. The bill will get passed on time. It will be sent to the President and be signed. Contrary to those standing in front of a tractor yesterday, wheezing and blowing about farm issues--some of whom I bet wouldn't know a bale of hay from a bale of twine--I guarantee before that bill leaves the Senate, we intend to offer an emergency package to say to family farmers: You matter; we are going to help you; when prices collapse, we will help you over the price ``valley.'' 
   What happens to a company on Wall Street, Long-Term Capital Management, that threatens to lose billions of dollars? What happens is they get bailed out by the Federal Reserve Board. 
   What would happen if we were talking about big corporations? They would get bailed out, but they are family farmers. 
   Somehow in the minds of some, it does not matter what happens to family farmers. It matters to me. It does to many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle. 
   I know why they held the press conference with tractors. It is because they are upset that folks on this side of the aisle offered a Patients' Bill of Rights. The reason the Patients' Bill of Rights was offered in the Senate on agriculture, and it would not have mattered on which bill it was offered, is we said it was going to be offered to the first bill that came up if we were not given the opportunity to have a Patients' Bill of Rights on the floor of the Senate. 
   It was offered because we have pushed and pushed and pushed and we have been denied the opportunity to debate and offer amendments on a Patients' Bill of Rights. That is not the way the Senate is supposed to work. You are supposed to be able to offer legislation, offer amendments, have debates, and then have a vote. But some do not want the Senate to operate that way. They want to shut the place down, close the blinds, pull the windows shut, and then say: This is our agenda. Here is all we are going to allow you to do. You can offer these three amendments. They have to be worded this way. If we don't agree with them, we will not give you the privilege of speaking on the floor. That is not the way the Senate is supposed to operate and we will not let it operate that way. We have rights. 
   The American people have rights. In my judgment, patients in this country have the right to know all of their medical options for their treatment, not just the cheapest. Patients have the right to get emergency room treatment when they have an emergency. Patients have a right to keep their own doctors during cancer treatment even if their employers change HMOs. All of those issues are issues we intend to fight for on behalf of patients in this country. But we are denied that right by a majority who says you can only talk about the things we want to talk about. 
   Then when the agriculture appropriations bill or any other bill comes to the floor and we offer the Patients' Bill of Rights, we are told by the same folks who say they care about farmers that we have delayed the agriculture appropriations bill. This bill will not take effect until October 1 and is to fund the U.S. Department of Agriculture and had we voted for cloture, it would have prevented Senator HARKIN and myself from offering the specific amendment to deal with income support for family farmers during this farm crisis. 
   I just have to say it takes some imagination to hold a conference and suggest we are the problem.

   Mr. DORGAN. That is exactly the case. It is the case that we are in the circumstance which now exists because there are some here in the Senate who simply do not want to have to vote on the issues we are talking about with respect to the Patients' Bill of Rights. They want to have a slogan so they can vote for something titled the Patients' Bill of Rights but one that will not have any strength; one that will really not have any provisions to provide people with the basic rights they ought to be provided with respect to this health care issue. 
   We have talked at great length about the too many instances in this country where health care decisions are not made by a doctor in a patient's room in the hospital or by a doctor in a doctor's office at a clinic, but where the answer to what kind of patient care will be allowed is to often, in too many circumstances, made by an accountant making medical judgments somewhere in an insurance company office 1,000 miles away. That is 
   what is wrong with the system.

   Mr. DORGAN. The Senator describes it exactly. It is the difference between one approach that is toothless and an approach that has some teeth to it that says we are going to make this work; we are going to offer some basic protections to patients. 
   I have a poster I was going to show today. I will show it later in the day. It is a poster of a young boy in a wheelchair named Ethan who was denied treatment by the HMO. He was born with very difficult problems that impaired the use of his limbs. He was denied treatment because a doctor who had never seen this young patient decided that the patient had a 50-percent chance of being able to walk by age 5, and a 50-percent chance of being able to walk if he gets the appropriate therapy is ``not significant.'' This is from a doctor who did not see the patient. It is not significant that this person might have a 50-percent chance of being able to walk, therefore we deny coverage. 
   That is the kind of thing that is happening time and time again. I say to the Senator from Illinois, I have talked about this woman who falls off a cliff, drops 40 feet, fractures her bones in three places, is knocked unconscious, taken by medevac helicopter out to a hospital, is brought into the emergency room unconscious, survives, and later is told: We will not pay the emergency room bill because you didn't have prior approval for emergency room treatment. This is a woman unconscious, brought into the emergency room for help. That is the kind of thing that ought to stop. Does she have a right through her health care coverage to emergency room treatment when she is knocked unconscious from a fall in the mountains? The answer is yes, of course. We demand that right be given that patient in this Patients' Bill of Rights.

   Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is absolutely correct. Again, it is the difference between an approach that is toothless and an approach that has teeth; one that works, makes a difference, one that matters. 
   So we have a couple of bills ricocheting around here for which the other side has adopted the same title--which is a nice thing to do, I guess: The Patients' Bill of Rights. The question is scope. How many Americans will it cover and what kind of coverage will it offer? Will it, in fact, help people like that young boy who was told a 50-percent chance to be able to walk by age 5 really doesn't cut it with us; we will not provide the therapy you need? Or will it, in fact, provide assurance to someone who is knocked unconscious in an accident, that if he or she goes into an emergency room unconscious nobody is going to say later: You should have gotten prior approval from the emergency room?

   Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator, I was as surprised as anyone to read the news these days about doctors wanting to join a union. But the reason is pretty obvious. They are tired of not being able to practice health care on their own. They are tired of someone making decisions about their patients who they have seen. They are the ones who have been in the examining rooms. They are the ones who have visited the hospital beds. Yet an accountant 500 miles away or 1,000 miles away in some insurance office, is telling them how to practice medicine. They are flat sick of it.

   Mr. DORGAN. I think that is exactly the case, the reason over 200 medical, consumer, and labor groups support this legislation. I have a picture loaned to me by Dr. GANSKE, who is a Member of Congress from the House, a Republican, a very thoughtful Congressman. He is a doctor who does reconstructive surgery. He held up the picture of this young boy. Let me hold up that picture, if I might, just so everyone understands what we are talking about. This is a terrible deformity. Dr. GANSKE held this picture up to use it as an illustration. 
   Obviously, you look at this young boy and you say what an awful deformity to have to live with. But there are ways, of course, to correct this. A young boy doesn't have to live with that deformity. Dr. GANSKE pointed out he did a survey of his fellow doctors and discovered that half of his fellow doctors had experienced the circumstance of having an HMO say: No, this is not medically necessary. You don't need to correct this. It is not medically necessary. 
   Can this young person live with this? Yes, I suppose so. Would any prudent American say it is medically necessary to help fix this problem, to give this young child the opportunity to get reconstructive surgery? The answer is clearly yes. That is what is at the root of this issue.

   Mr. DORGAN. As I understand it, the Senator describes the case exactly. Virtually every organization in health care supports what we are trying to do. The doctors in this country, the patients all support what we are trying to do because they know we are trying to solve problems. 
   Let me go back to this notion there are two different approaches. The approach they offer is toothless. It has a title and does not mean anything very much. The approach we offer has teeth, is real, and makes a difference in people's lives. 
   I want to make one additional point and then conclude because I know there are others who wish to speak. I came to the floor today because the majority leader and others held a press conference yesterday with tractors as a backdrop saying what we have been doing here is shortchanging American farmers. Nothing is further from the truth. American farmers are going to be well served by a Senate that does not push this agriculture appropriations bill through without emergency help which farmers desperately need. That is exactly what would have happened if we had voted for cloture as the majority leader was insisting. 
   Had we voted for cloture on the agriculture appropriations bill, the amendment that Senator HARKIN and I were going to offer for $6 billion to $7 billion in emergency help for farmers would have been ruled nongermane. It would have been over. We cannot pass an agriculture appropriations bill in the Senate without addressing this farm crisis, and those who stood in front of  tractors and talked about farmers know that. They know better than that. We cannot pass an agriculture appropriations bill and say we have done our job if we ignore the crisis which now exists and if we do not pass some basic income support package. 
   Senator HARKIN, Senator DURBIN, and I tried in the midnight hours of the emergency appropriations bill. We lost on a 14-14 tie vote. We tried to get it in this year's appropriations bill but lost on a partisan vote. We must try again on the floor of the Senate, and we will in the coming weeks. 
   We had a farmer and author testify before the Democratic Policy Committee named Wendell Berry. He has written a book called ``Another Turn of the Crank.'' I was thinking about that today because yesterday's show in front of these polished tractors was just another turn of the crank. 
   As I said, some of these folks would not know a bale of hay from a bale of twine and they are telling us about the long-term interests of farmers. Many of us who fight for farmers every day in every way are insistent that before this Senate moves any appropriations bill dealing with agriculture out of this Senate, it does not just deal with the programs and research over in USDA, that it deals with the income needs of family farmers. That is what has been at stake in the last couple of days. 
   Frankly, I am not a happy person to see the criticism that has been leveled by those who do not know anything about family farmers and those actions which will undercut our attempt to help family farmers.

   Mr. DORGAN. The Senator asks a question that relates to the key components of our piece of legislation. I again refer to this picture used by Dr. GANSKE, a Congressman in the House of Representatives, a Republican who supports our basic legislation. 
   Does current medical technology and all the advances in reconstructive surgery do this young child any good, if the child does not have access to it, if the child's parents belong to an HMO that says, no, it is not medically necessary we correct that deformity, it is not medically necessary at all? Does that kind of medicine help this child? The answer is no. What helps this child is a determination by this Senate that health care plans ought to judge on a uniform basis that this type of deformity is medically necessary and this child would get reconstructive treatment to solve that problem.

   Mr. DORGAN. I cannot. The Senator makes a point with his question. This is real trouble for a lot of patients, and what we are trying to do and say is health care is changing and patients ought to have rights. That is what our Patients' Bill of Rights does. It empowers patients and allows them to believe that if they are covered with health care through their HMO, there will be some basic guarantees that just, prudent people expect would be there anyway but which we have now seen in recent years by some HMOs have systematically been denied patients. 
   Let me make one final point. Not always, but too often health care treatment has become a function of profit and loss for some corporations. Look at their executives. Find how much money they are making in this industry. Then they say: But we can't afford to provide emergency room care for someone who is unconscious and presents himself on a gurney to emergency room workers, or we can't help this young child with a facial deformity which clearly needs attention. We can't help a child in a wheelchair who has a 50-percent chance of walking and told you don't get the therapy because a 50-percent chance of walking by age 5 is insignificant. 
   We are saying those are not medical judgments made by a doctor. Those are insurance judgments made by HMO accountants 1,000 miles away, and they undercut the very premise of this health care system in which we ought to expect prudent treatment that a doctor believes is necessary for a patient. Yet in too many instances, they are not getting it. This is not just a consumer bill or a patients' bill, it is a bill that really gets at the root of health care in this country. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I come to the floor today to speak about Devils Lake in North Dakota. Most people don't know about Devils Lake. It is one of only two lakes at the bottom of a closed basin in the entire country. One is the Great Salt Lake, the other is Devils Lake. Devils Lake has a basin about the size of the State of Massachusetts tucked inside the borders of North Dakota. 
   To set the stage, North Dakota is ten times the size of Massachusetts. Devils Lake has been subject to chronic emergency flooding now for many years. That flooding in Devils Lake over recent years has caused absolute chaos for the folks who live in that region of northeastern North Dakota. 
   This is a lake that has risen about 25 feet in 7 years. In the past 60 years, it has risen nearly 50 feet. If you were a family living in Minnewaukan, ND, it wasn't too long ago that you lived 7 miles away from a lake. But recently I was standing in Minnewaukan, and the lake is right up to the back yards of that community. In 7 short years, people who lived 7 miles away from the lake now find the lake flooding their property. 
   The cost of this flooding, in human terms, is massive. The lake continues to rise in a manner that is uncontrolled, and the question for the Corps of Engineers and the Federal Government is: What do we do to respond to the threatening rise of the lake that has occurred in recent years and threatens a fairly large city in North Dakota? It threatens to cut off one region of our state from emergency services and the normal commerce of daily life. It inundates roads, railways and utilities. 
   In response, over $300 million has been spent in that region raising roads and relocating people and building dikes--doing all the things necessary to combat the flooding. This is a different kind of flood, unlike a river flood, where we see a picture on television of a swollen river moving very rapidly and causing chaos with houses floating down the river. The lake flooding here has come, and it has stayed, slowly destroying homes and businesses. It is causing major problems. 
   One of the plans with respect to this Devils Lake flooding has been to build an outlet. We are building dikes to protect cities and protect roads. We are raising roads, using roads as dikes. We are doing all of these things over recent years. 
   One of the pending proposals is to build an outlet to take a small amount of pressure off the lake. The challenge is that there is no problem-free place to put the water. You could put some of it in the Sheyenne River, which goes down to the Red River and up into Canada. An outlet to the Sheyenne River can provide relief but must be well-managed to avoid causing problems for others. We don't want to solve a problem by creating a problem for others. The question of building an outlet has been a very difficult and sensitive one. 
   By the same token, most everyone believes it is an emergency and we must use a comprehensive strategy to try to take some pressure off this lake, including upland storage in the upper part of the basin and building an outlet to take some pressure off the lake. However, all of the plans and work to build an outlet have been for naught at this point, because the Corps of Engineers is at odds with itself on the question of whether an outlet should be built. 
   I came to the Senate floor to put in the RECORD two things. One is a ``Draft Summary Document for the Report to Congress on the Emergency Outlet from Devils Lake, North Dakota, to the Sheyenne River, North Dakota.'' This was prepared by the St. Paul District Office of the Army Corps of Engineers. I requested this be made available to me by the Department of the Army's Corps of Engineers Division Office in Vicksburg, MS. 
   Incidentally, Vicksburg, MS, has jurisdiction over North Dakota. Now, Lord only knows how that can happen. Tell me how it makes sense for a general sitting down in Vicksburg, MS, to tell us about lake flooding in North Dakota. But that is the way it is and the way the Corps is organized. 
   The St. Paul district, which has spent a great deal of time on this issue, prepared this document. I want to read just a bit from the document. The St. Paul district says pointedly that we face emergency conditions. This is the Corps of Engineers, St. Paul office:  
   Clearly we face emergency situations and we need to proceed.  
   The St. Paul division further says:  
   Further study and analysis are not reasonable responses to what is truly an emergency situation. What is required is a proactive, multifaceted emergency flood damage reduction plan to protect not only Devils Lake but the region. The lake is within a single Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) event of overtopping the levees protecting the City of Devils Lake, and for the first time in recorded history, the lake is within single PMF event of spilling into the Sheyenne River.........Any project that would prevent the natural overflow would be justified by economics and from a human health and safety perspective.  
   Accordingly, the St. Paul District recommends immediate action leading to the construction of an emergency outlet. 
   The Mississippi division, which has charge of the St. Paul division, is 1,500 miles away. The general at the Mississippi division and his staff have come up with a completely different perspective. They are farther away, spend far less time on this issue, and know much less about the issue. The Mississippi commander wrote a letter to the North Dakota congressional delegation questioning the summary recommendations of the St. Paul office, which has done all of the work on this issue and whose experts judged there to be an emergency--one that justifies an outlet. 
   The Vicksburg office in Mississippi says that is not the case at all. They say they don't need an outlet. They say, first of all, they are not certain there is an emergency at all. They say an outlet is not necessary or appropriate. ``Of the outlet plans reviewed, none of the outlet plans show benefits exceeding costs.'' 
   Incidentally, this computation by the Division ``experts'' wouldn't meet third grade math standards. They arbitrarily establish costs and benefits, but then leave out some of the real and major benefits. These benefits include, for example, not having to increase roads in order to keep roads open in this basin. Tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars are required to do that. But maybe if you have an outlet you don't have to do that. 
   The Corps of Engineers Division Office says: That is not the problem or the complication because we have  ``principles and guidelines'' to use for the computations. So we leave out large categories of costs avoided. Then they say the cost-benefit calculation does not work. The Mississippi division agrees with St. Paul that dikes should be built but only supports building an outlet subject to a favorable analysis. 
   In fact, the division doesn't believe that on outlet is appropriate. 
   The St. Paul Corps of Engineers said: Yes to an outlet. They are the ones who know this region. They study it, and are in charge of it. Vicksburg, 1,500 miles away, says no. 
   When the Corps decided to move its office to Vicksburg, MS, I had a fit. I should have tried to put a wrench in the crankcase then, and I did not do everything I should have done--I admit. It didn't make any sense at all to decide that the Corps of Engineers' headquarters for a region similar to that ought to be in Mississippi, 1,500 miles away. 
   Here is the evidence. The evidence is that you have the Corps arguing with the Corps. The St. Paul office, which knows the subject best, says: Here is what ought to be done. It is an emergency. We support an outlet for the following reasons. Here is what we ought to do. The folks in Mississippi say: Gee. We don't believe that at all. 
   The only reason I am putting two documents in the RECORD today by consent--I would like to include in the RECORD the summary document prepared by the St. Paul office of the Corps of Engineers and the letter sent to the congressional delegation by General Anderson, who runs the Vicksburg office of the Corps of Engineers--is that they directly contradict each other. Again, it is the same agency. 
   Let me use a couple of charts because I think it is useful to see. 
   This is the level of Devils Lake. You can see what is happening with this lake. This shows 1445.5 feet. It is actually now again up to 1447. So this chart is actually out of date in just a month or two. That chart shows what is happening to this lake. 
   Actually, the most appropriate chart to show for Devils Lake is a chart that I want to put up. This chart is actually a picture taken of a woman in 1993. If you look carefully, you can see she is standing at the bottom of the telephone pole in the Devils Lake area. 
   I want to show you where the lake is right now. It is not here. This is also out of date. This is 1445.5. The lake is now 1447 feet. It is above this chart. Here is where this woman would be in the lake at the moment with the lake somewhere around 25 or 30 feet above her head. This picture was taken in 1993. 
   That will describe to you what has happened here. 
   I mentioned to you that people who used to live 7 miles away from the lake 7 years ago now have a lake behind their homes threatening their houses. This doesn't happen anywhere else in the country. It happens in the Great Salt Lake and in Devils Lake. They are the only two closed basins in America in which you have this kind of flooding. The Great Salt Lake threatened a flood in a very dramatic way and receded. But Devils Lake continues to increase. 
   I want to show you what is happening. Every single year the Corps of Engineers says: Well, we were at 1437 feet, then the height of that lake. There is less than a 3-percent chance that it will increase. It increased up to 1443. Then they said there was a less than a 1-percent chance it would increase once more. Again, it increased up to 1444.7. They said that there was less than a 1-percent chance again, and it may well increase to 1447.5 by the middle part of this summer. 
   Every single year we are in a wet cycle, and this basin continues to flood and cause chaos for the people of that region. 
   Here is the cost. Here is what is happening to us and what happens with respect to this flooding. 
   At some point, this flows naturally across the divide out of the basin with the worst possible quality of water, with dissolved solids that create a terrible quality of water that everyone is afraid of. And it flows naturally across the divide at 1460, down into the Sheyenne River, up the Red River into Canada, causing very significant problem for major population centers. 
   That is why all of us have to be concerned about this. 
   Here is what the damages are when you have that kind of flooding. Again, it is not river flooding where a gushing river grabs a house and throws it downstream and you have dramatic pictures. It is a lake that gobbles up a region, people, property, and hope inch by inch. 
   What is happening is the cumulative damages, as this lake goes up, are massive--about $300 million to date, and the prospect is much more.

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, if the Senator from Mississippi is prepared to speak on something, I would be happy to defer. I want to speak for 5 minutes on something that is going to happen, perhaps, in a day or so. I have spoken about this a great deal. That is the question of interest rates and the Federal Reserve Board that will be meeting this week. 
   We are told that the Federal Reserve Board will almost certainly increase interest rates later this week. I thought it would be interesting to include in a discussion on the floor an analysis of what has happened to the rate of inflation in this country. 
   Interest rates are still at a rather high rate after adjusting for inflation. The economic rent for money is still very high given the historic American standards. The inflation rate--especially the core inflation rate--has dropped very dramatically in recent years. Incidentally, despite all the predictions by all of the best economists at the Fed and elsewhere, they used to say if you penetrate through 6 percent unemployment you clearly have massive inflation problems. You just can't have low unemployment and low inflation. 
   The economy, of course, confounded all of them. I think part of the reason was the models are all wrong. The models reflect traditional economic theory, and that doesn't account for the global economy in which producers produce anywhere they want in the world at lower costs and, therefore, put downward pressure on wages in the industrialized countries. But despite that, even if the models are wrong, what has happened is that as unemployment has reduced in this country and come down rather dramatically over the years, so too has inflation. 
   Looking at the rates of inflation, the Consumer Price Index, going back to 1990, we were at 6 percent, then down to just over 3 percent, under 3 percent, and down under 2 percent. The fact is inflation is well under control. The downward pressures that the global economy has put on wages in this country, I think, will continue to keep the rate of inflation well under control. 
   The Federal Reserve Board has a different set of circumstances it will evaluate. The Federal Reserve Board is an interesting board. It was created in the nineteen-teens. President Wilson and those involved promised the country: We are not and will not ever create a strong central bank. We just won't do that. 
   For many years, of course, the Fed has had a central banking function that has been enormously strong, and largely unaccountable. Some people think that is a virtue to be unaccountable to anything or anyone else in the country so it can run monetary policy as it sees fit, unlike others who are involved in the executive and legislative branch running fiscal policy. 
   The Federal Reserve Board is made up of a Board of Governors. We have one seat vacant. We have one seat that is being vacated. It is also joined in the Open Market Committee by a rotating group of members of the presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks. The presidents of the Federal Reserve banks are hired and retained by their boards of directors who are their bankers in their regions. Despite the fact they are not confirmed by anyone and are accountable only to the bankers and boards of directors in their region, they come to town on a rotating basis with the Board of Governors' to vote on interest rate policy. 
   The Fed will probably, the day after tomorrow, decide it should increase short-term interest rates again. I don't agree with that. I think it is a terrible decision to make. I don't think any evidence that justifies a hike in rates. Some of my colleagues come to the floor and say: What are you talking about? Mr. Greenspan ought to be credited for the great economy. 
   In my opinion, this nation's economic performance--if you review the record--is in spite of the estimates by Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board. They insisted we could not  pierce 6-percent unemployment without having a rekindling of inflation. They were wrong. The unemployment rate has remained below 6-percent for nearly five years with low inflation. 
   Now the Fed will say it has finally seen a demon in a closet somewhere called inflation that they can use to justify increasing interest rates. I think they are wrong. The American people, and especially producers, are already paying a higher economic rent for money than is currently warranted, given the core rate of inflation. 
   Organizations such as the National Association of Manufacturers believe it is not appropriate to have the Federal Reserve Board once again increase interest rates. The National Association of Manufacturers sent a fax sheet last Friday to 535 Members of the House and the Senate detailing why they think interest rates are already high enough and that an increase in the rates is not justified in light of an already slowing economy. 
   I happen to agree with that; I know others do not. I also happen to think the Federal Reserve Board and these Members ought to have some basic accountability. We ought to at least give them credit if you think they have done a wonderful job. Here are their names, addresses, pedigrees, and grey suits. Here are their salaries. 
   If you think, however, they are pursuing an unreasonably high interest rate policy, given the rate of inflation, here is who they are. Here is how much money they make. Here is who the regional Fed bank board of directors have appointed to be in charge of public policy. They come on a rotating basis, galloping into Washington, DC, shutting their large oak doors and make a decision on behalf of America. They will decide they think interest rates 
   aren't high enough. 
   They have decided for a long while that too many people were working in this country--a decision I did not quite understand. They serve their own constituents; their constituents are their member banks. Perhaps some day we can have a debate about monetary policy in this Senate. A century ago it used to be debated in barber shops and bars. 
   Not too long ago, I studied money and banking in graduate school. Lyndon Johnson was President and William McChesney Martin was head of the Federal Reserve Board. He was going to increase interest rates by one-quarter of 1 percent. Lyndon Johnson sent for him to come down to the ranch in the Perdinales in Texas for a barbecue. He put his arms around him and almost squeezed barbecue juice over that fellow--all over one-quarter of 1 percent. 
   Now it is not a big deal. The Fed shuts their door and everybody says: Hosanna--whatever the Fed thinks is what the economic doctrine ought to be. 
   Not with me. I think there is no justification with respect to the rate of inflation for the Fed to put this additional charge on American producers or the American people. When the Fed meets this week behind closed doors--and this is who they are, where they live, how much money they make--give them credit or blame them, depending on your economic doctrine. 
   My policy is interest rates are higher than is justified, or higher than justified at this point, given the rate of inflation in this country. The economic rent now charged for money exceeds the economic rent by historical standards over a long period of time. For the Fed to shut its doors and decide the economic rent ought to be higher, in my judgment, is fundamentally wrong. 
   That is probably a minority view these days, given the reverence for Fed policy, but it is at least therapeutic for me to say it on a Monday, preceding the Fed's meeting. If they increase interest rates at their meeting this week, I will come back with more to say. I hope perhaps they will surprise me and others and decide there is no data to justify an increase in interest rates given the rate of inflation in our economy today. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to respond just a bit to some of the discussion that has occurred with respect to both the Patients' Bill of Rights and also the agriculture appropriations bill. 
   I just heard the discussion about the Kennedy position in the House and the Kennedy bill this and the Kennedy bill that. It is not what this issue is about. This is about a Patients' Bill of Rights. It is about the kind of health care the American people get when they show up with a disease or with an injury and need health care treatment, what kind of treatment do they get under current circumstances, and what kinds of protections are reasonable protections for them to expect in this system. 
   We have been pushing, for a long while, to try to get a Patients' Bill of Rights enacted by this Congress and by the previous Congress, but our efforts have not met with great success. I will tell you why. Because as health care has reorganized, and the largest insurance companies have herded people into HMOs, they have decided they do not want Congress to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. They want to be making health care decisions in their insurance offices, often 1,000 miles away from a hospital room or a doctor's office. They do not want Congress, in any way, to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. They have gotten enough folks here in this Congress, and here in this Senate, to decide that they would block it. And it has been blocked forever. 
   So it does not matter that it was the agriculture appropriations bill. It would have been any bill. The Democratic leader last week said to the majority leader: We intend to offer it. If you don't give us an agreement and an opportunity to decide that we're going to have a fair and free and open debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights, we're going to offer it. 
   We are going to pass the agriculture appropriations bill. Before we pass the agriculture appropriations bill, we are going to have a debate on responding to the emergency of the farm crisis. That is not in this bill at the present time. We tried to put it in the bill in the subcommittee and were defeated in our attempts to do so. 
   But we are going to have a debate that is much larger than just this bill. This bill deals with the funding of USDA programs, research, food stamps--a range of things--but it does not address the farm crisis that exists out there today that deals with income: The fact that farmers go to a grain elevator someplace and the grain trade decides that their food is not worth much, they do not get a fair price for it. Family farmers are in desperate trouble. We are going to debate that bill, but we are also going to debate a bill to try to respond to the farm crisis.

   Mr. DORGAN. I will in a moment. 
   But let me point out, we are also going to debate the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is not going to be some gatekeeper who is going to tell us what our rights are on the floor of the Senate. Someone will stand over there and say: Well, we have reviewed this amendment. We think we'll allow you to offer that. We are not going to do that. That is not the way the Senate rules exist. The Senate rules exist in a way that says to every Senator: You have a right to offer amendments. 
   I understand that we are not in the majority and we do not set the agenda. The other side sets the agenda. But when they decide that the agenda will be to enhance all of their interests and shut off any debate of interests on the other side, they miss, in my judgment, the history of the Senate. That is not what this body is about. 
   We have rights. We intend to exercise those rights. We are going to talk about education. We are going to talk about health care. Yes, we are going to talk about the farm crisis. And we are going to insist on it. The debate at the moment is our insistence that we be able to have a fair opportunity to offer amendments with respect to our Patients' Bill of Rights, that we have a full debate on them, and to have them voted on. 
   We insist on that. 
   I am happy to yield for a question.

   Mr. DORGAN. Let me just make this point: We are going to pass an agriculture appropriations bill. The Senator from Idaho says: Well, we all agree there is a problem. We need to understand the scope and the depth. 
   I understand the scope and the depth of this problem. I sat in the Appropriations Committee conference in the basement of this building at midnight one night, when nobody said we needed to understand the scope and depth of the Defense Department issues. The Pentagon asked for $6 billion to prosecute the airstrikes needed to replenish their funds, and the Congress said: Well, you don't know what you are doing. We want to add another $6 billion. You didn't ask for enough money for the Pentagon. We demand that we give you $6 billion more. 
   Nobody was sitting around saying we need to understand the scope and the depth of that. They said: We demand you take $6 billion more money. That night, about 1 in the morning, Senator HARKIN and I said, if there is an extra $5 or $6 billion around, we demand a debate on the priority of its use. We have people going broke in farm country. We demand that some of it be used for that. 
   So we offered an amendment. By 14 to 14, we lost on a tie vote; I suppose, because some didn't know the scope and the depth. The Senator from Idaho cares a lot about family farming, as do I. It is mixing, in my judgment, a concoction of bad meals here to suggest that by adding a Patients' Bill of Rights to this particular bill it does something to agriculture or somebody isn't committed to agriculture. That is all fog. 
   We wouldn't be here talking about this had someone, some long 
   while ago, said, yes, we will give you your rights on the floor of the Senate to bring a bill to the floor and to offer amendments. Yet we have been systematically denied that opportunity. That is why, whether it is this bill or any other bill, you are going to find these kinds of amendments. 
   As soon as those who are in charge allow the Senate to operate the way it ought to operate and function, you will not see these amendments. 
   In my judgment, we are here on the Patients' Bill of Rights because we have been told: We don't want you to be able to offer your amendments on the Patients' Bill of Rights dealing with scope, dealing with emergency room treatment, and so on. That is why we are here.

   Mr. DORGAN. The answer to that is, of course, they do. This issue is not an issue of urban versus rural. The issue of health care and medical treatment exists all around this country. We have talked on the floor at great length about the specifics of it. 
   Yesterday I told the story--I will tell it again, because it describes something more than a Patients' Bill of Rights--does someone who was taken a 40-foot fall and has been helicoptered to a hospital and thrown into an emergency room unconscious with fractured bones in three parts of her body, does that person have a right to emergency room treatment? Or does the HMO have a right to say: We won't cover your emergency room cost because you didn't get prior approval to get to an emergency room? 
   How do you get prior approval when you are unconscious on a gurney being wheeled in from a helicopter, medivac'ed from the mountains where you were hiking? Does a patient in this country who has health care coverage have a right to expect emergency room treatment in those circumstances? Of course. 
   That is what the Patients' Bill of Rights is about. Not just that, but the right to keep the same doctor, and cancer treatment, a whole series of issues like that. Does that affect rural America? Of course, it does. 
   But I want to go back to the point made by my colleague. The agriculture appropriations bill does not come to the floor of the Senate with an ag crisis response because it was not deemed appropriate by those who decided they didn't want to put it there. We are going to try to put it there at some point. I hope perhaps we can do that on a bipartisan basis. 
   I know the scope and the depth of the problem in rural America. The problem is that it costs about $4.50 to produce a bushel of wheat. They drive to the country elevator and the grain trade says wheat is only worth $2.70 a bushel. That is a quick way to go broke. We have a lot of families who are experiencing broken dreams of being able to continue in family farming because the hungry world and the grain trade of the hungry world have said: Your food doesn't have value. 
   It is not in the bill now, so don't be in such a hurry about the underlying bill. We need to add to the underlying bill the farm crisis package that Senator HARKIN and others are going to push. In the meantime, we will insist on our rights to try to offer a Patients' Bill of Rights on the floor of the Senate.

   Mr. DORGAN. The only reason I stood up to respond is because there is information from the GAO and elsewhere that suggests that the Patients' Bill of Rights may actually encourage more health care coverage. You may have more people buying health insurance understanding that in their HMO they have rights. They have the right to demand information on all the potential treatments available to them,  not just the cheapest, for example. They might well believe that is a pretty good thing. 
   The GAO and others say this may well increase the coverage. The assumption that a couple million people will opt out, I do not believe that. 
   The second thing is, we are going to need to solve the farm problem with folks around here from both sides of the political aisle. The Presiding Officer is from Kansas, a big State in dealing with the farm issue. I would never suggest that somehow he doesn't care about farmers. I have served with him in the House and the Senate and know too well how much he cares about family farmers. We need, at some point, to get together on a solution to deal with the farm crisis. 
   I understand that. I have not said--and I could, I suppose--all right, you took $6 billion that you created someplace and gave it to defense. 
   So my contention is this: You gave the Defense Department money they didn't ask for that should have gone to farmers. I could come out here and make that case, I suppose. But I am not doing that. I have said I thought if there was $6 billion, we should have a debate about the priorities. We didn't. The Defense Department got it, and I am sure they will use it for security needs, readiness, and other things. 
   My point is, on the underlying bill, I don't think we should be too quick to pass it, because it doesn't have the fundamental resources to deal with the farm crisis. 
   In any event, last week the Democratic leader informed the majority leader: If you don't give us the opportunity that we insist upon as Senators, to bring these issues to the floor, such as the Patients' Bill of Rights, then we intend to offer it as an amendment to whatever vehicle is on the floor. Anybody who is surprised by that simply wasn't awake last week. 
   So we will get through this. I think the way we will do it is to have a full debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights at some point, with the ability to offer amendments, as we should, and I hope we will also have a robust debate on the issue of the farm crisis response.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to call the attention of the Senate to a couple of items that relate to an appropriations bill we will be marking up this afternoon in about half an hour in the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   We are going to mark up three bills. I will be there as a member of that committee. One of the bills deals with the District of Columbia. I have spoken on the floor in recent weeks about an issue dealing with the criminal justice system in the District of Columbia. I want to comment on it again in light of a news story in today's paper, this Thursday morning's Washington Post. 
   Some while ago, a young boy was rollerblading in the District of Columbia--a matter of weeks ago--and he was hit and killed by a car that then sped away. That car allegedly was driven by a man who was arrested, Shane DeLeon. He was arrested and put in jail and then, of course, let out of jail, as is so often the case these days. 
   Shane DeLeon, it says in the paper today, walked away from custody. It says:  
   The man charged in the hit-and-run death of an American University student walked away from a District halfway house Tuesday and remained free last night.......  
   I want to read a couple of paragraphs because it describes, I think, the chronic problem in the criminal justice system in the District of Columbia and, I should say, elsewhere as well.  
   Shane Simeon DeLeon failed to return to the Community Correctional Center on New York Avenue NE by his 11 p.m. curfew, according to D.C. Department of Corrections officials. [He] was allowed out of the facility from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. to remodel the basement of his girlfriend's home on MacArthur Boulevard in Northwest Washington....... 
   This is the third time [this fellow] has broken curfew. The first two times, he was under home detention.  
   Now he walks away again, this fellow who is facing second-degree murder charges. 
   I have spoken on the floor a lot about a case that was in the news a couple of weeks ago. I spoke about this case some years ago on a number of occasions and then again a couple of weeks ago. It is the case involving the murder of a young woman, Bettina Pruckmayr. Bettina Pruckmayr was a young attorney here in Washington, DC. She was abducted late at night and forced to go to an ATM machine and forced to withdraw money; and then her murderer, Leo Gonzales Wright, stabbed her over 30 times in a brutal murder. 
   It turns out, a couple of weeks ago, after this murderer was sentenced to Federal prison--3 years later, they discovered he had not been put in Federal prison, he was still out at Lorton. The Federal judge was justifiably angry, wondering, why couldn't they even get that right to send this murderer to Federal prison? My understanding is, he is in Federal prison now. 
   But the story in today's paper about a fellow facing second-degree murder charges simply walking away--he was allowed, by the way, while facing second-degree murder charges, to go help remodel the basement of his girlfriend's house from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.--why is a fellow facing murder charges walking around, remodeling his girlfriend's basement? 
   It is the same story as that of Leo Gonzales Wright. What was he doing walking around on the evening that he eventually murdered Bettina Pruckmayr? Here is a man who robbed a convenience store and shot the convenience store owner; he robbed a cab driver and murdered the cab driver; and then he was sentenced to prison for a minimum of 20 years--not to be let out before 20 years--and he was let out nearly 5 years early, despite the fact that in prison he had 33 different violations for assault and drugs and weapons. Then he was let out on the streets 5 years before his sentence ended, and, while on the streets, he committed theft and tested 
   positive for drugs. When he was brought before the parole board, this fellow, who was a twice-convicted murderer, was told: No; you can stay out on the streets on parole. Taking drugs as a violent offender is not serious enough to put you back in prison. Theft is not serious enough to put you back in prison. 
   So the message is: The authorities say that a violent offender can commit a theft, can take drugs, can remain on the streets, and remain on the streets in a manner that allowed him, on that fateful evening, to kill this young attorney named Bettina Pruckmayr. 
   A couple of weeks ago, 3 years after this man was sentenced to Federal prison, the Federal judge found out he was not in Federal prison at all--he was in Lorton--and the judge said: What on Earth is going on? 
   I looked into it in order to find out what happened. It is a mess. At every step along the way, this inspector's general report--which is some 50 pages long--shows one massive problem after another. This system is completely devoid of common sense. It is a system that says to the fellow who was up for second-degree murder: You go ahead and fix your girlfriend's basement. We'll give you every day, all day, from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. to do that. Then he walks away on them, and they are surprised. Or a system that says to another fellow: Yes, we know you are violent, we know you are a murderer, but it is fine if you are on the streets taking drugs, and it does not matter if you are convicted of theft or charged with theft. That is a system, in my judgment, that is defective. 
   I intend to raise some questions at the markup today with respect to the District of Columbia. I notice my colleague from Illinois has come to the floor. He has raised questions that go directly to these issues. 
   This is the District of Columbia that says: We have a lot of money we want to offer for tax cuts. They do not have enough money, apparently, to have prison space to keep people convicted of murder in prison. 
   The Senator from Illinois has asked the questions now a good number of times publicly: What about that? What about your priorities? What about your responsibility to the memory of Bettina Pruckmayr, who was murdered by someone who should have never been on the streets to murder anybody? He should have been in prison, but he was let out early. 
   This fellow Leo Gonzales Wright was in Lorton Prison. Do you know why he was let out early from there? Because he apparently was allowed into the prison system to change his own records; so when they looked at his records, they had all been altered to say he was a good guy when, in fact, he was a bad guy. It is just unforgivable what is happening on the streets in this country, especially in the District of Columbia. 
   And one additional point: It is not just there. There is a county adjacent to the District of Columbia in which two fellows are, I believe, on trial to be convicted for the murder of a couple people in a Mr. Donut shop. I asked my staff to look at the backgrounds of those folks. It seems the same two people carjacked a fellow on the interstate around this beltway, the same two people just months ago carjacked someone in a violent carjacking out on the streets so they could murder a couple people at a Mr. Donut late at night. 
   Day after day we read this, especially in the District of Columbia. I am sick and tired of it. 
   I will offer a couple amendments. I will consult carefully with my friend from Illinois, who is the ranking member on that subcommittee. One of the amendments is, if you are on parole in the District of Columbia for a violent crime and you are picked up on the streets as having taken drugs, you ought to find that your next address is back in that same jail cell. We ought not have violent criminals on parole taking drugs and then have parole officers say that is alright; that it is a minor infraction.  
   If you are a violent offender on parole taking drugs, my friend, your address ought to be a jail cell, once again, to the end of your full term. 
   I intend to offer that amendment. I hope that is the sort of thing we can get passed. 
   I yield to the Senator from Illinois.

   Mr. DORGAN. I am fully aware of that debate and in full support of the statements the Senator from Illinois has made. 
   Let me put up a chart that shows what has sparked my ire. I am not someone who comes to the floor to beat up on the District of Columbia, nor is the Senator from Illinois. I have simply had a bellyful of this behavior by folks in the criminal justice system in the District of Columbia. 
   This headline ran a couple of weeks ago: Killer Sent to Wrong Prison after Second Murder. This headline is referring to Leo Gonzales Wright who murdered Bettina Pruckmayr. Three years after he was sentenced by the Federal judge, they still couldn't get him in the cell that he was supposed to be in. 
   The point is, the inspector general report--I urge all my colleagues to read it--shows a system that is totally corrupt. It portrays a system that says to a violent murderer: You are out on parole. You are out early. You can take drugs. You can be charged with theft, and we don't care. You get to stay on America's streets. 
   A city that can't keep violent offenders off its streets and behind bars is a city that can't keep its streets safe. American citizens deserve better, especially in America's Capital, Washington, D.C. 
   The recommendations of the inspector general are really interesting. I read this at home the other night. When I finished reading it, I shook my head and said: This is such an incompetent system. It doesn't take rocket science to know what you have to do. When someone holds up a convenience store and shoots the owner, when the same person then decides to rob and murder a cabdriver, and then when that person is let out of prison early and decides to take drugs and steal, does that person belong on our streets so that this wonderful young attorney Bettina Pruckmayr can show up at an ATM machine one night, only to be savagely murdered by this animal? Does this person belong on the streets? Of course not. 
   Who was responsible for putting this person on the street? The criminal justice system. Person after person after person failed, and the result is a dead woman, a dead, innocent, young woman, full of promise, who met a killer on the streets of our Nation's Capital. 
   I say again, when we come to the floor--I will go to the Appropriations Committee in 15 minutes--I will offer two amendments, one of them dealing with drugs. I would have thrown this man back in prison immediately, and he wouldn't have been anywhere near Bettina Pruckmayr to be able to murder her that evening. I would have said: If he is found with drugs, as he was repeatedly, having been a formerly convicted murderer, that man goes back to a prison cell. That is just common sense. 
   Do you know, the policy of the District of Columbia was that drug use by someone on parole was not a serious enough offense to put them back in prison? What on earth can they be thinking? They are going to give a tax cut, but they don't have enough money for prison cells to keep violent people behind bars. 
   Shame on those people. Shame on those people who make those judgments. The murder of a young woman and so many others are on their shoulders.

   Mr. DORGAN. In answer, I think there is a leniency here in this system that is unforgivable. The case that the Senator from Vermont just mentioned is referenced in the newspaper today. That case is the grandmother who was trying to grab these children and get them off the streets as the bullets began to fly last Monday. It says in this same story this morning that Derrick Jackson, age 19, has been charged with the first-degree-murder death of Helen Foster-El by stray bullets on Monday night. He had walked away  from a juvenile home in April. He had been placed there in connection with juvenile drug and stolen vehicle charges. I will bet you that if you and I take the time to try to get this person's record, we will find a record as long as your arm and that person ought not to have been anywhere near that neighborhood to be able to fire a gun. 
   I will bet you that the record would justify, by any standard of any reasonable person, that this young man ought to have been in jail. But he was out on the streets with a gun. I don't have the record, but this is a guy who walked away from a halfway house or a juvenile home in April. Now it is almost the end of June.

   Mr. DORGAN. Let me make one final point. There is one other part of this, the case I have described, the Leo Gonzales Wright case. 
   I have always thought that in this country, in our criminal system, we ought to have two standards, one for violent offenders and one for nonviolent offenders. In every State, violent offenders should never get time off for good behavior. Your prison cell ought to be your address until the day your sentence ends, period, no time off. Leo Gonzales Wright earned nearly 5 years of time off for good behavior despite 33 violations in prison for assault, weapons, and drugs--5 years off for good behavior. He should not have been on the streets. 
   I have a bill that is simple. I have never been able to get it passed. It says this: If any jurisdiction in this country lets a violent offender out of prison early and that person commits a violent crime during the time they would have been serving a sentence, then the government--the city, county, or State that let him out--is responsible to the victim or the victim's family and doesn't have immunity from a lawsuit. This bill would force them make a calculation before sending a violent offender back to the street as to, what might this cost us in terms of what that offender might do to a potential victim? I would like to see Congress pass that at some point. I am going to continue to try. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from South Dakota will yield? 
   When he talks about medical necessity, I am reminded of two specific issues. One, the doctor who testified at a hearing before the Congress who worked for a managed care organization, who said: I caused the death of a man. She said it to a near-empty hearing room when the television cameras were gone. She was the last witness of a day. 
   I caused the death of a man, she said. I wasn't reproached for that. I wasn't issued any sanctions. In fact, my employer really felt quite good about it. I was rewarded for it. I withheld treatment that could have saved that person's life. 
   She was dealing at that point as an employee of an HMO, and a patient apparently needed some kind of heart procedure that was very expensive. The HMO said it was not a medical necessity. The patient died. This lady left her employment and later testified before the Congress and said it was a matter of dollars and cents. I caused the death of a man, but I was lauded for that by my employer because, to  them, it was a matter of dollars and cents. So that relates to medical necessity. What is necessary? 
   The second item I was thinking about, I know the Senator from South Dakota was at an event one day; the Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER, was at the same event. Dr. GANSKE, a Member of the House of Representatives, who is a Republican and has been a strong supporter of the Patients' Bill of Rights, held up a poster, a colored picture of a young boy. That young boy had no upper lip and no structure beneath his nose--a giant gaping hole. He was born with a very severe birth defect. It looked awful. One was hardly able to look at that young boy's face and not immediately say what incredible disfigurement this young boy has. 
   Dr. GANSKE, who was speaking that day, said: The HMO said there was not a medical necessity for this young boy to receive repairs. In dollars and cents, the repair of that horrible disfigurement did not make any sense to the HMO. But then he showed a picture of this young boy having gone through reconstructive surgery, and you saw a face, a wonderful face of a young boy which had been repaired and now that young boy had hope. One could sense the smile in that picture, and that is what medical necessity is. 
   It is not convenience. It is not just dollars and cents. It is investments in human beings, giving hope to a young boy. 
   I have one other person, if I may, whom I want to mention and whom I have mentioned before. He is a young boy born with horrible problems. The doctors said he would have a 50-percent chance of walking by age 5 if he had a certain kind of therapy. 
   The HMO said: A 50-percent chance of walking by age 5 is ``insignificant,'' which means that in dollars and cents they withhold the therapy and the young boy is not able to walk. He doesn't have the chance to learn to walk. 
   That is dollars and cents versus medical necessity. That is what is at issue. What is at issue is the ability to empower patients with the opportunity to get needed medical treatment, not necessarily the cheapest treatment, but the best treatment, not necessarily the treatment that someone in an insurance office a thousand miles away thinks might or might not be necessary, but what the doctor in the doctor's office thinks is necessary for that young boy's life, such as the reconstructive surgery of that boy's face. 
   That is what I think about when the Senator speaks about medical necessity. This is not theory. It is not some abstract term. It is an important part of lives, and that is why the Patients' Bill of Rights is so critically important and why the difference between what we are talking about and others are talking about is so stark. 
   We adopt the title, Patients' Bill of Rights, and then they say: We have one, too. Sure you have one. It is like picking up a turtle shell without a turtle in it. It is a shell. It does not mean anything. It does not provide the guarantees for people. That young boy would not have had his reconstructive surgery. The other young boy would not have had a chance to walk. And the list goes on. That is why these differences are so important. 
   Medical necessity, guaranteed emergency room treatment, the gag rule, understanding all your medical options for treatment, not just the cheapest--all of these things are critical differences, and it is why I believe they do not want to allow the Senator from South Dakota to bring the bill before the Senate. We need to vote on these things, if not in total, then one by one, to find out where do my colleagues stand on it. Do they stand for the right of emergency room treatment? Do they stand for the right of reconstructive surgery for that young boy? Where do they stand on these specific issues? 
   That is what is going to happen in the coming days. Like it or not, we are going to force them to face that, because the American people deserve the opportunity to have a Patients' Bill of Rights passed by this Congress empowering them.

   Mr. DORGAN. This morning, as chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, I convened a hearing on the farm crisis. About 10 to 12 of my colleagues came to the hearing. We had a number of family farmers from across the country testify. 
   We had Woody Barth, a farmer from Solen, ND, testify; Rob Lynch, a farmer from Zillah, WA; Glenn Brackman, a  farmer from Lafayette County, AR. We had some folks from Illinois, Iowa, and Kentucky. We talked about the farm crisis and about public policies that ought to be employed by this Congress to respond to the farm crisis. 
   I pointed out that a lot of people are not aware of the farm crisis. It is probably a circumstance that farmers working in quiet desperation, many of them threatened with losing their farms, are going through a period that most Americans do not understand and don't know about. 
   Every day we hear the stock market is up or down, mostly up--the stock market has gone to 11,000, now back down a bit. But the fact is, this country generally hears good economic news about where the stock market is going, about new information technology, about the progress of new companies, about the new day, about the global economy. Yet the folks who stay at home and produce America's food on our family farms are in desperate trouble. 
   Wendell Barry, a farmer from Port Royal, KY, testified today. He is also an author, a wonderful guy, kind of a philosopher-writer type. He wrote some things. In fact, he has written a book called ``Another Turn of the Crank.'' 
   I will read a couple things he has written that I think really bear on this issue. I do it in the context of the bill that is to be on the floor. We did have the agriculture appropriations bill on the floor of the Senate. It will come back, hopefully, as soon as an agreement is reached with respect to the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   When it comes back to the floor, Senator HARKIN and I intend to offer an amendment similar to the amendment we offered during the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. That amendment lost on a 14-to-14 tie vote in the conference. 
   We also offered a proposal in the agriculture appropriations subcommittee. But this is the time, when the agriculture appropriations bill is on the floor, for the Congress to decide what it will do with respect to emergency responses to the farm crisis. 
   There are some who might counsel we should do nothing, that it doesn't matter whether there are farmers in this country. They would say: Food will be produced anyway, and it doesn't matter much who produces it. We can farm America from California to Maine with corporate farms, and that is just fine. 
   I do not happen to share that view. I think that is a view that is devoid of all common sense. It suggests there is no worth and no value at all to the culture of family farming, that family farming doesn't contribute to our country, that the fact there are people living out on the land is irrelevant. The fact that those people combine to make small communities and build our main streets and build our churches and create good neighborhoods is irrelevant; that kind of investment and that kind of creation in our country doesn't count. 
   I guess those who think that way look through the lens of perhaps Wall Street or others who see only dollars and cents, only rows of columns. You add them up or you subtract them. You reach a balance, and that is the cost. It just eliminates, of course, the question of what is the value. Are family farmers contributing value to this country? Will the loss of family farmers matter to our country? The answer is yes on both counts. 
   Mr. Wendell Barry from Port Royal, KY, writes:  
   As we all know, we have much to answer for in our use of this continent from the beginning, but in the last half century we have added to our desecrations of nature a deliberate destruction of our rural communities. The statistics I cited at the beginning are incontrovertible evidence of this.  
   He cited statistics about the loss of farms, the depopulation of our farm belt, and so on.  
   But so is the condition of our farms and forests and rural towns. If you have eyes to see, you can see that there is a limit beyond which machines and chemicals cannot replace people; there is a limit beyond which mechanical or economic efficiency cannot replace care. 
   I am talking here about the common experience, the common fate of rural communities in our country for a long time. It has been, and it will increasingly be, the common fate of rural communities in other countries. The message is plain enough, and we have ignored it too long: the great, centralized economic entities of our time do not come into rural places in order to improve them by ``creating jobs.'' They come to take as much value as they can take, as cheaply and as quickly as they can take it. They are interested in ``job creation'' only so long as the jobs can be done much more cheaply by humans than by machines.  
   Mr. Barry writes, about liberals and conservatives, an interesting admonition:  
   Long experience has made it clear--as we might say to the liberals--that to be free we must limit the size of government and we must have some sort of home rule. But it is just as clear--as we might say to the conservatives--that it is foolish to complain about big government if we do not do everything we can to support strong local communities and strong community economies.  
   He is right about that. 
   We must decide as a Congress whether we are going to support America's family farms. I spoke at the hearing today, when I questioned the witnesses, about where I come from. I have told colleagues often about that. I come from a rural county in southwestern North Dakota that is the size of the State of Rhode Island. That county had 5,000 people when I left, and there are now 3,000 people living in that county. The county next to it is about the same size and there are 900 people living in that county. 
   We are fast depopulating rural America. Rural economies in small towns are shrinking like prunes. We now have prices for commodities, when the family farmer raises a crop and hauls it to the market, that are deplorable. The family farmer is told when he or she takes a truckload of wheat to the country elevator--the grain trade says: This doesn't have value. The food you produce is not of great interest to us. It is not worth very much. 
   At the same time, we have people who come and testify before the Congress that the Sudan, for instance, old women climb trees to try to find leaves to eat. We know much of the world is hungry, and we also know that while much of the world is hungry, the grain market tells our farmers their food isn't worth very much. 
   Something is not connected there, and this Congress must try to reconnect it. 
   We only have two choices, it seems to me. One is an opportunity, on an short-term emergency basis, to pass an emergency farm bill. It seems to me the question for this Congress is: Are we going to pass a short-term emergency bill to try to help family farmers? Second, are we going to repair the farm program, and the trade agreements, and other things that conspire to injure family farmers? 
   On the first issue, Senator HARKIN and I intend to offer an amendment for $5 billion to $6 billion to try to provide short-term emergency help for family farmers on this agriculture appropriations bill when it is brought back to the floor. We will have a fight about that. I don't know how that will turn out. I hope Congress will say that family farmers matter. 
   It was interesting to me that when the President sent a request down for military aid to restore and refresh the accounts in the Pentagon for conducting airstrikes in Kosovo, Congress said to the President: No, you are wrong about that, Mr. President, you didn't ask for enough money. We insist that you give $6 billion more. Mr. President, you shortchanged us in your request for defense, so we are going to give you what you ask for and we are going to add $6 billion more to your request for defense. 
   Well, gee, that came from conservatives. I hope those same conservatives will agree that the effort to save America's family farmers is as important. Don't tell me there is not money. There was money to say to the President we want to add $6 billion above what the Pentagon said it needed. If there is money to do that, there is surely money to invest in family farmers in rural America. So my hope will be that we are able, on a short-term basis, to pass an emergency bill; and, second, having done that, we will then revisit the question of the underlying farm program. 
   This farm program is not working. It ought to be apparent to everyone. The farm program that the Congress passed essentially said let us do whatever the marketplace says ought to be done. But there is not a free market in agriculture. 
   There is not now, and has not been, a free market in agriculture. Our farmers look at trade, and what they  find is that markets are closed to them in many corners of the world. So we raise a product we want to sell overseas and the markets are closed. Or if you raise, for example, beef, you will discover not only are the markets closed in some areas, but in other areas, such as Japan, you will pay a 45-percent tariff to get American beef into Japan, only to find out that the Canadian beef --both live cattle and hogs, and slaughtered beef and hogs--coming down is increasing at a very rapid pace. So we have grain and livestock coming in undercutting our markets. We find foreign markets are not open to us, and we have all of these trade negotiators running around doing trade agreements that have undercut our agriculture producers. 
   We need a farm program that works and trades policies that make more sense than the current policies. I voted against NAFTA and the United States-Canada free trade agreement, and I voted against the GATT agreement. I did all of that because I think that, while we need expanded trade, we do not, and should not, embrace trade agreements that are fundamentally unfair to rural America. 
   I recall when I was on the House Ways and Means Committee and the United States-Canada free trade agreement came to the committee, and the Trade Ambassador, who I won't name--Clayton Yeutter--said to us that the trade agreement itself would not result in a massive flood of Canadian grain coming across our border. I said, well, I think it will, and you know it will. ``Put it in writing,'' I said. The Trade Ambassador wrote to us on the committee guaranteeing that it would not happen. It wasn't worth the paper it was written on. 
   It happened, and it happened quickly. Not only did it happen--massive quantities of durum and spring wheat came across our border flooding our market, undercutting the market for American farmers--but we were then neutered in our ability to respond to it because he also traded away the remedies. So we didn't have a remedy for it. 
   That was in the United States-Canada free trade agreement. That passed the House Ways and Means Committee 34-1. I was the one. I didn't feel lonely a bit because I knew exactly what was going to happen with the agreement. Farmers' interests were traded away. In my judgment, we ought not accept trade agreements like that, whether it is United States-Canada, NAFTA, or GATT. 
   Speaking of NAFTA, after the United States-Canada free trade agreement, they negotiated NAFTA. The economists were telling us what a great deal it was. After the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, the trade surplus we had with Mexico turned into a big deficit in a short time. The trade deficit with Canada doubled in a short time. Instead of creating new jobs in this country, we lost massive numbers of jobs. All these economists who were predicting 300,000 jobs were just fundamentally wrong. We lost a lot of jobs as a result of that. 
   They said if we just pass these agreements, we will get from Mexico the product of low-skill wages. Do you know what we got? The three biggest products coming in from Mexico are automobiles, electronics, and automobile parts--all products of high-skilled labor. We now have more automobiles imported into this country from Mexico than the United States exports to all the rest of the world. That is what we got with NAFTA--again, undercutting our interests, hurting a lot of producers in this 
   country, and especially injuring family farmers. 
   Well, the point I am making is this: We had testimony this morning from folks who came from across the country to say we have a very serious problem in rural America. We can't fix that problem on a partisan basis. We need Republicans and Democrats together to agree that, No. 1, there is a farm crisis, and, No. 2, they are willing to do something about it, to respond on an emergency basis, and then to repair a farm program that is fundamentally deficient, which doesn't value family farming, a farm program that says it doesn't matter who farms. That, in my judgment, misses a lot of what is important in American life. 
   My hope is that in the next couple of days, as we offer amendments--Senator HARKIN, myself, and others--on an emergency basis, we will be able to strike a bipartisan agreement to do the right thing on behalf of family farmers. I know that it is a message that some get tired of hearing, perhaps, but I come from farm country and I care a lot about what is happening out in our part of the country. 
   North Dakota is a wonderful State. It has a lot of rural counties, and the fact is that not just family farmers but machinery and equipment dealers, Main Street businesses, and so many other people are suffering so much through this economic distress, even at a time when the rest of the country seems to be doing so well. 
   I had a letter from a young boy who talked about the distress his folks were going through while trying to hang onto their family farm. He said: My dad can feed 180 people, and he can't feed his family. He was talking about the fact that the family farm is so productive in this country, and they are losing so much money. You hear this over and over again. 
   This Congress, it seems to me, must respond. We are going to try to force that response, first with respect to the underlying agriculture appropriations bill with an emergency package, and, second, hopefully, to revisit and readdress the entire structure embodied in the underlying farm bill. 
   I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is the responsibility of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to consider treaties submitted by the President as soon as possible after their submission. Normally, most treaties are considered within a year of being submitted. The President of the United States transmitted the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty to the Senate on September 23, 1997. 
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has not held a single hearing on this important Treaty in the 639 days since the President sent the CTBT to the Senate for its consideration. In comparison, the START I Treaty was ratified in 11 months, the SALT I Treaty in 3 months, the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty in 4 months, and the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 3 weeks. 
   As of today, 152 countries have signed the CTBT, including Russia and China, and 37 countries have ratified the Treaty. The world is waiting for the United States to lead on this issue. I hope my colleagues will urge for this Treaty's rapid consideration.

   Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is talking now about specifics, and Senator DASCHLE was asking about clinical trials. 
   Let me ask another specific. Regarding emergency room treatment. Senator KENNEDY makes the point there is the Patients' Bill of Rights on this side and the Patients' Bill of Rights on that side. But they are not the same. There is a big difference. 
   Let me give an example regarding emergency room care. I told the story of a case of a woman named Jacqueline the other day. Jacqueline is a real person. She was hiking in the Shenandoah. While hiking in the Shenandoah, she slipped and fell down a 40-foot cliff. She fractured three bones in her body, including her pelvis. She was unconscious. She was medivac'ed by helicopter, taken to a hospital emergency room, and treated. She survived. 
   The HMO said: We don't intend to pay for your emergency room treatment because you didn't have prior approval to go to the emergency room. 
   This is a woman who was unconscious. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights that the AMA and so many other groups have endorsed--they have written in support--is different from the bill the majority party offers in the emergency room treatment in the sense that we require not only the ``prudent'' layperson standard in emergency care and emergency room, but we require also the poststability care that is necessary after you have been to an emergency room, and their bill does not do it.

   Mr. DORGAN. I just described a case of a woman being hauled into the hospital unconscious and being told: We can't pay your bill because you didn't get prior approval for emergency room treatment. 
   That is absurd. That is the kind of horror story that requires all Americans to believe we must pass a Patients' Bill of Rights that has teeth and works to solve real problems. 
   Isn't it the case, with respect to emergency room care, that we in this Congress have already given all senior citizens in the Medicare program exactly what is proposed in our bill with respect to emergency room treatment and poststability care? Isn't it the case that every Member of the Senate has already voted for that in Medicare, saying yes, that is the right thing to do; but when it comes to the Patients' Bill of Rights they say: We want to have a Patients' Bill of Rights, but on our emergency room care, we don't intend to offer that protection on not only emergency room care but also poststability care in a hospital after you get out of the emergency room; we don't intend to offer that, even though we have already done that and voted for it for Medicare patients. 
   I don't understand the contradiction; does the Senator from Massachusetts?

   Mr. DORGAN. I will respond, if the Senator will yield to me further, with the story I told on the floor of the Senate, about the woman who was also injured, whose brain was swelling and who was in an ambulance being taken to a hospital and who said to the ambulance driver, I do not want to go to X hospital. She named the hospital. I want to go to Y hospital farther down the road. This woman lying in the back of an ambulance with a brain injury said: I want to go to the hospital farther away. Why did she say that? Because she read that the hospital that was closest had made decisions about patients' care that were more a function of corporate profit and loss than they were about health care, and she did not want, with a brain injury, to be wheeled into the emergency room with the notion somebody was going to look at her and make a dollar-and-cents decision about her health care.

   Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I want to make a few opening comments as a member of the subcommittee. The Appropriations Committee is an interesting and a very productive committee. I am a member of the subcommittee that is chaired by Senator COCHRAN from Mississippi and whose ranking member is Senator KOHL from Wisconsin. I commend them for the job they do. It is not an easy job. 
   We have the classic problem of economizing. The definition by an economist of that is trying to fulfill unlimited wants with limited resources. That is not a very easy thing to do. 
   As I start, let me again compliment the work of Senator COCHRAN and Senator KOHL. 
   I will talk also about some of the challenges that we face that are not in any way addressed by this legislation. The legislation funds a range of issues with respect to the Department of Agriculture and agricultural programs. We need to do better in some of those areas. 
   I specifically mention the human nutrition study programs that exist in USDA. The administration had proposed a very substantial investment in those programs. We have not been able to meet that. I hope we can, because the work that goes on in those human nutrition labs is very important work in the nutrition area. 
   There are a number of other areas where we need to do better in research and agricultural-related areas, but I want to talk a bit about the crisis that faces our family farmers. We are going to have a Democratic Policy Committee hearing on Wednesday morning here in the Capitol from 9:30 to 11:30 on this subject: the farm crisis. We have a very serious problem on America's family farms. Frankly, we need to address it. I hope we can do that in a bipartisan manner. 
   This weekend I was in North Dakota. I drove to Finely, ND, for an event in the American Legion hall in Finely that had to do with a rural empowerment zone. Once again, in Finely, ND, as I would have found in every part of North Dakota, family farmers told me that they are not going to be able to make it much longer unless something changes. You cannot plant seeds in our ground, then tend those seeds, fertilize, spray for pests, hope they grow, hope it doesn't hail, hope the plants develop, hope it doesn't rain too much but rains enough, hope against crop disease and then, at the end, finally harvest that grain and take it to the elevator, only to discover that the elevator or the grain trader is willing to pay you a $1, $1.50 or $2 a bushel less than what it cost to produce the grain. That is not a formula for success. That is a formula for failure. Most family farmers know they will not last long with that kind of a formula. 
   Will Rogers once said: When there is no place left to spit, you either have to swallow your tobacco juice or change with the times. Well, there is no place left to spit. That is not a delicate way to say it, but there is no place left to spit on these issues. The current farm program is not providing price supports that are able to help family farmers continue in operation during a time of collapsed prices. It just isn't. We had to do an emergency piece last year, and we did that in the appropriations process. I commend all of those who were involved in it, including the Senator from Mississippi. My colleague from North Dakota, Senator CONRAD, myself and many others worked to make sure that we did an emergency piece that provided some income support for families during collapsed prices. But the prices are still collapsed. We will not have many family farmers left unless we provide some mechanism of supporting prices here in the Congress. 
   Is it our job? No, it would be better if we could get the price in the marketplace. But that is not happening. The price in the marketplace is dismal. Farmers are told that their hogs aren't worth much and their cattle are not worth much. The grain isn't worth much too. 
   There was a time when you could speak on the Senate floor when the farmer was hauling a hog to market and getting 10 cents a pound. In fact, that farmer could go to the grocery store in that small town and discover that it would cost him three times as much to buy a relatively small ham than he was able to get for the whole hog. 
   Now, there is something wrong with that. When prices collapse, if we want family farmers left in our country's future, then we have to do something about it. 
   My colleague from Minnesota talked about the need to reform the system. I was not able today to hear my colleague from Mississippi or my colleague from Wisconsin as they opened this discussion, but I know that they are well aware of the farm crisis. I will hold up a couple charts, if I might. 
   This chart shows the number of farm youth, down 82 percent since 1970, fairly steadily. We are ending up without any young people left in rural America. 
   This chart shows the last year for which we have net income data. It shows the change in net income, 1996 and 1997. We do not have the next 2 years. North Dakota lost 90 percent of its net income; Minnesota, 42 percent. These are net income losses. It would be interesting to know, I wonder how any wage earner would handle it if 90 percent of their income were gone. I wonder what Wall Street would do if they discovered that some industry of theirs had suffered a 90-percent loss. Think that would crash, that industry? You bet your life, in a moment. 
   But on the family farm, in 1 year a change in net income, down 38 percent in Nebraska, 28 percent in South Dakota, 90 percent in North Dakota, these figures change from year to year and State to State. The fact is, we have seen a dramatic change in net income in a negative way in my State and others. It results from a collapse in prices.  
   Now, there are people who say that is because EEP wasn't used. It is because of this or that other thing, 100 different reasons. The fact is, it is price. You can come up, I suppose, with your own notions of how to increase price in the marketplace, but I think we have a failure here. 
   The failure is that we have a farm program that says: Let us not care about supporting prices. Whatever the price in the marketplace place is, if it is 10 cents for hogs or if it is $2.50 for wheat, that is just tough luck. That is the way the market is. So let's have farmers get whatever they get from the marketplace. 
   The problem with that is, we won't have many family farmers left, if that is the attitude we take, because the marketplace doesn't work for agriculture. There is no free market for agriculture. Everybody knows it. Anybody that comes out here and preaches about a free market for agriculture is preaching a sermon that is not worth listening to. 
   Now, my colleague from Minnesota talked about the issue of monopolies. I want to talk about that just for a moment. I want to show a cartoon that appeared in the newspaper in Lincoln, NE, the Lincoln Journal Star. The cartoon shows something that I have previously spoken about on the floor of the Senate. The cartoon says: If the grain to make this costs pennies--talking about grocery cereal--and I have to pay $3.95, who gets all the rest? And here is a picture of a farmer giving up. 
   It is interesting that at a time when prices have collapsed for grain, cereal manufacturers have announced that they will increase the price of their cereal. I found it interesting that when grain prices increased a few years ago, wheat went to $5.50 a bushel, the cereal manufacturers were complaining that they had to increase cereal prices because grain prices were strengthening. So grain prices collapse, drop in half. What happens to cereal prices? They go up. What is wrong with that picture? It seems to me you would fail third grade math with that kind of calculation. 
   The point that the Senator from Minnesota made is an accurate point. In every direction the farmer looks, the farmer faces either a monopoly or a near monopoly. Let's say the farmer raises grain and wants to have it transported. So the farmer takes it to the railroad and the railroad operator says: We will transport that grain for you. And they tell the farmer exactly what it will cost. If the farmer doesn't like it, it is tough luck. 
   In our State, our State Public Service Commission says the railroads overcharge North Dakota, principally farmers but all businesses. They overcharge North Dakota farmers $100 million a year. How can they do that? No competition. We do not have three railroads vying for that business. When you have near monopoly or a monopoly, they charge what they want. So when the farmer goes to the grain trade and decides to sell their grain, what do they find? Only a few companies control most of the grain trade. 
   Two of those companies now want to get married. Continental and Carghill decided they like each other so much they don't want to compete anymore. They want to get together. So now they have this merger proposal, meaning more concentration. Does that make sense for farmers? To me, it doesn't. I do not think they ought to be allowed to merge. 
   Then when the farmers decide that they want to sell their fat steers--they had some calves and they raised some fat steers and heifers--they take them to market. Eighty-seven percent of the fat steer market slaughter in this country is controlled by three companies, three. So they tell the farmers and ranchers: Here is what we are going to pay you. 
   They say it is a free market. Of course, it is not free. So let's assume that the grain trade wasn't throttled at the neck of the bottle by a concentration of large corporations, and instead you had a free market. 
   Is it a free market for our producers, who raise a steer or heifer or cow and want to sell the beef to Japan, are faced with a 50-percent tariff because of a beef agreement with Japan, which does come down a little year by year, but snaps back up if you get more beef in? Currently, as I understand it, the tariff on beef going into Japan is 45 percent. Is that fair? I don't think so. 
   Or China sends us all their shoes and trousers and shirts and trinkets, and they have a $50 billion to $60 billion trade surplus with us, or we a deficit with them, and they say: When we want wheat, we want to buy it elsewhere; plus we want to keep part of your wheat out, and we don't want your hogs at all. Is that fair trade? Does a farmer have a right to complain about that? I think so. In every single direction, farmers have a right to say it is not a free market. 
   Let me mention trade. Our family farmers--despite having mentioned some trade with Japan and China, our family farmers are furious about our trade situation with Canada. We passed this NAFTA bill here in the Congress. I didn't vote for it, but everybody who voted for it, I guess, felt that the people who sold it said we were going to get some 300,000 new jobs in America with this NAFTA. 
   NAFTA turned a trade surplus with Mexico into a trade deficit very quickly and doubled the trade deficit we have with Canada. Now the fancy economists who decided they wanted to make money putting out studies telling us how wonderful NAFTA was going to be are saying: Maybe we were wrong. When you pass an agreement that creates huge deficits, lose jobs instead of gaining jobs, you are wrong. 
   But take a look at the trade back and forth across the border. What you will find with Canada is, we have massive quantities of Canadian grain coming in and undercutting our American farmers, and you can't get much American grain into Canada. I have been to the border there. I was riding in an orange truck trying to get durum wheat into Canada. I could not do it. But I saw Canadian trucks hauling Canadian wheat south. Is that fair trade? I don't think so. 
   That is what farmers face, unequal treatment. If you wipe all that away and just have farmers trade in the open market, free trade or fair trade, then when the farmer competes against the European grain or livestock producer in an international marketplace, how do you get around the fact that the Europeans subsidize their grain sales 10 times our subsidy--10 times? We say to our farmers, well, that is fair; it would be like a competition, let's give the other team a huge head start and then say it is a fair competition. 
   I don't know what people are thinking about. It is not fair. It doesn't make any sense. Our farmers in this country have a right to be very upset, because I don't think they have been supported very well by our range of policies, our agricultural and trade policies. They have not been fair and consistent. 
   On the United States-Canada free trade agreement, I was in Montreal when Clayton Yeutter was negotiating with Canada. I will tell you what happened with Canada. The U.S. agricultural interests got traded away--flat out traded away. This country got something for it. I wasn't in the room, but I guess we got access to 20-some million people for the financial services industry, and so this country got something for it. But farmers got traded way. So at the end of the time, we got an agreement that weakened section 22, all of our trade remedies, and then we got a piece of paper from Clayton Yeutter, the Trade Ambassador. I could read it, but generally the paper said we have essentially a spirit between us that, following the agreement, there will not 
   be a substantial increase in grain flowing across the border one way or the other. That wasn't worth the paper it was written on. It was a guarantee. 
   I was on the Ways and Means Committee; that is where this had to originate--the passing of the language on the agreement--and we got from the Trade Ambassador a guarantee that was worthless. We immediately began to see a massive quantity of grain coming into our country in a manner, in my judgment, that clearly violates our trade laws--dumping below the cost of acquisition. 
   Now, I know some of this is probably confusing and difficult. But I want to illustrate this point. The U.S. farmers said: Wait a second, this is not fair; we were told by our Trade Ambassador's office this wasn't going to happen. We have it in writing, we have a guarantee; this isn't fair. So action was taken against the Canadians to try to stop it.  
   Do you know what we discovered in that action? A side deal had been made between the Trade Ambassador's office and the Canadians that was never disclosed to Congress, never a part of debate. It gave to the Canadians, in selling into the American marketplace the ability to go below acquisition cost, the Canadians will not have to include their final grip payment--it is called a grip payment--to their farmers. 
   So what they did was set aside part of the cost of the acquisition of that grain and said that will not be considered. By definition, the formula says they can sell at below cost in this marketplace and they will not be in violation, because there was a separate side deal between our Trade Ambassador and the Canadians, in effect, selling out the interests of our farmers. 
   Do farmers have a right to be upset about that? Do they have a right to be concerned about policymakers who don't support our farmers' interests? You bet your life they do. Now, we have to decide in this Congress whether we are going to be willing to rebuild and invest and strengthen family farms. 
   Let me make this point. I am not at all bashful about coming to the floor and saying we need this help. We were just in a conference committee--I was part of it--in which the President said: We need some additional money for Kosovo. We need money for Kosovo. So Congress said: Well, how much do you need? The President said: Well, we need $16 billion. Congress said: No, you don't need that, you need more than that. So Congress added $6 billion to the President's request, saying: We don't think you have asked for enough money. If it is for defense, we don't think you have asked for enough money. There are those who said that the sky is the limit for defense. They said: The President didn't ask for enough, and we want to add $6 billion more. 
   I say to them, what about the issue of family farming in this country? What about the issue of agriculture? That is here at home. Those are our interests. That is not Kosovo. That is not bridges. That is not investment in weapons. That is here in this country. What about that? Is that not a priority? Are we not willing to decide that we will provide that resource? 
   Some say, well, the President should ask for it. Yes, he should, but the President didn't ask for the extra $6 billion Congress put in the emergency bill for defense. So apparently you have two standards. The President doesn't have to ask for the extra $6 billion for defense, but he must for agriculture. Well, those who say the President needs to be involved and ask for it, they are right. Let's have him do that. I want him to be engaged here with a request, and I think he will be.

   Mr. DORGAN. The share the farmer gets from the food dollar has diminished about 20 percent. 
   All the other interests that touch what the farmers produce make a lot of money, and many of them are making record profits right now. The farmer raises the grain; buys the tractor, plows the ground in the spring, tends the land; and takes all the risk. They harvest it and work hard. 
   Family farmers don't make much money. Now they are losing a lot of money. Even in the best of years they don't make that much money, taking into account all the unforeseen risks. They put the product on a railcar to market; it goes to a cereal manufacturing plant. The rail car company makes money and the railroad companies are making record profits. The grain trade makes profits. The grain goes to a cereal plant and they take that wheat and inject it with some air. Now it becomes puffed wheat. They package it in a bright colored, big box, with cellophane wrapping that can't be opened in the morning and they send it to a grocery store. 
   Farmers, last year, lost their shirt on the very same wheat that was puffed up by air and produced by the cereal manufacturers. The farmers lost their shirt; the cereal manufacturers make record profits. 
   Something is wrong. Those who haul it, those who trade it--every step along the way the big economic interests are making big profits. It is the folks who grow it that are told: No, somehow you don't matter. 
   On this Earth, every single month, we add another New York City in population; every single month we add another New York. Yet, the farmer is told by the grain trade--when the farmer loads the truck and takes it to the elevator--that this grain isn't worth very much; this food isn't worth very much. 
   We are told half a billion people go to bed every night with an ache in their belly and it hurts to be hungry. Most of them are kids. Half a billion go to bed every night with an ache in their belly because they are hungry. Far more people are malnourished than that. And we are adding a New Yorker to the City every month, yet we have farmers in Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, Mississippi, and Wisconsin going broke because they are told--after all of their work, all of their risk, all of their dreams--that the grain they produce doesn't have value. They load the truck, go to the elevator, and get the message. The message is, food doesn't have much value. 
   Within recent months, we had people come to Capitol Hill to testify about the famine in the Sudan. We had testimony by people talking about old women climbing trees to gather leaves to eat because there is nothing to eat, and our farmers are told: Your food has no value. 
   If we get past the question of, does food have value, there is a larger question. Who farms in this country, and does it matter? Family farmers are more than just planters. It is the family farm around my hometown of Regent, ND, that provides the blood vessels which make that small community live. It is the family farmer who helps build the church. It is the family farmer who helps keep the main street open. It is the family farmer who helps create a rural lifestyle. This is more than just a question of, does food have value; it is, who is going to farm in our country? 
   Some say: Let the corporations farm. They are fine; they can farm America from California to Maine. That is true. And we will have no population left in the middle part of our country. 
   This map demonstrates what is happening in the middle part of our country. The red represents the counties that have lost more than 15 percent of their population. You can see what is 
   happening. In the middle part of America, we are depopulating a significant part of our country. People are leaving, not coming. 
   I was in two different counties on Saturday in North Dakota. One county lost 60 percent of its population, and one of them had lost 50 percent of its population in the last 25 years.  
   Picture trying to do business in a small town, in an area that has lost 60 percent of its population. That is trying to do business in a depression. 
   It matters who farms--not just what is the return, what is the price of grain, but that we do we have a system that encourages family farming. Is the family, as an economic unit, something that has merit and value? Some say, let the market decide that. The market is not an allocator of all goods and services in a fair way at all times. There are times when we have to be a referee in the marketplace. 
   That is why we have had a farm program. If we hadn't had a farm program, we probably wouldn't have any family farmers now. When prices collapse and you have the valley, the only way family farmers get across the valley is by building a bridge called price support. Three or 4 years ago we were told: That is old fashioned; blow up the bridge. So Congress did--I didn't vote for that. It was called the Freedom to Farm bill. We blew up the bridge and pulled the rug from the family farmers. Let them go to the market. Whatever the grain trade says is the price, that is the market price. 
   We found out that is absurd. That doesn't work. China, Japan, Canada, Mexico, and Europe are engaged in the kind of trade practices that restrict our products, there are sanctions against food--some of which have, fortunately, been revoked--the farmer finds it can't sell into certain markets, it is locked out of about 11 percent of the international wheat market. 
   In my judgment, sanctions should almost never be put on. Hubert Humphrey used to say, send them anything they can't shoot back. It certainly makes sense to be able to send food to people who are hungry in the world. That has nothing to do with foreign policy or with guns. 
   When there is a sanction, certainly farmers should have been paid. Why should farmers bear the cost of this country's national security issues? We have had the sanctions, have had a range of other trade issues and farmers have always been the victims. 
   There is a way, it seems to me, for Congress, with both Republicans and Democrats to decide jointly that family farmers ought not continue to be victims in this country on trade policy or agricultural policy or policies dealing with market concentration. We need to do much better than that. Frankly, in recent years, I think we have let the farmers down. 
   This bill is an appropriations bill. There is much in it that is important. I say to the Senator from Wisconsin, your work and the work of Senator COCHRAN is very important work, as is the work of both staffs on the subcommittee. I was pleased for the first time this year to be able to join the subcommittee. It is an important subcommittee that makes critical investments in a wide range of agricultural issues. 
   At the end of the day, when all of this is clear, we must do something about prices for family farmers. If we don't do that, all of this other investment is not going to be very productive for our country. We must do something to address the question of price collapse. 
   We offered an amendment in the emergency supplemental bill a couple of months ago. Senator HARKIN and I offered that amendment. I recall, I think, it was midnight or so when Senator HARKIN was recognized to offer it. He spoke, I spoke, and several others spoke. Then we had a vote. We made the points, I and Senator HARKIN, about the difficult time in agriculture, the real crisis that exists at this point. The vote, I believe, was probably a vote on tabling or a vote up or down. We lost on a 14-14 tie vote, and that was only with the Senate conferees. 
   I know the Senator from Iowa is going to offer an amendment, and I certainly intend to join him during this appropriations process, to have a discussion about that amendment, about an emergency farm bill that puts some resources into rural America to try to respond to this farm crisis. 
   I am not now going to speak at much greater length on the amendment. I have more things to say, and I will say them at a more appropriate time. My expectation is this legislation will be on the floor for some while. I do want to speak at greater length about some of these farm issues, and my colleague from Iowa and others have a fair amount to say as well about these issues.

   Mr. DORGAN. I wanted to ask a question about the characterization that the Senator made with respect to the action that was taken to send the amendment to the desk. It is not an amendment of the agricultural interests here. I know the offering of the amendment--I sent the amendment at the request of Senator DASCHLE. I know that was not a surprise. Senator DASCHLE announced last Thursday it was going to happen if there was not some sort of understanding reached with the majority leader. 
   I wanted to say this. The underlying bill is very important, the agriculture appropriations bill. It does not, however, contain the emergency response to the farm crisis that we must add to it at some point here. I hope we will do it in a bipartisan way. But the interest that Senator DASCHLE has in trying to move forward with debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights doesn't in any way diminish the interest and importance of the agriculture appropriations bill.

   Mr. DORGAN. One additional question. I will not belabor the point, except I was with Senator DASCHLE, along with my colleagues, last Thursday. He made it clear to everybody here in the Capitol what his intention was for this week. There would not have been a need to submit this amendment today on any bill had there been an agreement last week. 
   But let me also say when we get to the agriculture appropriations bill, at some point there is going to be lengthy debate about the emergency response that we need to do with respect to this farm crisis. 
   Let me finally make this point. We will, I assume, at some point have a full debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. It will be a debate with amendments offered by both sides--not amendments 
   cleared by anyone, not amendments in which someone is being a gatekeeper and which people have an opportunity to say here is how we feel about this issue. That is going to happen sooner or later.

   Mr. DORGAN. I intend to support the legislation the Senator just described. The Senator from Pennsylvania described a condition with the steel industry that relates to, among other things, the lack of enforcement of trade laws. 
   In North Dakota, we don't produce steel. We don't have a foundry that produces a substantial amount of steel. We don't have steelworkers. However, we have farmers in almost exactly the same set of circumstances. At least part of that reason is because of bad trade agreements, or trade agreements that have not been enforced. 
   A number of Senators, I am sure, will support the initiative tomorrow. I think tomorrow is actually a vote on the motion to proceed. I believe it is important to stand up for our economic interests. 
   It is not about protectionism; it is about standing up for our country's economic interests and making sure we enforce trade laws. If someone is dumping in our country--whether it is steel or wheat--we ought to expect, as a steel industry or as family farmers, that our Federal Government will take action to enforce our trade laws. 
   I agree with the statement of the Senator from Pennsylvania. I think a number of Senators, tomorrow, will be in agreement on that basic premise. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, since I have a few minutes, I will speak about the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
   There was a piece in today's Washington Post which caught my eye, written by Mr. Paul Nitze, a former arms control negotiator and ambassador-at-large in the Reagan administration. It was coauthored by another gentleman. They made this point:  
   Approval of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty by the Senate is essential in order for the United States to be in the strongest possible position to press for the early enforcement of this vital agreement. Failure to act will undercut our diplomatic efforts to combat the threat from the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  
   I admit, I am not an expert in this area. I am not on the relevant committees, but I take a great interest in the question of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and delivery systems for nuclear weapons. 
   Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons known to mankind, the most destructive weapons that have ever been developed on this Earth. There are numerous reasons why nations in this world seek to develop nuclear weapons. They are considered by some nations as a measure of their standing and prestige in the world. Others view them as the ultimate insurance policy. But, in fact, the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the sheer number of nuclear weapons make this a pretty unsafe world. 
   The proposition has been, going back to President Eisenhower's time, that we ought to achieve a treaty banning the testing of nuclear weapons. In May of 1961, President Eisenhower said:  
   Not achieving a test ban would have to be classed as the greatest disappointment of any administration, of any decade, of any time, and of any party.  
   President Kennedy's speech at American University 36 years ago addressed the need for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. He said:  
   A test ban would help check the spiraling arms race in one of its most dangerous areas.  
   We must check the spiraling arms race. Since the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, the leaders of this Nation have worked and labored with other countries to fashion an agreement that would ban further testing of nuclear weapons. 
   Imagine their satisfaction if they could know that today 152 nations have signed such an agreement, including China and Russia. Although 152 nations have signed such an agreement, we have not yet acted on that agreement in the Senate, and it is my profound hope that sometime in the near future, in the next weeks or the next couple of months, in this summer of 1999, that the Senate will review, debate and vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   I have spoken a couple of times in this Chamber on this issue. I am not critical of anyone. There are strongly held views. I do not even know how the vote would go if we had this vote. But I feel very strongly we should have this debate and vote. 
   I have in this desk a reminder of the danger that existed in this country during the cold war that just ended with the old Soviet Union. I ask unanimous consent to show it to my colleagues.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a vial filled with chopped up copper. This copper came from the wiring of a nuclear submarine the Soviet Union used to operate on the high seas with missiles and warheads pointed at the United States. This submarine is gone. Its wiring has been chopped up. It was done so under an arms control agreement. We did not sink it. It was dismantled under an arms control agreement. 
   We must continue to work in every way to make progress in nonproliferation agreements and test ban treaties, and one of those steps of progress, I hope, with the cooperation of all our colleagues, will be to debate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in the next week, 2 weeks, month or 2 months, in the summer of 1999.

   Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am introducing today a piece of legislation called the Standardized School Report Card Act, along with my colleagues, Senator BINGAMAN and Senator BYRD. 
   Every 6 to 9 weeks every parent in this country who has children in our public schools gets a report card to tell him or her how that student is doing in school. 
   Rarely, however, do parents get a report card telling them how the school is doing for the students. 
   A number of States already do have school report cards--about 36, actually--but they vary around the country. Some have almost no information. Others are hundreds of pages long and very difficult to understand. Regardless, however, most parents never see a report card for their child's school. 
   I think it would be useful, and my colleagues do as well, to ask that there be a uniform or standardized school report card that will allow parents to understand what they are getting for the dollars they are investing in that school. What is their school doing versus the neighboring town's school? How are the schools in one State doing versus schools in another State? How can you compare what the parents and taxpayers are getting with respect to the dollars invested in education? 
   The Standardized School Report Card Act will require schools to report on eight key, basic areas in their report card and do so in an easily understandable manner. 
   The eight areas graded in the report cards would be: students' performance, attendance and graduation rates, professional qualifications of teachers, average class size, school safety, parental involvement, student drop-out rates, and access to technology. 
   Some might say this legislation is unnecessary because there are already some States that do have school report cards. As I have already indicated, that is true. However, the content varies widely, so they are not good tools for comparison. 
   In my home State of North Dakota, the State Department of Public Instruction has designed a school district profile that is published for each school district. It does include a lot of interesting information, but a numbers of areas that are required under this legislation are not covered at all. 
   My point is that we have a public education system in this country on which we spend a great deal of money. We send our young boys and girls to the classroom door, and we invest money, we build the schools, pay teachers, and buy the books. The question is, What do we get for all of that? 
   Most of the classrooms I have visited are led and taught by wonderful teachers. I am very impressed by many of the schools I have had an opportunity to visit across the country and especially in North Dakota. As a nation, when we spend $350 billion a year to provide an education to elementary and secondary students, parents and taxpayers need some uniform way to understand how there school is doing versus other schools. How is our State doing versus other States relative to the investments we are making in education? 
   That is the basis for the school report card legislation which I am introducing today. I am pleased to be joined by Senators BINGAMAN and BYRD in introducing this bill, and I hope others of our colleagues will join us in cosponsoring it.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will then, at the end of morning business, ask that morning business be extended if necessary. 
   I have waited to listen to my friend from Illinois, Senator DURBIN, and to add my voice to this call for a debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. What is the Patients' Bill of Rights? And why is it necessary? 
   The Senator from Illinois just described the invisible partner in the doctor's examining room or the hospital room. I want to read about this invisible partner because I think it is quite interesting. 
   A couple of years ago, we had a hearing here in the Congress on the House side. Late in the day, long after the television cameras had been packed up and the lights had been turned off and the crowd had left, a woman came to testify. 
   I want to read part of her testimony. She was a doctor. She said:  
   My name is Linda Peeno. I am a former medical reviewer and medical director for three managed care organizations. I wish to begin by making a public confession: In the spring of 1987, as a physician, I caused the death of a man. * * * * * 
   Although this was known to many people, I have not been taken before any court of law or called to account for this in any professional or public forum. In fact, just the opposite occurred: I was ``rewarded'' for this. It brought me an improved reputation in my job, and contributed to my advancement afterwards. Not only did I demonstrate I could indeed do what was expected of me, I exemplified the ``good'' company doctor: I saved a half million dollars! 
   Since that day I have lived with this act, and many others, eating into my heart and soul. For me, a physician is a professional charged with care, or healing, of his or her fellow human beings. The primary ethical norm is: do no harm. I did worse: I caused a death. Instead of using a clumsy, bloody weapon, I used the simplest, cleanest of tools: my words. The man died because I denied him a necessary operation to save his heart. I felt little pain or remorse at the time. This man's faceless distance soothed my conscience. Like a skilled soldier, I was trained for this moment. When any moral qualms arose, I was to remember: I am not denying care; I am only denying payment.  
   This from a doctor who served in a managed care organization, making the decisions about whether a patient and a doctor can continue to receive and provide care. That is the invisible presence in that hospital room--someone 1,000 miles away making a decision about profits and losses. This woman says: As a doctor, I caused a man's death and was rewarded for it. 
   Is this the way medicine should work? The Patients' Bill of Rights says no. Our bill says that every patient in our country, has the right to know all of their medical options, not just the cheapest treatment options. Today many doctors are gagged, told by the managed care organization, you dare not tell that patient what their range of medical options are, because we will not provide coverage for some of the more expensive ones, even though they might be the option that saves that patient's life. 
   Our Patients' Bill of Rights says let's correct that. Our Patients' Bill of Rights says, when someone is in need of an emergency room and needs medical treatment on an emergency basis, they have a right to get that care. 
   Not all managed care organizations say that is the case. Jacqueline Lee was hiking in the Shenandoah mountains. She tripped and fell off a 40-foot cliff. She had serious injuries from that  fall--fractures in her arms, pelvis, her skull. She was unconscious. She was airlifted by helicopter to an emergency room, unconscious, with fractures in many bones in her body. The HMO said it would not pay the more than $10,000 in hospital bills for Jacqueline Lee because she hadn't gotten prior approval for her emergency room treatment. 
   Think of that. Here is a woman hauled in on a gurney unconscious to an emergency room. The HMO says: Well, we won't pay that bill because you didn't get prior approval for emergency room treatment. 
   Is there a need for a Patients' Bill of Rights? Is there a need to correct this kind of thing? Of course there is. 
   Now, the Republicans say: We have a Patients' Bill of Rights. Yes, they do; they sure do. Their Patients' Bill of Rights covers some Americans, covers about 48 million Americans. But there are 113 million Americans who are not covered by their Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   The Senator from Illinois asked the question: Why can't we bring the bills to the floor and have a debate? The answer is, because some want to control every nuance on the floor of the 
   Senate. They want to control who speaks, when they speak, whether you can offer an amendment, what your amendment says. We have put up with that for far too long. 
   Speaking only for myself, we are done putting up with it. This is not the way the Senate works. The Senate doesn't have, as the House does, a Rules Committee that becomes the prison for all the amendments and then the warden decides which amendments get let out the door. That is not the way the Senate works. 
   I have just prepared an analysis of how the Senate has been handling these issues in recent years, compared with the history of the Senate. It is very interesting. Lately, the strategy is to bring a bill to the floor and do what they call ``fill the tree,'' so Senators can't offer any amendments. The only way you can offer an amendment is if the majority leader says: Let me see your amendment. If I like it, you get to offer it; if I don't, you can't offer it. 
   That didn't happen in the past in this Senate. That is not the way the Senate works. Somebody needs to tell the folks who run this place that we are not going to let them continue to run the Senate that way. We demand that the Patients' Bill of Rights be brought to the floor of the Senate, and we demand the right to offer our amendments. We demand the right to debate them. We say to those who seem to want to keep the doors locked on good public policy issues like this: If you intend to keep doing that, then you are not going to do much business around here. 
   While folks are brought into emergency rooms unconscious and told by HMOs: We won't pay because you didn't get prior approval, we are told we can't correct it with a Patients' Bill of Rights. While we have doctors who come to testify before the Congress and say: I am responsible for the death of a person because I withheld treatment and I was rewarded for it under the current system, we are told we don't have the time on the floor of the Senate to bring up a Patients' Bill of Rights, or, if we do have the time, we are going to demand that you get preapproval for your amendments by someone on the other side of the aisle who puts forward a bill that is just a shell. 
   This Senate is sleepwalking on important issues. We ought to do much better for the American people than to sleepwalk on issues dealing with health care and the Patients' Bill of Rights and education and so many other important issues. 
   I will come tomorrow to the floor to talk about the farm crisis. This Congress is sleepwalking on the farm crisis as well. 
   I would like to say to my friend from Illinois, the Patients' Bill of Rights should have been passed by the last Congress. We have been more than patient on this issue. 
   I ask the Senator from Illinois--I would be happy to entertain a question about the delay here--it seems to me there has been plenty of time to do this. There is just not the will by some to want this to come to the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. If I might also make the point, the Congress has 
   already said Medicare and Medicaid patients will get basic protections. Members of Congress get this protection in their own health care program. If it is good enough for all of those interests--and it is, and necessary--why is it not good enough for the 113 million Americans whom the Republicans say ought not get this help with their Patients' Bill of Rights?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer support for the legislation that is brought to the floor this afternoon and to make a few comments about the legislation itself. Let me especially comment on the subject of steel. 
   I come from a State that doesn't produce any steel. North Dakota is predominantly an agriculture State. But the roots of the problems that confront our steel industry, in many ways, are common to the roots of the problems that confront a number of industries in our country today, especially and including family farmers. 
   I haven't heard the news this afternoon, but I understand that the monthly trade deficit results are to be announced today. My expectation is that the announcement today will conclude that we have another record monthly trade deficit, probably the fourth in a row, probably $20 billion that we have gone in the hole in this country in our trade relations. This probably amounts to somewhere between $250- to $300 billion a year just in trade in goods and services. The deficit in trade in goods will be much higher than that, perhaps over $300 billion. 
   What does that mean? It means that this country has to borrow in order to finance its trade deficit. It means, at least in the field of economics, to the extent there are any certainties, that this country will have to repay this trade deficit at some point in the future through a lower standard of living. Is it a problem? Is it of concern? Apparently not to many people, because there is not much discussion about it. I think it is a very serious concern to this country. 
   People make the point that we have a good economy and we have prospered. That certainly is the case. Unemployment is very low. Inflation is almost nonexistent. Believe me, the Federal Reserve Board is on its hands and knees with magnifying glasses searching for signs of inflation. If they don't  exist, the Board will try to find them. They are so concerned about it. But homeownership is nearly at a record high; new housing starts are nearly at a record high. There is a lot of good news in this country's economy. 
   But there are clouds on the horizon because of this trade deficit, a record high trade deficit. And it is rising rapidly. We have a trade deficit with China that is very substantial; an annual trade deficit with Japan somewhere in the neighborhood of $50- to $60 billion--in fact, about the same level with China. We have a trade deficit with Canada, a trade deficit with Mexico, and the list goes on. 
   Some come to the floor and say, well, we must be required to compete. I say, absolutely. If the family farmers I represent can't compete with others in the world, then we are not going to make it. But the question is not, will we or shall we compete; the question is, what are the rules of competition? How do we compete? Are we to say, let's tie our hands behind our backs? Then we will see how well we do. Is that competition? 
   For example, you run a manufacturing plant in this country, and you produce widgets. We say: You must compete with all other widget makers in the world. By the way, you have to pay a living wage, a minimum wage. By the way, you cannot dump your chemicals into the rivers and into the air. By the way, you cannot hire 10-year old kids. By the way, you can't pay them 14 cents an hour. And, by the way, your factory must be safe. 
   Well, the widget maker says: Well, we know that we fought about that for 75 years and lost all those fights. We have to pay a minimum wage. We have to have safe workplaces. We have to abide by child labor laws. We have to abide by antipollution laws, and we don't like it. So what we are going to do is pole vault right over this geographical barrier and go to another country somewhere else in the world. We are going to hire kids. We are going to pay them peanuts and put them in unsafe plants. We intend to dump our chemicals in the air, and we intend to pollute the streams. We are going to produce the same widgets, and we are going to send them back to Pittsburgh, Fargo, Los Angeles and Kansas City and sell 
   them there. 
   I ask the question: Is that fair competition? Is that what people mean by competition? You must be able to compete, and if you can't compete, quit? You must be able to compete, and if you cannot compete, go broke? Is that fair competition? 
   The answer is, of course, it is not fair competition. We have fought for three quarters of a century in this country over these issues. People died on the streets from gunfire, marching for their rights as workers to organize for better wages, for safer working conditions, for all of these issues. 
   Now, some say: But it is a global economy; you just don't understand. Competition now is not with the rules that we would describe as reasonable. The rules are whatever you can find anywhere in the world if you are a producer. That represents fair competition? 
   Where I come from, that is not fair competition. 
   I frankly admitted, when I started, I do not know much about the steel industry. We do not produce steel in my State. I do not expect we will in the future ever see a strong economy that does not have manufacturing activities in automobiles and steel and other things that represent the central tenets of a strong economy. I don't think you can decide that you will have a strong economy if your manufacturing base is gone. 
   I get in the car and turn on the radio and drive to work. The news report on the radio tells about America's economic health. It is always about what we consume, not what we produce. It is always about the economic health as measured by what we consumed last month. Consumer spending is up. Spending is this; spending is that. 
   That is not a sign of economic health. What you produce is a sign of economic health. What you produce determines who you are and how you are doing. 
   I find it interesting--I know Mr. Greenspan is on the Hill today testifying, and I know Wall Street will weigh every word he says for some nuance about what the Fed might do with interest rates. The stock market will rise or fall like a bobber in the ocean, based on what Mr. Greenspan says. 
   You ask Mr. Greenspan, and he will have to admit it--so will the governors of the Federal Reserve Board--does a heart attack or a car accident represent economic growth to an economist? The answer is, of course. Heart attacks and car accidents represent economic growth in the data that economists use to determine how well our country is doing. Because a car accident means someone must fix a fender; a heart attack means someone is employed in emergency rooms. 
   So you ask yourself: What do these economists tell us? What do they mean? What does it say about our country? What do they measure? 
   Family farming is why I came to the floor today. Family farming suffers, too. We have steel manufacturers in trouble and going out of business. We have people being laid off. So the Senator from West Virginia says we ought to be concerned about that. We should. 
   Is a steel plant like a harness for a two-hitch team, destined to be gone forever from the landscape of this country because it can be done elsewhere much less expensively? I don't think so. I don't think anyone in this country would suggest that our country--with the kind of economic power and might that we have--is a country that ought to do without a strong manufacturing sector or a country that ought to do without a strong steel manufacturing capability. 
   Then what about farming? When we talk about farming, people say: Well, the farmer must compete. It is agriculture, some monolith called agriculture. 
   It is not that in my State. It is families. It is not just families planting some wheat that they hope to harvest in the fall. It is families that live out on the land, that help create a small town, that help provide economic sustenance on that main street, 
   that organize the church, that support the school, that support the charities. That is what family farms are all about. Some people may say that you can get rid of all of those families. America will be farmed. Corporate farms can farm America from California to Maine, hardly stopping to put some gas in the large tractors they would use to pull those plows. But it would not be the same because corporate farming isn't going to stop at a small town in Hettinger County to say: Let me help form that church, or that school, or help nurture Main Street, or help with a lifestyle that really breeds family values. 
   I hear people stand and talk about family values all the time on the floor of the Senate. There is nowhere in this country that nurtures family values any better than on the family farm. I am not saying they are better than anybody else, but I am saying that families living in the rural reaches of our country, with a yard light illuminating that life, they are the ones who really do it alone--except when there is trouble, all of their neighbors are there to help. That is the way farmers in a rural neighborhood are. 
   We will lose something very important in this country if we decide that family farmers don't matter. A North Dakota author named Critchfield wrote a good number of books. He was a world-renowned author who came from Hunter, North Dakota, a tiny town near Fargo. He wrote a book called ``In Those Days.'' It is the finest book I have ever read about small-town life and the rural lifestyle--a wonderful book. He wrote his next book about the rural lifestyle in a different way, and he said something I never really thought much about before. He talked about the nurturing of values, family values, the nurturing of shared responsibility, and caring. This country really always had its roots in rural America; it would roll from the farm to the small town to the big city as America grew. We have lost farmers who have moved to small towns and who have moved to big cities. We have had a refurbishment of the value system of our country coming from its seedbed in rural America. I wonder what would happen at some point if we decide that that seedbed of family values in rural America really doesn't matter, that America can as easily be farmed by large corporate enterprises with no lights and no homes and no stopping in small towns. 
   Well, this discussion today is about steel and oil, but especially about  steel. I am talking about agriculture because I want to talk about the common thread that exists on these issues. I just heard my colleague from Arizona speak, and he is a close friend and someone whose views I admire. We have disagreed from time to time. On this issue of trade, we find ourselves in somewhat different camps, I think, because we probably see it a bit differently. I don't, for a moment, dispute that it is a global economy. The times are changed. But I also believe that this country has every right, on behalf of its producers, to decide it will fight for values such as fair wages and safe workplaces and a good environment--to fight for those things that we have fought for in this country for over 75 years. We have a right also to fight for that in our international trade agreements. We regrettably do not do that. 
   Our country, interestingly enough, has a leadership position on trade matters. We go out and negotiate a lot of trade agreements. Did you know that we almost never enforce an agreement? My biggest complaint with our trade officials is that they negotiate bad agreements. If that weren't bad enough, they fail to enforce even the bad agreements. Go down to the Department of commerce, where they are required to enforce trade agreements, and ask yourself how many people in this Government, in the Department of Commerce, are around with the responsibility of enforcing our trade agreements with China. Does anybody know? Or Japan? Anybody know? I will tell you the answer. Six or seven people are tasked at the China desk with enforcing our trade 
   agreements with China. It is the same with Japan. We have a nearly $60 billion trade deficit with China, and about the same with Japan, but slightly less. We have a handful of people whose job it is to enforce our trade agreements. Why? Because our mindset has always been to go negotiate new agreements because we want to trumpet the success in negotiating a new agreement, but we don't want to mess around with enforcing the old ones. That results is a lot of folks who are angry, because the last trade agreement that was negotiated was not a very good one and, in any event, it wasn't enforced. 
   So we ended up with a trade agreement called NAFTA, the North American Fair Trade Agreement, with Canada. A miserable agreement. It turned a trade surplus that we had with Mexico into a big trade deficit. It doubled the trade deficit we had with Canada. I know it will tire anybody who has heard me say it, but not long after the trade agreement with Canada, we had a flood of Canadian grain coming across our border and undermining the market for our family farmers. Our State university said it cost our farmers in North Dakota over $200 million in lost income. 
   I drove up to the border with a fellow named Earl in an orange truck that was about 10 years old. In this 10-year-old orange two-ton truck we took a couple hundred bushels of durum wheat. We saw 18-wheel trucks coming in our direction that were full of Canadian grain coming south. On a windy day, the grain trucks drop a lot of grain on the road. Our windows were getting hit all along the way by Canadian grain dropping off the huge semi trucks coming south. After seeing dozens of them, we pulled up to the Canadian border with Earl and his orange truck and a couple hundred bushels of durum wheat, saying we want to take this North Dakota durum into Canada, knowing that millions of Canadian bushels are flooding into our country. Earl Jensen and I didn't get across the border with that durum wheat because you could not get it into Canada. Our border was open to the Canadian grain producers, flooding our country and undercutting our markets, but their border wasn't open to us. Another fellow who was with us brought along some beer. That is, after all, liquid barley. Beer comes from, in most cases, barley, and you liquefy barley. He was going to take barley, in liquid form, into Canada. No, you can't do that. How about a used clothes washer? Can't do that. The list goes on. 
   I sat up at that border understanding firsthand why our farmers have a right to be so angry. Who on earth would negotiate a trade agreement with Canada that says let's have a one-way circumstance across the board? You can bring all your products south and flood us with your grain, but, by the way, when your little orange truck comes north with Earl and Byron, we are not going to let you through. That is not fair competition. That is not the trade relationship we expect that would result in fair competition. So my experience is that we have a right, it seems to me, in our country, to be mighty upset about the current circumstances that exist for family farmers and unfair trade agreements or in trade agreements that even if they were fair are not enforced. We have a right to be upset with respect to the circumstances with steel. My colleague who spoke previously said undoubtedly there may be dumping of steel. I will bet there is. I guarantee you there is dumping of grain in this country. 
   I asked the GAO to get the data from Winnipeg and Montreal. Those folks thumbed their nose and said: Do you think you are going to get that out of us? Not in a million years. We don't intend to give you one figure with respect to the sales we are doing secretly in this country. That's the Canadian Wheat Board. That would be illegal in this country, selling at secret prices in this country. They said to GAO that there is not a chance, you are not going to get numbers out of us. 
   Is there a reason for people to be angry and sore about this? Of course. Do American producers have a right to ask the question of whether this country will stand up for fair trade? I am absolutely full up to my neck with folks who say that anybody who speaks the way I just spoke is a protectionist. I want to plead guilty to saying that I want to protect our economic interests and demand fair competition. If that is what being a protectionist means, I will plead guilty. In fact, I demand credit. I want to protect this country's economic interests. I also believe in expanded trade and trade relationships that are growing and are healthy. I believe in and demand and expect fair trade relationships. I expect our trade negotiators not to go out and lose in the first 24 hours of every single negotiation. 
   The Senator from Texas is on the floor. There is a lot of beef in Texas. We had a big beef agreement with Japan 20 years ago. You would have thought we had won the Olympics when we announced we had this beef agreement with Japan. Everybody celebrated. Guess what? We are getting more beef into Japan. More American beef is going into Japan. But there is now a 50-percent tariff on American beef going to Japan. They negotiated a 50-percent tariff. That will be ratcheted down over time, but it snaps back with increased quantity. 
   Would anyone here ever expect we would have a 45-percent tariff on a product and not be ridiculed in the world community by it? That is exactly what we negotiated with Japan. It was declared a success. Our trade negotiators thought it was just great. 
   We have such lowered, dimmed expectations of our trading partners that we don't even try. Part of that is because for the first 25 years after the Second World War almost all of our trade relationships were about foreign policy. We could beat anybody with one hand tied behind our back. It was easy. We negotiated trade relationships that were almost exclusively foreign policy initiatives. But in the second 25 years, it was different. For that reason, as better competitors developed--Japan, Europe, China, and others--our trade negotiators didn't change much. Most of our trade negotiating is still disguised as foreign policy, regrettably. It is not fair to our producers. 
   That is why the initiative was brought to the floor today with respect to steel. We don't produce steel in North Dakota, but I am well aware of unfair trade. I am well aware of the inability to provide remedies and to seek remedies for unfair trade. Certainly our producers understand that every day in every way they have to face unfair competition, and no one seems willing or able to do anything about it. 
   That is the frustration. It is a frustration, in my judgment, that produces the kind of proposition that is brought here to the floor of the Senate today. Is it a reasonable, modest proposition? Yes. Is it a proposition that jumps over the ditch here on this? No. Of course, it is not. It is not that at all. It is modest, in my judgment, reasonably thoughtful, and is something Congress should pass.  
   The reason I took the time to come to the floor is to say this: Following this legislation, we will come in next week to the floor of the Senate once again on the subject of family farmers. Family farmers are now in a circumstance where they are facing Depression-era prices and are going out of business in record numbers. 
   It is almost impossible to go to a meeting in farm country and listen to those farmers, who have invested their lives and their dreams and their hearts in that land, who stand up and pour out their souls and then begin to get tears in their eyes when they talk about being forced off the land they love. 
   I told my colleagues recently of the woman who called me and said her auction to sell her family farm produced on that day a circumstance where her 17-year-old refused to get out of bed--refused to come down and help her with the auction sale. She said it wasn't because he is a bad kid, or it wasn't because he was lazy; it was because he was so heartbroken that he wasn't going to be able to farm that he just could not bear to be present at the auction sale of their farm. His dad had recently died. They were forced to sell, and he simply couldn't bear to watch the sale of that family farm. 
   A 6-foot-4-inch fellow stood up at a meeting. He had a beard. He was a big, burly guy. He said his granddad farmed. He farmed. He said his dad farmed. It was in their blood. Then his chin began to quiver, and his eyes began to water. But he said: I am going to have to sell out. He would like to continue, and he couldn't. And he couldn't continue to speak, because this is more 
   than just a job. It is a lot more than just the term ``agriculture.'' 
   Again, I come to the floor to talk about family farming, because this question today relates to what we are going to talk about--agriculture, and fundamentally unfair trade policies that undermine our family farmers for which there is no remedy. 
   You go to the trade ambassador's office to seek a remedy. You go to the Commerce Department to seek a remedy. I guarantee you, industry after industry, you can prove the dumping, and you will not get relief. You will not get a remedy. That is, in my judgment, the weakness and the shortcoming of our trade laws. 
   Let me end by saying again that we must find a foreign home for almost half of what we produce in a State like North Dakota. I am not someone who wants to shut borders or restrict trade, but I darned well insist on behalf of the producers that I represent, just as the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from New Mexico insisted today, I insist that this country stand up for the economic interests of its producers, at least demanding fairness and competition in international affairs. As we deal with a global economy, we ought to be able to provide that kind of fairness for American producers. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the chairman and ranking member of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, Senators DOMENICI and REID, for the extraordinary work they have accomplished in bringing the FY2000 energy and water appropriations bill to the floor. While this bill funds a number of vastly important national security and economic development programs and initiatives, until this year it has been relatively non-controversial, in part because of the hard work of my colleagues, Senators DOMENICI and REID. 
   This year, however, they have had to operate under more difficult circumstances. They have had to fashion a bill from extremely limited resources. As reported by the Appropriations Committee, the bill provides $21.2 billion in new budget authority--$12.6 billion within defense activities and $8.6 billion within nondefense. In the defense accounts, that represents a $220 million increase over the President's budget request. In the nondefense accounts, however, it represents a reduction of $608 million from the request. This includes decreases in funding for critical water projects. 
   As the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee noted in his opening remarks on Monday, this is the first time in his memory--and he has been here many years longer than this Senator from North Dakota--that less funding for water projects is provided than requested in the budget. This is a worrisome situation for many important and worthwhile flood control and other projects in the coming year, but that is also a situation forced upon this subcommittee, indeed on most subcommittees, by the allocations received as a result of staying within the budget caps. 
   He also noted that he was unable to accommodate all of the funding requests of the members of this body. That was the case with this Senator, but I do want to note that he and his distinguished ranking member were able to fund a number of important flood control and water development projects in my home state of North Dakota. 
   For instance, as the city of Grand Forks continues its recovery from the devastating 1997 floods of the Red River, the city and State have developed a plan to reconstruct flood control dikes to protect the cities of Grand Forks, ND, and East Grand Forks, MN, from future floods. The city and State are matching Federal funds for this project, but this bill provides $9 million in federal funds for initial construction. 
   It also funds the President's request of $27 million for the Garrison Diversion project as well as over $2 million in additional funds requested by me and Senator CONRAD for unmet water supply needs on our Indian reservations. The tribes have already reached their funding ceiling under existing authority for these needs and the Bureau of Reclamation has documented over $200 million in critical unmet water development needs on three reservations. These funds will begin to make a dent in these needs. 
   I am also pleased that the bill recommends $1 million for the Energy and Environmental Research Center, EERC, to conduct research relating to the integration of biomass with fossil fuels in conventional power systems to increase busload renewable electricity generation; development of practical methods for using biomass in advanced power systems; and improvement of efficiency and environmental performance in agricultural processing and forest-based product industries producing food, fiber, and chemicals. These funds will build upon the exciting research already being conducted at the nationally recognized EERC in Grand Forks. 
   The bill funds the President's request of $5 million to purchase of easements and compensate landowners who in the Buford-Trenton area are unable to farm as a result of flooding and high water tables caused by siltation upriver from the Garrison Dam. In 1998, more than 1000 acres remained under water and represented an economic loss to the farmers and others in this area of hundreds of thousands of dollars. This year, the water level is higher and only continues to grow. This is a Federal responsibility and one which is only beginning to be met. The project was authorized in the 1996 Water Development Act at $34 million and this represents continued progress for buying easements from willing sellers. 
   Finally, I appreciate the subcommittee's support for an amendment offered by me and Senator CONRAD to add $50,000 for a reevaluation study of the Grafton dikes project by the Army Corps of Engineers. Because the project was de-authorized, this report is needed. While not reauthorizing the project, these funds will help us jump start the process once the project is reauthorized. 
   Our water supply and flood control needs in North Dakota are many and growing. Not all of our requested needs are met by this bill, but this is a good bill and one I can support. I thank Chairman DOMENICI and Ranking Member REID for their support and look forward to working with them in conference. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was listening to the Senator from Pennsylvania as I was coming through the Chamber. I want to propound a question. 
   I do not think there is much disagreement in this Chamber as to whether anybody ought to put their mitts on the Social Security funds. Those are dedicated taxes that go into a trust fund and should only be used for Social Security. I must say, several years ago, we had an incredible debate in this Chamber on amending the Constitution. It was the case that those who wanted to amend the Constitution to require a balanced budget were saying, put in the Constitution a provision that puts the Social Security funds, along with all other operating revenues of the Federal Government, into the same pot. Many of us were very upset about that and stood on the floor day after day saying that was the wrong thing to do; you ought not put them in the same pot.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me just propound a question. But before I do, let me state to the Senator from Vermont that I am a cosponsor of what he is trying to do. I think what he is trying to do is very important. 
   I regret that we found this parliamentary situation that created a point of order. I don't quite know how one gets out of this at this point. I regret that the Senator felt that he had to withdraw the amendment, but I think what he and I and others are trying to do makes a lot of sense in terms of investment for this country and investment in the future with alternative energy resources. It is very important, especially because some of the programs show such great promise for our country's future. 
   I regret that we are not able to proceed with his amendment. I think the offset is appropriate. I think the amendment would advance this country's energy interests. I know because of the press of time that folks want to move forward. I will not say more except to say that I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Vermont on this. I hope this is not the end of it. I hope that perhaps by this process by committees in the Senate and in the House we can find a way to do what the Senator and I and so many others want to do.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a piece of legislation on behalf of myself, Mr. WELLSTONE, Ms. SNOWE, and Mr. JOHNSON. These three Senators, and I hope others as well, have joined me in introducing this bill, the International Prescription Drug Parity Act, today. 
   This piece of legislation deals with the question of prescription drugs. By consent of the Chair, I would like to show on the floor of the Senate today examples of the issue that is addressed by this piece of legislation. 
   With your consent, I will show two bottles of the drug Claritin, a medication most people are familiar with. Claritin is a popular anti-allergy drug. These two bottles contain the same pills, produced by the same company, in the same strength, in the same quantity. One difference: a big difference in price. This bottle is purchased in the United States--in North Dakota, to be exact. This bottle of 10  milligram, 100 tablets cost North Dakotans $218, wholesale price. This bottle--same drug, same company, same strength, same quantity--was purchased in Canada. They didn't pay $218 in Canada; they paid $61. Why the difference for the same drug, same dosage, same quantity, same company? In Canada, it costs $61; U.S. consumers pay $218. 
   Here is another example--and I have a lot of examples. But with the consent of the Chair, I will only use two today. 
   This is Cipro, a prescription drug to treat infections. Both bottles are made by the same company. We have the same number of pills, 500 milligram, 100 tablets--same drug, same company, same pill. In North Dakota, the wholesale price for this bottle is $399; in Canada, it is $171. The North Dakotan pays--or the U.S. consumer pays because this is true all over our country--$399, or 233 percent more than for the same drug in Canada. The question is, Why? The question is, With a global economy, why would a pharmacist simply not drive up to Canada and buy the same drugs and offer them for a lower price to their customers? The answer to that is, there is a law that restricts the importation of drugs into this country, except by the manufacturers of the drug themselves. That is kind of a sweetheart law, it seems to me. We want to change that. 
   If the manufacturer that produces these pills has been inspected by the Food and Drug Administration and the same drugs are marketed everywhere, why on Earth, in a global economy, cannot our consumers access a lesser price? Incidentally, this pricing inequity does not just exist with Canada; it is the same with Mexico, Germany, France, Italy, England, Germany--you name it. It is true around the world. We pay a much higher price for most prescription drugs than consumers anywhere else in the world. The United States is the consumer that pays a much higher price for the same pill, in the same bottle, produced by the same manufacturer. 
   With our bill we say, let's decide that what is good for the goose is good for the gander. If the pharmaceutical companies can access the raw materials which they use to produce their medicine from all around the world and produce a pill and put it in a bottle, it seems to me that the customer here in the United States ought to also benefit from free trade, as long as the drug is FDA approved and comes from a plant that is inspected by the FDA. 
   The drug industry will say that safety is an issue. It is no issue with respect to my bill. Safety is not an issue here at all. I am saying--and my colleagues are as well--if medicine approved by the FDA and produced in a plant inspected by the FDA is to be marketed around the world, but the American is to pay the highest price--in some cases by multiples of four and five --let us use the global economy to let U.S. pharmacists and prescription drug distributors access that medicine wherever it exists at a lower price, and pass along those savings to American consumers. 
   Back in 1991, the General Accounting Office studied 121 drugs and found that, on average, prescription drugs in the United States are priced 34 percent higher than the exact same products in Canada. I just did a comparison of the retail prices on both sides of the border of 12 of the most prescribed drugs, and discovered that, on average, U.S. prices exceeded the Canadian prices by 205 percent. 
   I mentioned before that Claritin costs the American consumer 358 percent more. We American consumers pay 358 percent more than the consumer does north of the border. And incidentally, the Canadian prices have been adjusted to U.S. dollars. Does this make sense? Of course not. Studies show that the same drug that costs $1 in our country costs 71 cents in Germany, 65 cents in the United Kingdom, 57 cents in France, and 51 cents in Italy. All we are saying is that if this global economy is good for companies that produce the drugs, it ought to be good for the consumer. 
   In 1997, the top 10 pharmaceutical companies had an average profit margin of 28 percent. The Wall Street Journal reported that profit margins in the drug industry are the ``envy of the corporate world.'' The manufacturers produce wonderful medicines, and I am all for it. But I want them at an affordable price for the American consumer. I am flat sick and tired of the American consumer being the consumer of last resort who pays a much higher price than anybody else in the world for the same drug, in the same bottle, produced by the same company. It doesn't make sense. 
   Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?

   Mr. DORGAN. Let me go for another minute, and then I will yield to my colleague from Minnesota, who will have 7 minutes remaining on the 15 minutes. 
   As I have indicated, Senator JOHNSON from South Dakota and Senator SNOWE from Maine are also cosponsors. We expect other cosponsors to join us. Frankly, the reason we have introduced this legislation is that there is an unfair pricing practice that exists with respect to prescription drugs in this country. 
   It is fundamentally unfair for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to say that we will produce a drug, and, by the way, when we decide to sell it we will sell it all around the world, but we will choose to sell it to the American consumer at a much higher price than any other customer in the world. 
   That is unfair to the American consumer. 
   What prevents the local corner pharmacist from going elsewhere to buy these prescription drugs in France or in Canada or elsewhere? A law that says you can't import a drug into this country unless it is imported by the manufacturer. What a ridiculous piece of legislation that was passed over a decade ago. 
   If this global economy works, let's make it work for the consumers and not just for the big companies. 
   Our legislation only pertains to this circumstance: If the drug has been approved by the FDA and the facility where that drug is bought are inspected by the FDA, then those drugs have a right to come into this country not just by the manufacturer but by local pharmacists and distributors who want to access that drug at a less expensive price in other parts of the world and pass along the savings to American consumers. That makes good sense to me. 
   I have a lot more to say, but I will say it at a later time. I yield my remaining time to my colleague, Senator WELLSTONE from Minnesota, who is joined by Senator JOHNSON of South Dakota and Senator SNOWE of Maine as cosponsors of this legislation.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might just make a comment to the Senator from Minnesota, all of us have the experience of going around our States and talking to especially senior citizens, who take a substantial amount of prescription drugs--many of them wonderful, lifesaving drugs but at a substantial cost. Many of them have no health insurance coverage for these costs. 
   Let me say at the outset, lest anyone think I don't appreciate what goes on, that the research done at the Federal level and the research done by the pharmaceutical companies have produced lifesaving, remarkable medicines. I commend all of those folks for that, including these companies. I am only debating the price issue here. 
   I ran into a woman one day. She was in her eighties. She had heart disease, diabetes, and was living on somewhere around $400 a month of total income. She said to me: Mr. Senator, I can't afford to take the drugs the doctor says I must take for my heart difficulties and for my diabetes. What I do is buy the drugs, and then I cut the pills in half and take half of the dose so it lasts twice as long. It is the only way. Even then I can hardly afford to pay for food. 
   That is what the problem is here. The problem is that these pharmaceutical drugs are overpriced relative to what every other consumer in the rest of the world is paying for them. I am talking of other consumers in France, in Germany, Italy, England, Canada, and Mexico--you name it. That doesn't make any sense to me. Why should our senior citizens--all consumers for that matter--be paying 300-percent more for the same drug in virtually the same bottle produced by the same company inspected by the FDA than a consumer 20 miles north in Canada is paying? 
   I just came from a meeting near the border of North Dakota and Canada. I was talking to people, again, about that disparity. The Senator from Minnesota has exactly the same situation. 
   The pharmacists at the corner drugstore are saying: Why can't I go up there and buy some of these medications? I know that it is the same pill which comes from the same plant. 
   The reason is the law prevents him from bringing it back, and we want to change that.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am not going to offer an amendment to this bill. In fact, I am a member of the subcommittee and I commend the Senator from Alaska, Mr. STEVENS, and the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. INOUYE, for their leadership and work on this legislation. I am pleased to work with them on a range of issues that deal with the defense of this country and with the strengthening of the Armed Forces. I think they do an excellent job. 
   There is one area--and not just on this legislation--of the policy debate in Congress I wanted to mention during the discussion on funding, and that is the area of national missile defense. I do have some concerns about the policy and direction of national missile defense. I wanted to express them now because I think this is the appropriate place. 
   I don't quarrel with the question of research for national missile defense. We have been involved in a robust research program on missile defense. Hopefully, that research, at some point, will bear fruit sufficient that if a threat exists that would persuade us to deploy, we would deploy a national missile defense system that is a workable system and one that provides real and significant protection to our country. 
   Last week--I think perhaps it was a week ago tomorrow--I was driving on a road up in far northeastern North Dakota. I looked to my left and I saw this huge concrete structure. It is, of course, the only antiballistic missile system that was ever built in the free world. It was built in the late 1960s, early 1970s. It was built in Nekoma, ND, up in the northeastern corner of our State. The very month it was declared operational it was also mothballed. Apparently, in today's dollars, somewhere around $20 billion was spent. We still have the massive quantities of concrete poured into a building that looks very much like a modern-day pyramid up in the vast reaches of northeastern North Dakota. That is a legacy, I suppose, to the taxpayers who say sometimes you can have a very expensive program that doesn't turn out quite the way you expected. Some will say, well, that program was just fine; it was a bargaining chip in arms control, and it was mothballed the very month it was declared operational because that was part of the strategic calculation of our country. Of course, that is not the case. 
   I want to talk for a moment about the range of threats against our country. One of those threats is the threat of a terrorist nation, or an adversary, acquiring an intercontinental ballistic missile and affixing to the top of this missile a nuclear warhead and then firing that missile at the United States of America. If that should happen, do we want to have in place a national missile defense system to intercept it? Of course. The answer is yes, of course. 
   What are the likely threats? I mentioned an intercontinental ballistic missile being acquired by a terrorist nation. But, it is far more likely that it would not be an intercontinental ballistic missile but a cruise missile; they are much more widely dispersed, and it would be much more easily acquired. That cruise missile would travel 500 feet above the ground, at 500 or 600 miles an hour, and would be launched from a barge, or a submarine, or a plane just off our shores. That is not going to be intercepted by a national missile defense system. 
   Some say we are working on theater defense that will intercept cruise missiles. Yes, but that theater defense isn't part of what is going to protect the perimeter of our country. It is far more likely that a terrorist nation would acquire a cruise missile. Is there a defense system against a cruise missile? 
   It is far more likely a terrorist nation would, in fact, terrorize our country with a deadly vial of biological or chemical weapons that could cause the kind of chaos that nearly occurred in Japan a couple of years ago, where the right kind of deadly biological agents can kill thousands, hundreds of thousands, perhaps a million people. It is far more likely that a major U.S. city would be threatened by a suitcase bomb placed in the trunk of a rusty Yugo car on a New York City dock by a terrorist nation. That is far more likely than them acquiring a sophisticated intercontinental ballistic missile. 
   The potential, for example, of an adversary such as Russia, which has substantial nuclear might, accidentally launching tubes full of missiles from a Russian submarine would not be defeated by the national missile defense system we are talking about because the system being discussed could only potentially defeat a handful of missiles, 
   not an accidental launch of all the tubes of a Russian submarine. Only a handful of missiles could be intercepted by the missile defense system that is currently under discussion. That doesn't suggest that we ought not consider it. But the question I ask is this: Consideration at what price and with what other consequences? 
   First, as we begin to make decisions about a national missile defense system, I don't think we ought to just throw money at the system. I think some who have an appetite for it say  we should just keep pouring money in there and somehow a system will emerge that will protect our country. I think that would lead to a great deal of waste. 
   Second, the debate we have about deploying a national missile defense system, as soon as technologically possible or feasible, is a debate that worries me, because it seems to suggest all of the consequences are less important and all of the consequences should be set aside. 
   What are those other consequences? One is a program we now have under way with Russia in which we actually saw the wings off Russian bombers. We actually remove Russian missiles from their silos and remove the warheads from the missile. We are reducing in a dramatic way the number of missiles and bombers and the capabilities of delivering warheads aimed at this country. 
   I have in this desk drawer a little vial which, with the consent of the Presiding Officer, I will show. This little vial of material is wiring that was ground up. It is from a Russian submarine that carried missiles aimed at the United States. That submarine is reduced to small pieces of metal. It is cut up. It doesn't exist anymore. I have some of the wiring right here. 
   How do we acquire the wiring of a Russian ballistic missile submarine? You could shoot it and destroy it. That is one way. Or, the other way is with an agreement between ourselves and the Russians to reduce weapons of mass destruction and the delivery capabilities of each side. We have seen submarines and bombers and nuclear warheads being systematically reduced in a very aggressive way. 
   That is exactly what is happening here. That happens through the Nunn-Lugar funds that are offered in this kind of legislation. It is a very important program. It has been remarkably successful. I do not want to, by what we are doing in other areas, jeopardize that kind of arms reduction and arms control. 
   One other point, Mr. President: It is true that this is an increasingly difficult and dangerous world. North Korea is testing medium-range missiles. Iran is testing medium-range missiles. Pakistan and India do not like each other, and they exploded nuclear weapons right under each other's nose. It is a difficult and dangerous world. 
   I support research on missile defense. But I do not support efforts that would say let us demand deployment of any system as soon as technologically feasible, even if it is at the expense of injuring other efforts to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons, or to eliminate delivery systems of nuclear weapons under current arms control regimes. 
   Some say the ABM Treaty is for a country that no longer exists, the old Soviet Union; don't worry about it; ignore it. 
   The fact is that we have made significant progress under our arms control agreements. I think we need to be very careful as we proceed down this road not to do one thing at the expense of others that we know will work. 
   I only wanted to say again that the national missile defense program is one that I have provided support for by substantial amounts of research. I do worry sometimes that the amount of money offered is exceeding the amount of money the system is capable of using effectively. It is a difficult technology to hit a bullet with a bullet at intercontinental missile speeds. Some of my 
   colleagues make the point that it is not one program, it is many programs in a seamless transition of dealing with suppression of missile threats in the theater, and also dealing with intercontinental ballistic missile threats. 
   It is true that these programs represent a number of different kinds of programs. But the largest of them is the national missile defense program, commonly referred to as that, which would be deployed to defend against an intercontinental ballistic missile. Representing a State that has housed the only ABM or national missile defense program that was ever built in the Free World, I have some acquaintance with it. 
   It is my hope that when and if this country deploys a system in the future, it not be done at the expense of arms control reductions that exist in other arms control agreements. That we not decide to focus so much on this issue that we do so at the expense of the nonproliferation efforts this country ought to have as job one. We ought to worry very much every day and in every way about efforts to prevent the proliferation and spread of weapons of mass destruction. 
   I think there is a lot of evidence out there about which we need to be very concerned. Frankly, I think it has taken a back seat in recent years. I think it has taken a back seat in Congress and a back seat in the administration. I don't think we have had nearly as much effort as I would feel comfortable with to try to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
   There are not too many countries that have nuclear weapons at this point, but many countries want to acquire them. There is a black market in the weapons material and production of nuclear weapons. As all of those countries are seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, I hope, as we discuss all of these issues, our country will understand that to prevent proliferation of these weapons, we should not just discuss national missile defense in a way that says it is more important than any other area. If we are to build a safer future for ourselves and our children, it must be a priority for us to say that the proliferation of nuclear weapons around the world is a very serious problem that this country ought to pay serious attention to, and it ought to command a substantial amount of our time. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.

   Mr. DORGAN. I understand that the Fiscal Year 2000 Defense Appropriations bill contains $20 million for innovative readiness training. Under this program, the Department of Defense trains Active Duty, Guard and Reserve personnel by providing ``real world'' experience here in the US which is similar to what might be encountered in Overseas Humanitarian and Civic Assistance Programs. Under the Innovative Readiness Program, the Walking Shield American Indian Society has provided such training opportunities on American Indian reservations especially those located in the states of North and South Dakota and Montana. Without the support and cooperation of the Walking Shield American Indian Society, many of the engineering and medical projects conducted by the Department of Defense would not have been possible. This type of civilian-military program has a very positive impact on recruiting and retention and should be continued in FY 2000. 
   I understand that the report accompanying the Fiscal Year 2000 Appropriations bill for the Department of Defense notes that the Committee believes that the Department should expand the scope of readiness initiatives to include Native American groups, when appropriate and compatible with mission requirements. Is that correct?

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of information given the American people in recent days about a potential settlement or at least progress with respect to ending the airstrikes in Yugoslavia. It appears from the reports I have received, both from the administration sources and also press reports, that the airstrikes have had a significant impact on Mr. Slovodan Milosevic, on his Serb troops, and on their ability to continue the reign of terror that has been committed against the Albanians in Kosovo. 
   But as I read all of the reports, I am concerned about one element, and that is, if the airstrikes are terminated and if some kind of negotiated circumstance exists by which the Serbs withdraw from Kosovo and Mr. Milosevic remains in power, in my judgment, it remains unfinished business. 
   We have in this decade been through a circumstance with Saddam Hussein where a war was concluded with the country of Iraq and Saddam Hussein retained his power. We have year after year after year had to deal with the consequences of Saddam Hussein remaining in power in the country of Iraq. It doesn't make any sense to me that we should do the same thing with Mr. Milosevic. 
   With Mr. Saddam Hussein, we knew who he was, we knew what he had done, and this country should well have known that the conclusion of the war with Iraq should have resulted in his departure, or his leaving the leadership of that country. He is, I think, one of the only men in the world who has used weapons of mass destruction to murder people in his own land. We knew that about Saddam Hussein, and yet the war was concluded with Iraq, and he remained in power. The result has been problem after problem and consequence after consequence. We ought to learn from that. 
   However we conclude this terrible chapter of violence committed against the Albanians in Kosovo, in my judgment, it will always be unfinished business if it is concluded in a manner that leaves Mr. Milosevic in power. We must find a way, it seems to me, for the protection not only of the Albanians in Kosovo but for some basic understanding we might have, that we will not have to revisit this issue very soon after the airstrikes cease. The only way that will occur, in my judgment, is if Mr. Milosevic is driven from office. 
   I have spoken on the floor of the Senate a number of times suggesting that it is time to try Mr. Milosevic as a war criminal. I am pleased to say that he was indicted within the past 2 weeks and that indictment will likely result in trial. My hope is that trial--at least seeing the evidence that I have seen about the atrocities committed by Mr. Milosevic and the Serb troops--will result in his conviction as a war criminal. The atrocities are really quite unusual. He visited a reign of horror on these people in a manner that drove one to one and a half million of them from their homeland, often with their villages burning, with story after story of mass murder, ethnic cleansing, gang rape, and torture. 
   The question for this country and the NATO allies is, Could we go 2 years, or 5 years, or 10 years down the road and look in our rearview mirror and say that we knew that happened but it didn't matter, that it wasn't our business? Our country and the NATO allies  said no, it was our business; it does matter. We have the resources and the capability, through NATO, together to try to do something to put a stop to it. That has been the effort. Is the effort perfect? No. Have there been mistakes? Of course. But will we, by the judgment of history, be seen as a country and a group of countries attempting to do something in the face of ethnic cleansing, in the face of a ruthless leader who packs people into train cars and hauls them off to an uncertain fate, 
   who, in the words of all of the refugees who have shown up at the border of Albania and Montenegro and other areas, has permitted mass rape and torture and murder against the citizens of Kosovo? Do we understand the consequences of that and the requirement to respond to it? The answer is yes. 
   But I hope at the end of this chapter, Mr. Milosevic will not be a part of an agreement that leaves him in power. That will not, in my judgment, be finished business.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to talk for a moment about the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. That is a subject I suppose will glaze over the eyes of many, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. I was in my home State of North Dakota last week. The Senate was not in session. We did not have votes. I guess I was in 20 or 25 different communities all across the State, probably at three dozen different events, town meetings and speeches and various things. It will not surprise anyone to learn that the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty did not come up. We talked about farm policy. We talked about virtually every other thing. We talked about water policy, we talked about welfare, but at none of the meetings in which we discussed public issues did anyone raise the issue of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
   I want to raise the question about this treaty because the President of the United States signed this treaty 2 1/2 years ago and sent it to the Senate for ratification. This Senate did not hold a hearing on it during the 105th Congress, no hearing at all. It is now 6 months into the new Congress, with no hearing. I, with some of my colleagues, am organizing a letter to the appropriate committee and key people on the committee to say we would like to see movement here. If one Senator opposes this country joining the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, then bring it out here and let's have that debate. I cannot conceive of significant opposition to a determination by so many countries in the world that we ought to prevent nuclear testing; we ought to have an agreement that we do not want the spread of nuclear weapons to additional countries. 
   In the past year or so we have seen activities that concern me and many of my colleagues a great deal. We know how many countries possess nuclear weapons. Among those countries that are understood to possess nuclear weapons we can now add India and Pakistan, because each of them exploded nuclear weapons under each other's noses. These are two countries that do not like each other a great deal. There are great tensions. In fact, yesterday on the news you would have seen shelling on the border between Pakistan and India. Each of these countries exploded nuclear weapons, apparently just to show the other country they possess nuclear bombs. 
   North Korea is testing medium-range missiles, firing missiles down range. The country of Iran is testing medium-range missiles. Are these things ominous? Of course they are. Terrorist states acquiring delivery mechanisms for long-range missiles and potentially, I assume, to send weapons of mass destruction to other parts of the world; is that an ominous development? You bet it is. 
   We spent a lot of time here in the Senate talking about a national missile defense; if we could just get a national missile defense put in place in this country so if someone shoots a missile at our country we can go up and hit that bullet with a bullet. I guess we have spent $100 billion over the years trying to do that. There is not much talk about the other things that have been far more successful, and that is arms reduction and test ban treaties banning nuclear tests, reducing nuclear weapons. 
   With consent, I hold up here the part that was taken from the wing of a backfire bomber. This is the piece of a wing strut from a backfire bomber which had its wings sawed off at a former Soviet airbase in Priluki, Ukraine. During the cold war, when the Soviet 
   Union was considered our adversary, the only way I could hold up a piece of the wing of one of their bombers was if we had shot the bomber down. So how does it happen I hold up a portion of a wing of a Soviet backfire bomber? That wing was cut off. Why was it cut off? This country helped provide the funds to cut the wings off bombers in the Soviet Union and now Russia and now the Ukraine. 
   Why did they agree to that? Because we have an arms control reduction agreement in which missiles with nuclear warheads aimed at the United States of America that used to be buried in the ground in the Ukraine are now taken out of the ground and dismantled with the warhead still on. I displayed a picture on the floor of the Senate showing where a missile used to rest in a silo in the Ukraine with the warhead aimed at the United States of America. A sunflower field now exists there. No missile, no nuclear bomb--sunflowers. How did that missile get taken out? How did this backfire Soviet bomber wing get chopped off? We have arms reduction agreements with the Soviet Union, the old Soviet Union, and now Russia and the Ukraine, and they are working. 
   We have people here who say: We do not care about those agreements. We want to build a national missile defense system. It doesn't matter what it costs. It doesn't matter whether it will work. We just want to spend the money so we will feel good. 
   One part of what works in arms control, in my judgment, is the Nunn-Lugar funds which we have spent that accomplished this. The second part, in my judgment, is to pass pieces of legislation that we know make sense for this country's future and for the safety of the world. One of those is the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. This country needs to pass it. This Senate needs to ratify it. That is the way, as a country, we make judgments about it. 
   I want to hold up a chart that shows the support for it. This was polling done in a range of States around the country: Oregon, Nebraska, Utah, Ohio, Kansas, Colorado, Tennessee--support for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Look at it. Mr. President, 86 percent in favor to 10 percent in Oregon who believe we should not ratify this treaty. This country signed it; so have many other countries around the world, 152 countries. 
   This country has a responsibility, in my judgment, to provide leadership, and leadership will mean this Senate ought to ratify it. In order to do that, we must get this treaty out of the committee and get it to the floor and have a debate on it. I urge my colleagues who feel strongly about this to join me and say to the committee it is time, long past the time, when this Senate should ratify the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
   I will, in coming days, speak again on the floor on this issue and the importance of it. I hope I will be joined by plenty of colleagues who will encourage and urge and push, if necessary, the committee to bring this treaty to the floor. Give us a chance to debate this treaty and give us a chance to produce the votes to ratify this treaty, for this country's sake and for the sake of added security and safety in the world. We must prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. We must prevent the spread of technology that allows the delivery of nuclear weapons. One way to do that, in my judgment, is to prevent additional nuclear testing, and the way to do it is to ratify this treaty. 
   It is long past the time to do it, and we ought to do it now and we ought to expect that be reported to the floor for debate in the next 2 to 3 months. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Lewis and Clark Expedition Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act.'' This act authorizes the U.S. Mint to produce a commemorative coin honoring the Lewis and Clark Expedition. This is a bill I introduced in the last Congress and which had the support of 43 other Senators. The bill is a companion to one that has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman BEREUTER. 
   I am introducing this legislation to ensure that one of America's finest moments will be forever memorialized. The Lewis and Clark Expedition, called the Corps of Discovery, represents the finest in American history. The Expedition began in 1803 when President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the exploration of the newly purchased Louisiana Territory and ended in 1806 with the Expedition's triumphant return. 
   When considering why we should commemorate the Expedition, it's important to recall Thomas Jefferson's vision for America's future and his dedication to expanding not only our geographic frontiers, but the frontiers of knowledge as well. Jefferson's vision is epitomized by his commissioning of the Expedition. Further, the Expedition represents a hallmark for peaceful diplomacy, as demonstrated by the friendly relations the Expedition established with the Native Americans it encountered on its journey. These are a few of the many valuable lessons from the Expedition that we should carry forward into the future. 
   The minting of the Lewis and Clark Commemorative Coin was endorsed in the 1998 recommendations of the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee (CCCAC), which was established by the 102nd Congress. If, as expected, the coin sells out, approximately $5 million would be available to help fund bicentennial celebrations. After the Treasury Department has recovered all costs of minting this coin, two-thirds of the surcharge received would be available for the National Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Council's commemorative activities. 
   The Council is an outgrowth of the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation, Inc., which was created in 1969 to continue the work of the Lewis and Clark Trail Commission, established by Congress in 1964. The remaining one-third of the surcharge will be donated to the National Park Service to help offset costs associated with their planned activities to commemorate the bicentennial. 
   I feel confident that, with the support of my Senate colleagues and the passage of this bill, we can appropriately celebrate a vibrant and historically significant event.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment for myself and Senator SMITH of New Hampshire, to ensure that Navy and Marine Corps Combat veterans get the recognition they deeply deserve. 
   The ongoing action in Kosovo reminds us of the dangers our men and women in uniform face when called upon during a time of conflict. In recognition of their service, they are awarded campaign and combat decorations to identify them as those who have faced this nation's fiercest challenge--enemy fire. America's combat veterans risk their lives to preserve our freedoms, and carry out the orders of the President in answering the challenges to our nation's security. 
   During World War II, the Army created the combat infantry badge to identify those soldiers who had faced combat. The Navy had no similar award until the 1960's. Although the Navy awarded Combat Stars prior to that point, the Combat Action Ribbon was created as a way to better recognize those who had served in combat. Recently, legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives to make Navy and Marine combat veterans who served in combat for any period after July 4, 1943, and before March 1, 1961, eligible for the Navy Combat Action Ribbon. In response to this legislation, a Pearl Harbor survivor from my state wrote to me and pointed out that the dates included in the legislation exclude many of the combat veterans who served in the war's fiercest naval battles, Pearl Harbor and Midway among them. 
   In response to this oversight, our legislation will make eligible for the Navy Combat Action Ribbon those Navy and Marine combat veterans who served in combat for any period after December 6, 1941, and before March 1, 1961, The Secretary of the Navy will review those who apply for these awards to ensure that those who have not yet been recognized are not forgotten. We believe it is only appropriate that we honor those who were willing to sacrifice their lives for this country.

   Mr. DORGAN. My colleague from North Dakota is entirely correct. I am informed that no production in the coming fiscal year would likely result in a dangerous reduction to the inventory, and could force Navy training operations to be curtailed as early as 2002. This would clearly not be in our nation's interest. I am additionally informed that a gap in production next year could drive up unit cost sharply.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I received a very touching letter from a Vietnam Veteran from my state, who was recently awarded the Silver Star for his bravery during the Vietnam Conflict. 
   Helping Al Myers get that Silver Star and the recognition he deserved for so long was a very rewarding experience. Al sent me this letter. It is a fictional remembrance of a soldier who's name is on the Vietnam Memorial. 
   The letter defines the importance of paying tribute to our nation's honored soldiers who have fought for, won, and kept our freedom, whether that tribute comes in the form of our nation building a great ``Black Granite Wall,'' or simply a family member putting flowers on a beloved white tombstone at a veteran's cemetery. It exemplifies the strength, dedication, and sacrifice our nation's military men and women, and their families, make. We are forever indebted to them, and it fills me with great pride and humility to honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve our way of life as Americans. 
   I thought it was very important to read it in honor of the Memorial Day Observance on Monday. It touched my heart and I wanted to share it here on the Floor today. It is called ``The Wall from the Other Side.'' 
   The Wall From the Other Side  
   At first there was no place for us to go until someone put up that ``Black Granite Wall.'' Now, every day and night, my Brothers and Sisters wait to see the many people from places afar file in front of this ``Wall.'' Many people stopping briefly and many for hours and some that come on a regular basis. It was hard at first, not that it's gotten any easier, but it seems that many of the attitudes towards that Vietnam War we were involved in have changed. I can only pray that the ones on the other side have learned something, and more ``Walls'' as this one, needn't be built. 
   Several members of my unit, and many that I did not recognize, have called me to The Wall by touching my name engraved upon it. The tears aren't necessary, but are hard even for me to hold back. Don't feel guilty for not being with me, my Brothers. This was my destiny as it is yours to be on that side of The Wall. Touch The Wall, my Brothers, so that I can share in the memories that we had. I have learned to put the bad memories aside and remember only the pleasant times that we had together. Tell our other Brothers out there to come and visit me, not to say Good-bye but to say Hello and be together again ..... even for a short time ..... and to ease that pain of loss that we all still share. 
   Today, an irresistible and loving call summons me to The Wall. As I approach, I can see an elderly lady ..... and as I get closer, I recognize her--It's Momma! As much as I have looked forward to this day, I have also dreaded it, because I didn't know what reaction I would have. 
   Next to her, I suddenly see my wife and immediately think how hard it must have been for her to come to this place, and my mind floods with the pleasant memories of 30 years past. There's a young man in a military uniform standing with his arm around her--My God!--he has to be my son! Look at him trying to be the man without a tear in his eye. I yearn to tell him how proud I am, seeing him stand tall, straight and proud in his uniform. 
   Momma comes closer and touches The Wall, and I feel the soft and gentle touch I had not felt in so many years. Dad has crossed to this side of The Wall, and through our touch, I try to convince her that Dad is doing fine and is no longer suffering or feeling pain. I see my wife's courage building as she sees Momma touch The Wall and she approaches and lays her hand on my waiting hand. All the emotions, feelings and memories of three decades past flash between our touch and I tell her that ..... it's all right ..... carry on with your life and don't worry about me ..... I can see as I look into her eyes that she hears and a big burden has been lifted from her on wings of understanding. 
   I watch as they lay flowers and other memories of my past. My lucky charm that was taken from me and sent to her by my CO ..... a tattered and worn teddy bear that I can barely remember having as I grew up as a child ..... and several medals that I had earned and were presented to my wife. One is the Combat Infantry badge that I am very proud of, and I notice that my son is also wearing this medal. I had earned mine in the jungles of Vietnam and he had probably earned his in the deserts of Iraq. 
   I can tell that they are preparing to leave, and I try to take a mental picture of them together, because I don't know when I will see them again. I wouldn't blame them if they were not to return, and can only thank them that I was not forgotten. My wife and Momma near The Wall for one final touch, and so many years of indecision, fear and sorrow are let go. As they turn to leave, I feel my tears that had not flowed for so many years, form as if dew drops on the other side of The Wall. 
   They slowly move away with only a glance over their shoulders. My son suddenly stops and slowly returns. He stands straight and proud in front of me and snaps a salute. Something draws him near The Wall and he puts his hand upon the etched stone and touches my tears that had formed as dew drops on the face of The Wall ..... and I can tell that he senses my presence and the pride and love that I have for him. He falls to his knees and the tears flow from his eyes and I try my best to reassure him that it's all right, and the tears do not make him any less of a man. As he moves back wiping the tears from his eyes, he silently mouths, ``God Bless you, Dad .....'' 
   God Bless You, Son ..... we Will meet someday, but in the meanwhile go on your way ..... there is no hurry at all. 
   As I see them walk off in the distance, I yell loud to Them and Everyone there today, as loud as I can: Thank You For Remembering. ..... Thank You All For Remembering ..... and as others on this side of The Wall join in, I notice the U.S. Flag, Old Glory, that so proudly flies in front of us everyday, is flapping and standing proudly straight out in the wind from our gathering numbers this day ..... and I shout again, and ..... again ..... and again ..... 
   Thanks for Remembering! 
   Thanks for Remembering! 
   Thanks for Remembering!

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have not been a cheerleader for our participation in this conflict. I supported it, but I am nervous about it. But I must say, this is wrong. At 7 o'clock this evening, with no notice, we have an amendment that suggests we shall terminate our participation in the NATO campaign to stop the ethnic cleansing and the massacre in Kosovo. At 7 o'clock tonight, with no notice, we are going to have this debate probably for an hour? 
   I just heard one of the sponsors of this amendment talk about what Mr. Milosevic has achieved. He is right about that, Mr. Milosevic has achieved the following: massacre, we don't know how many; troops burning villages; raping people; killing innocent men, women and children; hauling people like cattle in train cars or herding them in groups to the border; displacing 1 million to 1.5 million people from their homeland. 
   Yes, he has achieved that. What hasn't he achieved? What he has not achieved he is about to achieve if the Senate adopts this amendment. He wants to achieve an end to the airstrikes that cause him great inconvenience and a great threat to his movement in this massacre and in this ethnic cleansing. Does the Senate want to allow him to achieve that goal? I do not think so. 
   Five or 10 years from now we will look in our rear-view mirror and see that on our watch ethnic cleansing and massacre occurred and we said: Gee, that didn't matter; it wasn't our business. 
   We have already decided that is not the position we will take. It is our business. It does matter. Do you want to know what ethnic cleansing is? Do you want to know what are the horrors of this kind of action visited upon those men, women, and children? Go to the museum not many blocks from here and see the train cars where they hauled people in Europe before, see the shoes of the people who died in the gas ovens, and then ask yourself: Does this kind of behavior matter? It does matter, and this country, with our allies, is trying to do something about it. 
   Imperfect? Is this operation in Kosovo with us and our NATO allies imperfect? Yes, it is imperfect, but are we trying? Is this country, with our allies, saying this does matter? Yes. That is exactly what we are doing. 
   Do we really want to say to Mr. Milosevic tonight: You can achieve the rest of your goals through the help of the Senate. You can do all this--rape, burn, massacre, move people out of their homeland, clean out a country, engage in ethnic cleansing--and when this country and others stand up to say we will not allow that on our time and our watch, you can achieve your objective and remove that nuisance called airstrikes and bombing campaigns and the Senate will help you do that? I do not think so. I certainly hope not, not this Senate. 
   My hope is that history will record this effort as a noble effort that said when this kind of behavior exists, we will do what we can with our allies to stop it. I do not know how this ends, but I know it should not end tonight on a Wednesday night vote by the Senate to say to Mr. Milosevic: This country will no longer continue to be a problem for you. 
   The rape, the burning, the massacres, the ethnic cleansing will not stop, but the airstrikes should? I do not think that is a decision this Senate will make. It is not a decision the Senate should make, and I hope in a short time, with an amendment that should not be offered in this kind of circumstance, the Senate will say: No, this effort by this country at this point in time is important. This is not about us alone. It is about this country with NATO, with our allies attempting to stop this man, Slobodan Milosevic, from the kind of behavior we would not accept from anyone in the world. I hope when this vote is cast, we will not achieve the objective Mr. Milosevic wants most, and that is a cessation of the bombing and the airstrikes. That is the price this man is paying for his behavior, and he must pay that price until he stops. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last week we debated the Juvenile Justice Act. We had a good number of provisions, especially dealing with guns, gun shows, and gun sales that were very controversial. I did not speak last week on an amendment I offered to the juvenile justice bill that became a part of that and is now a provision that has been passed by the Senate. I want to take a few minutes today to describe the amendment I offered and its importance. 
   Some while ago, I was watching a television program. It was about a serial killer, a man who killed four women and one man in Gainsville, FL. The program described the book this serial killer has written: ``The Making of a Serial Killer: The Real Story of the Gainsville Murders in the Killer's Own Words.'' 
   I thought: That cannot be the case. If you murder four or five people and are sent to prison, you lose your right to vote and you lose certain rights. Do you have a right to write a book and profit from it? This television program described the dilemma. 
   There was a murderer in New York who was described as the ``Son of Sam'' murderer many years ago. He was sent to prison and wrote a book in order to profit from his murder. In other words, a violent murderer goes to prison and spends his time writing a book to sell to the public to make money. Is that a right prisoners have in this country after committing a violent crime? Is there a constitutional right to profit from a violent crime in America? I do not think so. 
   The State of New York passed a statute, the ``Son of Sam'' statute, and the Federal Government passed a statute saying that the proceeds from a book written by a violent offender who is sent to prison cannot be retained by the violent criminal. 
   That was appealed and went to the U.S. Supreme Court. Guess what. The U.S. Supreme Court said: No, you may not prohibit the expressive writings of a violent criminal, because that is a violation of the first amendment. I am truncating the Supreme Court decision, but essentially the Supreme Court invalidated the ``Son of Sam'' laws. The Federal law has never been enforced, to my knowledge, and the State laws have been invalidated. 
   So we had a circumstance where, on the program I watched, this serial killer was interviewed. The woman with whom he apparently is romantically involved, who is one of the sponsors of this book, was interviewed. It raised the question in my mind: Shouldn't we correct this issue and these statutes so the next time this goes to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court will not overturn the law? 
   I wrote a piece of legislation, after consultation with some constitutional lawyers, that I think does solve this issue and will say to any prospective author, some disgusting human being who murders four young girls and a man in Gainsville, FL, who now says, I want to write a book to describe the detail, the horrible detail of these murders: You can write until you are dead, but you will never ever profit, you will never profit by writing the accounts of your murders and then sell a book and keep the money. Not just you, but your agent, those to whom you assign the profits--you will not be able to reap the rewards of telling the gruesome, dirty tales of your sordid criminal lives. 
   The juvenile justice bill which passed last Thursday has an amendment in it that closes the loophole and rewrites the Federal law. It says that any individual convicted of any Federal or State felony or violent misdemeanor, if that convicted defendant tries to sell his book, movie rights, or other expressive work or any property associated with the crime--a bloody glove, murder weapon, photos and so on--whose value has been enhanced by that crime, then the U.S. attorney will make a motion to forfeit all proceeds that would have been received by the defendant or the defendant's transferee--spouse, partner, friends, and so on. 
   Is this important? I think it is. I think we ought to have a Federal statute, and if the Supreme Court said the ``Son of Sam'' statute is not valid, we ought to have a Federal statute that says to anybody in this country: If you commit a violent crime and you go to prison, do not expect to sit in prison and write and profit by publishing a book about your crime. 
   I offered that in the Senate last Thursday, and I was joined by my colleague, Senator EVAN BAYH. It has now passed the Senate, and my hope is my colleagues in the House will see fit to keep this in the Juvenile Justice Act, and it will go to the President and be signed into law.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to make a point about something which I think is critically important to the Senate and to this country and its future. It is something we are spending no time on and pay no attention to. It is the issue of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
   In the past two State of the Union Addresses, the President has asked Congress to report out and approve the nuclear test ban treaty. 
   Going back to a time when President Eisenhower talked about this issue, I think most Americans understand the value of and the interest in a test ban treaty. 
   Since 1945, six nations have conducted 2,046 nuclear test explosions. That is an average of one test every 9 days. There are a few countries that have the capability of producing a nuclear weapon and testing a nuclear weapon. There are many countries that want that capability. Stopping the spread of nuclear weapons, stopping the spread of missile technology, the means by which nuclear warheads can be delivered, is critically important. 
   It seems to me one of the underpinnings of those efforts must be the passage of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The United States has been under a moratorium of nuclear tests. We have not been testing since that moratorium began in 1992. We do not test nuclear weapons. We have been a leader. In this area, ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is not only important public policy for our country and the world, it is important in the context of our leadership in these areas. 
   The difficulties we now have in the Balkans and the ruptures that have occurred with our relationship with the Russians, it seems to me, ought to emphasize to us how important it is to turn back to these issues of arms control. 
   We know that the Iranians are testing medium-range missiles. We know that the North Koreans are testing medium-range missiles. We know that India and Pakistan exploded nuclear weapons under each other's nose, and they do not like each other. 
   Ought that be of some concern to us? Of course it should. Yet, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty--the CTBT it is called--the Comprehensive Nuclear  Test Ban Treaty is here in a committee without movement. There were no hearings on the treaty in the last session of the 105th Congress. We are now 5 months into the 106th Congress. I very much want our country to do the right thing: Ratify that treaty before September of 1999, when the committee will be formed of the countries that are signatories to that treaty and who have ratified that treaty, about how it will be brought into force and how it will be verified. 
   I know some say: Well, if you have a treaty on banning nuclear weapons tests, only those who are willing to ban them will ban them, and you can't deal with the rogues or the outlaws. 
   Look, if that is the attitude, no arms control of any type is worth pursuing. But, of course, that is absurd. Arms control has brought real rewards and real reductions in nuclear weapons. 
   I have in my desk here in the Senate a piece of a backfire bomber. I am not at my desk to get it, but it is a piece of a wing of a backfire bomber. Normally you would get a piece of a potential adversary's bomber wing by shooting down a bomber. We did not do that. We cut the wing off the bomber as part of an arms control agreement in which they reduced the number of bombers, they reduced the number of missiles, and they reduced the number of warheads. 
   Arms control reductions have worked. So too will the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. I intend to work with a number of my colleagues to see if we are able, in the coming weeks, to speak with some aggressiveness on this issue here on the floor of the Senate and, on behalf of the American people, to make the case that we ought to have the opportunity to vote on the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. We 
   ought to do it soon. 
   I have seen the agenda that has been offered by the Majority Leader as to what he hopes to bring to the floor to the Senate before Memorial Day, before the Fourth of July. This is not on it. It must be. It should be. I hope it will be, because this is a critically important issue to our country and to the world. 
   Efforts to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons are critical to our future. 
   Many countries want them. Only a few countries have access to them. We must, at every step of the way, try to forge arms control agreements that work. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is one step in that direction. 
   Other steps include forging additional alliances with Russia who, as all of us know, is in some significant economic difficulty. We worry a lot about a range of issues with respect to their command and control of nuclear weapons. 
   But the first step, I think, is for the Senate to be given the opportunity to vote on and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. I hope that is sooner rather than later. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am today submitting a resolution that will express the sense of the Senate that Slobodan Milosevic should be tried as a war criminal. My colleague, Senator SPECTER, and others, have also talked about this at some length on the floor of the Senate in recent months. 
   It is important, given where we are with the airstrikes in Kosovo, to think through this question about Slobodan Milosevic and why we are involved in an air campaign in that part of the world. 
   These are gruesome pictures, and I will only put one of these photos on the easel. But all of these people have names and have lives and have the human suffering that is visited upon them by Slobodan Milosevic. One million to 1.5 million people have been evicted from their homes and communities. Homes have been burned, and innocent civilians have been raped and beaten. Thousands have been massacred, and thousands more have been packed into train cars, reminiscent of the Jews who were hauled to the ovens by the Nazis in the 1940s. 
   This country and our allies decided we do not want history to record us as saying it doesn't matter. There is a moral imperative for us, where we can, when we can to take steps to stop ethnic cleansing, to stop the genocide, to stop someone like Slobodan Milosevic. So we commenced the airstrikes. 
   The very purpose of those airstrikes is underlined by the understanding that Mr. Milosevic is committing horrible war crimes against these ethnic Albanians. They have been driven from their homeland and subjected to rape, torture, and genocide at the hands of the troops commanded by Mr. Milosevic. 
   The question for these children and these innocent victims is: Shall we, as a country, push to have Mr. Milosevic tried in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia? 
   The Tribunal exists for a very specific purpose. Should this country not be pressing very aggressively to have this leader, Mr. Milosevic, indicted and convicted of war crimes? 
   We made a mistake, in my judgment, with respect to Iraq. Saddam Hussein was never tried for war crimes. He committed many. He is one of the few leaders in the world who has murdered people in his own homeland with weapons of mass destruction, but we did not press for his conviction in an international tribunal. So now, instead of being a convicted war criminal, Saddam Hussein is still in power. 
   I understand that perhaps we would not have been able to arrest him, but at least in absentia evidence could be presented to say that this is a war criminal. 
   This monster, Slobodan Milosevic, and the despicable acts committed in his name by his troops, ought to persuade our country to support his indictment and conviction in the International Tribunal, which exists for that purpose. 
   Why would we not do that? I am told that, at some point there has to be a settlement to end this war, and those who are involved in the settlement do not want to be negotiating with a convicted war criminal. That doesn't make any sense to me. The very reason for launching the airstrikes was that this person and the troops under his leadership was committing unspeakable horrors against the ethnic Albanians, which, in my judgment, brands him a war criminal. 
   In fact, former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, who has a long and distinguished career, said in 1992 that Mr. Milosevic was a war criminal. And it is now 1999. Thousands have lost their lives; a million to a million and a half people have been driven from their homes; and the human misery visited on innocent men, women, and children by this leader, Slobodan Milosevic, ought to persuade this country immediately to press for his indictment and conviction--immediately--not tomorrow, not next week, now. 
   This country has an obligation to do that with our NATO allies. 
   I am submitting another resolution today, and the resolution is very simple. 
   It says:  
   It is the sense of the Senate that the President should publicly declare as a matter of United States policy that the United States considers Slobodan Milosevic to be a war criminal. And we urge the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal to seek immediately an indictment of Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes and to prosecute him to the fullest extent of international law.  
   We have a responsibility to do this. The failure to do this, and a resulting negotiated settlement at some point down the line that would leave Slobodan Milosevic in power, would be, in my judgment, a tragic mistake. In or out of power, this leader ought to be branded a war criminal. Whether we apprehend him or not, he ought to be indicted and tried, in absentia, if necessary, with all of the evidence, including the graphic pictorial evidence and all of the statements that have been made by the folks who are pouring into these refugee camps. 
   I am not going to describe those statements, but last Wednesday the State Department released a tape verifying many of those statements. It brings tears to your eyes instantly to understand the unspeakable horrors that have been visited upon these people.

   Mr. DORGAN. I want to observe that the unanimous consent proposal offered by the Senator from Wyoming had not been cleared on our side. We were constrained to object. I also observe, if we are going to establish an order for legislation to be brought to the floor following disposition of the supplemental, for example, we may want to bring to the floor the proposed amendment that died in conference committee by a 14-14 vote dealing with the agricultural fund. 
   Our point was that there are other priorities as well. But the unanimous consent request had not been served on our side. That is why we were constrained to object.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I begin, I pay tribute to the Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. STEVENS, and the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD, and other of my colleagues. I see the Senator from Mississippi on the floor, Mr. COCHRAN, and so many others who in that conference spent hour after hour, day after day hammering out a conference agreement. Especially the chairman and the ranking member. I recall one evening sitting there at 1 in the morning, and they were still there exhibiting the kind of patience that is quite extraordinary in order to resolve all of these many issues. 
   Much of the discussion was about the victims of Hurricane Mitch, the responsibility to respond to our neighbors in this hemisphere who have been hit with such a terrible disaster, the military needs with respect to the airstrikes in Kosovo, and the prosecution of that conflict, the needs for spring planting loans in farm country, and a range of other issues. 
   I support many of those areas, but I am not going to support the conference report because I believe, as I indicated in the conference committee, that if there are resources above that which was requested for the Defense Department for the prosecution of this conflict in Kosovo, if there were $2 billion or $3 billion or $5 billion or $6 billion more available, then I believe we should have a better debate on the priorities of the use of those funds. I, for one, believe we have an urgent, urgent need in rural America to provide a better safety net to give family farmers a chance to make it through this price depression. I believe that is the priority. 
   We had a vote in the conference on the Senate side, and we lost 14-14 on a proposal that would have added nearly $5.5 billion for some price supports to build a bridge across those price valleys during these troubled times in rural America. We lost 14-14. I wish we had won. 
   Nearly $5.5 billion to $6 billion was added to this package for defense spending that was not requested. It is not that the money is not available, it is that a different priority was attached to the spending of this money. 
   I will tell you why I feel so strongly about this. I come from rural America. I come from a small town. We raised some cattle and horses. Last Thursday, my brother called a florist in a little town called Mott, ND. Mott, ND, is 14 miles from my hometown of Regent. Regent has 300 people and Mott is a bigger town and always was, even when I was growing up. Mott is about 800 people. 
   My brother called the florist on the Main Street of Mott. There is one little florist shop. He said: My brother and I want to order flowers to be delivered to the cemetery at Regent for our mother and father for their graves on Memorial Day. We do that each year, and we also do so on Mother's Day and Father's Day. 
   My brother said he told the woman who runs and owns the floral shop: By the way, I forgot to call you this year on Mother's Day. I was going to have you deliver some flowers for Mother's Day. 
   Incidentally, this floral shop always apologizes when we call because she says: We have to charge you a $2 delivery fee. It is 28 miles. 
   My brother said: I forgot to call you this year to deliver flowers for our mother's grave on Mother's Day, but I would like you to deliver them on Memorial Day. 
   The woman who owns the flower shop said: That's all right, we delivered some on Mother's Day because we know you call every year and we thought you just forgot. Later on, we were going to send you a bill, and if you paid it, that was all right, and if you did not, that's all right, too. 
   That probably does not happen across America, but it happens in my part of the country, in rural America, where family farmers and Main Street merchants work together in a lifestyle that is really quite wonderful. People do things, people help each other, but there is no amount of help in farm country these days that can reach out  and say to family farmers who are struggling to make a living: We will help you with the price of your grain. We know you are trucking that grain to the elevator these days and are told there is no value; we will help you. 
   That is not what is happening. In fact, they are going to the elevators today to find out the grain market has collapsed and they are getting Depression-era prices, at the same time the current farm program, freedom to farm, is pulling the rug out from under these farmers with respect to the safety net. We need to help. 
   If we want family farmers in our future, we need to help. If we want to preserve this kind of lifestyle, yes, of family farms and Main Street of our small towns, we need to do something to help. 
   I want to read a few things from Ted Koppel's program ``Nightline'' on Tuesday, May 18. They did a program on the farm crisis. They pointed out--while all of the good news comes to the Washington Post and the New York Times, just open them up and read all the wonderful news, our economy is growing, unemployment is down, inflation is down, virtually everything else is up, a lot of good news--but the farm belt does not experience that good news. Family farmers are in desperate trouble and small towns are shrinking. The rural economy is in desperate trouble. 
   Ted Koppel on his program had farmers and others talking. I will share some of that with my colleagues:  
   Here's what many farmers see happening, the prices they can sell their crops for falling and predicted to stay low....... wheat prices are down 42 percent. 
   Now, ask yourself, how would you feel or your family feel if you had a 42-percent cut in your income? Would you feel that the economy is doing real well?  
   Corn prices are down 38 percent. Oats and barley down 32 percent.  
   In constant dollars, these are prices that we received in the family farm in the Great Depression. 
   At the start of the program, Ted Koppel interviewed a fellow. He talks about a guy who works with farm families, tries to help them. Willard Brunell said:  
   I think the scariest one was back a few years when I got a phone call from a farm wife [who] said my husband just left with a gun and he's driving away. He said he's going to his tractor. [He said] I was there with him 20 minutes and it was quite a ways away. I got him out of his tractor. He sat in my little car and we spent two hours in that car trying to talk him down and he told me exactly how he was doing, going to do it. He had the gun with him. .....  
   They get more than 50 calls a month in this fellow's church talking about that kind of desperation. 
   In Minnesota and North Dakota, where Ted Koppel's program was taped, is some of the richest farmland in the entire world. Last year, one in every three farmers grew a crop that cost more to produce than they could sell it for. For many, it was the fourth, fifth year that happened. 
   Lowell Nelson was interviewed on this program. He is one of those farmers.  
   He was born, raised and had his own sons on this land, a fertile 400 acres he bought from his brothers 35 years ago after his dad died. But this spring [is the first spring] he's not planting anything.  
   He cannot. He is ruined. He said:  
   Well, I had been putting it off [this decision] for quite [a long] time and I had gotten a lot of urging, you know, from my wife to make a decision and I had just been putting it off. It's a decision I didn't want to make.  
   His wife said:  
   One night he was out in the field and all of a sudden called me on the [shortwave] radio and wanted me to come over just to ride with him [on the tractor] and I knew something was wrong and it was shortly thereafter that he decided he'd better get some medical help.  
   The interviewer asked Mr. Nelson:  
   How badly did you scare yourself?  
   He said:  
   Real bad.  
   The interviewer asked:  
   What do you mean?  
   He said:  
   Thinking that it may be better off not being here.  
   The reason I mention the ``Nightline'' program, they interviewed these folks. These are real people in desperate trouble--just in desperate trouble. We have a country whose economy is growing and thriving and rising--full of good news. The stock market hits record highs. Everybody says this is a terrific economy. Then you drive out down a country road, and talk to a family who has struggled for 20, 30, 50 years, and you see what is happening. 
   A big guy stood up at a meeting I had one day. He had a 
   big beard, a tall fellow, a strong fellow. He said: You know, my granddad farmed my farm. My dad farmed it for 40 years. And I have farmed it for 23 years. Then his eyes teared up and his chin began to quiver, and he could not continue anymore. When he finally got the words out, he said: And I can't keep going anymore. I'm broke, so I have to sell the farm. 
   That may not matter to some, but it matters to me. 
   A woman wrote me a couple of weeks ago and said: We had our auction sale on our farm, and my 17-year-old son would not get out of bed to come downstairs. He refused to come down and help at the auction sale because he was so heartbroken. He knew he would never be able to do what his dad did. He knew he would never be able to farm that farm. She could not get him out of bed he was so heartbroken. 
   I tell you all of that because we pass a supplemental bill and we say: All right, on defense, the Defense Department needs $6.1 billion to prosecute this war in Kosovo. We must restore munitions and planes and do other things. And I am for all of that. I support all of that. I support our men and women in uniform and support this mission. 
   But then we also say there is another $5 or $6 billion we want to add to that. And I say, if there is $5 or $6 billion around that can be used in this discretionary way, then I want the priority to say: We want to continue to invest in America's family farmers. 
   You think this country is going to be a better, stronger place when we don't have family farmers left? When corporations farm America from California to Maine, you think food prices are not going to go up? And it is more than just farming. These folks contribute in every way to their community. They contribute to a way of life that we are losing in this country. Yet, somehow, when we talk about all of these fancy economic theories, nobody talks about the family as an economic unit--nobody. 
   The economic unit in this country is the large corporation. They are all getting married, as you know. There is all this corporate romance going on all over America. Every day you wake up and see a new couple of corporations have decided to get hitched and get bigger. 
   What about the economic unit that really matters in the center of this country in America's farm belt that grows America's food? That makes America's communities strong? That helps build America's churches? That puts life on main streets on Saturday night? What about those economic units? What about family farmers? 
   Last year, we passed an emergency bill. About half of that money is not yet in the hands of family farmers. It will be there in a matter of weeks, I guess, through the USDA, through this formula. But it is $1.5 billion short of what was promised. We should have at least added that to this piece of legislation. We should have at least added some additional support to say to family farmers, when prices collapse at Depression-level prices, we are going to reach out a helping hand, extend a helping hand to you to say you matter to this country. 
   We had an opportunity to do that and did not. A 14-to-14 vote, and how I regret losing that vote--but in this business, in this system, you win some and you lose some. My hope is that those who felt it not appropriate, those who felt it was not the time to respond to this need now will, a week from now or a 
   month from now, decide that it is time to respond. 
   This is not Democrat and Republican. We have had bad farm programs under all kinds of administrations--Democratic administrations, Republican administrations. I want the farmers to get the price from the marketplace as well. That would be my fervent hope. But when the marketplace collapses, we must help. 
   Let me make a final point. I think it is fascinating that at a time when  somehow the economic unit of the family, with respect to agriculture, does not seem to matter, that which the family farm produces in this country is used by everybody else to make record profits--the railroads make record profits hauling it; the cereal manufacturers make record profits putting air in it and puffing it up and putting it on the grocery store shelves and calling it puffed wheat--the farmers go broke. The manufacturers get rich. Or they sell a steer for a pittance or sell a hog for $20, an entire hog. You can buy a hog for $20 at the bottom of the hog market, and then go to the store and buy a ham that cost you $30 or $40. Buy a small ham at twice the price you bought the entire hog for. 
   Something is fundamentally wrong, and farmers know it. So everybody who touches these products make record profits and are getting bigger and richer; and the folks who start the tractor and plow the ground and plant the seed, and then hope all summer it does not hail, the insects don't come, that it rains enough and doesn't rain too much, and that they, by the grace of God, might get a crop, wonder whether they will be able to sell it in the fall and make any kind of profit. 
   So I cannot vote for this conference report. But having said that, I deeply admire the work of the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from West Virginia and others who participated in it. The priorities, in my judgment, needed to include the priorities I have just discussed with respect to helping family farmers, and they do not, regrettably. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am glad to be a cosponsor of the mentoring amendment offered by my colleague from Nebraska, Mr. KERREY, and I commend him for his work on this issue. I also want to thank the managers of this bill for accepting our amendment. 
   When it comes to juvenile delinquency, I subscribe to the notion that ``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'' I think it makes a great deal of sense to spend a dollar now to try and prevent young people from becoming criminals in order to save the thousands of dollars it would cost later to incarcerate and rehabilitate them. 
   I believe one of the most effective forms of prevention is mentoring. I have seen firsthand that mentoring can make an important difference in a child's life through my participation in a wonderful program started by Senator JEFFORDS called Everybody Wins. Every week, I have the privilege of spending an hour or so with a boy named Jamal. It has been a pleasure to watch him learn and grow into a fine, confident, young man. 
   I would encourage any of my colleagues who want to make a real difference to become a mentor. At-risk young people with mentors are 46 percent less likely to use illegal drugs and half as likely to skip school than at-risk youth without mentors. Nearly three-quarters of young people with mentors indicate that their mentors have helped to raise their goals and expectations. 
   Unfortunately, there are too many at-risk youth who do not have an adult willing or able to give them the regular, individual attention they need. The amendment offered by Senator KERREY and I would help to ensure that exemplary youth or family mentoring programs in each of our states are funded by the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Challenge Grant program established in this bill. I believe this would be a good investment in our young people, and I again thank my colleagues for their support of this amendment.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last year, I introduced a bill to correct problems with the Federal Son of Sam Law, as those problems were perceived by the United States Supreme Court. Today, I am reintroducing this legislation, which deals with a continuing problem. The New York statute analyzed by the Supreme Court, as well as the Federal statute which I seek to amend, forfeited the proceeds from any expressive work of a criminal, and dedicated those proceeds to the victims of the perpetrators crime. Because of constitutional deficiencies cited by the Court, the Federal statute has never been applied, and without changes, it is highly unlikely that it ever will be. Without this bill, criminals can become wealthy from the fruits of their crimes, while victims and their families are exploited. 
   The bill I now introduce attempts to correct constitutional deficiencies cited by the Supreme Court in striking down New York's Son of Sam law. In its decision striking down New York's law, the Court found the statute to be both over inclusive and under inclusive: Over inclusive because the statute included all expressive works, no matter how tangentially related to the crime; under inclusive because the statute included only expressive works, not other forms of property. 
   To correct the deficiencies perceived by the Court, this bill changes significantly the concepts of the Federal statute. Because the Court criticized the statute for singling out speech, this bill is all encompassing: It includes various types of property related to the crime from which a criminal might profit. Because the Court criticized the statute for being over inclusive, including the process from all works, no matter how remotely connected to the crime, this bill limits the property to be forfeited to the enhanced value of property attributable to the offense. Because the Court found fault with the statute for not requiring a conviction, this bill requires a conviction. 
   The bill also attempts to take advantage of the long legal history of forfeiture. Pirate ships and their contents  were once forfeited to the government. More recent case law addresses the concept of forfeiting any property used in the commission of drug related crimes, or proceeds from those crimes. I hope that courts interpreting this statute will look to this legal history and find it binding or persuasive. 
   The bill utilizes the Commerce Clause authority of Congress to forfeit property associated with State crimes. This means that if funds are transferred through banking channels, if UPS or FedEx are used, if the airwaves are utilized, or if the telephone is used to transfer the property, to transfer funds, or to make a profit, the property can be forfeited. In State cases, this bill allows the State Attorney General to proceed first. We do not seek to preempt State law, only to see that there is a law in place which will ensure that criminals do not profit at the expense of their victims and the families of victims. 
   One last improvement which this bill makes over the former statutes: The old statue include only crimes which resulted in physical harm to another, this bill includes other crimes. Examples of crimes probably not included under the old statute, but included here are terrorizing, kidnaping, bank robbery, and embezzlement. 
   Mr. President, our Federal statute, enacted to ensure that criminals not profit at the expense of their victims and victim's families, is not used today because it is perceived to be unconstitutional. I believe victims of crime deserve quick action on this bill, drafted to ensure that they are not the source of profits to those who committed crimes against them. I ask for your support.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to just add a note of sympathy and condolence, but also, on this day, a note of admiration for Admiral Nance's public service. As I said one day on the floor when we were talking about the late Scott Bates, there are many people who serve this country, and work in this Senate especially, who do so in ways that are not obvious to people on the outside, but in ways that are critically important to the workings of the Senate and the construction of good public policy in America. 
   I did not know Admiral Nance well. I knew him to see him. I, on several occasions, approached him with some questions about policy issues that I knew the committee was working on, that I knew he was involved in with Senator HELMS. On each occasion, he answered my queries with patience and with a great deal of understanding. I walked away thinking to myself, this is a person who really knows these issues, both from experience and just a general knowledge from a wide range of interests and issues. It reminded me again, then, with him, as it has with so many others, of the wonderful service given the Senate by so many people on our staffs. But he was different. He was by all accounts, of all those who had many more dealings with him than I had, a person who brought to this Senate a very substantial background and a very special kind of knowledge about these issues in foreign affairs. 
   So I want to add my voice today to the expressions of gratitude for his public service. Yes, condolence over his passing and sympathy to his family and loved ones, but especially, at the same time, to say thank you to Admiral Nance for lending himself in service to his country in such a noble way and especially thank you to him for being of service to his country here in the Senate with Senator HELMS for so many years. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this morning I opened the Washington Post newspaper to the Metro Section and saw on page 1 of the Metro Section, a headline that says, ``Killer Sent To Wrong Prison After 2nd Murder.'' I want to describe this killer and I want to describe what has happened in the District of Columbia, because I have spoken about this case, I suppose, five or six times on the floor of the Senate over the last 4 or 5 years. 
   First, let me tell you about the man they are talking about, the killer. His name is Leo Gonzales Wright. On June 10, 1974, he committed a rape and committed a burglary. On June 18, 1976, armed robbery; shot a store owner during an armed robbery. February 1, 1976, robbery and murder of a cab driver, Joseph Woodbury. Apprehended, incarcerated, pled guilty to second degree murder and armed robbery. Released on parole some 17 years later. Arrested for cocaine in the District of Columbia. Indictment in a drug case, arraigned on the drug charge, failed to report for drug testing. Failed to report for drug testing. Carjacking and armed robbery of Kristina Keyes. Failed to report for drug testing. Carjacking and murder of Bettina Pruckmayr. 
   Who is Bettina Pruckmayr? She was a young, 26-year-old human rights lawyer. You can't see this picture much. She had just graduated from Georgetown, a young woman who one evening was getting into her car and this Leo Gonzales Wright abducts here, forces her to drive to an ATM machine, and gets her ATM code. She cooperates in every way: gives him the PIN number for the ATM machine, says, ``I only have $20 in my account,'' and then she tries to run away. 
   He follows her and, according to the paper, got angry and decided to kill her, this 26-year-old lawyer. He said he was so enraged he stabbed her 38 times, plunging the knife into her body with such force that her sternum was crushed and many of the wounds, inflicted with a 5.5 inch butcher knife, were more than 6 inches deep. 
   This young lady, this wonderful young attorney, was killed by someone who should not have been able to kill anybody. He was on the streets, released early. He had already murdered, was put in prison, but released early and then picked up again for an offense and not put back in jail. Then he murdered this young woman. So the judge sentenced him, and the judge said, when he sentenced him 3 years ago: It is my intent, sir, that you will never be released into society again. You, sir, will die in jail. This court will do everything in its power to ensure that you will never walk the streets of this country or anyplace again. 
   That is what the Federal judge said to Leo Gonzales Wright, a double murderer, a man with a criminal record as long as my arm, someone who should not have been on the streets to murder Bettina Pruckmayr. 
   This morning the story in the paper says that, while Judge Sullivan ordered this man to be sent to Federal prison 3 years ago, he is not in a Federal prison. He has been out here at Lorton in the District of Columbia for the last 3 years. In fact, at one point he was given part of a day to go home to attend his mother's wake. 
   The story talks about the judge's anger. The judge has a right to be angry. All of us have a need to be angry. This is gross, utter incompetence. I don't know anybody in the criminal justice system in the District of Columbia. I don't know anybody there. But there is such gross incompetence there it just staggers the imagination. 
   I have spoken probably five times on the floor of the Senate about this murder, only because it is so reflective of what is 
   wrong in our criminal justice system. We know this guy is a murderer. We knew it before and society put him in jail, and the parole folks let  him out early so he could murder again. 
   Who is accountable for that? Is somebody going to lose his or her job? The last time a Federal judge sent him to Federal prison he didn't go. Who is accountable for that? Or he gets to go to his mother's wake, this fellow who has murdered twice. Who is accountable for that? Who is going to tell the Pruckmayr family: We are sorry. This is just the way bureaucracy works. 
   It ought not be the way the system works anywhere. 
   I want to say to the Mayor of this city and the folks who run the criminal justice system in this city, I am not someone who bashes the city of the District of Columbia. I have never done that. Some do, but I do not. But I say today I am on the Appropriations Committee and you are going to pay a price. You are going to pay a price for this gross, staggering, incompetence, unless someone is held accountable for this kind of nonsense. 
   People have the right to expect the streets are safe. People have the right to expect that murderers are not walking up and down the streets in this country. And in the District of Columbia, at least, they knew this fellow was a murderer--he had murdered before, committed armed robbery before, committed rape before--only for them to say somehow: We decided to put him back on the streets. Then a Federal judge says: I want him in Federal prison forever. The District of Columbia cannot even get that right. 
   We need to understand why. I do not mean this as a threat. I just mean it as a promise. They are going to pay a price unless they demonstrate to the American people and to this Congress they are holding people accountable for this kind of gross negligence and gross incompetence. 
   I never met Bettina Pruckmayr. I have spoken in the Senate about a young 11-year-old boy, I suppose, about a half dozen times as well. They found that young boy dead. They found grass and dirt between his fingers. He was also killed by a guy who previously had been convicted of murder. That young boy was stabbed many times and left for dead in a pond, except he was not dead. He tried to crawl his way out. He died at the top of the embankment with dirt and grass between his fingers. 
   He should never have been murdered. He was murdered by someone we knew was a murderer, because he murdered before. But the system said it was OK that he be let out of jail. 
   The exact same thing is true with this young woman, Bettina Pruckmayr. She ought not have died. Her death is on someone's conscience. I do not know who it is. Who makes these decisions? Who makes the decisions that these killers be turned loose on our streets? 
   I have come to the floor today only to ask the question: Who makes the decision to say to a Federal judge you may want this person in a Federal prison out of society for life, but we have decided differently. We will stick him back in Lorton and when his mother dies, he can go to the wake. 
   Who makes that decision? Who is going to be held accountable for this, because this is the same kind of staggering incompetence that led to this person's release in the first place, that led to this person not being apprehended when he failed a drug test while on parole. It is the same staggering incompetence. 
   I am saying as one Member of the Senate that when we take a look at our obligations and I as an appropriator take a look at our obligations to the District of Columbia, I will insist that the mayor and others in this system demonstrate to us that they have held people accountable for this kind of behavior. 
   Too many innocent people die. I have had a piece of legislation in the Senate--I have never been able to get it passed and I will never quit trying--that says if a unit of government, a city, a State, decides they want to let killers out early, time off for good behavior; we want to manage you in prison, so we will give you an inducement: If you behave in prison we will give you time off. If you commit violent crimes and murder, we will let you out early if you are good behind bars so you can walk the streets early and commit another crime. 
   What I have said is those units of government that decide to let people convicted of violent crimes out early, if those people commit a violent crime during a period when they would have still been serving their sentence in prison, should be held responsible to the victims and the victims' families. Yes, that means lawsuits, recompense. 
   There ought to be responsibility. Let's find those who are letting these folks out of prison and say to them: You be responsible. If you want to let them out early, then you bear the consequences. 
   Am I upset by reading this story this morning? Yes, I am. Again, I did not know this young woman, but I have spoken about her often, and many others have, I believe, watched this case with bewilderment, wondering who on Earth could be in charge of a system that is so fundamentally incompetent, a system that, in my judgment, ultimately allowed this person to be free on the streets to kill this young woman, a system that now can't even comply with a simple order by a Federal judge that this person ought to be in Federal prison forever, never again to be released on the streets in this country. 
   People of this country deserve better and expect better. Those of us in the Congress who have some capability of applying some pressure to the people of the District of Columbia to remedy these problems have an obligation, it seems to me, to use that leverage to force that to happen. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased and proud to join my colleague, Senator HOLLINGS of South Carolina, as a cosponsor of this amendment. I have worked with Senator HOLLINGS since 1992 on this subject in the Commerce Committee. We have had hearing after hearing. This is a very big issue. We are proposing a baby step on a very big issue. It is likely that this baby step that we propose to take will be turned down by the Senate. We will see. Maybe I will be surprised today. I hope I will. But if the past is prologue, we will likely see the Senate decide it is not time or the amendment is not right or any one of 1,000 excuses. 
   If ever there was an example of when all is said and done, more is said than done, if ever there was an example of that, it is on this subject. We have thousands of studies. We have had hundreds of hours of debate, many proposals. Almost nothing happens. 
   Will Rogers said something once instructive, it seems to me. He said: When there is no place left to spit, you either have to swallow your tobacco juice or change with the times. 
   On this subject, I say to my colleagues, it is time to swallow your tobacco juice. There is no place left to spit on this issue. 
   Let me give you some statistics. As a parent, I am pretty acutely aware, but I have a 12-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter. We have a couple television sets, and they have switches on the sets. We try very hard to make sure they are not watching inappropriate television programming, but I tell you, it is hard. There is a lot coming through those sets at all hours of the day and night. 
   Senator HOLLINGS and I say, let us at least describe a block of time or have the Federal Communications Commission describe a period of time during which children are expected to be watching television, during family hour, and describe that that period will not contain excessive amounts of violence on television. Surely we can entertain adults without hurting our children. That is all this amendment says. 
   Is it old-fashioned? Yes, it goes back to a time when we actually had a sort of understanding. During certain periods of the evening, during family time, during times when you would expect children to watch television, you won't have excessive acts of violence on television programming. Is that so extreme? Is that censorship? No, of course not. 
   Let me read you some information. Before I do, let me mention, I said last night that by the time a young person graduates from high school, they have watched 12,500 hours of television. Excuse me, let me change that. They have sat in a classroom, 12,500 hours in a school classroom, and they have watched 20,000 hours of television. They are, regrettably, in many cases much more a product of what they have seen than what they have read. Let me read some statistics about what they are seeing on these television programs. 
   By the end of elementary school, the American Medical Association reports from their studies, the average American child has watched 8,000 murders on television and 100,000 acts of aggressive violence. That is by the end of elementary school. By age 18, these numbers, of course, have jumped, 112,000 acts of violence, and by age 18, the average young American has watched 40,000 murders on television. 
   Now, one can make the point that it doesn't matter, it is irrelevant, and this doesn't affect anybody. I am not saying that just because when somebody sees an act on violence on television, they rush out the door and commit an act of violence on somebody else. But I am saying that the media have a profound influence on our lives. People spend $200 billion a year advertising precisely because they feel it makes a difference--it makes a difference in terms of what people wear, what songs they sing, how they act, what kind of chewing gum they buy. It works--except when it comes to violence, we are told it is irrelevant and it doesn't matter. 
   I would like to call my colleagues' attention to one little community in Canada. I have never been there; I never heard of it before, in fact. But a fascinating study was done in this town. It is a town called Notel, Canada. In 1973, this small community acquired television for the first time. It wasn't because this little Canadian town never wanted television; that wasn't the problem. The problem was that they had signal reception problems that could not be solved and so they didn't get television until much, much later. They didn't have any hostility to television; they just didn't get it. You had this little ``island,'' this little town with no television. Somebody decided to do a study. They did a study concurrent with this community never having had television now receiving television for the first time. They did a double blind study and selected two other towns and then this community. Then they measured young people's behavior. 
   I want to describe to you what they learned because it is exactly what you would expect: Television affects behavior. Violent television affects behavior. 
   In the double blind research design, first and second grade students were observed prospectively over a period of 2 years for rates of objectively measured noxious physical aggression, such as hitting, shoving, biting, et cetera. The rates of aggression did not change in the two communities who had had television all along. Their rate of aggression was the same. But that community that just received television in 1973, which had been dark all those years because they could not get reception, they get television now, it is a new thing, and guess what happens? The rates of physical aggression among their children increased by 160 percent. The other two communities didn't change. The community that just began to receive television had a substantial increase in the rate of aggression among their children. 
   What does that say? It says what we all know: Television affects behavior. At one of our hearings, we had testimony that said--do you remember the old ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' program? There was Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo and--perhaps the Senator from South Carolina can name the fourth. It's Raphael, I think. So you have four turtles, and they have sticks and they are beating up each other. It is interesting. 
   We had testimony before the Commerce Committee that ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' had to be produced two ways. One, with all of the full flavor of the hitting and the sticks and all of the things they were doing. And, second, they had to clean it up and tone it down because in some foreign markets they would not allow it to be imported into their television sets with that level of violence because they didn't want the kids to see that. So you make it at one level of aggression and violence for the U.S. market and then clean it up a bit so some 
   of the foreign children aren't exposed to that. 
   I thought that was interesting because it describes, it seems to me, an attitude here. The attitude has been: Let's keep pushing the limits. I think, as I said yesterday, television has some wonderful things on it. I laud those people who produce it. Some things I see are so wonderful and beautiful. I watch some of these channels. I have mentioned Discovery, the History Channel, and so many other things. Yes, the broadcast channels produce things I believe are wonderful as well. But I also have the right, believing that and saying that, to say there is  also a lot of trash. The first amendment gives people a right to produce trash as well. But is the first amendment an impediment for us to say to broadcasters that there are certain times in our living rooms, when our children are going to be expected to be watching television, that we ought to be able to expect a menu of television programming that is free from excessive violence? Is that an unreasonable proposition? I don't think so. 
   The evidence, as described by the Senator from South Carolina, is so clear. After a couple of decades of research, the National Institutes of Mental Health concluded:  
   The great majority of studies link television violence and real life aggression.  
   The American Psychological Association's review of research was conclusive. They said:  
   The accumulated research clearly demonstrates a correlation between viewing violence and aggressive behavior.  
   You can throw these studies away and say it doesn't matter, that it is psychobabble. But, of course, we all know it is not. Every parent here understands that this is real. 
   I mentioned last evening that if someone came to the door of my colleague, the Senator from Kentucky, or the Senator from South Carolina, and you had children in your living room playing and you had a television set that was turned off and somebody knocked on the door and said: We have some entertainment for your kids; I have a rental truck here and we have props and some set designs and I have some actors; I would like to bring them into your living room and put on a little play for your children. So you invite them into your living room and they put on a play. They pull knives and stab each other, they pull pistols and shoot each other, and they beat each other bloody--all in the context of this dramatic play, this mayhem and violence. And your children are watching with eyes the size of dinner plates. Would you, as a parent, sit there and say that it doesn't matter, that is fine, thanks for bringing this play into my living room? I don't think so. I think you would probably call the police and say: I have a case of child abuse in my living room. Shame on you for bringing that into my living room. 
   Well, it is brought into our living rooms every day, in every way, with the touch of a button. Some say, well, the solution to that is to turn the TV set off. Absolutely true. There isn't a substitute for parental responsibility. But as a parent, I can tell you it is increasingly difficult to supervise the viewing habits of children. 
   I introduced the first legislation in the Senate on the V-chip. I introduced it twice, in 1993 and in 1994. It is now law. The V-chip will be on television sets, but it will be a while before almost all television sets have them. Hopefully, that will be one tool to help parents, but it will not be the solution, just a tool. 
   It seems to me that we ought to decide now, to the extent that we can help parents better supervise children's viewing habits, that we can tell broadcasters, and tell the FCC that we want broadcasters to know, there is a period of time when they are broadcasting shows into our living rooms that we want the violence to be reduced in that programming so as not to hurt our children. That is not unreasonable. That is the most reasonable, sensible thing in the world. We did it before in this country; we ought to do it now. We have done it for obscenity, and we ought to do it for violence. The Supreme Court has ruled that there is a period of time when certain kinds of obscenities and language ought not to be allowed to be broadcast because children will be watching or listening. And the Supreme Court has upheld that. The Supreme Court will uphold this. Again, I say, this is a baby step forward. 
   Now, let me quote, if I might, the Attorney General of the United States, who testified at the Senate Commerce Committee hearing. 
   She said:  
   I am not at this hearing as a scientist. I am here as Attorney General who has been concerned about the future of this country's children and as a concerned American who is fed up with excuses and hedging in the face of an epidemic of violence. When it comes to these studies about television violence, I think we are allowed to add our common sense into the mix.  
   She continues:  
   Any parent can tell you how their children mimic what they see everywhere, including what they watch on television. Studies show children literally acting out and imitating what they watch. The networks themselves understand this point very well. They have run public service announcements to promote socially constructive behavior. They announce that this year's programs featured a reduced amount of violence, and they boosted episodes encouraging constructive behavior in each instance. Then they endorse the notion that television can influence how people act.  
   She says, further quoting her:  
   As slogans go, I fear that ``Let the parents turn off the television'' may be a bit naive as a response to television violence, especially when you consider the challenge that parents face in trying to convince children to study hard, behave and stay out of trouble. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens compared this argument to saying that the remedy for an assault is to run away after the first blow. Indeed, many parents don't want to have to turn the television set off. They want to expose their children to the good things television can offer, like education and family-oriented programs.  
   I have watched television for a long time and have seen much good and much that concerns me. I have seen in most recent years an increasing desire to create sensationalized violence and intrigue in entertainment, most notably the shows about the police and the rescue missions. 
   When I turn it on these days, there is one network that is particularly egregious. They have all kinds of shows where they get their television cameras and put them in the cop's car. I guess what they are doing is probably contracting with the police someplace, and then they are off and showing traffic arrests and drug arrests. The other night, I saw a case where a fellow was in the front seat of the police car with a camera for a television show. And they engaged in a high-speed chase of a drunk driver. The result, of course, was that at the end of the chase there was a dead, innocent driver coming the other direction hit by the drunk. 
   My mother was killed by a drunk driver. My mother was killed in a high-speed police chase. 
   I have spent years in the Congress proposing legislation dealing with drunk driving with high-speed pursuits and other things. I have also prepared legislation recently dealing with this question of whether our police departments should contract with television stations, having people with television cameras riding in the police car, of which the conclusion, incidentally, to a high-speed chase must be, it seems to me, to go ``get their man'' because that is going to make a good conclusion to the television program. The answer to me, though, is absolutely not. 
   If they want to put a television camera in a police car for the entertainment of people on some television network, then I think we ought to subject them to a very substantial liability 
   when somebody gets hurt as a result of it. 
   I am, frankly, a little tired of turning on television and seeing television news cameras moving down the highways and above the highway recording high-speed chases, because they think it is excitement that people want to see. I am flat sick of seeing programs in which television network programs are riding with members of the police force because they can maybe record some violence for people who want to see. That is not entertainment, in my judgment. That is just more trash on television. I know some people like to watch it. But I happen to think people die as a result of it. Innocent people die as a result of it, and I think it ought to stop. 
   But this issue of violence on television is something that Senator HOLLINGS from South Carolina has been at it for a long time. We just had a man come to the Chamber a bit ago, Senator Paul Simon from Illinois. He is not a member of this body anymore. He retired. But he also joined us years ago. In fact, he was one of the earliest ones who talked about this issue. This issue has been around since the 1960s, and has been discussed among families for all of this decade. 
   With respect to the efforts of the Senator from South Carolina, and, as I indicated, the proposal that he and I offer today to simply allow the FCC the authority to describe a period of time in the evening that would be described as family viewing hours is a baby step forward. Those who come to this Chamber and say that they can't  take this baby step, you can make excuses forever. You can make excuses for the next 10 years, as far as I am concerned. You defy all common sense if you say you can't take this baby step. The only reason you can't take this step is because there are a bunch of other big interests out there pressing on you saying we want to make money continuing to do what we are doing. What they are doing is hurting this country's kids. 
   As I said when I started, surely we ought to be able to entertain adults in this country without hurting our children. And this is one sensible step that we can take. We did it before some years ago. We ought to do it again. It does no violence to the first amendment. It seems to me that it offers common sense to American families. 
   Mr. President I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. It is a very brief question. 
   As the Senator knows, I was the original sponsor of the V-chip that was first introduced in the Senate. The Senator from Vermont is describing an agreement. I am curious. The Senator mentioned a few of the outside groups who are party to the agreement. Which Senators were a part of that agreement? I was the original sponsor of the V-chip. I wasn't a part of that agreement.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have great respect for the Senator from Vermont. I would not suggest he go back on an agreement he made with anybody. But I do want to make this point clearly. On January 31, 1994, I introduced legislation in the Senate calling for the V-chip. It was the first legislation introduced in the Senate on the V-chip. Within a year or so, with myself, my colleague and others, including Senator CONRAD especially, and Senator LIEBERMAN, the V-chip passed the Senate and became law. There is nothing, no agreement at all for most Members of the Senate about some V-chip versus any other restriction on legislative action. 
   The letter that was read earlier, that might have been from some people who were not necessarily involved in the V-chip issue. I am the one who introduced it. There might have been some people who made some commitments to somebody else that they would not do something. That is their business. If there are 6 or 8 or 10 of them, that is their business. But that is not the business of the other 90 Senators. They have made no such agreement. 
   This proposal complements the V-chip. This proposal works with the V-chip. This proposal is not at odds with the V-chip, and there is no such agreement I am aware of with almost all Members of the Senate that we should not take this baby step forward on this sensible proposition. 
   One more point: This is not content-based Government involvement. We already have a description that says if you are a television broadcaster you cannot, at 7:30 in the evening, broadcast the seven dirty words. You cannot do that. Why? Because we have decided certain things are inappropriate and the Supreme Court has upheld our capability of doing that through the Federal Communications Commission. 
   It is also inappropriate, and we used to think as a country that it was, to broadcast excessively violent programs in the middle hours of the evening when children are watching. The Senator from South Carolina and I simply want to go back to that commonsense standard. Suggesting somehow that we have no capability or no interest in determining what some broadcaster somewhere throws into America's living rooms is just outside the debate about what is real. What is real is we have a real responsibility. That is what is being addressed by the amendment offered here by the Senator from South Carolina. 
   Again, it is a baby step. I do not want anybody to be confused that somehow this is at odds with the V-chip. I introduced the V-chip. This is not at odds with the V-chip. It complements the V-chip, and this Congress and this Senate ought to agree to this amendment and we ought to do it this morning. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened to this debate. It reminds me of the three stages of denial: The fellow says I wasn't there when it happened; if I was there, I didn't do it; if I did it, I didn't mean it. 
   I have listened to the denial on this issue. We finally come to the point after three decades of debate, especially in the last 6 or 8 years, where the denial is to say we can't take a baby step forward on this important issue because somebody has reached an agreement somewhere with someone else. 
   I didn't reach an agreement with anybody. We have a V-chip. I introduced the first V-chip bill in the Senate January 31, 1994. We have a V-chip in law. But don't anybody stand up here and say that because we have a V-chip in law there was some deal someplace with somebody that prevents Members from doing what we ought to do now. Don't anybody say that, because I was not part of a deal. The Senator from South Carolina was not part of a deal, and I daresay that 90 other Senators in this Chamber were part of no deal with anybody about these issues. 
   This is common sense. This makes sense.  
   It seems to me that we ought not have anybody ever come to the floor of the Senate again to talk about this issue if Members are not willing to take this baby step in the right direction. 
   I am pleased to join the Senator from South Carolina in offering this amendment today to say we have had a lot of discussion, hundreds of studies, a lot of debate. Now we come to the time where we choose. Don't make excuses. Don't talk about some deal that doesn't exist for most Senators. Vote for this legislation.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this country made a promise years ago to the men and women who risked their lives in defense of this nation. They were promised that their health care needs would be provided for by a grateful nation. That promise is not being kept, and it is time to stop paying lip service to those who served this country so well. 
   The current state of veterans' health care funding is shameful. Spending on veterans' health care has seen no significant increase for three consecutive years, at the very time that more and more of our World War II and Korean war veterans are relying on the VA health care system. 
   In a memo to VA Secretary Togo West, Under Secretary for Health Dr. Kenneth Kizer expressed concern that a fourth year with a stagnant health care budget ``poses very serious financial challenges which can only be met if decisive and timely actions are taken.'' If increased funding is not secured even deeper cuts will be required such as ``mandatory employee furloughs, severe curtailment of services or elimination of programs, and possible unnecessary facility closures.'' 
   Today, veterans' health care facilities are laying off care-givers and other critical staff. 
   It is unlikely that the Senate will increase normal appropriations for veterans health care funding enough to correct three years of neglect. That is why Senator CONRAD and I are proposing an additional $1.7 billion in emergency spending to address the health care needs of our country's veterans. We need to keep our promises to those who have served our country and risked their lives to preserve our freedoms. This bill is a step in the right direction. 
   This legislation will help the Veterans' Administration keep up with medical inflation, provide cost of living adjustments for VA employees, allow new medical initiatives that the VA wants to begin (Hepatitis C screenings and emergency care services), address long-term health care costs, provide funding for homeless veterans, and aid compliance with the Patients Bill of Rights. 
   In light of other emergency measures this Congress is considering, it is our opinion that preventing a health care catastrophe for our veterans is of equal, if not greater, importance than funding items like the NATO infrastructure fund and overseas military construction projects. Congress is debating right now, many new emergencies, new programs, and new initiatives. I'm not passing judgment on those decisions. 
   What I am saying, is that because of insufficient funding, and unforeseen health care needs, we have an emergency right now, in our ability to honor our commitment to this nation's veterans. We must not break our promise. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to swiftly approve this legislation. The veterans who proudly served their country deserve no less.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor, along with my colleague from South Carolina, Senator HOLLINGS, of the amendment he has just introduced, the Children's Protection From Violent Programming Act amendment. 
   That is kind of a long title. What it means is Senator HOLLINGS and I would like to restore in television broadcasting a period of time during the evenings when children are likely to be watching television, where the television programming would not be containing excess violence. 
   The reason we feel that way is study after study, year after year--in fact, for decades--studies have shown the excessive violence in television programming hurts our children. Yet, if you evaluate television programming during what would normally be considered family viewing hours in this country, you will find the language has become more coarse, words are used that were previously not used, that are not suitable for children. You will also find substantial amounts of programming violence, gratuitous violence, during those shows. 
   Some would say, what about censorship? I think there are times when it is appropriate for the Federal Communications Commission to establish a family viewing period in the evening where the television broadcasting would be more appropriate, more suitable for our children, when children are watching those programs. We already have an instance dealing with obscenity, and the Supreme Court has upheld the opportunity and the responsibility given the Federal Communications Commission to carve out a period in which certain kinds of words and obscenities cannot be used because it is inappropriate for them to be used at a time when we expect children to be watching television. 
   We believe the same ought to be true with respect to television violence. One might say, this is much ado about nothing; television violence is nothing new; it is really not very important. Yet that is in defiance of all the conclusions of virtually all the studies. By the time young children graduate from high school in our country, they will have gone to school in classrooms for about 12,500 hours of their lives. But they will have watched television for about 20,000 hours. They have sat in a classroom 12,500 hours and sat in front of a television set 20,000 hours. Regrettably, too many of them are more a product of what they have watched than what they have read. 
   What is it they are watching? Some years ago I sponsored a project with a college on the North Dakota-Minnesota border that created a television violence report card. Volunteers at that college watched television programs for an entire week and cataloged each and every program and produced a report card on what kind of violence on television was being portrayed to our children. If you simply condense what our children are watching on television--yes, even during what would be considered family viewing hours--it is quite remarkable. 
   Imagine if someone came to your door tomorrow and said: You know, you have two children. They are age 6 and 9. We would like to put on a dramatic play for them. We have a group of actors out here in our van and we have some stage props. We would like to come into your home, into your living room, and we would like to put on a little play for your children. 
   So they come in. In the living room they put on a play. In this dramatic play they shoot each other, stab each other, beat each other up. Blood runs freely. There is screaming, 
   there is horror. 
   You would probably say to those actors: You are just committing child abuse in my living room, doing that in front of my children. What on Earth can you be thinking of? Yet that is exactly what happens in our living rooms with that electronic box, with programming coming to our children at times when children are watching television, programming that is not fit for children. 
   So the response they have is, turn the television set off. Easy to say. Of course, most homes have a good number of television sets, probably two or three in different parts of the homes. In many homes there are circumstances where the parents are attentive parents, good parents, who try very hard to supervise the children's viewing habits, but it is very, very hard to do. 
   In fact, if you were watching, one day recently, a television set that depicted the unspeakable horror that was visited upon those students in Littleton High School, in the middle of the live reports with SWAT teams and students running out of school, with the understanding that children had been murdered, in the middle of all that one television network took a break and on came a commercial--of course, louder than everything else because commercials are always louder--advertising that you really needed to pay attention to their next big program. The next program was ``Mr. Murder.'' You really needed to watch ``Mr. Murder'' because this was going to be exciting. 
   All of this, coming at our children in television programming, study after study points out, hurts our children. This is not helpful to children. It is hurtful to children. 
   Newton Minow, many, many years ago--1961 in fact--said, ``Television is a vast wasteland of blood, thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism and murder.'' He said, ``In 1961 I worried that my children would not benefit much from television. But in 1991 I worry that my children will actually be harmed by it.'' 
   Television executives produce some wonderful programming as well. You can turn to certain programs on television and be struck by the beauty and the wonder and the information. I have sat with my children watching the History Channel, for example, or certain programs on the Discovery Channel. I should not begin naming them. There are some wonderful, beautiful things from time to time on television. 
   But there are some ugly, grotesque things on television as well, some of which come through our television sets during times children are expected to be watching. 
   What the Senator from South Carolina proposes is very simple: to go back to a time when we had in this country a period described by the FCC as a ``family viewing period'' that would be relatively free of gratuitous violence being displayed in those programs. 
   Is that so extreme, so radical? Do we really believe that we have to hurt our children in order to entertain our adults? I do not think so. It does not make any sense to me. There is plenty of opportunity in a lot of areas to entertain adults in this country, but it seems to me perfectly reasonable that at certain times when you expect families to be watching with children in the household that we could try to reduce the amount of violence on television. 
   I understand that some will portray this as a terrible idea. They will say we now have some ratings systems, and the ratings will give parents the capability of better supervising their children's viewing habits. That is true. I commend the broadcasting industry for having ratings. Not all do. One of the major networks has declined. The ratings themselves have not been used very much.  
   We have a V-chip that is coming in all new television sets. I offered the first V-chip bill in the Senate some years ago. That is now law, and that will help parents sort out the programming with certain violent scenes. 
   The fact is, we need to do more. The Senator from South Carolina and I have offered an amendment that we think will be helpful. We do not believe it has constitutional problems. This is not about free speech. You can say pretty much what you want to say and you can depict violence, but we are saying during a certain period of time, you cannot do it in a way that injures children. 
   I thought it might be useful to go over a couple of the pieces of evidence that most all of us have become acquainted with in all of the studies and hearings that we have had. I guess I have been involved in this issue for 7, 8 years. We have had hearings in the Commerce Committee and elsewhere. 
   I have a couple of young children who are now age 12 and age 10. We try very hard to make certain that we monitor their viewing habits. Our 12-year-old said to us: Well, friends of ours are able to go to movies that are PG-13 movies. 
   We say: That might be something their parents let them do, but we don't. We don't want you to see material that is inappropriate. 
   Movies have ratings, and so you make affirmative decisions whether you are going to go out or allow your child to go out with someone else and see a movie. But television is different. Television is in our family rooms, in our homes. When we turn that dial on the television, the programming that is shown on that television set is programming that is offered for entertainment and for profit. 
   The first amendment allows people to produce all kinds of programming. As I mentioned before, there are some wonderful, wonderful things on television. There is also some trash on television. It seems to me it would be helpful for parents to have the assistance of the Federal Communications Commission and broadcasters in complying with an amendment of this sort adopted by the Congress that will give parents the feeling that during 
   certain periods, they will not have to worry about what kind of violent scenes are going to be displayed to their children on that television set. 
   I have a fair amount of things I want to say about the amendment in addition to this, but we have a conference committee meeting. The appropriations conference committee is ongoing in the basement of this building, and I am a conferee, so I must return. I know Senator HOLLINGS and I will be back on the floor tomorrow morning and will be speaking on behalf of this amendment. 
   My hope is between now and then we will be able to encourage other Members of the Senate to be supportive of this amendment. I know others have come out. I have been in the conference committee, and I have not been here for much debate on the juvenile justice bill. 
   Also tomorrow, I want to take a moment to describe a visit I just made to the Oakhill Detention Center in Laurel, MD. I went out there because I wanted to sit down and talk with juvenile offenders. I wanted to try to understand from judges who were there, from prosecutors and from public defenders, and from the juvenile offenders themselves: What is going on? 
   I sat with a young boy who had been in a gang and shot three times and sold drugs at age 12. 
   I sat with a girl who was 15 years old. She had a baby 2 years previous to that. She was abused by her mother. She sold drugs at age 13. 
   I sat with another young boy who was selling drugs at age 12 who had been involved with guns and very serious offenses. 
   These are kids who shot people, kids who committed armed robbery, kids who were in a lot of trouble. 
   One of the boys said something that was quite remarkable--most all of them came from circumstances of really difficult conditions, no parental supervision. In fact, the young girl said her mother was a drug addict and told her, from the moment she was able to understand what her mother was saying, that she would never amount to anything. She told this girl: You will never amount to anything and I never wanted you in the first place. That was from a drug-addict mother. This young girl is now locked up and has been convicted of selling drugs and other criminal acts. She has a baby and is only 15 years old. 
   We talked about supervision, how do you get your life straight? Who cares about you? Somebody said: But you need to have a parent check up on you once in a while, don't you? 
   This young boy said: No, you don't need a parent to check up on you once in a while. That's the problem. 
   If you have maybe a grandparent or uncle and aunt and someone checks in once in a while, once in a while is not enough for children. Children need help, need parental supervision, not once in a while. 
   I spent a half day out at the Oakhill Detention Center just talking with kids to try to understand. I should also say--I will talk a bit about it tomorrow--there is another part of that Oakhill Detention Center that left me feeling a little buoyant and hopeful. 
   There were some young men--in this case it was older young boys, some young boys who had committed horrible crimes, who had been drug addicts from age 12 on to about 17, 18, young boys in a program to shed themselves of their drug addiction and to turn their lives around. One young boy was going to be released the 
   Friday I was there. This is a couple weeks ago, and he had a job. He had gone out for an interview and had gotten himself a job. 
   This young guy had gone through the drug program. He has become straight. It is fascinating to listen to him describe his background, where he wants to go, and what he now knows he needs to do to get his life back in order. 
   The reason I want to talk about it is part of this issue of juvenile justice is, yes, detention and protection and law enforcement, and another part of it is to say there is something else here that we need to do to help. I know that is a debate that has occurred on this floor now for many, many hours. But mentoring programs, afterschool programs--there are a lot of programs that can make a difference in young people's lives, especially programs dealing with drugs. Drugs were at the root of a lot of the troubled lives of the young children whom I saw at this detention center. 
   I hope we can come back tomorrow and talk a little bit about the Juvenile Justice Act.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor briefly today to talk about two issues. First, tomorrow the appropriations conference begins between the House and the Senate on the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. That includes specifically the President's request for emergency appropriations to be made for some agricultural spring planting loans, some emergency appropriations to be made for the purpose of helping the victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America, and then since that time the President has made new recommendations on emergency funding for the Defense Department needs as a result of the actions in Kosovo. 
   The House of Representatives took a request by President Clinton for nearly $6 billion in added funds for the military especially, but including some humanitarian relief for the actions in Kosovo, and added to that $6 billion of emergency funding nearly $7 billion more, to reach a total of close to $13 billion in emergency funding. 
   A number of us believe that, while we are on the subject of emergencies and in a supplemental appropriations conference, it would be inappropriate to add $7 billion to the defense budget for emergency needs relating to Kosovo--although some of it has very little relationship to Kosovo, it has a relationship to what is called ``readiness'' in defense accounts and other things--that it would be inappropriate to consider that without considering other emergency needs here at home on the domestic front. One of those is agriculture. 
   The plight of the family farmer in this country has been pretty well described by myself and others on the floor of the Senate in recent months. The Congress did some emergency work last fall to provide some income support to family farmers above and beyond the current farm bill. But it is not nearly enough. 
   We now come to May of 1999, at a time in which prices for many commodities in agriculture, in constant dollars, are at Depression level, and we are going to lose thousands, tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of family farmers if we decide to do nothing. Tomorrow's conference between the House and Senate may be the only opportunity that exists this year to provide support for emergency funding, to add some income price support to family farmers, which they desperately need. 
   This chart shows what is happening in rural America. This map shows counties marked in red which are being depopulated in our country. These are counties that have lost at least 10 percent of their population in the last 18 years. You can see on this map the large red area that shows the middle of this country--the farm belt--is being depopulated, people are leaving. 
   Why are people leaving the farm belt in droves, and especially now in more recent years? Why are people leaving their family farms, leaving the farm belt, and leaving rural counties? The answer is, family farmers cannot make a living when they produce grain and then have to sell it at a price far below their cost of production. It does not work that way. You go broke. Bad trade agreements, concentration in agricultural industries--there are a whole series of reasons--but the central reason, it seems to me, is low prices. If you do not get a decent price for that which you produce, you are not going to be able to make a decent living. 
   The question for this country is, What kind of price supports are available to farmers when market prices collapse? Every one of us in this Chamber would prefer that farmers received their prices from the marketplace. But when the marketplace collapses, farmers load a couple hundred bushels of wheat on their trucks, drive to the elevators, are told that wheat has no value, or has very little value, then the question for Congress is, Do we want family farmers in our future? And, if we do, What kind of income support are we willing to offer to create a bridge over that price valley when prices collapse? 
   The largest enterprises, the big agrifactories, will make it across that valley. They are big enough, strong enough, have the financial resources to make it across that price valley. It is the family farmer who will not make it. So the question for the Congress is, Do we care about family farming? And, if we do, what can we do to provide some income support when prices collapse? 
   A number of us will offer, during this deliberation in the conference between the House and the Senate on emergency needs, a proposal to restore some emergency funding to family farmers. There are lots of ways of doing that. I have my own feeling about how to do  it. Senator HARKIN and I, along with Senator CONRAD and others--Senator HARKIN and I, incidentally, will be in the conference tomorrow, are prepared to offer some proposals to deal with emergency needs, it is not just the Defense Department that has emergency needs, family farming is in a full-scale emergency in this country. 
   This Congress must take steps to save it. Tomorrow, again, Senator HARKIN, myself and some others in the conference on appropriations, of which Senator HARKIN and I are conferees, intend to raise this question in a very forceful way and push very aggressively for action on an emergency basis with our colleagues. 
   Republican and Democrat colleagues here in this Chamber understand that we face a very serious problem. All of my colleagues who come from the farm belt have said the same thing. Family farmers are in trouble. There is no disagreement about that. There might be some disagreement about the mechanism by which we address this question, but I think everyone here, with whom I share the long-term interests of the welfare of family farming, believes that we need, during periods of collapsed prices, to provide some income price support. The question is how do we do that. My hope is the first step will be tomorrow during the conference that we have with the House of Representatives.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I may address one additional issue, this deals with Kosovo and Mr. Milosevic. There was a piece published in the Washington Post on Sunday, written by Mark S. Ellis, that I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks on Kosovo.

   Mr. DORGAN. The piece by Mr. Ellis is entitled ``Non-Negotiable, War Criminals Belong in the Dock, Not at the Table.'' 
   I wanted to bring this piece to the attention of my colleagues because Mr. Ellis says it well. He points out that we are at a time and a place, dealing with Mr. Milosevic in Kosovo, when it is all of our responsibilities to bring Mr. Milosevic to justice. 
   Some would say, well, how do you arrest someone who is not accessible to you? It doesn't matter, as far as I am concerned, whether it's possible to apprehended and arrest him. We have a responsibility in this case, just as I felt we did in the case of Saddam Hussein, to make the case against these leaders for the war crimes they have committed and to bring them to trial before an international tribunal, try them, and, hopefully, convict them as war criminals. To not do that, it seems to me, will be to continue to have to deal with people who have committed genocide and war crimes that have brought unspeakable horror to the people of Kosovo, and to continue to have to deal with them in the future. 
   I know some in this country and elsewhere say the problem is, if you push aggressively to try Mr. Milosevic as a war criminal and ultimately have to negotiate with him some sort of negotiated settlement in the Balkans, it is very hard to negotiate with someone you have identified as a war criminal. That is a lot of psychobabble, as far as I am concerned. 
   We have already decided this fellow is a war criminal by virtue of our actions in NATO. NATO decided that the genocide and ethnic cleansing that were occurring in Kosovo could not be allowed to stand. 
   I think it might be useful to read through a list of some of the allegations. By no means is this a definitive list, it is just a small sliver: the village of Goden, the execution of 20 men and then the burning of the entire village; Malakrusa, 112 men shot and their bodies burned; Pastasel, 70 ethnic Albanian bodies discovered; Pec, at least 50 ethnic Albanians killed and buried in their own yards; Podujevo, the execution of 200 military age men and 90 percent of the village burned as well; summary execution; robbery; rape; forced expulsion. 
   We now have seen the march of nearly 1 million people displaced from their homeland, villages burned, looted, and plundered. One refugee said, ``16 special policemen appeared shooting their automatic weapons in the air. Two families had strayed from the group and the Serbs opened fire, killing every 
   member of both families, except for a 2-year-old boy who had been protected by his mother. She hid the baby in front of her and saved him. I saw this with my own eyes,'' this refugee said, ``maybe 150 feet from me.'' 
   In 1992, Secretary of State Eagleburger publicly identified Mr. Milosevic as a war criminal; 1992, 7 years ago. Mr. Eagleburger is one of the most respected foreign policy thinkers in our country. He said Mr. Milosevic was a war criminal in 1992. What does that mean, to say someone is a war criminal or for our country to allege someone is a war criminal, if we decide to do nothing about it, if an international tribunal exists by which someone can and should be tried but we decide, no, we don't really want to do that in the face of mass executions, in the face of ethnic cleansing? We say we really don't want to do that because we may need to negotiate a settlement to this conflict. 
   It was a mistake not to go to an international tribunal and convict Saddam Hussein as a war criminal so that forever after he would be branded a war criminal. He is now, many years later, of course, still running Iraq. He does not have the stigma of having been convicted in absentia as a war criminal. He should have. The same, in my judgment, is true of Mr. Milosevic. 
   To read a paragraph from Mr. Ellis's wonderful piece in the Washington Post, he said:  
   When I watched the bus loads of new arrivals enter Stenkovec camp, I saw a small girl's face pressed against the window. Her hollow eyes seemed to stare at no one. History was being repeated. In his opening statement at the Nuremberg trials in 1945, U.S. chief prosecutor Robert H. Jackson said, ``The wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so calculated, so malignant, and so devastating that civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored because it cannot survive their being repeated.'' Jackson was expressing the hope that law would somehow redeem the next generation that similar atrocities would never again be allowed. Today, we must hold personally liable those individuals who commit atrocities in the former Yugoslavia. To negotiate with the perpetrators of these crimes not only demeans the suffering of countless civilian victims, it sends a clear signal that justice is expendable, that war crimes can go unpunished. Inevitably, lasting peace will be linked to justice, and justice will depend on accountability. Failing to indict Milosevic in the hope that he can deliver a negotiated settlement makes a mockery of the words ``Never Again.''  
   I am not an expert in this region. I have been to Yugoslavia, when it was Yugoslavia. I sat at an outdoor restaurant on a beautiful evening and watched wonderful people, just like my neighbors in Regent, ND, just like North Dakotans or Kansans or other folks, and it occurred to me that it was a wonderful country with a lot of wonderful people. Of course, we now know that what has happened as a spark occurs in an area, and Mr. Milosevic follows up the spark with ethnic cleansing, producing a calamity. We see the horrors inflicted on people, in some cases by their previous neighbors, that you would have thought unthinkable. Something is dreadfully wrong when the rest of the world allows a dictator like Mr. Milosevic to inflict ethnic cleansing and the kind of horror he has inflicted on the people of Kosovo. 
   That is why NATO and the United States have engaged in airstrikes. It is why all of us hope this conflict ends soon and that Kosovars are returned to their homes. Also, Mr. Milosevic, at least from my standpoint, should be brought before an international tribunal and tried even in absentia, if necessary, as a war criminal and convicted as a war criminal to send a signal to the world that this new world order will not allow this to go unpunished. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Texas, based on the previous agreement, is to be recognized to offer two amendments. I heard his call for other Members to come with amendments. I have a couple of amendments which I intend to offer. I would not expect the Senator to include those in the list of amendments he intends to accept, but nonetheless I also wish to make a statement about the bill generally today. I have come over several times, as the Senator knows, and it has not been convenient to be able to do so with respect to other schedules, and I understand that. But I wonder if the Senator could give me some notion of when I might be able to be recognized, at which time I would make the statement I intend to make about the bill generally and then offer an amendment.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are debating a piece of legislation in the Senate that is called the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. 
   I come today with the confession I am probably hopelessly old fashioned on this issue. For those who have a vision of re-landscaping the financial system in this country with different parts operating with each other in different ways and saying that represents modernization, then I am just hopelessly old fashioned, and there is probably nothing that can be said or done that will march me towards the future. 
   I want to sound a warning call today about this legislation. I think this legislation is just fundamentally terrible. I hear all these words about the industry remaking itself--banks, security firms and insurance companies, and that we'd better catch up and put a fence around where they are or at least build a pasture in the vicinity of where they are grazing. What a terrible idea. 
   What is it that sparks this need to modernize our financial system? And what does modernization mean? This chart shows bank mergers in 1998, in just 1 year, last year, the top 10 bank mergers. We have discovered all these corporations have fallen in love and decided to get married. Citicorp, with an insurance company--that is a big one--$698 billion in combined assets; NationsBank--BankAmerica, $570 million; and the list goes on. This is a massive concentration through mergers. 
   Is it good for the consumers? I don't think so. Better service, lower prices, lower fees? I don't think so. Bigger profits? You bet. 
   What about the banking industry concentration? The chart shows the number of banks with 25 percent of the domestic deposits. In 1984, 42 of the biggest banks had 25 percent of the biggest deposits. Now only six banks have the biggest deposits. That is a massive concentration. 
   I didn't bring the chart out about profits, but it will show --this is an industry that says it needs to be modernized--banks have record-breaking profits, security firms have very healthy profits, and most insurance companies are doing just fine. Why is there a need to modernize them? 
   So we must ask the question, what about the customer? What impact on the economy will all of this so-called modernization have? 
   It is interesting to me that the bill brought to the floor that says, ``Let's modernize this,'' is a piece of legislation that doesn't do anything about a couple of areas which I think pose very serious problems. I want to mention a couple of these problems because I want to offer a couple of amendments on them. 
   I begin by reading an article that appeared in the Wall Street Journal, November 16, 1998. This is a harbinger of things to come, just as something I will read that happened in 1994 is a harbinger of things to come, especially as we move in this direction of modernization.  
   It was Aug. 21, a sultry Friday, and nearly half the partners at Long-Term Capital Management LP [that's LTCM, a company] were out of the office. Outside the fund's glass-and-granite headquarters, a fountain languidly streamed over a copper osprey clawing its prey. 
   Inside, the associates logged on to their computers and saw something deeply disturbing: U.S. Treasurys were skyrocketing, throwing their relationship to other securities out of whack. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was swooning--by noon, down 283 points. The European bond market was in shambles. LTCM's biggest bets were blowing up, and no one could do anything about it.  
   This was a private hedge funding.  
   By 11 a.m., the [hedge] fund had lost $150 million in a wager on the prices of two telecommunications stocks involved in a takeover. Then, a single bet tied to the U.S. bond market lost $100 million [by the same company]. Another $100 million evaporated in a similar trade in Britain. By day's end, LTCM [this hedge fund in New York] had hemorrhaged half a billion dollars. Its equity had sunk to $3.1 billion--down a third for the year.  
   This company had made bets over $1 trillion. 
   Now, what happened? They lost their silk shirts. But of course, they were saved because a Federal Reserve Board official decided we can't lose a hedge fund like this; it would be catastrophic to the marketplace. So on Sunday night they convened a meeting with an official of the Federal Reserve Board, and a group of banks came in as a result of that meeting and used bank funds to shore up a private hedge fund that was capitalized in the Caymen Islands for the purpose, I assume, of avoiding taxes. Bets of over $1 trillion in hedges--they could have set up a casino in their lobby, in my judgment, the way they were doing business. But they got bailed out. 
   This was massive exposure. The exposure on the hedge fund was such that the failure of the hedge fund would have had a significant impact on the market. 
   And so we modernize our banking system. This is unregulated. This isn't a bank; it is an unregulated hedge fund, except the banks have massive quantities of money in the hedge fund now in order to bail it out. 
   What does modernization say about this? Nothing, nothing. It says let's pretend this doesn't exist, this isn't a problem, let's not deal with it. 
   So we will modernize our financial institutions and we will say about this problem--nothing? Don't worry about it? 
   I find it fascinating that about 70 years ago in this country we had examples of institutions the futures of which rested on not just safety and soundness of the institutions themselves but the perception of safety and soundness, that is, banks. Those institutions, the future success and stability of which is only guaranteed by the perception that they are safe and sound, were allowed, 70 years ago, to combine with other kinds of risk enterprises--notably securities underwriting and some other activities--and that was going to be all right. That was back in the Roaring Twenties when we had this go-go economy and the stock market was shooting up like a Roman candle and banks got involved in securities and all of a sudden everybody was doing well and everybody was making massive amounts of money and the country was delirious about it. 
   Then the house of cards started to fall. As investigations began and bank failures occurred and bank holidays were declared, from that rubble came a description of a future that would separate banking institutions from inherently risky enterprises. A piece of legislation called the Glass-Steagall Act was written, saying maybe we should learn from this, that we should not fuse inherently risky enterprises with institutions whose perception of safety and soundness is the only thing that can guarantee their future success. So we created circumstances that prevented certain institutions like banks from being involved in other activities such as securities underwriting. 
   Over the years that has all changed. Banks have said, because everybody else has decided they want to intrude into our business--and that is right, a whole lot of folks now set themselves up in a lobby someplace and say we are appearing to be like a bank or want to behave like a bank--the banks say if that is the case, we want to get into their business. So now we have the kind of initiative here in the Congress that says: Let's forget the lessons of the past; let's believe the 1920s did not happen; let's not worry about Glass-Steagall. In fact, let's repeal Glass-Steagall; let's decide we can merge once again or fuse together banking enterprises and more risky enterprises, and we can go down the road just as happy as clams and everything will be just great. And of course it will not. 
   I mentioned hedge funds--talk about risk. How about derivatives? Incidentally, those who vote for this bill will  remember this at some point in the future when we have the next catastrophic event that goes with the risks in derivatives. Fortune magazine wrote an article, ``The Risk That Won't Go Away; Financial Derivatives Are Tightening Their Grip on the World Economy and No One Knows How to Control Them.'' Somewhere around $70- to $80 trillion in derivatives. 
   I wrote an article in 1994 for the Washington Monthly magazine and derivatives at that point were $35 trillion. You know something, today in this country banks are trading derivatives on their own proprietary accounts. They could just as well put a roulette wheel in the lobby. They could just as well call it a casino. Banks ought not be trading derivatives on their proprietary accounts. I have an amendment to prohibit that. I don't suppose it would get more than a handful of votes, but I intend to offer it. 
   Is it part of financial modernization to say this sort of nonsense ought to stop; that banks ought not be able to trade derivatives on their own proprietary accounts because that is inherently gambling? It does not fit with what we know to be the fundamental nature of banking and the requirement of the perception of safety and soundness of these institutions. Does anybody here think this makes any sense, that we have banks involved in derivatives, trading on their own proprietary accounts? Does anybody think it makes any sense to have hedge funds out there with trillions of dollars of derivatives, losing billions of dollars and then being bailed out by a Federal Reserve-led bailout because their failure would be so catastrophic to the rest of the market that we cannot allow them to fail? 
   And as banks get bigger, of course, we also have another doctrine. The doctrine in banking at the Federal Reserve Board is called, ``too big to fail.'' Remember that term, ``too big to fail.'' It means at a certain level, banks get too big to fail. They cannot be allowed to fail because the consequence on the economy is catastrophic and therefore these banks are too big to fail. Virtually every single merger you read about in the newspapers these days means we simply have more banks that are too big to fail. That is no-fault capitalism; too big to fail. Does anybody care about that? Does the Fed? Apparently not. 
   Of course the Fed has an inherent conflict of interest. I think, if the Congress were thinking very clearly about the Federal 
   Reserve Board, they would decide immediately that the Federal Reserve Board is not the locus of supervision of banks. The Federal Reserve Board is in charge of monetary policy. It is fundamentally a conflict of interest to be listening to the Fed about what is good for banks when they are involved in running the monetary policy of this country. If the Federal Reserve Board were, in my judgment, doing what it ought to be doing, it would be leading the charge, saying we need to regulate risky hedge funds because banks are involved in substantial risk on these hedge funds. Apparently hedge funds have become too big to fail. Then there needs to be some regulation. 
   The Fed, if it were thinking, would say we need to deal with derivatives, and that bank trading on proprietary accounts in derivatives is absurd and ought not happen. Some will remember in 1994 the collapse in the derivative area. You might remember the stories. ``Piper's Managers' Losses May Total $700 Million.'' ``Corporation After Corporation Had to Write Off Huge Losses Because They Were Involved in the Casino Game on Derivatives.'' ``Bankers Trust Thrives on Pitching Derivatives But Climate Is Shifting.'' ``Losses By P&G May Clinch Plan to Change.'' 
   The point is, we have massive amounts of risk in all of these areas. The bill brought to the floor today does nothing to address these risks, nothing at all, but goes ahead and creates new risks by saying we will fuse and merge the opportunities for inherently risky economic activity to be combined with banking which requires the perception of safety and soundness. 
   We have all these folks here who know a lot more about this than I do, I must admit, who say: Except we are creating firewalls. We have subsidiaries, we have affiliates, we have firewalls. They have everything except common sense; everything, apparently, except a primer on history. I just wish, before people would vote for this bill, they would be forced to read just a bit of the financial history of this country to understand how consequential this decision is going to be. 
   I, obviously, am in a minority here. We have people who dressed in their best suits and they just think this is the greatest piece of legislation that has ever been given to Congress. We have choruses of folks standing outside this Chamber who spent their lifetimes working to get this done, to say: Would you just forget all that nonsense back in the 1930s about bank failures and Glass-Steagall and the requirement to separate risk from banking enterprises; just forget all that. Time has moved on. Let's understand that. Change with the times. 
   We have folks outside who have worked on this very hard and who very much want this to happen. We have a lot of folks in here who are very compliant to say: Absolutely, let me be the lead singer. And here we are. We have this bill, which I will bet, in 5, 10, 15 years from now, we will be back thinking of this bill like we thought of the bill passed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, in which this Congress unhitched the savings and loans so some sleepy little Texas institution could gather brokered deposits from all around America and, like a giant rocket, become a huge enterprise. And guess what. With all the speculation in the S&Ls and brokered deposits and all the things that went with it that this Congress allowed, what did it cost the American taxpayer to bail out that bunch of failures? What did it cost? Hundreds of billions of dollars. I will bet one day somebody is going to look back at this and they are going to say: How on Earth could we have thought it made sense to allow the banking industry to concentrate, through merger and acquisition, to become bigger and bigger and bigger; far more firms in the category of too big to fail? How did we think that was going to help this country? Then to decide we shall fuse it with inherently risky enterprises, how did we think that was going to avoid the lessons of the past? 
   Then the one question that bothers me, I guess, is--I understand what is in this for banks. I understand what is in it for the security firms. I understand what is in it for all the enterprises. What is in this for the American people? What is in it for the American people? Higher charges, higher fees? Do you know that some banks these days are charging people to see their money? We know that because we pay fees, obviously, to access our money at bank machines. But credit card companies, most of them through banks, are charging people who pay their bills on time because you cannot make money off somebody who wants to pay their bill every month. 
   If you have a credit card balance--incidentally, you need a credit card these days, because it is pretty hard to do business in cash in some places. You know with all the bills, everybody wants to use credit cards. Many businesses want you to use credit cards. So you use credit cards, then you pay off the entire balance at the end of every month because you don't want to pay the interest. Some companies have decided you should be penalized for paying off your whole balance. Isn't that interesting? You talk about turning logic on its head, suggesting we don't make money on people who pay off their credit card balance every month, so let us decide that our approach to banking is to say those who pay their credit card bill off every month shall be penalized. 
   Turning logic on its head? I think so. As I said when I started, I am likely to be branded as hopelessly old fashioned on these issues, and I accept that. I suspect that some day in some way others will scratch their heads and say, ``I wish we had been a bit more old fashioned in the way we assessed risk and the way we read history and the way we evaluated what would have made sense going forward in modernizing our financial institutions.'' 
   Oh, there is a way to modernize them all right, but it is not to be a parrot and say because the industry has moved in this direction, we must now move in this direction and catch them and circle them to say it is fine that you are here now. That is not the appropriate way to address the fundamental challenges we have in the financial services industry.  
   I am not anti-bank, anti-security or anti-insurance. All of them play a constructive role and important role in this country. But this country will be better served with aggressive antitrust enforcement, with, in my judgment, fewer mergers, with fewer companies moving in to the ``too big to fail'' category of the Federal Reserve Board, with less concentration. 
   This country will be better served if we have tighter controls, not firewalls that allow these companies to come together and do inherently risky things adjacent to banking enterprises, but to decide the lessons of the 1930s are indelible transcendental lessons we ought to learn and ought to remember. 
   Mr. President, I have more to say, but I understand my time is about to expire.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have sought recognition, because I intend to offer a couple of amendments to the pending legislation. I would like to discuss the underlying bill just a bit more, and then also offer the amendments and discuss the amendments. 
   I spoke earlier today about this legislation, which is called the Financial  Services Modernization Act of 1999, and said then that I am probably part of a very small minority in this Chamber, but I feel very strongly that this is exactly the wrong bill at exactly the wrong time. It misses all the lessons of the past and, in my judgment, it creates definitions and moves in directions that will be counterproductive to our financial future. 
   What does this bill do? It would permit common ownership of banks, insurance, and securities companies, and to a significant degree commercial firms as well. It will permit bank holding companies, affiliates, and bank subsidiaries to engage in a smorgasbord of expanded financial activities, including insurance and securities underwriting, and merchant banking all under the same roof. 
   This bill will also, in my judgment, raise the likelihood of future massive taxpayer bailouts. It will fuel the consolidation and mergers in the banking and financial services industry at the expense of customers, farm businesses, family farmers, and others, and in some instances I think it inappropriately limits the ability of the banking and thrift institution regulators from monitoring activities between such institutions and their insurance or securities affiliates and subsidiaries raising significant safety and soundness consumer protection concerns. 
   This morning I described what is happening in the financial services sector by showing a chart of big bank mergers just in the last year. You couldn't help but to have picked up a daily paper at some point last year and read a headline about another bank deciding to combine or merge with another large bank. 
   April 6, Citicorp decided it was going to grab up Travelers Group and have a $698 billion combined asset corporation--not exactly a mom and pop, but two big very successful companies decide they want to get hitched. 
   NationsBank apparently fell in love with BankAmerica. Bank One decided it wanted to be related to First Chicago, and Wells Fargo likes NorWest. So we have merger after merger, buyout after buyout, and the big banks get bigger. 
   We already have a circumstance in this free market economy of ours in which you ought to have easy entry and easy exit into the marketplace and the right to make money and to lose money. We already have a circumstance in banking called ``too big to fail.'' If you are big enough, the ordinary market rules don't apply to you. You have the old Federal Reserve Board out there. And the Fed says we have a list of banks that are ``too big to fail,'' meaning they have become so big that if they were to fail and made some pretty dumb decisions, lose a lot of money, that their failure would be so catastrophic and such a shock to the economic system in this country that we couldn't possibly let that happen. So we have a list of banks at the Federal Reserve Board. That list says these banks are ``too big to fail''--no-fault capitalism. But the list is growing. That list of ``too big to fail'' banks in America is growing because the big banks are getting bigger, and this record-breaking orgy of mergers in our country moves now at an accelerated rate unabated. 
   In the context of all of this--it is not just with banks but all financial services companies--at a time when banks, investment banks, underwriters of securities, insurance, and others are showing very handsome profits in our country, we are told, ``You know, what is really wrong here with America is we need to 
   modernize this system. The lack of modernization is hurting us. In fact, some U.S. banks are able to do things overseas they can't do here. What a shame. It is awful to hold them back,'' we are told. ``So let us modernize.'' 
   In ranching parlance, this would be like if the horse gets out of the barn, you decide, ``Let's find out where the horse is and build a new barn around the horse.'' That is what this is all about. Where I grew up we raised horses. When a horse got out of the barn, you know what we did. We went and chased the horse, caught the horse, and brought the horse back to the barn. That is not rocket science. I didn't have to take a lot of school courses to teach me that. You go bring the horse back. 
   But now, what they have decided is no. We will just decide, all right, the horses are out of the barn, and in the way things are supposed to work, in a manner that preserves safety and soundness of our banks, in a manner that preserves separation of certain kinds of activities--some that are inherently risky as opposed to those that require safety and soundness--things have happened. We are persuaded to get rid of all of the old rules, and we will rewrite them in a way that circumstances and activities have been happening in our country. We'll say those who have done it, OK, that is where you are, a new day, we will call it modernization. We will just say it is just fine. Well, it is not fine with me. 
   It is interesting that we live in 1999, now in the month of May, having experienced this remarkable economy. I am one who, with all of my colleagues, would say what a remarkable opportunity, to live in an economy that has virtually no inflation, has virtually full employment, seems to have economic growth that continues unabated, and whose stock market continues to set new records--23 days, another 1,000 points. You get the feeling, gee, the stock market is like one of those slot machines that pays off every time you pull the handle. Every time you put a quarter in you get a return back beyond what you put in. 
   There are people who have begun to invest in this economy of ours through mutual funds, and in the markets and so on who apparently believe there is only one direction for our economy and only one direction for our markets, and that is up, and single digit returns are not sufficient. Returns are now expected of 15, 20, 25, 30 percent a year. Of course, that will not continue. 
   We want a country with the twin economic goals of stable prices, full employment, and economic opportunity and growth. But we have been through periods in this country where when you sit down and add things up somehow the answer doesn't seem correct. This isn't all going to continue. One day in one way there will be adjustments. Companies selling 300 and 400 times earnings, we think that is going to continue? I don't think so. 
   What has happened in recent years in this country, despite all of the good news, is a series of economic activities by firms that 20 and 40 years ago would never have thought of engaging in those activities, and those activities which really represent kind of a new form of gambling by firms that should not be involved in gambling represents now an acceptable kind of behavior. 
   Let me give you some examples of some of it. I started this morning. But I am going to read a bit more, because I think it is important for everybody to understand and hear this. 
   I mentioned ``too big to fail''--big banks that have become so big that our Government says they can't be allowed to fail. Of course, we continue then every day to see more mergers to allow more banks to join that ``too big to fail'' list. 
   It is not just the banks. I want to read the story again of Long Term Capital Management in an article from the Wall Street Journal last fall, because I think it is illustrative of not just what is happening at this moment in this chapter of our history but also what happened in 1994 with the massive losses across our country in derivatives described in this Fortune article, ``The Risk That Won't Go Away,'' ``Financial derivatives tightening their grip on the world economy, and no one knows how to control them.'' 
   Derivatives, unregulated hedge funds, banks, holding companies that now fuse and merge, banks underwriting securities, insurance--is all of that a cause for concern? 
   Let me read a couple of things and see whether perhaps this can be interpreted in a manner differently than those who have drafted the current legislation. 
   It is not a secret that I have said I think this current bill, the underlying bill, financial modernization for 1999, is a terrible bill. I don't mean disrespect to either the chairman of the committee or the ranking member of the committee. I don't mean any disrespect to them. 
   This is moving this country in the wrong direction. This is terrible legislation to be considering at this point. 
   Long Term Capital Management is a private company; big investors, all rich. You have to be rich to invest in  Long Term Capital Management. You have to be smart. A smart operator with lots of money formed a private company called Long Term Capital Management and began betting. I will describe the bets in a moment.  
   It was Aug. 21, [last year] a sultry Friday, and nearly half the partners at Long-Term Capital Management LP were out of the office.  
   Inside, the associates that day logged on to their computer and they saw something that began to strike some fear in their hearts:  
   U.S. Treasuries were skyrocketing, throwing their relationship to other securities out of whack. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was swooning--by noon, down 283 points. The European bond market was in shambles. LTCM's [Long-Term Capital Management, this hedge firm, their] bets were blowing up, and no one could do anything about it. 
   By 11 a.m. [in the morning] the fund had lost $150 million in a wager [they made] on the prices of two telecommunication stocks engaged in a takeover. Then, a single bet tied to the U.S. bond market lost $100 million. Another $100 million evaporated [the next hour] in a similar trade in Britain. By day's end [this private hedge company] LTCM had hemorrhaged half a billion dollars. Its equity had sunk to $3.1 billion--down a third for the year.  
   This is the Wall Street Journal's recount of the story:  
   Partners scrambled out of their offices and onto the trading floor as associates stared at their screens in disbelief. Making frantic phone calls around the globe, they reached John Meriwether, the fund's founder, at a dinner in Beijing. He boarded the next plane to the U.S. Eric Rosenfeld, a top lieutenant, called in from Sun Valley, Idaho, where he was settling in for a vacation. He left his wife and children behind and made an all-night trip back to Greenwich.  
   Then the brass assembled the next morning. It is 7 o'clock now, 7 a.m. on Sunday.  
   One after another, LTCM's partners, calling in from Tokyo and London, reported that their market had dried up. There were no buyers, no sellers. It was all but impossible to maneuver out of large trading bets [that they had.] They had seen nothing like it. 
   The carnage that weekend set off events unprecedented in the world of high finance, culminating with a $3.625 billion bailout funded by a consortium of 14 Wall Street banks and engineered by the Federal Reserve [Board.] LTCM lost more than 90 percent of its assets by the time it was bailed out, and the markets were roiled for weeks. Longer term, it forced many of the world's most sophisticated institutional investors to redefine the ways they manage risk and triggered calls for tougher regulation of hedge funds, those freewheeling investment pools that cater to the wealthy.  
   Here is a company that lost $3.6 billion. What happened? It gets bailed out in a consortium of banks investing at the behest of the Federal Reserve Board at meetings arranged by the Federal Reserve Board. 
   We will hear a bit more about this case because it relates to an amendment I will be offering.  
   In an industry populated by sharp money managers, LTCM had the most renowned of all--including Nobel Prize winners Robert Merton and Myron Scholes. But in the end, it wasn't all rocket science. It was about smart marketing-appealing to a wealthy clientele who wanted to be able to say their money was being managed by a passel of Ph.D.s. And it was about massive borrowing, up to $50 for every dollar invested. Long-Term Capital Management was, ultimately, like a supermarket--a high-volume, low-margin business, trying to eke out small profits from thousands of individual transactions. 
   ``Myron once told me they are sucking up nickels from all over the world,'' says Merton Miller, a University of Chicago business professor and himself a Nobel Prize winner in economics.  
   Continuing the quote:  
   ``But because they are so leveraged, that amounts to a lot of money.'' 
   All of which helps to explain how so many geniuses, sometimes overcoming divisions within their ranks, got it so wrong. And all the while, vanity, greed and a cult of personality blinded some of the world's most reputable financial institutions, from Wall Street stalwarts to Swiss banks, to the pitfalls inherent in such a strategy.  
   The reason I offer this is to say we are now talking today on the floor of the Senate about a strategy that says we want to ignore the lessons of history. We want to ignore the fact that in the go-go 1920s, everybody was making money at about everything, and banks decided to fuse their activities and be involved not just in banking, but also in underwriting securities and a range of other very risky enterprises. We are going to ignore those lessons we learned during that period. 
   When studies were done to determine what happened in the 1920s, one of the things they discovered was what you expect. If you have something called banks whose perception of safety and soundness is at the root of their stability and viability, when banks are fusing their activities with inherently risky activities--underwriting securities, for example--ultimately those kinds of risks, those bets that exist, overcome the perception and the reality of safety and soundness, and people begin getting worried and nervous and pulling their money out of banks and we have bank failures. 
   So the Congress in the 1930s passed a bill called Glass-Steagall which said: Learn the lessons; my gosh, let us not put activities together with banks that are so inherently risky. We should separate them forever. 
   So we did. And we prohibited certain kinds of investment and acquisition by banks and required that certain enterprises do business and compete in their own sphere. Banks were prohibited from being involved in most of the securities issues, underwriting securities and insurance and more. 
   Over the years that served this country pretty well. Banks have made the case in recent years--and they are right about this--everybody else has wanted to invade their territory. Everybody now wants to be a bank. If you are selling cars, you want to finance the cars; you want to be a bank. Everybody wants to create some sort of homogenized one-stop station where people can buy their insurance, buy their home, finance it. So banks say people are intruding on their turf and the only conceivable way we can compete is if we can compete on their turf as well. They want Glass-Steagall repealed. 
   Guess what? Here it is. The bill that sits on the floor of the Senate today repeals Glass-Steagall. It forgets apparently 60 or 70 years of history. It will all be all right. Don't you see, the economy is growing, unemployment is down, inflation is down, the stock market is up. Don't you understand, Senator DORGAN? 
   I guess not. Maybe I am hopelessly old fashioned. I think it is a fundamental mistake to decide to repeal Glass-Steagall and allow banks and all of the other financial industries to merge into a giant smorgasbord of financial services. Those who were around to vote to bail out the failed savings and loan industry, $500 billion of the taxpayers' money, are they going to want to be around 10 or 15 years from now when we see bailouts of hedge funds putting banks at risk? Or how about the banks not just bailing out a hedge fund but banks having the ownership of the hedge funds? 
   That is what we have now. This bailout of Long Term Capital Management says we have significant investments by some of the largest banks in these hedge funds. 
   Or how about derivatives? I am not an expert in this area, but I wonder how many Members of this body know about derivatives. How many know that banks in this country are trading in derivatives--not for customers, but in their own proprietary accounts? They could just as well set up a bingo parlor in their lobby. They could just as well decide to have a casino somewhere in their lobby. The kind of betting and wagering that is going on in proprietary trading of derivatives in an institution whose assets are guaranteed by the taxpayers of this country is just wrong. Someday somebody is going to wake up and say: Why didn't we understand that? Why didn't we understand the consequences of hundreds of billions of dollars or, yes, even trillions of dollars of wagers out there with deposits at risk? Why didn't we understand that did not make any sense? 
   I wrote an article about this in 1994 that was published in the Washington Monthly. At that point there were $35 trillion in derivatives being traded. Now it is $70 trillion. It is hard for me to even say the number; $70 trillion in derivatives. Does anybody here know the exposure that exists in the largest banks of proprietary trading on derivatives? I will bet not. Does anybody understand what this bill does in these areas? It says: Hedge funds, we don't want to manage those; let them go, let them do what they will. How about derivatives? It doesn't do anything. 
   This is a GAO report from May, 1994. It is 5 years ago: ``Financial Derivatives, Actions Needed To Protect The  Financial System.'' That report has been available for 5 years to all of the Members of Congress. If this legislation really was a modernization bill for financial institutions, you would have a solution to this issue in it. It would include my amendment that says no institution whose deposits are guaranteed by the American taxpayer will trade derivatives in their proprietary accounts--none of them. We will not allow gambling in the bank lobby. But of course the bill does not have that, so I will offer the amendment and it will be defeated because it is not in vogue, it is not in fashion. This bill moves in the other direction. It says, not only are things not wrong, don't be alarmed by hedge funds and derivatives; it says, let's just do more of what we have been doing that has caused some of this alarm. 
   As I mentioned, the piece of legislation before us repeals provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act that restrict the ability of banks and security underwriters to affiliate with one another. The bill repeals provisions in the Bank Holding Company Act by allowing a new category of financial holding company. This structure allows for a wide range of financial services to be affiliated, including commercial banking, securities underwriting, and merchant banking. And the new financial holding companies, by the way, may engage in the following: Lending and other traditional banking activities, insurance underwriting and agency activities, provide financial investment and economic advisory services, issue instruments representing interests in pooling of assets that a bank may own directly, securities underwriting and dealing, and mutual fund distribution, merchant banking. I think most listening to me understand my concern and deep reservations about the direction we are heading. 
   What about timing? This bill almost came to the floor of the Senate last year. I was one of those who objected, and as a result the legislation was not enacted. In fact, some of the folks who bring it to the floor today also objected because of some other issues. But it is now on the floor. It is in a different form than was passed out by the committee last year. But what about timing? It seems to me the past experiences we have had with banking and financial conglomerates in this country in this century, whose collapse has led to the adoption of the very 
   financial protection laws they seek to repeal today, ought to be a cautionary note to those of us in Congress and to the American people. It seems to me the recent experiences we had with a nearly $500-billion bailout of a collapsed savings and loan industry ought to have some consequences, at least in terms of awareness of those in Congress who had to go through that experience. 
   It seems to me the question marks that hang over the international marketplace and the international economy ought to give pause to some--a very difficult collapsed economy in some parts of Asia, a Russian economy that has virtually collapsed, economic problems in other parts of the world, a description in the country of Japan of the keiretsu--the circumstances in a market system in Japan where a keiretsu allows the combining of virtually all economic activities into four or five firms that work together as partners to accomplish ends; you put the bank and the manufacturer all together. 
   What has happened as a result of that Japanese experience? Would we want to trade our economy for the Japanese economy? I don't think so. One would think that would give some folks pause. 
   Or how about the red flags that ought to have been flying for all of us with respect to the regulators' recent experiences dealing with excessive risk-taking in our system? Does it give anybody pause that on a Sunday night some of the smartest folks, the folks who were viewed as geniuses in New York, who put together this hedge fund, they had to be bailed out by the Federal Reserve Board running some folks across the street to convene an emergency meeting and then sitting there, apparently convening a group in which substantial numbers of large banks ante up billions of dollars to bail out a private firm? Is that a red flag for anybody? It suggests a conflict of interest for the Federal Reserve Board, of course, because they regulate the very banks that were incentivized to ante up money to bail out a private firm in order to avoid some sort of economic catastrophe, an economic catastrophe for the country. That is why the Fed was involved--because this private firm, too, was too big to fail. Does that raise any red flags with anybody? It does with me. 
   Or we are told, if we do not do this, it is going to be a disadvantage. To whom? Are the banks doing well in this country? You are darned right they are doing well, making lots of money. Security underwriting firms, merchant banking firms, are we doing well? America's corporations, are they doing well? Sure. Look at the stock market. Look at the profit reports. When we pass this bill, everybody in this Chamber knows what is going to happen. The first thing that is going to happen is, we are going to have more and more and more mergers because this turns on the green light at the intersection. It says if you all want to get together and just get into one big financial swamp here and have a smorgasbord of financial services, then buy each other up, that's just fine. This orgy of mergers we have already seen will simply accelerate. Will that be good for this country? Of course not. 
   Those who preach the loudest about the free market system do the least to protect it. I guarantee it is true. It has been true ever since I came to the Congress. Those who bellow the loudest about the free market do the very least in this country to protect it. We are going to have a fight a little later this year about antitrust enforcement. One way to be sure the free market remains free, open to fair, competitive competition, is to make sure you enforce your antitrust laws against cartels and monopolies. Interestingly enough, those, again, who talk a lot about the free market are the least likely to be supportive of aggressive antitrust enforcement, to make sure the market is free, open, and competitive. 
   This is a highly complicated issue. I know there are big stakes all around. We have the biggest economic interests in the country working very hard to see their interests are served versus other interests. 
   I understand all that, and I understand my view is not the prevailing view. George Gobel once said: ``Did you ever think the world was a tuxedo and you were a pair of brown shoes?'' I feel like George Gobel on this issue. 
   I understand this bill is on the floor, and it is going to get passed by the Congress. People do not want to entertain this notion, that, gee, there might be some inherent risk out here. This is a case, as I said earlier, of deciding this is where the industry has decided it wants to go, so let's go ahead and put a lodge up so we can accommodate all their interests and where they want to be. 
   We have been through this before. Where they want to be is not necessarily where this country ought to have them. This country ought to be concerned about safety and soundness of its financial institutions first and foremost. That does not fit--it has never fit--with the understanding that you can merge the interests of banks and other financial and economic activities that are risky. 
   When you put things together that require safety and soundness with enterprises that have an inherent high risk, you are begging for trouble, and this country will get it. Our banks say to us, ``Well, others have done it; you can do it in other countries.'' Do you want to trade our economy for any other country at the moment? I don't think so. What they are doing in other countries is not the litmus test for what we decide as Americans to do to strengthen our economy, and this bill, in my judgment, if passed, will represent a giant step backward for our economy. 
   Let me ask one additional question. With all of the debate that I have heard since this legislation came to the floor of the Senate, do you know I have not heard anything about whether or why or if this bill is good for people. Nothing. I wonder if anybody can describe one single thing in this legislation that will be helpful to ordinary folks? 
   This morning, I talked about the fact we have banks and credit card companies that are saying to their customers these days--it is 1999, so things have changed. I wonder what my grandmother would think if she heard me  say there are banks and credit card companies saying to customers: If you pay off your bill every month, we are going to penalize you. 
   Isn't that Byzantine--we are going to penalize you for paying off your bill. In the old days, you got penalized for not paying your bill. No, the way you make money is for people to carry over a balance and charge a high interest rate. People who use a credit card to purchase every month and pay the full bill off every month are not very good customers; credit card companies do not want those folks around. 
   I read some examples this morning of companies that say, ``Well, you people, if you're going to pay off your bill like that, shame on you, we're going to charge you a service charge.'' 
   Shame on them. What has financial service come to with this sort of behavior? 
   Another point. We have a circumstance in this country where --we are going to have a bankruptcy bill later this year, and we will have this discussion later--credit cards, of course, are distributed to everybody in America. I have a 12-year-old son. His name is Brendon. He is a great young guy, a wonderful baseball player. He is a great soccer player. He is a good student. For his benefit, I should say a great student, but he is a good student. 
   I can describe how wonderful he is in a thousand different ways, but he is only 12. He received a letter in the mail one day from the Diners Club. The Diners Club said: Brendon Dorgan, we want to send you a preapproved Diners Club credit card. So my 12-year-old son appreciates Diners Club. I am sure he has an appetite to spend money. I see it from time to time. It is normally not on big purchases. Normally it is something sweet or 
   something that fizzes at the 7-Eleven, but my son does not need a Diners Club card. 
   Why would a 12-year-old get a Diners Club card? Why would Diners Club send my son a card? Because they send everybody a card. I assume it was a mistake, he got on the wrong list someplace. They send cards to college kids who have no income and no jobs and say, here is a preapproved bunch of credit for you; here is a card. It is just like a check. You go spend the money. We don't care you don't have a job. We don't care you don't have an income. Here is our card. Take it, please. 
   That is what is going on in our country today--penalizing people for paying their bills, sending credit cards to 12-year-old kids, sending credit cards to people who have no income or no job. Why, my grandmother would be mortified to think that is the ethic we think makes sense in this kind of an economy. 
   We cannot correct all of that in this discussion, but we can correct a couple things. I described not my son's credit card solicitation; I described derivatives traded on proprietary accounts in banks. I described potential regulation of risky hedge funds. Those are two big issues and very complicated issues. We can correct that. 
   I intend to offer two amendments. I will send the first amendment to the desk and then ask that it be set aside by consent, and then I will send to the desk the second one and describe it. The committee chairman and ranking member will then proceed with the bill. They have other amendments I know they are going to have to consider today. I know they want to move ahead and finish whatever business they have with this legislation. 
   My hope of hopes is enough Members of the Senate will take a look at this bill in final form and say this is a terrible bill, a terrible idea coming at a terrible time, and enough Members would vote against it to say: This is not modernization, this is a huge step back in time, and a huge pit in which we have lost the lessons that we learned earlier in this century. I do not have great hope that will happen, but, who knows, lightening strikes and perhaps at the end of this day, Members of the Senate will say: You know, this wasn't such a good idea after all.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will not explain this in great detail, except to say, as I described in my earlier remarks, my intention is to say it is inconsistent with the obligations and our expectations of institutions whose deposits are insured by depository insurance and, in fact, guaranteed by the American taxpayer for them to be trading in derivatives on their own proprietary accounts. 
   I understand banks being a conduit for the trading of derivatives for customers, but for banks in their own proprietary accounts to be taking the kinds of risks that exist in derivatives I think exposes all taxpayers in this country who are the guarantors of that deposit insurance to those kinds of risks. They may just as well put some kind of a slot machine in the lobby of a bank if they are going to trade in derivatives on their own account. 
   I say to the people who own the capital in these banks, if you want to gamble, go to Las Vegas. If you want to trade in derivatives, God bless you. Do it with your own money. Do not do it through the deposits that are guaranteed by the American people and by deposit insurance. My amendment prohibits the trading of derivatives on their proprietary account. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set aside.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to tell a story as I describe this amendment. About 10 years ago, I was serving in the House of Representatives on the Ways and Means Committee. Ten years ago, as you might recall, in this country we had the marketing of junk bonds; that is, noninvestment grade bonds by Drexel Burnham and Michael Milken. Junk bonds were used increasingly for hostile takeovers. It was a go-go economy. They held conferences and talked about how you could turn a minnow into a whale and arm a minnow with junk bonds and they will go and bite the tail off the whale. You had little companies buying big companies. It was a remarkable thing to see. 
   One of the things that occurred to me was how unhealthy and unholy it was in this country that junk bond sellers were parking junk bonds with savings and loans. Our savings and loans, whose deposits were insured by the Federal Government, were then ending up with junk bonds, noninvestment-grade bonds, in their portfolios, so that if the enterprise went belly up, the American taxpayers would end up paying the bill. 
   Let me give you the creme de la creme, the hood ornament on the excess. The hood ornament was that we had one of biggest casinos in the country built in Atlantic City, glitzy and big. Junk bonds were for the casino, noninvestment-grade bonds. With junk bonds they build the casino. The junk bonds get parked with the savings and loan. The savings and loan goes belly up. Guess who ends up with the junk bonds that are nonperforming and a big casino. The American taxpayer. The U.S. Government and the American taxpayer end up holding junk bonds that are nonperforming junk bonds in a casino. 
   How did that happen? Because it was all right according to our regulators, and all right according to law, for our savings and loans to go out and buy junk bonds and load up. One California S&L had, I think, nearly 60 percent of its assets involved in junk bonds. 
   So I got an amendment passed. It is now law. Some people have never forgiven me for it, because I got an amendment passed that said savings and loans--that is, those whose deposits are insured by the Federal Government--cannot purchase junk bonds and must divest those they have. 
   I had a devil of a time getting it passed, just an awful time. I got it passed. It became law and caused all kinds of chaos for those who were parking all these bonds at S&Ls, playing the financial roulette game they were playing. It was the right thing to have done for the taxpayers of this. 
   I mention that only because financial institutions will do what they must and will do what they can under the rules as long as we are looking the other way. I am not saying they are all irresponsible. I am saying they are all going to try to pursue the largest rate of return they can possibly pursue, especially if you have the deposits underwritten. Those institutions are going to take advantage of these opportunities. It was true in the 1980s; it will be true in the next decade as well. 
   The lesson with respect to junk bonds, the lesson with respect to derivatives and hedge funds, is that we have to be vigilant. Did the bank regulators jump on this and deal with it? No. In fact, the Secretary of the Treasury would come to the Ways and Means Committee. I would say: Mr. Secretary, we have a crisis going on here. What on earth are you doing? Sitting on your hands? Oh, no, Congressman DORGAN, there isn't a crisis at all; there's no problem. There is no problem here at all. 
   Well, the problem turned out to be hundreds of billions of dollars for the American taxpayer, because those who were supposed to be involved in regulation looked the other way.  
   As we pass this piece of legislation today, we would do ourselves a favor, I think, passing an amendment that would prohibit proprietary trading in derivatives by banks and also passing the amendment I just sent to the desk that would provide regulation for risky hedge funds that have at least $1 billion or more in assets. It is a handful of hedge funds, perhaps fewer than 50. They have aggressive leverage. It seems to me that while I would like to be more aggressive in the regulation of hedge funds, at least this should be a start in dealing with this issue. 
   Mr. President, I will not offer a third amendment. I will offer only these two amendments. I believe that the legislation is inappropriate at this time, and I intend to vote against the legislation on final passage. As I have said on a couple occasions this afternoon, I think this is a giant step backward. I think it is exactly the wrong direction for our country. I think it does 
   nothing for ordinary people, does not address any of the issues. It is something that will make a number of the largest enterprises in this country that are already making substantial profits very, very happy. I guarantee every Member of this body that if this legislation is passed, when you wake up day after day, week after week, and month after month, you will read the news of more and more and more mergers and greater concentration. 
   Then don't you come to the floor of the Senate and talk to me about competition and don't you come to the floor of the Senate and started preaching about free markets. The opportunity to respond to real competition and free markets, in my judgment, is, by turning this legislation down, enforcing strong antitrust enforcement, and being thoughtful about the things we have to do in the future to preserve the safety and soundness of our banks and, yes, to encourage investment and encourage economic activity in other sectors of our economy. 
   Let me conclude by saying I am not someone who thinks that big firms are bad. I don't believe that at all. Nobody is going to build a 757 jet airplane in the garage in Regent, ND. Economies of scale are important. Some of the largest enterprises in our country have contributed mightily to this country and its economy. But I also believe that what contributes most to this country is good old-fashioned healthy competition, broad-based economic ownership. I know it is a timeworn and, some consider, old-fashioned Jeffersonian notion of democracy that broad-based economic ownership is what eventually guarantees economic freedom and what eventually underscores and guarantees political freedom as well. That is something that is very important to this country's future. 
   We do not advance in that direction by passing legislation that will further concentrate and further provide inducements for more mergers and bigger, more concentration and bigger companies. That will not advance this country's interests. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to join all Americans in expressing my profound relief at the safe return of Sergeant Andrew Ramirez, Sergeant Christopher Stone, and Specialist Steven Gonzales from captivity in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
   I was necessarily absent from the Senate this morning in order to attend a technology conference in my home State of North Dakota. Had I been present, I would have gladly joined 92 of my colleagues in commending the Reverend Jesse Jackson, and the delegation of religious and political leaders he led, for their instrumental efforts in securing the release of these three Americans. A grateful nation owes them its gratitude.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the legislation that my colleagues, Senator MCCONNELL, Senator BENNETT, Senator CONRAD and I have jointly introduced--a piece of legislation called the Flag Protection Act. 
   This, at its roots, is about the Constitution. Some will say the Constitution is an easy issue. 
   A decade ago, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Texas statute, a statute which provided criminal sanctions for the burning of an American flag. The Supreme Court said, no, the desecration of a flag is an expression of speech. 
   That fellow in Texas had a constitutional right to do that. That was a 5-4 decision of the Supreme Court. I disagreed with that decision. I think the Supreme Court was wrong. But immediately--and for 10 years--there was an effort to amend the Constitution to overturn the Supreme Court's decision and allow a statute to be deemed constitutional that would prohibit the desecration of the American flag. 
   I have voted on two occasions against a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag desecration. Those who say it is an easy vote say it is just an amendment amending the Constitution. Let's just do it and protect the flag. 
   It might be easy for them; it is not easy for me. 
   Then there are those who say we should never amend the Constitution, that you have a right to desecrate the flag. They too say this is an easy choice. Let's just make that choice. 
   This decision has been just as difficult. I have agonized about this issue. 
   There are many, many Americans, over many, many years, who have shed their blood to nurture this country's liberties and freedoms. The burning of an American flag is a disgusting act, one that I personally do not think is protected under the first amendment of the Constitution. 
   The question is, however, what do you do to remedy this situation? Do you amend the Constitution, or is there a way to craft a statute saying flag desecration is wrong in a manner that the Supreme Court would say, yes, this statute will meet the test? 
   I believe there is. I have believed all along there is. I pledged to some folks back in my home State that I would review this, reanalyze it again. I have done that over and over. I have read everything that has been written by virtually all of the scholars on both sides of this issue. I conclude, once again, that our country is better served by reserving our attempts to alter the U.S. Constitution for those things that are extraordinary occasions, as one of the  authors of the Constitution, James Madison discussed. Then the Constitution should be amended only in circumstances when it is the only remedy. 
   Some 12 or 13 years ago, I went to Philadelphia in the summertime for the 200th birthday of the writing of the U.S. Constitution. I have told my colleagues this before, but I want to say it again, because it describes how I feel for the Constitution. 
   Two hundred years previously, 55 white men marched into the assembly room in Independence Hall, a room that is substantially smaller than this Chamber. Those 55 men wrote a Constitution for this country. Walking down the cobbled streets of Philadelphia, someone asked Benjamin Franklin, one of the 55, what they were doing. He said, we are writing a Constitution, if you can keep it. 
   Two hundred years after the writing of that Constitution, 55 of us were privileged to go back into the very same room. The chair where George Washington presided still sits in the front of the room. Mason sat over here, Madison, Ben Franklin. I was one of the 55 chosen, men, women, minorities. I come from a town of 300 people, a high school class of 9. I got goose bumps sitting in this room where they wrote the Constitution of the United States. I have never forgotten that day, thinking that I am in the room where the historic figures of our country created the framework for governance in our country. 
   That day is always etched in my memory when we debate the questions of whether we should amend the Constitution of the United States. 
   There have been 11,000 proposals to change America's Constitution. Outside of the first 10, the Bill of Rights, only 17 amendments have changed our Constitution in the more than two centuries of history in this country. 
   Now we have a proposal during these past 10 years to change the Constitution. Is it a serious proposal about a serious issue? Yes, it is. Our flag is important. So is our Constitution. It seems to me, as I said, our country is better served if there is a way to address the issue of flag desecration by passing a statute that will meet the test of the Supreme Court, to do that rather than alter our U.S. Constitution. 
   The piece of legislation we have introduced today has been reviewed by a number of constitutional experts, the Congressional Research Service and elsewhere, and they indicate they feel it does meet the test. It would be upheld by the Supreme Court. 
   To be able to enact a statute of this type and avoid altering the Constitution makes eminent good sense to me. I think future generations and our Founding Fathers would agree that it is worth the effort for us to find a way to protect our flag without having to wonder about the unintended consequences of altering this significant area of our Constitution that guarantees and preserves important rights for the citizens of our country. 
   Mr. President, I know that many who have invested a great amount of time and effort to enact a constitutional amendment will be sorely disappointed by my decision and, perhaps, Senator CONRAD's decision and others, to not support a constitutional amendment on flag desecration. I know they are impatient to correct a decision by the Supreme Court that they and I believe was wrong. 
   I have wrestled with this issue for so long. I wish I were not, with my decision, disappointing so many, including some of my friends who passionately believe we must amend the Constitution to protect the flag. But as I sift through all of the material and think about the history of our country and think about this constitutional framework of our government and all of the appetite that exists here and elsewhere to change this Constitution for 100 different reasons and 100 different ways, I think our country is better served by patience and by a thoughtful effort to correct a problem short of altering our country's Constitution. 
   For that reason, I join my colleagues today, two Republicans and two Democrats, to offer a piece of legislation that would serve, instead of altering our Constitution, as an effort to protect our American flag.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, 10 years ago the U.S. Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision struck down a Texas flag protection statute on the grounds that burning an American flag was ``speech'' and therefore protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution. I disagreed with the Court's decision then and I still do. I don't believe that the act of desecrating a flag is an act of speech. I believe that our flag, as our national symbol, can and should be protected by law. 
   In the intervening years since the Supreme Court decision I have twice supported federal legislation that would make flag desecration illegal, and on two occasions I voted against amendments to the Constitution to do the same. I voted that way because, while I believe that flag desecration is despicable conduct that should be prohibited by law, I also believe that amending our Constitution is a step that should be taken only rarely and then only as a last resort. 
   In the past year I have once again reviewed in detail nearly all of the legal opinions and written materials published by Constitutional scholars and courts on all sides of this issue. I pledged to the supporters of the Constitutional amendment that I would re-evaluate whether a Constitutional amendment is necessary to resolve this issue. 
   From my review I have concluded that there remains a way to protect our flag without having to alter the Constitution of the United States. I am joining with Senators BENNETT, MCCONNELL and CONRAD today to introduce legislation that I believe accomplishes that goal. The bill we introduce today protects the flag but does so without altering the Constitution and a number of respected Constitutional scholars tell us they believe this type of statute will be upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. This statute protects the flag by criminalizing flag desecration when the purpose is to, and the person doing it knows, it is likely to lead to violence. 
   Supporters of a Constitutional amendment will be disappointed I know by my decision to support this statutory remedy to protect the flag rather than support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I know they are impatient to correct a decision by the Supreme Court that they and I believe was wrong. I have wrestled with this issue for so long and I wish I were not, with my decision, disappointing those, including many of my friends, who passionately believe that we must amend the Constitution to protect the flag. 
   But in the end I know that our country will be better served reserving our attempts to alter the Constitution only for those things that are ``extraordinary occasions'' as outlined by President James Madison, one of the authors of the Constitution, and only in circumstances when it is the only remedy for something that must be done. 
   More than 11,000 Constitutional amendments have been proposed since our Constitution was ratified. However, since the ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1791 only 17 amendments have been enacted. These 17 include three reconstruction era amendments that abolished slavery, and gave African-Americans the right to vote. The amendments included giving women the right to vote, limiting Presidents to two terms, and establishing an order of succession in case of a President's death or departure from office. The last time Congress considered and passed a new Constitutional amendment was when it changed the voting age to 18, more than a quarter of a century ago. All of these matters were of such scope they required a Constitutional amendment to be accomplished. 
   But protecting the American flag can be accomplished without amending the Constitution, and that is a critically important point. 
   Constitutional scholars, including those at the Congressional Research Service, the research arm of Congress, and Duke University's Professor William Alstyne, have concluded that this statute passes Constitutional muster, because it recognizes that the same standard that already applies to other forms of speech applies to burning the flag as well. This is the same standard which makes it illegal to falsely cry ``fire'' in a crowded theater. Reckless speech that is likely to cause violence is not protected under the ``fighting words'' standard, long recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States.  
   I believe that future generations--and our founding fathers--would agree that it's worth the effort for us to find a way to protect our flag without having to wonder about the unintended consequences of altering our Constitution. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation Wednesday to improve the safety of the nation's food supply, by increasing educational efforts for food processors and handlers and the frequency of inspections for some of them. The bill also establishes new mechanisms for identifying food processors and handlers who originate contaminated food in order to improve federal recall and food safety law enforcement action. 
   Farmers produce high quality products and expect them to reach the consumer with the same high quality  standards observed. Farmers and consumers both have an interest in assuring the unquestioned safety of our food. 
   The new global economy is another reason for strengthening the nations' food safety laws. With the new global economy, we have food moving around the world without much understanding of where its coming from, who produced it, and under what conditions. I think it calls for a much more rigorous food inspections, not only for the safety of consumers, but to safeguard the reputation of the products our farmers produce. 
   Another important feature of the bill is new authority for inspection of food and food products at the border as they enter the United States from foreign countries, and in some cases inspections at food processing plants located in foreign countries. 
   A similar bill will be introduced shortly in the U.S. House by Representative FRANK PALLONE (D-NJ), underscoring the urban-rural, producer-consumer nature of the new drive for improved food safety laws.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know there has been discussion about the agenda here in the Senate, what the Senate will take up, what it will consider, what it will debate in the coming days and weeks and months. I hear very little discussion about the need to respond to the farm crisis in the rural parts of our country. 
   I have, on half dozen occasions now, brought to the floor of the Senate a chart that shows our entire country with those counties blocked out in red that are losing population. What it shows is a large part of the middle of our country is being depopulated. We have a serious and abiding farm crisis. That depopulation in the middle part of America stems in large part from a farm economy that means family farmers are not making a living and all too often are having to leave the farm. 
   We keep hearing that it is a global economy. If it is a global economy, then why on earth do we have so many people hungry in the rest of the world? We are told 500 to 600 million people go to bed with an ache in their belly every night because they did not have enough to eat. Then in the same global economy, with so many hungry people, a farmer somewhere in Cando, ND, or Regent, ND, today loads up a truckload of wheat and takes it to the county elevator and is told that the food has no value. That is not a global economy that seems to work, in my judgment. 
   This chart shows what is happening in the heartland of our country. Most of it is because of the urgency of the economic crisis facing family farmers. These red counties are the counties which have lost more than 10 percent of their population. Many of them have lost far more. My home county [Hettinger] is right up in here. It has lost almost half of its population in the last 25 years. 
   The middle part of America is being depopulated. We have a farm program that doesn't work. We have natural disasters that affect these family farmers. We have crop diseases. A GAO study I just released last week shows that in North Dakota a crop disease called scab or vomitoxin has cost our farmers $200 million a year in lost income. They say 750 farmers have lost their farms because of just that one crop disease, the worst crop disease in a century in my home State. 
   Natural disasters, crop diseases; how about trade? How about telling our family farmers to compete in the global economy with the Europeans subsidizing their farmers in multiples of what we are while we try to help our farmers open foreign markets. You compete in the international marketplace with one hand tied behind your back. Or how about international trade that says, why don't we have the Canadians dump tens of thousands of semi-truckloads of their grain, their durum wheat and their spring wheat into our marketplace in conditions of unfair trade, driving down our prices. That is all right, and we will sit by and do nothing about it. 
   That is not a fair circumstance for our farmers. Japan, China; how many in this Chamber know that currently the tariff on American beef going into Japan is 45 percent, a 45-percent tariff? If we imposed that on anybody, we would be considered a massive failure. China says maybe they will decrease their tariff on American beef going into China. It is now 42.5 percent. 
   Our farmers deserve better trade policies than they are getting from this Government of ours. Our Government cannot do much about natural disasters except respond to them with a helping hand at a time when people need help. It can do something about trade policy that is unfair to our producers. And certainly, this administration and this Congress, especially this Congress, ought to do something about a farm bill that shortchanges American farmers. 
   The current farm bill we have is a wonderful bill if you are Cargill or Continental or some large grain trading company. If you are one of the behemoths, one of the giant agrifactories in America, you have to like the current circumstance. You have low prices at which you can buy the grain. Then you can put it in your plant, apply some air to it, and you can puff it up. Now you can call it puffed wheat and put it on the grocery store shelf. And while you are paying less for the grain, you can increase your prices. That is exactly what is happening, and that is exactly what was announced last week. 
   Grain prices for family farmers are collapsed. Cereal manufacturers are saying, we want to increase cereal prices 2.5 percent. You talk about a disconnection. You talk about short-circuiting the economic system. That is a short-circuit. 
   The question for this Congress is, Do we care? I do. Do enough others care to want to save family farmers? Or is America's food production destined to go to the giant agrifactories that farm America from California to Maine with nary a person in sight--no farm lights, no yard lights out 
   there illuminating where a family lives and does its work--because there won't be families on the farm? 
   Or does this country, does this Congress, as many other countries, believe that a broad network of family producers on America's farms and ranches represents the best economic system? Do we believe in the Jeffersonian model that Thomas Jefferson talked about: That which keeps America free is broad-based economic ownership, because economic freedom relates to political freedom? 
   Do we really believe in broad-based economic ownership? If so, let's start to manifest that belief in farm policy. Let's decide that current farm policy is a bankrupt policy. The bill that was passed, the current farm bill that was passed that pulls the rug out from under family farmers says, when prices collapsed, do not bank on us for help--when that bill was passed, without my vote in this Congress, there was feasting and rejoicing and celebrating here in this town by the largest agribusinesses because they thought they had just won the lottery. What a wonderful deal for them. 
   Someday we will have lower grain prices, they thought, and we will buy this grain from family farmers cheap, and then eventually the family farmers will be gone. They will take over the farms and farm all of our country. They will put that grain in plants and will make substantial money off of it. That is exactly what happened at the expense of family farmers. 
   The question before this Congress is: Are we going to have the will to do what is necessary to repair the hole in the safety net for family farmers? Do we care whether there are family farmers left in our country? 
   Wheat prices have fallen 53 percent. Let me show a chart which demonstrates what has happened to wheat prices. I ask any American, I ask any Member of the Senate, how would you  feel if this was what was happening to your paycheck? How well would you do if this was what your income looked like? That is what the income looks like on our farms. 
   On America's farms, they see Depression-era prices in constant dollars, but their expenses keep going up. Try to buy a tractor or a combine, fertilizer, seed, fuel, at today's prices. See if you get a bargain. But then sell the grain that comes from the sweat and the labor, from driving the tractor, planting the seeds in the spring, tending that crop through the year and at harvesting in the fall. Try to sell that crop, and see what they tell you. Then it is not so much a circumstance where they say, well, times have changed and things cost more. They say, your product that you worked so hard to create is worth less, worth less or worthless. 
   This country can do better than that. If we don't do better than that, we won't have any farmers left. 
   We need to decide that by the Memorial Day break or by the July 4 break at the very latest, we need to do something to repair this safety net. The first step is obvious. I just spoke over in the Appropriations Committee hearing. We have an emergency bill which provides for the first spring planting loans. That emergency bill was passed many weeks ago here in the Senate and now, of course, awaits action on the Kosovo emergency question. But the climate doesn't wait. The spring doesn't wait. Spring planting is needed to move ahead now. Yet the loans that many farmers need to get into the field for the spring, to buy the fuel and buy the seed, those loans are not available because we haven't passed that emergency supplemental dealing with those emergency loans. 
   That is the first step. That ought to be done immediately. 
   The second step is, between now and the Memorial Day break or the July 4 break, we ought to do something to put in place a fair price plan for family farmers. We ought to have the good sense to do that. There is nothing wrong with making a U-turn when you discover where you are headed is the wrong direction. The current farm bill is the wrong direction. It seemed right at the time for a lot of folks who voted for it. As I said, I didn't. For those who voted for it when farm prices were better, it seemed like it was the right thing to do. But it was the wrong thing to do. 
   Now that farm prices have collapsed, the question is, Do we have a safety net left in this country for family farmers to try to get them across those price valleys? The answer is no. But we can repair and provide a safety net for family farmers if this Congress and this country believes it is important to have a broad-based network of family farm ownership across this country. I believe that very strongly, and I hope my colleagues who support family farming will feel the same way. 
   Now, Mr. President, last week, when I came to the floor of the Senate, I held up a newspaper that I got on an airplane in Minneapolis. This paper said: ``Cargill Profits From Decline in Farm Prices; 53 percent jump in earnings.'' I don't know Cargill. It is a big agrifactory. ``Cargill Profits From Decline in Farm Prices.'' As do all of the big economic interests. This was in the same newspaper: ``General Mills to Boost Cereal Prices 2.5 Percent.'' There is a decline in farm prices, farm prices have collapsed, but cereal manufacturers are going to increase the price of breakfast food 2.5 percent. 
   I think the consumers and farmers are both victimized, and they have a right to ask what on Earth is going on in this country. Farmers are being shortchanged and consumers are being overcharged. What on Earth is happening and when is somebody going to do something about it? 
   On the same day in that newspaper, these two stories tell of the sad, sad events that now confront our family farmers: collapsed prices and a circumstance where all of those who take their product and use it, turn it into cereal for store shelves, those who haul it, those who trade it, and those who add value to that product are making record profits, increasing prices, and are doing fine. But family farmers, of course, are going broke. 
   This Congress must decide, and decide quickly. I and others will be coming to the floor repeatedly to ask this question: Why is it when people talk about family values they only refer to cultural values? Why is the family not valued as an economic unit in this country? Why aren't family economics important? The family farm, the family business--that is an economic unit that is important to this country, and our public policy ought to reflect that. It is long past the time when Congress ought to address this farm crisis in a serious and thoughtful way. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to just briefly mention a couple of issues this morning. 
   First, I would like to comment on some of the statements made this weekend, especially by the Senate majority leader, but by others as well, dealing with the issue of Social Security. 
   This weekend, on a Sunday talk show, our colleague, Senator LOTT, indicated that he felt that the issue of Social Security reform was dead for this Congress. 
   Vice President GORE this morning expressed the fervent hope that this is not the case. I would join the Vice President in saying that it is not good public policy for our country to give up on the important task of reforming Social Security. 
   The Social Security program has been a critically important program for our country. It has made life so much better for so many older Americans for so long. The problems of our Social Security system are born of success--not failure. The success is that  people are living longer and better lives in our country. At the start of this century, you were expected, on average, to live to be 48 years old. Now, at the end of the century, you are expected to live on average to about 78 years of age--a 30-year increase in life expectancy. 
   For a lot of reasons--better nutrition, breathtaking breakthroughs in medical science, better medical facilities--a whole series of things contribute to the success. But the result of the success is that people are living longer, and that puts strains on the Social Security system. But we ought not shrink from the challenge of those strains. 
   We can solve this issue. We can make Social Security solvent for at least the next 75 years and beyond. Let's not at this point decide that the 106th Congress cannot deal with the Social Security challenge. Of course we can. 
   President Clinton and Vice President GORE made a proposal at the start of this Congress. Just as a starting point, they put forward a proposal to let us sink our teeth into this issue, and make it a priority. 
   I know there is a lot of controversy about how you might reform and change and improve the solvency of the Social Security system for the long term. But I think the best way to approach this--I agree with Vice President GORE--is for both parties to resolve that this shall be a priority; we, together, should decide to save Social Security in this Congress. 
   I ask the majority leader here in the Senate and others to agree with President Clinton and Vice President GORE that this ought to be job No. 1 for this Congress. Let us together reform the Social Security program, and make the changes that are necessary to extend its solvency for the long term into the future. 
   Again, while we do it, let me remind those who listen to this debate that the problems confronted by the Social Security system are not problems of a program that doesn't work. It works, and works well. They are problems resulting from longer and better lives for many older Americans in this country.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to talk just for a moment about the horrible tragedy that occurred in Littleton, CO, last week. 
   I am a North Dakotan. I have been a North Dakotan all of my life. I did, however, leave our State to go to graduate school in Colorado. Following graduate school, I worked in Colorado, and worked, in fact, in Littleton, CO. It is a nice community, a suburb of Denver. 
   Last week, I was, along with all other Americans, horrified to see the pictures on television of the school shooting at Columbine High School that took the lives of so many innocent young boys and girls, and also a teacher. 
   And I asked myself, what is causing this? What is at the root of this kind of violence? The Littleton, CO, shooting is just the latest in a series of school shootings. Unfortunately, there have been many others in the last several years. 
   I can't watch the television set without getting tears in my eyes. Moments ago, I was turning on a television set and I saw the funeral for a very brave teacher who died that day in that school in Colorado. We ask ourselves over and over and over again, what has changed? What is causing all of this? 
   On Friday, I met with a high school assembly in North Dakota. We talked at great length about these issues. This morning I spent all morning at a youth detention facility called Oak Hill and talked to young folks at that facility from 12 years old on up, young people who had committed violent crimes and who are now committed to that detention facility not more than an hour from this Capitol Building. 
   I don't have any better answers perhaps than anyone else in America about these issues. I have some thoughts about some of it. Obviously, first, it all starts at home. There isn't a substitute for good parenting. 
   One of the young boys this morning at the Oak Hill Detention Center, who has been involved in drugs and violent crime, said he only had one parent. He said his parent checked on him from time to time but he said, ``Checking in on young folks from time to time isn't enough.'' 
   Another part of the problem is drugs and the accessibility of drugs. In addition, a country with 220 to 240 million guns, and with seemingly easy accessibility to guns by children, makes parenting more difficult. 
   How about the violence children are exposed to every day? By the time children graduate from high school they will spend about 12,000 hours in a classroom and about 20,000 hours in front of a television set. Study after study after study, year after year after year shows that the steady diet of violence seen by our young people on television affects their behavior. Does it turn them into murderers? No. Does it affect their behavior? Yes, of course it does. 
   Corporations spend $200 billion a year in this country advertising in the media. Yet when we are suggesting through studies that the steady diet of violence offered to our young children on television is hurting them, the same people will say, ``Gee, the media has no influence on our children.'' If that is the case, why is $200 billion a year spent advertising tennis shoes, jerseys, and more? If it doesn't work, why do we see it used so extensively? Of course the media has an enormous influence. 
   Last week, while these shootings at school were taking place, as horrifying as it was for everyone in America to watch SWAT teams move into the building and young children run from the building in panic, one of the networks broke for a commercial. The commercial break was to encourage us to watch a new program called ``Mr. Murder.'' I thought to myself, I guess that says a lot, doesn't it? We are watching these children at this high school under siege by young gunmen, and then there is an advertisement for the new program, ``Mr. Murder.'' 
   Is a murder program on television causing these murders in the school? That is not my allegation at all. Does it hurt our children? The pop culture of increasingly violent television, increasingly violent movies--or how about increasingly violent lyrics in music? There is a man in Minot, ND, whose young boy put a bullet through his brain. When he found his son, he was lying on his bed with his earphones connected to a compact disk that was playing over and over and over and over again lyrics to a Marilyn Manson song saying the way to end all of this ``is with a bullet in your head.'' For 3 months, he obsessed on this kind of music, and then his father found him lying on his bed with a bullet in his head. 
   The teacher of a young boy named Mitchell, who killed 4 of his classmates and 1 teacher and wounded 10 others, testified before the Senate Commerce Committee last June. 
   She talked about 13-year-old Mitchell. She was Mitchell's teacher, taught Mitchell English. He was always respectful, she said, saying ``Yes, ma'am,'' ``No, ma'am.'' She never saw him exhibit anger. After the killings, she said the classmates had a discussion. They discovered Mitchell had been obsessing on an entirely new kind of music--Bone Thugs and TuPac. And she told us the lyrics that Mitchell had been listening to in ``Crept and We Came'' by Bone Thugs:  
   Cockin the 9 and ready to aim 
   Pullin the Trigger 
   To blow out your brains 
   Bone got a gang 
   Man we crept and we came.  
   This song has about 40 murder images, like ``puttin them in the ground and pumpin the gun.'' 
   That is what Mitchell was listening to. 
   ``Body Rott,'' by Bone Thugs. Or here are the lyrics from ``I Ain't Mad at Ya'' by TuPac.  
   I can see us after school 
   We'd bomb on the first [blank blank] 
   With the wrong [blank] on. And from ``2 of Amerikas Most Wanted:'' 
   Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture. 
   Bomb the hoochies with precision...... 
   Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party.  
   These lyrics are from Mitchell's teacher who wanted us to know what he was listening to. 
   Is this part of the culture? Does this hurt our children? Is it easy to parent with these kinds of images, these kinds of thoughts coming from our television set, from compact disks? Should we think through all of this--not just at the surface with parenting, drugs, and guns--but also the issue of pop culture? 
   If $200 billion is spent advertising in the media because it influences behavior, should we as parents and should we  as legislators start understanding that the media then has a profound impact on children as well. Should we understand when the media pumps images--thousands and thousands and thousands of images--of murder that tell our young children the way adults solve their problems is to kill someone, to stab someone, to murder someone? That is the way adults solve their problems, according to television programs. 
   Yes, it is fiction, but how do children know that? Yes, you can say parents should do a better job of seeing what their children are watching, but it is very hard. 
   I have a lot more to say about this but I know colleagues are waiting. I am sure I join all of my colleagues in saying we are heartbroken by what is happening in this country and what happened in Littleton, CO. My thoughts and prayers go to all of those families and friends who lost loved ones. 
   I watched the images of the funerals today in Littleton, and I want to be part of anything any of us can do to try to find reasons and try to develop policies to see if we can't steer all of us in a more constructive direction. In the meantime, my thoughts and prayers are with all of those in Colorado and around this country who today grieve for those young children and the teacher who lost their lives. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator yielding for a question. I wanted to note that for, I guess, the seventh year now that I have been here in the Senate, the one consistent voice on this issue has been the Senator from South Carolina. I find it interesting, and I wonder if he sees the same irony as I do, that the very people that now bring us the notion of a lockbox, because they are worried about the Social Security trust fund, were just a few years ago on the floor of the Senate ridiculing the Senator from South Carolina, myself, my colleague from North Dakota, and others, because we said what you want to do with a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget is to put a provision in the Constitution that says Social Security revenues must be counted not as part of a trust fund, but as part of the ordinary operating revenues of the Federal budget. 
   In other words, they wanted to put in the Constitution the misuse of the Social Security trust funds and decide that you have a budget surplus only when you have used the Social Security trust funds to get there. So we said no; if you are going to do something in the Constitution about a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, let's at least be honest with the trust funds and say the budget is only balanced when you have not misused Social Security trust funds. 
   I should have brought the charts. I was thinking about bringing the charts over to read all of the comments that were made on the floor of the Senate about our position at that point. 
   They have three stages of denial: 
   First, we are not misusing the Social Security trust funds. 
   Second, they said but if we are misusing them, we promise to stop. 
   If we promise to stop, we can't do it for the first 8 years. We will promise to stop 12 years from now. 
   Those were the three stages of denial when we debated the issue of a constitutional amendment. 
   But I just find it interesting that those who now say they are the protectors are the ones who are building a lockbox and are the very, very same interests who are on the floor of the Senate saying we should amend the Constitution in a manner that provides that Social Security revenues will be treated like all other revenues of government. It is no protection at all, and they would cement that in the Constitution of the United States. When we objected, they said: You are wrong; this is exactly what we want to do. Now we have this little pirouette on this floor when they come back and say we are the ones who want to protect Social Security. 
   I just wanted to ask the question if the Senator from South Carolina sees the same irony here, although this amendment doesn't do what it is advertised to do. The Senator from South Carolina is absolutely correct; the rhetoric in support of this amendment is directly in contradiction to the kind of things we heard from that side of the aisle just 3 to 4 years ago.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to speak about three items today. First, I want to talk for just a moment about Kosovo and the NATO actions in Kosovo. 
   I had a town meeting in North Dakota over the weekend and had a fairly large number of North Dakotans pack into a rather small room, and we had a 1 1/2 hour discussion about the airstrikes in which NATO, including the United States, is involved in Yugoslavia and in Kosovo. I expect I am joined by all of my colleagues when I say I hope and pray the hostilities in the region will cease. I hope Mr. Milosevic will pull back his Serb troops and that we will be able to restore peace and order and have the opportunity to find a way to provide those refugees who have streamed across the border the opportunity to go home. 
   Most North Dakotans who have communicated with me, and those who came to this weekend's meeting I had in Fargo on this subject, are anxious and nervous and concerned about what is happening in the region. 
   They do not have any better answers than I or my colleagues, or anyone else for that matter, on what to do when someone like Mr. Milosevic commits genocide or ethnic cleansing, including substantial massacres of the civilian population in the region of Kosovo. 
   The question that all of us at this weekend's meeting in North Dakota posed was, What shall we do? Shall we say it is none of our business, it is not in our part of the world? Genocide committed by Mr. Milosevic or ethnic cleansing is not something we need to be concerned about? I think most people believe that is not the answer either. 
   Clearly, we do not want in 5 or 10 years from now to look back and say, that genocide or Holocaust, or whatever it was Mr. Milosevic committed, killing thousands, perhaps ultimately hundreds of thousands, is something that we did not care about. If that were the case, I think it would be reasonable to say shame on us. 
   We must be involved and we must care. The question is, How do we address it? How do we effectively thwart the attempt by Mr. Milosevic to clear all of the Albanians out of Kosovo? How do we thwart his attempt to massacre innocent civilians with the Serb Army? How do we restore order to this region? 
   I have supported the airstrikes, and I hope and pray they succeed in driving Mr. Milosevic back. I have said before and I reiterate today that I do not and will not support the introduction of U.S. ground troops to the Balkans. I think that would be a horrible mistake. 
   Frankly, the bulk of the airstrikes have occurred in the Balkan region with U.S. planes and U.S. pilots. If, in fact, ground troops are ultimately needed, I believe it is the responsibility of the European countries to commit those ground troops. I know NATO is involved in this as an alliance, and we are a significant part of that alliance. But the United States bears the heaviest burden in the air war, bears the heaviest cost in the airstrikes, and I think if ground troops ultimately are necessary--and I hope they will not be--I think those ground troops must be furnished by the European countries. I will not support the position that we should introduce U.S. ground troops in the Balkans. I believe that would be a serious mistake, and I cannot and will not support that. 
   Let me again say, I do not believe my constituents or my colleagues have any easy answers. This is not an easy situation. Things are happening in the Balkans that I think all of the world looks at with horror and says, ``We must do something to try to respond to it.'' But it is not easy. 
   Dozens of foreign powers over many centuries have gone to the Balkans only to experience profound disappointment in their attempt to change something that was internally happening in that region of the world. 
   Let me hope, along with my colleagues, that these airstrikes by NATO will convince Mr. Milosevic that the price is too high to continue doing what he is doing in that region to so many innocent men, women, and children. Let us hope that this is a success sooner rather than later and we can provide some peace and stability to that region.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to talk just for a moment about agriculture and the challenge facing agriculture. 
   On Saturday, I was in an airplane and opened up a newspaper to an interesting article. I have spoken about agriculture and family farmers during the past weeks. I have talked about what is happening in our part of the country with the depopulation of middle America, rural communities drying up--shriveling like prunes, people moving out--not moving in, Main Street businesses boarding up, family farmers going broke, and nobody seemingly caring very much. 
   The business section of the Minneapolis Tribune had two 
   fascinating stories on the front page. They respond in a kind of perverse way to what is happening, both in this Chamber and also around the country with respect to the policy dealing with family farmers. 
   The first article: ``Cargill Profits from Decline in Farm Prices; 53 percent jump in earnings expected.'' Cargill is a large company and has always done quite well, I believe. It is a privately held company. It purchases agricultural products and is involved in a wide range of activities adding value to agricultural products. 
   ``Cargill Profits from Decline in Farm Prices.'' Is that unusual? No. Big agribusinesses all too often are profiting from the misery of America's family farmers. Family farmers on the one side go broke; while Cargill sees a 53 percent jump in earnings. Cargill, incidentally, wants now to marry up with Continental Grain. Cargill and Continental want to get married, merge, and become bigger, with more market power. 
   In the question of market power, it is reasonable to ask, who wins and who loses? Family farmers all too often lose, and those with the most market power win. ``Cargill Profits from the Decline in Farm Prices.'' You could wipe out the name ``Cargill'' and include any number of agribusinesses. I am not picking on Cargill; they just happened to be in this paper on Saturday. 
   Let's go to the article on the bottom of the front page. Family farmers are going broke because commodity prices have collapsed. The price of wheat has collapsed. The article states, ``General Mills to boost cereal prices 2.5 percent'':  
   General Mills, Inc., the maker of Cheerios, Wheaties and Lucky Charms, is raising cereal prices an average of 2.5 percent.  
   One might ask the question, in terms of public policy, What is going on in this country when the folks who gas up the tractor in the spring, borrow money to buy seed, fertilizer, plant the crop, harvest the wheat, sell it in the market, and then go broke because they are told that the wheat they produced from their fields has no value? But the people who buy that wheat and turn it into Cheerios or Wheaties or Lucky Charms, even though the prices of commodities have collapsed and they are paying the farmer less--in fact, so little that family farmers are going broke in record numbers--they say they need to boost cereal prices that people pay at the grocery store. 
   I woke up this morning and I ate a bowl of cereal. I will not advertise which cereal it was, but I ate a bowl of cereal. I looked at the box, after I had seen this in the paper on Saturday, and I read the label about what is in this  cereal I am eating. I will tell you what is in the cereal--grain. 
   So this company buys it from farmers, pays them a pittance, and then they puff it or crisp it or shred it. Once they have it all puffed and labeled as Puffed Wheat or Shredded Wheat, the process is all done. They have added the air to the grain or they have shredded it with a knife, then they put it on the grocery store shelf and charge a fortune for it. 
   Buy a box of cereal at the grocery store and ask yourself whether you like that price. Now, they say it is not enough. While farmers are going broke, they say they need to boost cereal prices. Talk about a disconnection and evidence that the market system does not work in agriculture. There must surely be a golden rule here, the one that says--those who have the gold make the rules--there must be a golden rule here that says cereal manufacturers can increase prices with impunity while family farmers go broke because they are selling their grain at the elevator and are told that their food has no value. 
   I mentioned last week an auction sale by a farm wife in North Dakota. She wrote a letter and said they were forced to sell out. She said her 17-year-old son would not even come down, he stayed in bed during the day of the auction sale and refused to come down to witness the auction sale of this farm because he was heartbroken. It was breaking his heart. 
    It was breaking his heart that they were having to sell their farm. He wanted to farm. 
   This is all about human misery, failure--and it is not their fault. It is not the family farmers' fault that commodity prices have collapsed at the same time we have a hungry world. Hundreds of millions of people go to bed with an ache in their belly every night because they do not have enough to eat, while our farmers are told their product has no value. And when companies take the farmers product and turn it into cereal by puffing it, then they send it to the grocery store, they say it not only has value, in fact, they are announcing a price increase. Yet, they have received record profits and now want to increase cereal prices. 
   I want to put up a chart that shows the average annual return on equity for the major cereal manufacturers, 1993 to 1997: 29 percent, 24 percent, 25 percent, 22 percent. 
   Our family farmers are going broke raising the products that go into these cereals; and the largest corporations that make cereal are making very substantial returns on their equity. There is something wrong with that economic system. Some say, ``Well, that's just the way it works. The big get bigger and the small get phased out.'' If this country decides it is worth losing family farmers, it will have lost something of great value to our country. 
   Some in this Chamber think having only giant agrifactories around in the future is fine. They will buy up farms from coast to coast. Only having large farms in America is not fine with me. This country will have taken a giant step backwards, unless we fundamentally change the farm law this year and provide a decent safety net for family farmers. We do it for another segment in our economy. We provide a safety net for workers with a minimum wage. 
   Family farmers were told, under the current farm bill--about 3 years ago--``We're going to pull the safety net out from under you.'' And then, of course, prices collapsed, and the result is family farmers have no effective safety net. 
   I just say that when you look at what is going on in the business page of the newspaper, ``Cargill profits from decline in farm prices'' and ``General Mills to boost cereal prices''--I do not mean to single out these two companies, they are doing what economic clout and power allows them to do--but it is unfair to family farmers. 
   We have asked for substantial investigations by the Justice Department about the concentration of economic power and what it is doing to the family-sized farm. I hope the Justice Department will move, and move aggressively, on these issues. But more importantly, this Congress needs to decide, in the next few weeks, whether it wants family farmers left in this country. And if it does, we have to do a U-turn on farm policy and reconnect a decent safety net for family-sized farms. 
   I know what some people say, ``Well, all this is wonderful, but it's boring and it's not very important.'' It is critically important to families out there struggling to make a living. 
   Will Rogers said, many years ago, ``You know, if on one day all the lawyers on Wall Street failed to show up for lunch, it wouldn't mean a thing for this country. But if one day all the cows in our country failed to show up to be milked, that would be a problem.'' What he was trying to describe was a difference between those who move paper around in America and those who produce real products on the farm, that are of real value and contribute to feeding our country. That admonition by Will Rogers is just as important today. 
   I hope the Justice Department will take a look at the Cargill-Continental merger with a critical eye, to say, why do we need corporations in this system, already too large, to get bigger? Why do we need them to impose their economic will on small producers? Why do we need to give them more economic clout to do that? 
   I hope the Justice Department will look at market 
    concentration in meat packing and in a whole range of other areas, because those are the kinds of things that are undermining the foundation of America's family farms. 
   A number of us will speak at greater length on these issue in the coming days, because we must convince this Congress that we have a responsibility to develop a farm program that works, one that tells family farmers: ``You matter to our future. And we want you to be able to make a decent living if you work hard on the family farm.''

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last Thursday was tax filing day, and we had a number of my colleagues come to the floor of the Senate and talk about taxes. I have yet to meet anybody who likes taxes. I know taxes pay for the cost of civilization. I know we would not have the kind of country we have in this country without taxes. I know that the ability to drive on good roads, to have a police force, to have a fire department, to have a Defense Department, to have safe food through food inspectors, to be able to control our borders--all of those things require the payment of taxes. 
   But our tax system has become enormously complicated, and it ought to change. I authored, about a year and a half ago, a proposal called the Fair and Simple Shortcut Tax Plan; it is called the FASST Plan. 
   You want to file your tax return with minimum bother? You want to avoid having to file an income tax return at all? Then this is a plan that will work for you. 
   It was not too many years ago that the American people, by and large, did not have to file an income tax return because only a small percentage of the American people paid income taxes. About 6 percent of the American people had a requirement to file a tax return. The rest of the people did not. For those who had to file, they had a very thin instruction booklet, just a couple of pages. 
   Now we have an instruction booklet with our income tax return that looks very much like a J.C. Penney's catalog. We have moved dramatically in the wrong direction with a highly complicated federal income tax system. Taxpayers are spending more than 3 billion hours at a cost of some $75 billion in trying to comply with our federal income tax laws every year; and it need not be that way. 
   We have had people come to the floor of the Senate to say, ``I have a better idea. Let's abolish the whole federal income tax.'' I would like to know what they want to put in its place before abolishing it. Others say, ``Let's have a flat tax so that the person making $30,000 a year can pay the same tax rate as Ross Perot or Donald Trump pay.'' I do not happen to share that belief. 
   Still some others say, ``Let's have a national sales tax; get rid of the income tax and put a national sales tax on everything.'' I don't know how much you would like to buy a home and discover you have to pay a 35 percent sales tax on the value of the home. Or if that is the first thing you would exempt, how much higher would the national sales tax rate increase in order to get the required money to make the difference?  
   My point is, it sounds great to say, ``Let's abolish the income tax,'' but I want to know what you want to do in place of it. Some would say--and some have offered plans here in the Senate and the House--``Let's have a different tax system. Let's have one that taxes work. You go out and work for a living? We want you to pay a tax. But if, on the other hand, you get your income from capital gains, dividends or interest, you don't pay a tax. Let's tax only activities from work; and let's exempt investments.'' 
   I guess that sounds pretty good, if all your income comes from investment. Guess who would pay taxes and be exempt under that kind of scheme. The wealthiest folks would be exempt and the working people would pay the taxes. That is a tax on work. 
   My point is, let's take a look at seeing if we can't change the current system in a way that benefits at least a fair number of the American people. 
   Here is what I propose we do. More than 30 countries have some kind of income tax system in which most of the taxpayers, or many of the taxpayers, do not have a requirement to file an income tax return. Here is how I would propose we do it. Everyone who signs in at work for a job fills out a W-4 form. It says, My name is so and so. My Social Security number is x, y, and Z. I'm claiming this many allowances. And I am married, filing jointly, or whatever that information would conclude; and therefore your employer calculates how much income tax shall be withheld from your weekly or monthly wage. 
   I propose an approach where we would put a couple of extra lines on the W-4 form, and for a lot of Americans--perhaps 60 to 70 million Americans--with a few extra checkmarks on the W-4 form, their withholding at work will become their exact tax liability for the year. They would have no requirement to file a tax return--no return to be filed at all--therefore, no trips to the post office on April 15 and no worry about major audits. What is your wage? and based on what you checked on your W-4 form, what kind of withholding is necessary. 
   Let me give you an example of how we would do that. Families earning up to $100,000 in annual wages--$50,000 for singles--and up to $5,000 in capital gains, dividends and other non-wage income--$2,500 for singles--may elect this tax return-free filing system at work. This other income would be tax free. When they sign in at work, they would simply fill out a slightly modified W-4 form that allows them to have their employers withhold their exact tax obligation computed by using a table provided by the IRS, and they would pay a single low tax rate of 15 percent on their wages. 
   They would still be allowed their standard deduction, their personal exemptions, a deduction for home mortgage interest and property taxes paid, and their child tax credits. Those would be the couple of extra boxes checked on the W-4 form. But by and large, this would radically simplify income tax filing for 60 to 70 million Americans to say to them, check these extra boxes, you, therefore, do not have to file an April 15 tax return. You have a flat 15-percent tax rate on wages, and your other income, up to $5,000 for married, filing jointly, is totally exempt from any income tax obligation. 
   This system makes a great deal of sense in my judgment, and, as I indicated, anywhere from 60 to 70 million Americans will be able to decide if they want to use this system and, therefore, not be required to file any income tax return at all on April 15. 
   The reason I am describing this system today is the discussion last week on tax day was interesting. I do not quarrel with those who say we ought to change the current tax system. Yes, we should. 
   The first step would be to dramatically simplify the responsibility for filing income tax returns for the bulk of the American people. I am saying that the majority of taxpayers could avoid having to file any income tax return at all on April 15, could avoid all of the problems of getting paperwork together, and could stop worrying about a subsequent major audit. They could avoid all of that with the Fair and Simple Shortcut Tax plan. 
   My proposal allows every taxpayer, if they want, to compute and file their tax returns under the old system. You could get your tax return and your catalog size instructions, and you can go through it and you can labor and agonize and sweat and talk to accountants if you want. That is your choice. You will have the choice. But the second choice and I believe much more appealing for most Americans is to access the return-free income tax system with a single 15-percent rate, with the abolition of both the marriage tax penalty and the Alternative Minimum Tax under this system, with up to $5,000 of capital gains, dividends and interest income completely tax free. 
   We can do this. We can do it easily, and we can do it now. More than 30 countries have some kind of approach like this. This is better tailored to our system, but some 30 countries already have some form of a tax return free system. This country can do that for the 60 to 70 million Americans it would relieve of having to file an annual federal income tax return. 
   As we debate and discuss the tax system in this Congress, it is important for us to listen to all of the ideas that exist, and there are plenty, some wonderful, some crackpot, some workable, some unworkable. This, in my judgment, is a system that can be implemented almost immediately, is eminently workable, and will address the first roadblock that exists in our current income tax system--that is, complexity. It can eliminate all of the complexities all at once for up to 60 to 70 million American people. That makes a great deal of sense. 
   I will be visiting with a number of my colleagues about it, and we are going to introduce it as a formal plan very soon. I hope that some of my colleagues will consider it favorably. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last year, I introduced a bill to correct problems with the Federal ``Son of Sam'' law, as those problems were perceived by the U.S. Supreme Court. Today, I am reintroducing this legislation, which deals with a continuing problem. The New York statute analyzed by the Supreme Court, as well as the Federal statute which I seek to amend, forfeited the proceeds from any expressive work of a criminal, and dedicated those proceeds to the victims of the perpetrator's crime. Because of constitutional deficiencies cited by the Court, the Federal statute has never been applied, and without changes, it is highly unlikely that it ever will be. Without this bill, criminals can become wealthy from the fruits of their  crimes, while victims and families are exploited. 
   The bill I now introduce attempts to correct constitutional deficiencies cited by the Supreme Court in striking down New York's Son of Sam law. In its decision striking down New York's law, the Court found the state to be both over inclusive and under inclusive: Over inclusive because the statute included all expressive works, no matter how tangentially related to the crime; under inclusive because the statute included only expressive works, not other forms of property. 
   To correct the deficiencies perceived by the Court, this bill changes significantly the concepts of the Federal statute. Because the Court criticized the statute for singling out speech, this bill is all-encompassing: It includes various types of property related to the crime from which a criminal might profit. Because the Court criticized the statute for being over inclusive, including the proceeds from all works, no matter how remotely connected to the crime, this bill limits the property to be forfeited to the enhanced value of property attributable to the offense. Because the Court found fault with the statute for not requiring a conviction, this bill requires a conviction. 
   The bill also attempts to take advantage of the long legal history of forfeiture. Pirate ships and their contents were once forfeited to the government. More recent case law addresses the concept of forfeiting any property used in the commission of drug related crimes, or proceeds from those crimes. I hope that courts interpreting this statute will look to this legal history and find it binding or persuasive. 
   The bill utilizes the Commerce Clause authority of Congress to forfeit property associated with State crimes. This means that if funds are transferred through banking channels, if UPS or FedEx are used, if the airwaves are utilized, or if the telephone is used to transfer the property, to transfer funds, or to make a profit, the property can be forfeited. In State cases, this bill allows the State Attorney General to proceed first. We do not seek to preempt State law, only to see that there is a law in place which will ensure that criminals do not profit at the expense of their victims and the families of victims. 
   One last improvement which this bill makes over the former statutes: The old statute included only crime which resulted in physical harm to another; this bill includes other crimes. Examples of crimes probably not included under the old statute, but included here are terrorizing, kidnaping, bank robbery, and embezzlement. 
   Mr. President, our Federal statute, enacted to ensure that criminals not profit at the expense of their victims and victim's families, is not used today because it is perceived to be unconstitutional. I believe victims of crime deserve quick action on this bill, drafted to ensure that they are not the source of profits to those who committed crimes against them. I asked for your support.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today is April 14 and tomorrow is April 15. That means tomorrow there will be a good many Americans who will finish their tax return preparation, go to the post office and drop it in the mailbox in order to get an April 15 date stamped on it to comply with the tax laws in this country. It is never a pleasant thing, and I know most people grit their teeth and wring their hands about the responsibility of having to file income tax returns. But most Americans do that because they know that we have needs and obligations in this country to pay for a defense establishment, to pay for roads, to pay for schools--to pay for the cost of civilization, in effect. 
   However, not everybody pays their fair share of U.S. income taxes, not everybody pays their way. Today, I am releasing a United States General Accounting Office report that was done at my request. This GAO report, which I hope Members of the House and Senate will read, has some rather startling conclusions in it. At about the time most Americans will file their tax return and pay the tax bill that they owe, this GAO report says there are plenty of special interests in this country that don't pay anything--earn a lot of money, but don't pay any taxes. 
   They are not taxpayers. Let me describe what this GAO report says. The GAO report says that 67 percent of the foreign controlled corporations doing business in the United States--67 percent--pay no U.S. income taxes at all. Zero in Federal income taxes. In the first half of this decade, the General Accounting Office says that the percent of foreign-based corporations doing business here and paying no U.S. income taxes has ranged from 67 percent to 74 percent. The GAO report also shows that U.S. controlled companies fared little better. 
   Now, that represents all corporations filing a U.S. tax return. Let's just deal with large corporations. That is, corporations defined by the GAO as having at least $250 million in assets, or $50 million or more in sales; that is a large  company. About 30 percent of both the large foreign controlled and U.S. controlled corporations doing business this country paid no U.S. income taxes--despite having more than $1 trillion in sales here in 1995, the latest year for which statistics are available. 
   In 1995, the large foreign controlled corporations that did pay some U.S. income taxes on the profits they made--and some did, the General Accounting Office says they paid taxes at a rate that was just about one-half of the rate paid by the large U.S. corporations paying federal income taxes on their profits here. 
   Now, I bring this to the floor of the Senate simply to say this: There is still substantial tax avoidance in this country, and it is not tax avoidance by working folks, by people who get up in the morning and go to work at a job for 8 or 10 hours a day; they aren't avoiding their tax responsibilities, because they can't. They must file tax returns. They have withholding on their wages and they must meet their citizenship requirements in this country. 
   As we near April 15, one day away, and the American people are filing tax returns, it is reasonable for them to ask, when they hear what is within the cover of this GAO report, why do they not see some of the largest economic interests that make hundreds of millions of dollars, and in some cases billions of dollars--why don't they see those economic interests as taxpayers in this country? 
   The GAO, some while ago, and other reports, said that one automobile maker, a foreign car maker, sold $3.4 billion worth of automobiles in this country and paid zero in Federal income taxes. The Presiding Officer is from a State that would care about that, the State that makes more cars, I suspect, than any other State in our country, where most major car manufacturers are located. So how, one would ask, could a foreign company come in and sell $3.4 billion worth of automobiles and say that ``we want all the advantages and to enjoy all the opportunities the American marketplace can give us, but we don't want to become taxpayers in your country''? How does that happen? Because we have a tax law, in my opinion, that deals with international corporations that do business all around the world in a way that allows them to jump through massive tax loopholes and, as this report says, hundreds of billions of dollars and more of sales in this country and then claim to the U.S. Government that they don't owe one penny in income taxes. 
   There is something fundamentally wrong with that system. I am going to come to the floor to speak later about what causes all this and what we can do about it. But I did want to disclose the GAO report today that says this problem isn't getting better. They did this report for me 4 years ago. I asked them to renew it and update it. They have done that. The report says this problem isn't getting better. What we have is, according to some folks, $10 billion, $20 billion, $30 billion--and one report estimates $35 billion--in taxes that should be paid to the Federal Government by these international corporations, but that is in fact not paid. 
   The only way you can retain a tax system of the type we have 
   in this country is to have voluntary compliance--that is, to have most people complying because they know they have a responsibility to do so. People will not voluntarily comply with a tax system that they think is unfair. It certainly is unfair to those working families in this country, who make $25,000, $35,000, $55,000, $75,000 a year and work hard and send their kids to school and pay their bills and stretch budgets to make ends meet, and at the end of the year they have to file a tax return and pay the Federal income taxes. It is not fair to them and it certainly erodes their confidence in this country and in the tax system to see some of the largest international corporations doing business in America saying, ``We want all the advantages of being able to do that, except we don't want to be a taxpayer.'' 
   I say to those corporations, if you get in trouble, whose Navy are you going to ask for to bail you out? I know the answer and so do you. If you are going to do business here and make profits in this country, you have a responsibility to help pay for that Navy and the many other things we do in this country that make it a wonderful place in which to live. 
   I might just mention some of the ways in which these companies avoid paying taxes, just because some people might wonder how this happens. It happens through massive tax avoidance schemes called ``transfer pricing.'' A foreign corporation decides to do business in the United States. It sets up a wholly-owned subsidiary. It manufactures in a foreign country, ships it to this country, and then either overcharges or undercharges itself, depending on which way the product is going, in order to make sure there is no profit shown in this country from its activities in the United States. The result of gaming that system and preventing the tax collectors at the IRS from seeing what they really made is that they are able to cart off their profits from this country and avoid paying any taxes at all. 
   On April 15, tax day, every American ought to scream at the Congress and the tax collection agency to say that we ought to fix this and we ought to do it soon. How do we fix it? Well, it is interesting that even at a time when GAO is doing this report that shows we have massive tax avoidance through transfer pricing--even at this time, this problem is getting worse because Congress, at virtually every opportunity, the kind of folks who think about these things are slipping little things into bills every chance they get to make this problem worse. They just did it last fall in a revenue bill with a juicy little tax break worth a couple hundred million dollars. With no debate and no hearings, they just stuck it in the middle of that bill. It added to the proposition that more companies will do business, make profits here and pay no taxes here. We have a responsibility to fix that. 
   So I appreciate the work the GAO has done. I intend to encourage them to keep doing this work to show us who is paying taxes and who isn't. Guess what? The working American families are paying taxes. They don't have any choice. They may not like it, but they understand the advantages of living in this country and what we must pay for for ourselves and our children--defense, schools, roads and more. 
   If the working families in this country voluntarily comply with this tax law--and they do--then I suggest it is time to ask some of the largest international corporations selling brand names that every single one of us knows to start doing the same thing. 
   I am going to bring a report to the floor in the coming days that talks about transfer pricing in ways that everybody will understand. I will talk about corporations selling to themselves radial tires for $2,570 and a tooth brush for $172. Why would companies sell a tooth brush for $172 to themselves? So they can soak profits in one direction or another and prevent the Federal Government in this country from taxing their profits. There are massive schemes of tax avoidance. How about a piano for $50? 
   Sound good? I am going to talk about the kind of tax avoidance schemes that goes on as a result of this transfer pricing, which results, by the way, in this kind of study, which says, in conclusion, the largest international corporations in this country--yes, domestic corporations doing business overseas and foreign corporations doing business here are involved in massive tax avoidance. We have a responsibility to the American people to stop it. This is not rocket science. It is simply standing up to the largest economic interests, to say to them you have the same responsibility in this country as individual taxpayers. 
   You have the same responsibility in this country as the average working family has, and that is, you do business here, you profit from this system, you have a responsibility to contribute, to pay taxes. When you do not do it, we ought to change the law and certainly improve enforcement and make sure you do do it, because that is the fair way to make sure a tax system works for everybody. 
   Mr. President, with that I will be back on a succeeding day to talk more about transfer pricing. But I wanted to bring to the attention of my colleagues and others the GAO report that is released today that describes what I think is a rather dismal conclusion about massive tax avoidance by some of the largest taxpayers in the world, doing business in this country, making  substantial profits, and avoiding the responsibility of paying their fair share of Federal income taxes. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are dealing with the budget and the naming of conferees, and a number of priorities have been discussed here on the floor of the Senate. That is what a budget is, establishing priorities. I offer this motion to instruct, and it is very simple. The Senator from New Mexico said he would like to take this, and if he does, I will not ask for a recorded vote. 
   In this motion, I move to instruct the conferees on H. Con. Res. 68, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2000, to include in the conference report provisions that would provide additional funding for income assistance for family farmers above the level provided in the Senate-passed resolution. 
   Why am I asking for favorable consideration on this motion? Yesterday, I read on the Senate floor a letter from a North Dakota woman that I want to read today. Her name is Susan Jorgenson. She wrote in her letter, describing the plight of family farmers, something that I think everybody listening to this debate should digest. Susan Jorgenson has lost her husband. He died last August. She said he had diabetes, but she said:  
   .....what I really feel caused his death was trying to make a living as a family farmer.  
   She said:  
   I had an auction last week to sell the [farm] machinery so I can pay off some of the debt that [we] incurred after 26 years of farming. I have a 17-year-old son who would not help me prepare for the auction and did not get out of bed the day of the [auction] sale because he was so heartbroken that he could not continue [to farm] this land [that he loved].  
   She said this of her husband:  
   He chose to farm rather than to live in Phoenix where he had a job with Motorola [early on] because he wanted to raise his children in a place with clean air, no crime, and good schools. He worked very hard, physically and emotionally, to make this farm work and its failure was ..... no fault of his own.  
   That is what this farm wife says about her deceased husband. 
   What is happening on the family farm? Everybody is making money but them. They raise the crop and give it to a railroad; the railroad makes a record profit hauling it. They raise steer and sell them to the slaughter house; the slaughter house makes a profit and the farmer goes belly up. They raise grain and put it into a cereal manufacturing plant, and they then take that wheat or rice and puff it and send it to a grocery store as puffed wheat or rice. The company that added the puff makes a mint and the farmer goes broke. Everything that touches what the farmer raises makes record profits, and the farmers are going broke in record numbers. 
   We have a serious emergency on family farms. Here is a headline concerning prairie dogs. Some groups have now decided --including in the Government--that we have a big problem, that we have to save prairie dogs. I don't know if these folks have driven around my part of the country much, but we have lots and lots of prairie dogs. We don't need a Federal program to ensure that we are going to have them in our future. Prairie dogs will take care of themselves, thank you. 
   What we lack are family farmers. Every day in every way, every week, every month, and every single year, we lose more and more family farmers. Now, we have farmers raising wheat and selling it for Depression-era prices in constant dollars. How would you like to be receiving wages that are Depression-era wages right now in constant dollars? 
   How about a minimum wage for family farmers? We debate minimum wage here on the floor of the Senate and I always vote for it. I think the folks at the bottom end of the ladder need to be given the chance to raise themselves up a bit. 
   What about an opportunity to provide a fair price for farmers? Wheat prices and grain prices have collapsed. Cattle prices and pork prices have collapsed. Farmers are having auction sales and 17-year-old boys won't get out of bed because they are so heartsick 
   about losing their farms. 
   We are told by people around here: Well, that's just the way the market system works. That is not a system that works at all. The system says to those who gas the tractor in the spring, plow the ground, plant the seed, and harvest the crop that their work has no value but the giant agrifactories that make a fortune with it have value. I am saying that this Congress must do something about that. This Congress must decide that family farmers matter in this country's future. 
   I have watched the chairman of the Budget Committee fight for things that matter to him. I have watched him fight for the National Labs and so many other things that are so important to him and there is no more tenacious of a fighter in the Senate than the Senator from New Mexico about the things that matter to him. I feel the same way about family farmers. That is what matters to me. I am not saying that [farming] doesn't matter to him or anybody else. I am not making a judgment about that. I am just saying that we have a full-blown emergency in rural America. 
   I held up a chart yesterday that showed the counties in this country which are losing population, which have lost over 15 percent of their population in the last 15 years. What you have is a huge red swath in the middle of America being depopulated--the middle part of our country. 
   We need a farm program that works. And when we see auction sale posters from wall to wall in small towns, and small town businesses boarded up--so many auction sales that they have to call retired auctioneers out of retirement to handle the sales--we ought to understand that this counts for something in this country and that we need to develop a public policy that says we are going to try to do something to stop the flow of family farmers who are leaving the land and discovering that their hopes and dreams have come to an end. 
   Every single month, we add a ``New York City'' in population to this Earth. Every month, a new ``New York City'' is added in population to this Earth. Yet, farmers are told that the food they  produce has no value. The market system says it has no value. That is not logical. Over half of the people on this Earth go to bed with an ache in their belly because they don't have enough to eat. 
   I have mentioned time and again--and I will do it again--that in Sudan people talk about old women climbing trees to gather leaves to eat because there is nothing to eat. Ask yourselves about the people in refugee camps today and what their needs are. It is food. Somehow this system of ours, in a Byzantine way, says that those who produce the food ought not to get full value for it, but those who make it into cereal, those who haul it, those who add value somehow should achieve record profits. There is something wrong with that system. 
   I hope this Senate will go on record saying that we need to do more and better. My personal feeling is that we need to take the caps off the loan rates. The farm bill--which I didn't vote for because I didn't think it was a good bill--was saying we will take away with the fine print what we promised to give you in the large print. We promised a loan rate, and we promised that that loan rate would produce $3.25 in wheat, but in the small print it was limited to about $2.58. 
   Let's take away that provision that limits the amount of support and help farmers during this period of collapsed prices and see if we can give them the opportunity to have a decent income when prices collapse. If we don't build a bridge across those valleys, nobody will do it. We will be left with a country full of giant agrifactories farming from California to Maine. We will get the food all right, but it will be more expensive, and nobody will be living in rural America. We will have lost something very important--family farmers, small towns, main street businesses, and a very special and unique part of this country's character that comes from that part of America. 
   So I am offering this motion to instruct conferees to ask that money be added above the Senate level for income support for family farmers. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me take a minute to say that I understand the point the Senator from New Mexico made. I appreciate the additional $6 billion that was added over the 5 years. My point is, it is far short of what we need in terms of income support. It is the case that the administration budget did not do nearly what it needed to do. But there comes a time at some point when the urgency of the situation in rural America really requires us to say this isn't about us or them anymore; it is about what we are going to do together to respond to a real problem of significant consequence to this country. We will simply not have family farmers left unless we together, Republicans and Democrats in Congress, recognize that we have a farm bill that says when market prices collapse, it's response is too bad. That can't be the farm bill response. 
   When market prices collapse, if we want to save family farmers, we have to build a bridge across those valleys. Only the largest corporate farms will survive a collapse in market prices. They are big enough and strong enough to survive. Family farmers can't and won't. So if we care about having people live out on the land, if we care about the special quality family farms and small towns give this country, then we must reconnect and provide some kind of basic safety net for family farmers. 
   Again, I see all these headlines about prairie dogs. They are going to save the prairie dog. God bless the prairie dog. There sure are plenty of them in my State. We don't need a special effort to save prairie dogs. We need to save family farmers. That is the message, and that is the urgency, in my judgment, for a public policy debate here in Congress and the establishment of the correct priorities in this budget to say to family farmers, ``You matter.'' Some say we need a national missile defense system. Yes, that might be the priority for some. But I happen to think we need a farm program that works for family farmers. In the absence of it, we are going to see wholesale bankruptcies and more and more auction sales, and this country will have lost something that is very important to its character and its economy. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder 
   of my time.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague from North Dakota, Mr. CONRAD, in introducing a bill to provide a final settlement on certain debts owned by the City of Dickinson, North Dakota, to the Bureau of Reclamation. The legislation is virtually identical to that introduced during the last Congress. 
   The Dickinson Dam Bascule Gates Settlement Act will provide long overdue relief to the citizens of Dickinson. Let me briefly explain why the debt liquidation is needed and appropriate. For one thing, the Bureau of Reclamation built a faulty project. The debt was incurred by the City of Dickinson for construction of a dam with gate structures which never worked properly. In addition, the need for the dam to help provide a reliable local water supply was eclipsed by the construction of the Southwest Pipeline, a project of the same Bureau of Reclamation. 
   The legislation itself is actually quite simple. It would permit the Secretary of the Interior to accept one final payment from the City of Dickinson in place of a series of payments now required by city's current repayment contract. 
   My colleague has described in some detail the complicated and frustrating story of the dam and bascule gates project. Let me underscore a couple of major points. In 1949 and 1950, the dam was constructed to provide an adequate water supply for the City of Dickinson, as well as some flood control and recreation. The bascule gates were added to augment storage capacity in the reservoir called Patterson Lake. Despite the city's concerns about the use of a gate structure on the dam, which had not previously been used in a northern climate, the gates actually failed in 1982. The ensuing modifications increased the cost of the project. 
   Another twist in the story is that by 1991 the city no longer needed the Patterson Lake water supply. As noted, it began to receive its water supply from the Southwest Pipeline. This is a major distribution network of the Garrison Diversion Unit, another Bureau of Reclamation project. This system provides both higher quality and more reliable water supplies than the city's previous supply from Patterson Lake. 
   Consequently, it makes no sense for the City of Dickinson to have two water supply systems when it needs only one--especially when the first system was a faulty one. The city has already repaid more than $1.2 million for the bascule gates, even though they now provide virtually no benefit to the city. 
   Last year, I was able to pass an appropriations amendment to provide partial relief for the city's debt. Unfortunately, this provision stalled in the conference committee. The North Dakota delegation also added an amendment for more complete debt relief to a package of water management projects, which did not pass in the last days of 1998 session. 
   Thus, we need to provide authority for Dickinson to settle its debt, to reallocate costs for operation and maintenance of the bascule gates and Dickinson Dam, and to permit the Secretary of the Interior to enter into appropriate water service contracts with the city for any beneficial use of the water in Patterson Lake. The proposed legislation will address those three objectives while also providing a fair settlement for the Federal Government and the City of Dickinson. 
   I want to commend my colleague from North Dakota for his leadership and cooperation in developing a sound solution to this problem. In term, I urge my colleagues to consider and pass this needed legislation.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as the Senate reconvenes from a 2-week Easter recess, I am sure a number of my colleagues will be coming to the floor to discuss the challenges and the difficulties and the circumstances that exist now with respect to the action being taken in Kosovo. I am one of those who voted to support airstrikes in Kosovo. We voted to give the President the authority to commit U.S. troops and airplanes to conduct airstrikes only, along with our NATO allies, to respond to the ethnic cleansing  and the genocide that has been occurring in Kosovo. 
   I believe it is in our national interest to respond in these circumstances when we see genocide being committed. When we see ethnic cleansing on the scale as has been committed in Kosovo, we have a responsibility as a community of nations to respond to it, to try to help and to save the lives of those poor, innocent people who are being repressed and in a good many cases murdered, and certainly in hundreds of thousands of cases removed from their homeland, by a tyrant, by someone who does not respect international law. Over 630,000 refugees have been forced from their homes in Kosovo, 25,000 of them loaded on trains in scenes that are reminiscent of the late stages in World War II, sending of the folks to the death camps in the Second World War. Reports of mass executions, burned villages, rapes and robberies--all of this is rampant. 
   I supported the airstrikes as part of a NATO response to stop this ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. The United States is doing this as a part of NATO, but the United States shoulders the bulk of the burden of the airstrikes in that region. There are 400 U.S. war planes, 400 U.S. aircraft involved in this operation, and about 200 aircraft from the allied nations. During the first week of the war, the United States flew about 90 percent of the sorties. In other words, 90 percent of the pilots and about 90 percent of the airplanes during the first week of that war were U.S. planes and pilots. 
   I expect we will have briefings this week about the consequences of the airstrikes that have been launched. We have seen substantial television coverage. There has been a great deal of news analysis of all of this, and I think probably everyone here in the Senate is concerned and nervous about what is happening. There is discussion now about whether ground troops ultimately will be needed in that region in order to complete the mission of NATO. I do not know the answer to that, but I do feel very strongly that the introduction of U.S. forces on the ground in the Balkans could be a very, very significant mistake. 
   The NATO allies, it seems to me, the NATO countries, particularly the European countries, have a greater responsibility, especially in their neighborhood, in their area of the world, to do what is necessary to make the commitment if ground troops are necessary to support this effort. We do not know the consequences of NATO action. We know the consequences of taking no action. That would be the continuation and perhaps the finality of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, perhaps the murder of tens of thousands of additional people, certainly the displacement of hundreds of thousands and more from Kosovo to refugee camps and to other places in the world. 
   That is unacceptable. None of us want 5 and 10 years from now to look back and say, ``What shame has been wrought upon this world with this ethnic cleansing and this genocide that we did nothing about it.'' That is the reason I think this country and the NATO allies decided we will not allow this to stand; we must take action. So we took action with airstrikes, and those airstrikes continue. 
   The next decision, I think, will be, Will there be ground troops needed? I will just say, speaking for myself, I am very concerned about the introduction of U.S. ground forces in the Balkans. I believe very strongly that the NATO countries, particularly the European countries, must bear a greater responsibility of that burden. If ground troops are needed for intervention in the Balkans, then I believe that the European countries ought to commit under NATO those ground troops. But I would be very concerned about a decision to commit U.S. ground troops in the Balkans. 
   Those of us in leadership on the Republican and Democratic side, both in the Senate and in the House, have been invited to meet with President Clinton tomorrow at the White House late in the morning. We will be discussing this issue, I suspect, in greater detail: What have the airstrikes accomplished? What is the mission? How does that mission now continue toward some kind of conclusion, and what might we expect that conclusion to be? 
   I do not agree with my colleagues at all who say our mission must be to be successful; our mission must be to win with respect to the goals we have established in this area. But no one should mistake that this is a very difficult set of circumstances. We acted because we had to, but this remains a very difficult set of circumstances for this country and for the NATO allies. 
   It is my hope that very soon Mr. Milosevic will understand that he cannot continue, that this country and many of us in this body view him as a war criminal. I am one who believes he should be tried as a war criminal in front of an international tribunal. I know some are reluctant to do that because then they say you are negotiating ultimately with a war criminal if you negotiate an end to the hostilities. 
   The fact is, because genocide is being committed, we are persuaded to go in to stop it. By definition, when we began this process, we decided this person was a war criminal at the start. Why are we reluctant now, at anyplace along this process, to ask an international tribunal to brand him, try him in absentia, if necessary, as a war criminal? 
   There will be much more to discuss on the subject of Kosovo in the coming days. I will be interested, as well, in the views of my colleagues and interested in the meeting with President Clinton tomorrow with the joint leadership of the House and the Senate. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on a different subject, the subject of family farming and agriculture, for another 8 minutes.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me, as we turn towards the agenda before the Senate, from now perhaps until the Fourth of July, to understand that we face an urgent situation in rural America. Family farmers today, in my State and your State, if you represent the farm belt, went to the bank and were told that their investments, all of their 20 or 30 years invested in their farm are gone. They will not be able to plant the ground and raise a crop this year because they are out of money. 
   I want to read a letter I received from a woman. I talked to her by phone this morning. I was so struck by it, because she represents so well the dilemma and the urgency that we face in family farming. 
   This is a woman named, Susan Jorgenson, who is from North Dakota. Her husband died last August. She said that he had diabetes. She writes:  
   ..... what I really feel caused his death was trying to make a living as a farmer. 
   I had an auction last week to sell the [farm] machinery, so that I can pay off some of the debt that [we] incurred after 26 years of farming. I have a 17 yr. old son who would not help me prepare for this auction and did not get out of bed the day of the [auction] sale, because he is so heartbroken that he can not continue [to farm] this land. 
   My husband was an excellent manager and fully educated.  
   He had a masters degree.  
   He chose to farm rather than to live in Phoenix where he had a job with Motorola [early on], because he wanted to raise his children in a place with clean air, no crime and good schools. He worked very hard, physically and emotionally to make this farm work and its failure was ..... no fault of his own.  
   What do we say to families who live on America's farms when prices collapse for the product they produce? And when they take a truckload of grain to the elevator, that elevator operator says, ``Well, the grain market for this grain you produced has no value''? The farmer who worked to plant and harvest the crops, risked the money to farm to get that grain to the elevator thinks, ``Gosh, that's a strange set of circumstances. I'm told my crop has no value, and yet much of the world goes to bed with an ache in their belly because they don't have enough to eat.'' 
   People are starving in other parts of the world. We have images of old women climbing trees scavenging for leaves to eat because there is nothing else to eat. We had a report recently noting a country with a million to a million and a quarter people on the abyss of starvation, and our farmers are told their crops have no value. 
   The challenge for us in this Congress is to decide whether family farmers matter in our country.  
   I have a chart that shows all of those counties in America, shown in red, where they have lost more than 15 percent of their population. Largely, it shows in the center part of our country, the farm belt, that people have moved out. Our farm belt is being depopulated. 
   A century ago we had the Homestead Act to persuade people to 
   come out and begin farming. If you moved out there, the Federal Government gave you 160 acres of land. You were a homesteader; you farmed the land. And we populated the farm belt. 
   Now look at what has happened: The farm belt is being depopulated for a good number of reasons, the most important of which, in my judgment, is we have a farm program that does not work. The farm program says, ``You're on your own. When market prices collapse, we're not going to provide decent support prices.'' 
   We need to reconnect with decent price supports. We need a Fair Price Plan for Family Farmers, and we need it soon. This Congress has a responsibility, in my judgment, between now and the July 4 recess, to address this urgent situation on America's family farms and to say to family farmers, ``You matter, the products you produce make a difference, they have value, and this country stands behind what you represent in our country.'' 
   We need to do a number of things. We need to pass a better Farm Bill, as I said, a Fair Price Plan. We need meat labeling that will help our ranchers. Let people know what they are eating and where it came from. We need price reporting. Let's see fair prices and full price reporting on livestock prices. Let's break up some of the monopolies that exist in the slaughterhouses. Eighty-seven percent of America's fat steers go to four slaughterhouses to be slaughtered. What that means is, you pass that monopoly pricing back on family farmers. They are the ones who are already losing money. 
   Isn't it interesting that every firm in this country who touches what a farmer produces, whether it is a steak or a bushel of wheat or a bushel of corn, is making money. The railroads are making record profits hauling it. The cereal manufacturers are making record profits crisping and puffing it, putting it into a box and selling it as cereal. The folks that slaughter the beef, the pork, the poultry, and the sheep are making record profits. It is the farmer who rises to do the chores, to plant the ground, to harvest the crops, who is going broke because they are told their commodities have no value. 
   That is a bankrupt approach for this economy. The economy, if it rewards hard work and the production of things people in this world need, will do well. But we decided that the all-star economic producers in America, the American family farmers, don't matter and we passed a farm bill that says, you're on your own; you deal with the marketplace and we don't care what the marketplace looks like. The farm bill is stacked against you, it favors monopolistic businesses, it presses its heavy boot upon you and you can't do anything about it. That is tough luck because it says we don't need you anymore, we don't need family farmers, all we need are giant agribusinesses. 
   If that is the position that is taken in this country, this country will have taken a giant step backwards. 
   So I am saying that in the coming 2 or 3 months we must recognize the urgency of the situation on the family farm. Farmer after farmer after farmer in State after State are going broke, through no fault of their own. This young boy, who could not bear to attend the auction sale at his own farm, because it broke his heart not to be able to farm that land that his dad and his granddad and great-granddad farmed, this boy ought to hear from this Congress that we stand ready to help, that we care about preserving families on America's farms, that the decentralization of food production, a network of family farms dotting this country's prairies, strengthens America, that producing food that a hungry world needs is something that is an asset in this country, not a liability. 
   So I hope in the next 2 to 3 months those who care about family farmers will join those of us who come from the farm belt to pass aggressive, good, strong legislation dealing with concentration, monopolies, price reporting, meat labeling, and a decent price support--all of those issues and more--that will finally say to family farmers, you have a decent opportunity to make a living on America's family farms. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. But before I do, I thank my colleague from Maine for waiting patiently. 
   Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DORGAN. That amendment is an amendment that I have introduced with a number of my colleagues, including Mr. DASCHLE. So let me begin by describing the amendment and the reason that we are here. I will then call on my colleague from North Dakota, Senator CONRAD, Senator DASCHLE, and others. 
   Mr. President, first, let me tell you that I am offering an amendment for my colleagues to try to strengthen rural America, and to try to provide some better price supports for family farmers. 
   I want to tell you about a 90-year-old woman I talked to this morning. Her name is Margaret Hansen. A few weeks ago, Margaret, age 90, got in her car in the rural part of North Dakota and got stuck in a snow bank. This 90-year-old lady got out of her car and began to walk. She walked a mile and a half when her legs gave out. Then this 90-year-old woman began to crawl on this gravel road. She crawled for a half mile, and then she couldn't crawl any longer. She laid there huddled on that road apparently for about 8 hours before someone came along in a pickup truck and stopped to wonder what was lying on the road. He found this 90-year-old woman. She wasn't dead. They took her to a hospital. 
   I am happy to report that Margaret is doing quite well. She said to me, yeah, I am doing fine, but my legs aren't so good. She was remarkably upbeat. 
   Why would it take 7 or 8 hours before a 90-year-old woman is found lying on a gravel road in the middle of winter? That's because there aren't many people living in rural America anymore. 
   I want to show you a chart. This chart shows, blocked out in red, the counties in this country that are losing population. If you look at the farm belt in the Great Plains, up and down the middle part of America, you will see a part of our country that is being depopulated. And some of these counties have lost half their population in a relatively short period of time. 
   Now, why is that? The overriding reason is we have a farm program that doesn't work. We have a farm program that doesn't allow family farmers to stay on the land and work the land. We have a miserable farm program that pulls the rug out from under family farmers. 
   Let me show you a chart that shows what has happened to the price of wheat. The price of wheat has dropped 53 percent since the passage of the farm law. It was $5.75 a bushel. Last, month prices received by farmers nationwide average $2.72. Now, ask yourself, if instead of the price of wheat it were your salary or your profit, your wages, your minimum wage, your Social Security check, were cut in half? If this was your income, how do you think you would be doing? 
   We have folks in the Senate who said some years ago within budget debate that we are going to change the farm program. In making those changes, in essence they told rural America that they were going to pull the rug out from underneath family farmers. They were going to have farmers operate in the marketplace and, when prices collapse, the nation won't care. If farmers go out of business, they wouldn't care. They basically said they don't care whether there are family farmers in this country's future. Boy, you talk about a wrongheaded public policy for America. That was it. 
   What my colleagues and I are suggesting today is that it is time to decide that family farmers matter in this country. It is time to provide the resources to get some price protection so that when commodity prices collapse, those folks operating out on America's farms have the underpinnings so that  they are going to be able to get across those price valleys. That way, they will be able to continue working the land, continue a rural lifestyle. Other countries do it. But, our country has decided that, gee, if things are fine on Wall Street, they are fine everywhere. 
   That is not true. This country has a very strong economy. Things are going well in this country. But our family farmers face a very serious crisis. This is a serious emergency on the family farm, and we must do something to respond to it.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me continue briefly and then call on my colleague from North Dakota, Senator CONRAD, and I believe the Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE, will be here as well. 
   Imagine for a moment that corporate profits were cut by 50 percent, or 75 percent, or 90 percent, as farm income was cut one year recently in my State. Imagine what would happen in this country if that were the case, and corporate profits were slashed. We would have an apoplectic seizure here in Congress trying to figure out what happened and what can we do about it. 
   The question is what do we do about the economic all-stars, the families out there on our family farms that produce, raise crops, and take the risks? What about when their income collapses? Again, we have people here who say that doesn't matter and that corporations can farm America from the California coast to Maine. It doesn't matter, they say. I cannot describe how wrong they are. So we come to the floor to say we propose this amendment to add $6 billion a year, which would provide the opportunity for real, significant price support increases when commodity prices collapse for family farmers. Is that a lot to ask? 
   We hear folks come to the floor and say defense needs more. So, we stick in money for defense. We want to build a missile system. You put $1 billion in for a missile system last fall that the Defense Department said it did not want and could not use. Money for tax cuts? There's plenty of money for that. But what about money for mom and pop out there on the family farm who are ravaged by collapsed prices? No, they say, we are out of money. 
   I would say this. This Congress is out of ideas when it comes to family farming, if it believes the current farm program is the road to prosperity for these producers who are this country's real economic all-stars. We need to backtrack just a bit and decide that family farmers matter to this country's future. We need to say to them that we are going to reconnect a reasonable price protection program. So, when prices collapse our country will say to farmers that we will give them a chance to make it across those price valleys. 
   I started by talking about Margaret Hansen, the 90-year-old woman from North Dakota. We are a sparsely populated State. Half of our economy is agriculture. But that is also true with respect to a major part of this farm belt. This Congress should understand that America's economy is never going to be doing well in the long term if the middle part of its farm belt is being depopulated. Food production is important to this country's future and the health of family farming is important in producing America's food. 
   Let me call on my colleague from North Dakota and allocate 7 minutes to my colleague, Senator CONRAD.

   Mr. DORGAN. Would the Presiding Officer notify me when I have 1 minute remaining? 
   Mr. President, this is about priorities. We just heard my colleague say: ``Well, this isn't a priority. We don't have resources for this.'' Gosh, we have resources for some very large tax cuts. If that is their priority, then there is money for that. Or, what about the $1 billion for national missile defense which the Department of Defense says it does not want, does not need, and cannot spend. They have money for that. And, then there is $110 billion or so for readiness in defense. They have money for that.  
   The question is, What is a priority? We do have a surplus of empathy and sympathy. I do not disagree with that. Everybody empathizes and sympathizes. 
   The fact is, we have farmers going broke in record numbers. 
   How would you feel I would ask if any of you listening or watching or participating had your income cut by 98 percent? All of a sudden you have 98 percent less income. Would that be a catastrophe? I think it would. That is what happened to our farmers. I had a fellow at a forum, a big, husky guy with a beard. He said, ``My dad farmed, my granddad farmed on the same place. I farmed for 23 years.'' Then he got tears in his eyes and his chin began to quiver. He said, ``I am quitting, I can't continue. I am being forced off the farm.'' 
   That is what this amendment is about. We need to consider the human toll of farm failures all across this country. What will be left when only the corporate agrifactories are producing America's food. Some people think that would be great because they love big corporations--the bigger the better. Of course, there will be no yardlights lighting farmsteads. There will be nobody living in the country, because all the farmers who risked their money will have found that the auction block served as the final resting place for their dreams and their hopes. 
   We can do something about that if we decide it is a priority. 
   I say to my colleague from New Mexico, this is where the current farm bill started in 1995. It started right here in the budget. It is where it ought to stop. It is where we ought to make the modifications and changes. It is where we, as a Congress, ought to say this is a priority, and that family farmers are a priority. But, it is not just about farm families. It is also about Main Streets and small towns. It is about the economic and social fabric in a part of our country that is now being depopulated. 
   Let me again refer to this chart. The red on the chart shows the middle part of the country, which is full of rural counties that are losing population. This little place right here is where I grew up in Hettinger County, North Dakota. When I left, there were 5,000 people in that county. Today, there are 3,000 people. That county is symbolic of so much of the farm belt that is now being depopulated because we have a farm program that doesn't work. 
   There is a whole range of other programs that we must address. It is not enough to say that things will work out, or that this doesn't matter. This matters very much to a significant part of America. We have a right to be standing here on the floor of the Senate saying, this too is a priority. This is a priority for us, for our part of the country, and for family farmers. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. DORGAN. Let me respond to a couple points. 
   First, let's talk about national missile defense. He makes an interesting argument, but the Senator misunderstood what I said. I talked about the $1 billion last fall that was stuck into the omnibus appropriations bill. No one asked for it and the Defense Department said they couldn't use it. Go track the money and find out what happened to it. They didn't want it, but Congress said, ``We demand you take it.'' My point is, if it is a priority, then the sky is the limit. It doesn't matter that it is not needed. That is the point I was making. 
   The tax-and-spend cliche is such an old argument it is calcified. I thought I heard the last of that some years ago. This debate is about what is important and what are our priorities. 
   I want to talk about the big print and the little print which got us to this mess. Some years ago, we had people in Congress who said we should change the farm program. In the big print in the 1996 farm law it says that we will provide a marketing loan and it will be at 85 percent of the Olympic average of the prices received by farmers in the previous five years. That was the big print. Then they put the little print in the bill. It said, by the way, although we promised you that marketing loan at 85 percent, we are going to cap it at $2.58 a bushel for wheat. What the big print giveth, the little print taketh away. 
   Does it matter? Does it cost? Of course. It matters in terms of the failure of hopes and dreams for family farmers who are bankrupted by these little print policies. These little print policies really say that family farming doesn't matter too much to this country anymore. It says that we would rather have big corporate agrifactories. It says we like corporate agriculture. and corporate farming. It says that mom and pop don't have to live out there so the yardlights don't have to be on. It says we can mechanically milk all the cows and have 3,000-head dairy herds. That is a very different version of America than I have and a different sense of priorities than I think should exist for this country. 
   That is what this debate is about. The Senator from New Mexico says this should go to the Agriculture Committee. This started in 1995 in the Budget Committee. That is where it started. The budget resolution prescribed the Freedom to Farm bill. If you can start the farm bill in 1995 in the Budget Committee, we can, it seems to me, debate it in 1999 as we debate the budget resolution. 
   Today, we face depression-era prices on the farm. Family farmers are going belly up on a wholesale basis out there in the country and this Congress must do something about it. 
   Did the President's budget address this? No. Does this budget resolution address it in an appropriate way? No. Do I 
   appreciate that the Budget Committee put in $6 billion over 6 years or so for crop insurance? Of course I do. I appreciate that. But it is so far short of what is needed. We are about $5 billion  a year short of what we used to do to provide to fund price protection for family farmers. 
   Today we need to repair that by deciding our priority in this budget resolution is to stand up and help family farmers during this time of trouble.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the amendment we will consider next is an amendment which provides an opportunity to address the dire emergency that exists on American farms. All of us in this Chamber know that farm prices have collapsed. We also know that we face the prospect of losing tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands perhaps, of family farmers unless something is done to restore some price protection during this time. 
   The amendment I have offered is the only opportunity to do that. It provides room in this Budget Act for a $6-billion-per-year price protection opportunity.  
   In 1995, the budget resolution that we considered was the start of the change of farm programs to the new Freedom to Farm bill. In this budget resolution, we are trying to provide an opportunity to repair the deficiencies in that bill that stripped away much of the needed price protection. 
   This amendment I hope will be supported by my colleagues and give us the opportunity this year, after a midyear correction by the Congressional Budget Office, to use needed resources to help family farmers during their dire emergency. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. I found the presentation interesting. I ask the Senator from New Jersey, is it not the case that both of the proposals, the one from the majority side and the one from the minority side, coming from the Budget Committee, save all of the Social Security surplus, but the major difference is that the proposal offered by the Senator from New Jersey also proposes to move some resources to help deal with the Medicare issue?

   Mr. DORGAN. As I ask that question, I intend to come to the floor following the Senator from Illinois and make a presentation on this issue of saving Social Security. I can 
   recall a few years ago when dozens of people on the floor stood up and said that proposition is nothing but a gimmick. In fact, the proposal was to put in the Constitution a requirement that the Social Security revenues be considered part of ordinary revenues for the purpose of determining whether or not you have a budget surplus. I will come to the floor to talk about that. 
   I just say I am delighted that everybody apparently has now come to the same position on this question of whether we ought to save the Social Security surpluses for the purpose which they were intended in the first instance. But those of us who insisted that be done, against the wishes of those who wanted to put that practice in the Constitution about 3 or 4 years ago, were told our position was gimmickry. 
   It not only was not gimmickry, it was transcendental truth about what we ought to do with these resources. The Senator has it right, as does now the Senator from New Mexico: Let us save the Social Security surplus, but let us at the same time allow room, as the Senator from New Jersey does, to invest and strengthen Medicare at the same time. That is, I think, the purpose of the alternative offered by the Senator from New Jersey, which I think should commend it here to the Senate.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the agenda for the Senate this week is to continue on the supplemental appropriations bill. Then at some point this week we will go to the budget bill. My hope is that we will finish work on the supplemental appropriations bill. I understand that we are heading towards a vote tomorrow on cloture on a Kosovo amendment to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. So we are off on a range of other issues, that being a foreign policy issue. We already had votes on tobacco and tobacco proceeds from the settlement, and so on. 
   But my hope is that one way or another we will get through the supplemental appropriations bill in order to provide the resources in that legislation for spring planting loans for family farmers. There are not very many weeks until our family farmers will be in the fields, and they need some operating loans to buy the seed and the fuel and to pay the expenses to do spring planting. And we have many farmers in North Dakota who are not, under current circumstances, going to be able to get loans from the Farm Service Agency unless we pass this supplemental bill. 
   So if we do not pass the supplemental appropriations bill this week, and we go home, then we are not in session the next 2 weeks, we are going to be leaving these farmers in pretty tough circumstances. Then this supplemental has to go through the House, the Senate, and go to the President for his signature. Frankly, the fate of a lot of family farmers rests on our ability to get this done. 
   Last week, a friend of mine announced that he was quitting farming, which I suppose is not such unusual news these days. A lot of farmers are quitting farming. This friend happens to be Elroy Lindaas, who is a State senator. Elroy is a wonderful fellow. He  farms near Mayville, ND. I have been to the barn dance on his farm a good many times. I guess the last time was about 5 months ago. The barn dances that Elroy has are held up in the hayloft of a very large white barn. 
   Elroy and his wife have gone to various garage sales in and around Mayville over the years, and they would pick up a davenport here or a couch or a chair. So up in the hayloft of his barn he has this large expanse lined with very comfortable old chairs. 
   He has built himself a little stage. He plays guitar and he has neighbors that play musical instruments, as well. At this barn dance that he holds every year, they get a little band together. They hang some crepe paper. They get a couple hundred people who come up and fill the hayloft at the Lindaas barn. 
   On this farmstead, they have planted 120 consecutive crops. For 120 years they have planted crops on the Lindaas farm. But this year, the 121st year they won't be planting a crop because he is selling his farm this June. 
   Here is a farm that has been in that family for 120 years, passed from granddad to dad and son. Why does that farm at this point cease operation? Why does the family decide it cannot make it any longer? Here is a family farmer trying to do business, with prices for wheat and other grains at Depression-era prices. In constant dollars, the price they get for a bushel of wheat today is no different than it was during the Great Depression. 
   What does all this mean and what do we do about it all? The chart with this map shows what is happening in our country as we talk about the choices and priorities we will make in the supplemental appropriations bill and then the budget bill. This map shows those counties, which are marked in red, where we have had an outmigration of people. You will see the outmigration from the middle part of America, up and down the farm belt and especially in North Dakota. Up and down the entire farm belt in the Great Plains, we have an entire region of America that is being depopulated. People are leaving, not coming. Look at all of these counties, each of these in red are rural counties in which the population is leaving. These are the counties that have lost fifteen percent or more of their population in a fifteen-year period. 
   My home county, Hettinger County, ND, is probably a good example. Hettinger County, ND, is right here in Southwestern North Dakota. It, too, is marked in red. When I left Hettinger County there were 5,000 citizens living there. Now there are 3,000 citizens. The next county is Slope County. Both my home county and the next county are the size of Rhode Island, individually. Slope County has 900 people. A year ago or so they had seven babies born in the entire county. 
   What is happening with the depopulation of rural areas, with people moving out, not moving in? Elroy Lindaas, after 120 years of planting crops and making a family farm work, is saying, ``I can't do it anymore.'' 
   What is happening? A lot of things. The Presiding Officer will not be surprised when I mention the current farm bill, which in my judgment, is a disaster. In fact, it is interesting that in 1995 when we discussed the Budget Act on the floor of the Senate, that budget bill provided the framework for changing the farm bill. The budget that year framed the requirements under which a new farm bill had to be developed. It was developed into what was called the Freedom to Farm bill. 
   Freedom to Farm had two parts to it. One part made a lot of sense. It gave farmers the freedom to plant what they chose to plant, not what the Federal Government allowed them to plant. 
   Second, it cut the tie between farm prices and government payments. The bill's sponsors said because farm prices were so good and so robust and healthy at that time, we would give a transition payment on top of the current strong market prices, and then farmers would be on their own. That payment would decrease over a number of years after which farmers would be on their own. That was essentially the theory of the program. It was called transitioning-the-farmers-out-of-a-farm program. 
   The problem is, farm prices didn't stay healthy and family farmers discovered very quickly that as commodity prices for wheat, feed grains and others began to collapse, there wasn't much of a price support for them. There wasn't a government program that said, ``You are important. So, when commodity prices collapse, somehow we will build a bridge over that pricing valley to see if we can help you get across.'' 
   We have our farm people looking 2 years, 5 years, 7 years ahead. They hear the economists say prices aren't going to improve much. They say if that is the case and if the Federal Government is not going to help and doesn't care whether there are family farmers left, they will leave. That is what is creating the depopulation of a rural area. 
   It is also true that the ability to raise grain here and ship it to Asia has diminished, as the Asian financial crisis took away our export markets. It is true that this administration has not been nearly as aggressive as it should have been on the Export Enhancement Program. It is also true that, frankly, the Congress did not provide what the administration asked for on EEP. The administration, Congress, and the markets shaped the circumstances that now conspire in ways that say to farmers there is not much hope for you out here. 
   As we watch the depopulation of a major part of our country, let me make another observation. Those farmers that stay in business will harvest a crop this fall and receive a price that is pretty anemic. When the farmers get in the truck and haul the grain to the elevator, they will be told the food they produce doesn't really have much value. The farmers will scratch their heads and say, ``I don't understand that.'' 
   This world adds a New York City in population every single month. Every single month another New York City in population appears on the face of this globe. At least a half billion people and probably far more than that go to bed every single night with an ache in their belly because they don't have anything to eat. Yet, we are telling our farmers that what they produce has no value. There is something fundamentally wrong with that. 
   Working on a bipartisan basis as a Congress, we have to find a way in this budget mechanism to say to family farmers that their presence in this country matters to America. It strengthens our country to have our food production produced by a network of broad-based economic owners, by our family farmers. It strengthens our country to have the family farm system existing in America. 
   We must decide and decide quickly that the current farm bill doesn't work. It must be changed. People say, ``Do you want to go back to the old support prices?'' I don't know. I am willing to discuss that. If you have a better idea, let me know. But, do you really want to go to any community in this area and say our nation's policy is more of the same? Do we want to keep seeing outmigration, and collapsed farm prices? Do we want to keep transitioning farmers out of farming? 
   Whatever ideas exist in this Chamber, I am willing to discuss. I have an idea for the first step. Let's take the caps off the price support loan rates and at least give farmers what the big print said it was going to give them in the farm bill, and what the fine print took away. Let's take the caps off the loan rates, and get the loan rates up to where they ought to be. That is the first step. 
   We have all the farm organizations around town who purport to support family farmers. I assume that is who is financing them. Yet, every single one has a different message about what ought to be done. Some do not support taking the cap off the loan rates. They don't have ideas, but they oppose those who do have ideas. 
   At some point, if we are going to save family farming for this country, we have to get together and find some kind of approach that will reconnect a decent income to those who produce. 
   This isn't the fault of family farmers. This is not their doing. They didn't cause the markets to collapse. They didn't cause the financial crisis in Asia. They didn't cause the unfair trade from Canada that allows a massive quantity of spring wheat and durum wheat to flood into our marketplace. They didn't cause that, and they ought not be victims.  
   They didn't cause the foreign policy problems that require us to have sanctions against other countries, or the foolish notion that we ought to have any sanctions at all on food and medicine. Farmers didn't cause that. 
   That is another step we ought to take. I don't say this suggesting that it will solve the farm problem, because it won't. We ought to decide all sanctions on food and medicine anywhere in the world ought to be ended. I may offer that to the budget resolution this week. Does anyone think Saddam Hussein or Fidel Castro missed a meal because we can't ship food to Cuba or Iraq? Not hardly. All that sanctions hurt are our farmers here in this country and poor people and hungry people abroad. 
   My point is we must pass this supplemental bill in order to allow some of these family farmers to get into the field this spring. Without it, many of them won't get into the field. Then we must fix this farm program because this farm program doesn't work. We must work on a range of other issues, including trade to deal with the unfair trade problems our farmers face. There are a whole series of other steps that we can and should take. 
   I want to mention this issue of priorities. I come from one of the most rural States in America, and our family farmers are in desperate trouble. 
   Even as we debate these issues, we are told there is limited money available and we just can't do all of these things. If that is your priority, then farmers don't matter much. 
   I mentioned that in 1995 the genesis of the current farm bill originated here on the Senate floor in the Budget Act that was brought for a vote to the Senate. And so better farm policy could start this week here in the budget resolution that is brought to the Senate later this week. 
   Let's talk about what the priorities are. The majority party will bring a domestic budget mark to the floor this week that decreases domestic spending by slightly over $20 billion. The proposed mark of the Budget Committee will have a $9.1 billion increase for defense over that which was assumed in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. So, in defense, their budget will provide $290 billion, a $9 billion increase. But, in other domestic discretionary spending, their budget would take $20 billion in cuts. 
   Now, last year in the fall, we passed some emergency aid for farmers. In that omnibus appropriations bill Congress provided aid for a range of things, including agriculture. $1 billion was added for the national missile defense program. $1 billion. It was money that wasn't asked for by the Defense Department. This money wasn't needed by the Defense Department. The Defense Department said it was spending money as rapidly as it could to find the technology and the solutions to hitting a bullet with a bullet, which is what the national missile defense program is. 
   The Defense Department said it really didn t have the capability of using any more money. The Congress said it didn't matter to them and demanded that they have $1 billion more. So $1 billion more emerged. I tried to get a few thousand dollars, a few hundred-thousand-dollars, or a few million dollars to deal with the emergencies in Indian housing and Indian health care. I couldn't do it. But $1 billion, which the Department of Defense didn't want, didn't ask for, and didn't need emerged mysteriously. In fact, it turns out that they could not even spend it. 
   Of the $1 billion, the Department of Defense could only find $150 million in uses in fiscal year 1999. Do you know what that was for? A third of it, amounting to $56 million was used for contract transition and rebaselining. Does anybody know what that is? Does that sound as if you are building a weapon? Contract transition and rebaselining. They are going to allocate another $50 million in the next fiscal year because they could not use it in the last fiscal year. They want to use $400 million on things other than national missile defense because they could not find a use for it in national missile defense. 
   This priority comes from a Congress that says that we don't have enough money and we can't help these farm folks. It doesn't matter that these farmers aren't doing very well. They say we can't help them much because we don't have the money. 
   My point is that this is about making choices. We have a responsibility to make thoughtful choices, good choices, choices that will strengthen our country. I find it more than a bit disappointing to discover that there is plenty of money for someone else's priorities, but not enough money to deal with what I think is a priority for this country such as the long-term economic health of family farming. 
   I want to also mention one contributing factor to the farm troubles in this country of ours. I mentioned trade just a moment ago. I want to go back to it because our prices have collapsed for a range of reasons. These are the prices that our farmers receive for grain when they haul it to the elevator. One of the reasons is that we have a trade policy in this country that is a terrible trade policy. We say to the rest of the world that we are for free trade, open trade, come and trade with us. Yet, we refuse to stand up and have any backbone at all to stand for our producers when we are the victims of unfair trade. 
   Let me give you an example. The Canadians continue to flood our country with their durum wheat and their spring wheat, 
   undercutting our farmers' prices. Our nation can't seem to do a thing about it. For years now, it has gone on. I acknowledge that our Trade Ambassador and this President have taken some action, which is more than previous Presidents have done. Previous Presidents would not give the time of day to this issue. But this President's action and the action of the Trade Ambassador is far short of what it should be, and they know it. 
   I found it interesting when I was in Europe a few months ago and I picked up the paper. I read that we are going into a trade war with Europe over bananas. I am sitting there in Europe thinking, gee, that is strange. Let's see, where do we produce bananas in the United States? I guess maybe we produce a few bananas in Hawaii. But by and large, we don't produce bananas in the United States. So why do we have a Trade Ambassador prepared to go into a trade war over bananas, something we don't produce? I guess it is because U.S. corporations produce bananas in Latin America and they are trying to sell them to Europe. Europe won't let the bananas in, so we get all exercised and we are going to have a trade war over bananas. 
   I want to ask the Trade Ambassador this: If you are willing to go into a trade war over bananas, which we don't produce, would you be willing to take some reasonable action against countries that inundate our markets and cut our prices on something we do produce, such as spring wheat, durum, and barley? Why is it that we are willing to go to bat here and ratchet up a big trade dispute with Europe over bananas when we don't produce any real bananas. Yet, we seem unable, or unwilling, to take action against the Canadians, who clearly are violating our trade laws and who are causing massive dislocation in the center part of our country by undercutting our grain markets and hurting our family farmers.? 
   Oh, I have thought from time to time about getting a truckload of bananas and dumping it on the front steps of the USTR s office to say at least here you can see some bananas when you walk out. You won't see any in the fields and you won't see any banana trees anywhere you look in the continental United States. You have this big trade dispute going on over bananas, which you won't be able to find in most corners of this country. That would at least give our trade office a chance to see bananas. But I decided I could not afford to do that, and it would probably be a stupid stunt anyway. 
   Somebody needs to say: You are not thinking straight. If you want to stand up for the economic interests of this country, then stand up for things we produce. Then someone will say to me: Mr. Senator, you know there are some agricultural groups that support action against Europe on the banana issue? Yes, I am sure there are. We have dozens of farm organizations in this country who say they speak for farmers, and they wouldn't know a pair of coveralls from an oil rag. I mean, they wouldn't know a pickup truck from a razorback hog. In fact, they don't know much about farming. They are about agribusiness. They lobby under the  name of farmers, but they really represent the agrifactories of this country. 
   I say to them: You are off supporting this dispute about bananas, and you are probably all upset that I am undercutting you. No, all I am interested in doing is getting the limited resources of the U.S. Trade Ambassador's office to start fighting for the economic interests of what we produce in this country. Things like wheat and steel? Sure, we have people concerned about steel. I will join them. How about focusing on wheat coming in from Canada at secret prices, sent to us by a state trading enterprise that would be illegal in this country? We send auditors up to Canada and they say, ``We want information about what price you are selling for.'' They say, ``We are sorry, we don't intend to give you any information at all.'' That is violative of our trade laws, and we ought to have a Trade Ambassador who will do something about that and a President who will join her to say it is time to stop that kind of unfair trade. 
   Well, Mr. President, my time is about over. I know that, as we begin the budget process this week and as we complete, hopefully, action on the supplemental this week, we will have a 
   discussion about choices. I have talked a great deal about agriculture and the farm program. 
   Let me conclude by saying that one of the most significant choices we will make, in addition to those I have described, will be the issue of the broad choices of what we are able to do with the future surplus. One of the major choices will be to determine whether there will be reserves left from that surplus to invest in Social Security and to protect Medicare. I am especially concerned with the issue of Medicare, which is the major issue that represents the difference between the two budget resolutions that will be brought to the floor of the Senate. 
   That, I think, will be an aggressive and healthy debate and an appropriate one. 
   There are those who stood on this floor some 35 or so years ago and said that the Medicare Program would make sense for this country for senior citizens who had no health care. They found that insurance companies were not lining up to ask if they can insure older folks. They didn't run around looking for older folks to insure, because old folks aren't the kind of people you make money from. You insure young, healthy people, and make money from those folks. 
   Sixty percent of the senior citizens of this country had no health insurance, and we passed Medicare over the objections of many. Now, 99 percent of the senior citizens in this country have health care. They don't go to bed at night worried about whether their health circumstance will change in a way that will cause them very substantial trouble because they won't have the money to deal with their health care needs. Medicare relieves them of that kind of anxiety. 
   We must, it seems to me, commit ourselves, in the context of choices that we make in the budget this year and in future years, to the long-term financial future and solvency of both Social Security and Medicare. I think in the next 2 or 3 days we will have a robust, healthy, and aggressive debate on this. Perhaps the debate will include some who never liked Medicare in the first place, and who wouldn't vote for it now, if they had a chance. I have heard a couple of people suggest as much in recent years. But, there are those on that side and perhaps many of us on the other who believe very strongly that this is a program that has been very, very healthy for tens of millions of American people and who believe that we ought to continue to provide solvency for it in the long term. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from Texas and, I must say, there are many Members of the Senate who have concerns about a range of these issues. But I will also say that one of my concerns is that as sensitive negotiations occur in Belgrade today with Mr. Holbrooke and others, a resolution that says ``The United States national security interests in Kosovo do not rise to a level that warrants military operations'' seems not to 
   be the best of timing. 
   I understand all the points the Senator made. As she knows, we have had some discussions about NATO in the past. I am someone who voted against expanding NATO for a number of reasons. But NATO does exist. This country is a part of NATO, and NATO has indicated to Mr. Milosevic that there are consequences to his actions. The actions he has taken obviously include the slaughter of innocent civilians. 
   I am troubled, I guess, by having a resolution on the floor of the Senate at this moment. There will be a time and should be a time for a robust and aggressive discussion about what exactly is in our national security interest. 
   I was someone who was nervous about Bosnia. I would characterize the circumstances in Bosnia differently than the Senator from Texas did. There is not just a cease-fire there, there is a peace agreement in Bosnia, and this country went to Bosnia as a peacekeeper, not a peacemaker. We did not send American troops into Bosnia to create a peace that did not exist. We sent American troops in as part of a NATO contingent in Bosnia to keep a peace that already existed. Those of us who were watching what happened in Bosnia understood genocide was occurring in that area. We got involved through NATO. Frankly, it has worked to this point in a manner that has undoubtedly saved the lives of many in that region. 
   The Kosovo issue is, in many ways, as difficult and perhaps more difficult, and I do not know that airstrikes will have any impact at all. I honestly do not know. The Senator from Texas indicates that the President should consult with Congress, and she is absolutely correct about that. I know that there was a meeting on Friday. I was invited to a meeting at the White House on Friday, as were a number of my colleagues. I believe a bipartisan group of Members of Congress were at the White House on Friday when the President discussed the circumstances in Kosovo. 
   I, too, think consultation on these matters is required. Also required is a significant and robust debate about exactly what is in this country's national interest. The Senator from Texas has been very consistent on raising these questions over a long period of time. 
   However, it bothers me some that the timing of this particular amendment comes at exactly the moment that there are these discussions today in Belgrade with President Milosevic about the consequences of continuing to do what he is doing. Obviously, anybody has a right to offer any amendment. But I was, frankly, surprised to see the amendment that has been offered as a second-degree amendment. I understand that there will be a vote on a cloture motion tomorrow at 2:15 on this second-degree amendment. And this is a very difficult time for us to be essentially sending this message to Mr. Milosevic.

   Mr. DORGAN. If I might reclaim my time, the timing here is more than ``less than perfect,'' as the Senator suggested. If I were involved in negotiations this afternoon in Belgrade with Mr. Milosevic, the Lott amendment would be of great concern to me, because I would expect that someone sitting across the table from me would  say, ``Well, you are offering threats of airstrikes, but I can tell you that at this moment there is legislation pending in the U.S. Senate to prohibit those very strikes you're suggesting represent the threat to me.'' 
   I only say that I wish at this point we could have found a way--or could still find a way--to have the kind of debate about what is in the national security interest, what is the role of NATO, all of the kinds of discussions that the Senator suggests. Clearly, those are discussions we should and will have. But I rose simply to say I think the timing of this amendment detracts from the ability of our negotiators to express the threat of NATO action. 
   If I were negotiating for our side, debating this amendment is probably the last sort of thing I would want to see happen, because I don't think it serves our negotiating interests. 
   I do not say that personally in terms of anybody who offered this. The Senator from Texas indicated that she introduced this discussion in the Appropriations Committee, of which I am a member. She is correct about that. But this most recent amendment was laid down, I believe, Friday, and a cloture motion filed on Friday; and that is what I am concerned about.

   Mr. DORGAN. I would just point out, sending American men and women into harm's way is something I think no President wants to do. We've had ill-fated incursions and actions taken by Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents alike. The perfection of foreign policy is not the province of any one party. 
   I was sitting here--the Senator from Texas was talking about President Reagan--and I was recalling that I was in Congress when Americans in Beirut were killed by a truck bomb. There have been a lot of circumstances where we had to learn exactly how and when we involve ourselves. It is a lesson that is very hard to learn. 
   The folks who feel very strongly about American and NATO involvement in Kosovo will make the case that if the situation is not contained there, it will spread very quickly and we will have a very substantial, broader problem on our hands in Europe. My colleague from Delaware is waiting to speak. He knows a lot more about these issues and has been involved with them much longer than the combined service of myself and the Senator from Texas. 
   But I think all of us are probably nervous about these issues. We do not know exactly what the right approach might be. I only rose today to say that I am concerned about the timing of this debate. Just this afternoon sensitive negotiations are occurring in Belgrade with Mr. Milosevic. I hope Mr. Milosevic will hear at least one voice coming from this Congress, perhaps many voices, saying that the slaughter in that region of the world must stop--one way or the other. 
   With that point, let me yield the floor. I know my colleague, Senator BIDEN, is waiting to speak.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, thank you. 
   Mr. President we are now returning to the National Missile Defense Act of 1999, which is a very important policy issue before the Senate. My expectation is we will complete work today. I had noticed two amendments; and I shall not offer the amendments today, to the relief of those who are counting the amendments that are ahead of us. 
   But I did want to take the floor to at least describe especially the substitute amendment, because while I will not offer it to this bill, this is really a debate about policy. This policy will not mean anything until it is funded. 
   The real debate will be on the appropriations, it seems to me. What is it we want to buy and pay for? We can talk until we are blue in the face, but if we are not willing in an appropriations process to pay for a policy, it is not going to be deployed. 
   Let me talk a bit about that. My substitute amendment will be something that I will likely offer during an appropriations debate and will wait until that day for a vote. 
   The proposition before the Senate offered by my colleague, Senator COCHRAN, is very simple. Yesterday, I was holding something from Senator LOTT and when I was referring to Senator COCHRAN I called him Senator LOTT, for which I apologized. I certainly know the difference, and I respect both of them immensely. Senator COCHRAN has offered a proposal on the floor of the Senate that says it shall be the policy of this country to deploy a national missile defense system as soon as technologically feasible. In other words, notwithstanding other issues, as soon as it is technologically feasible to put a national missile defense system in place, we should do so. 
   What is this national missile defense system? We had one once, 24 years ago, in my home State. This country built the only antiballistic missile system that was ever built in the free world. Members ought to see the concrete that was poured, this huge concrete building in northeastern North Dakota, a sparsely populated region of our State, where the ABM, antiballistic missile, system was built. In today's dollars it costs about $20 billion. It was declared operational 1 day and mothballed the very next day. It produced a lot of good jobs in northeastern North Dakota as a result, a lot of construction, a lot of building. 
   But what did we get for our money? And was a national ballistic missile defense system feasible 24 years ago? The answer, I suppose, is yes. We had a national ballistic missile site built and declared operational 24 years ago, so it was feasible. It used a different technology. The proposition was if we were attacked by some incoming missile from some hostile power, we would send up these antiballistic missiles with nuclear warheads on our missiles and we would shoot off a nuclear warhead somewhere in the heavens and we would destroy all the incoming missiles. That was the technology then, and we built it--paid a lot of money for it--and it was declared mothballed the day after it was operational. 
   Now the proposition is that the national missile defense is a different kind of technology. It has the ability to hit a bullet, a speeding bullet, with another bullet. That is the proposition. We have had a lot of tests--a few successful, most unsuccessful. It is a very difficult proposition. 
   The experts in the Department of Defense tell us that they have spent as much money as they can spend to pursue the technology to build a national missile defense system, but the technology does not yet exist. Now, when the technology does exist, what kind of consideration should exist in terms of its deployment? 
   Russia has a lot of weaponry; Russia, of course, is the dominant country in what was the old Soviet Union. Their weaponry consists of a great many nuclear warheads on top of intercontinental ballistic missiles and bombers. We need to be concerned about those. As a result of that, we have engaged with the old Soviet Union and now Russia in a regime of arms reductions. Arms control talks resulted in START I and START II. The Russians, we hope, are prepared very soon to adopt START II. We have already done so. 
   As a result of all of that, yesterday I held up part of the wing of a Russian bomber. Last year, I held up a metal flange from the door of, I believe, an SS-19, an intercontinental ballistic missile that held a nuclear warhead, a missile aimed at the United States. Yesterday, I held up at this desk a wing strut from a Russian bomber; one would have expected in the cold war that the only way you would hold a piece of a Russian bomber in your hand is if somebody shot it down in hostile action. That wasn't the case. I held up  a piece of a wing from a bomber from Russia that used to 
   carry nuclear weapons that would threaten our country because the wing was sawed off that bomber. 
   Who sawed the wing off of the bomber? Was a wing shot off in hostile aerial combat? No, not at all. It was sawed off as the bomber was on the ground, because part of the agreement between us and the Soviet Union is that they would reduce the number of missiles, reduce the number of warheads, reduce the number of bombers, and so would we. The result is these arms reductions have resulted in significant reductions in the number of nuclear warheads, the number of missiles, the number of bombers, the number of delivery systems. That is a success. 
   I also talked last fall about the Russian launch of a number of intercontinental ballistic missiles early in the morning, and as those Russian missiles lifted off in the early morning and pierced into the sky, one could have wondered what on Earth was happening in our world--a launch of significant numbers of ICBMs by the Russians. But it didn't worry the United States because those missiles were launched and destroyed in the area by prior agreement--part of arms control, something we agreed upon--that they destroy their missiles. 
   Isn't it much better to destroy their missiles by taking them apart, pinching the metal and putting them in a warehouse, or sawing the wings off their bombers? Isn't it better to destroy a weapon before it is used? That is precisely what arms control is all about. 
   The question I ask about this country's national missile defense policy is not whether we should have one--we likely will have a national missile defense system at some point, some day, when it is technologically feasible, when it is financially practical, when it will not injure our arms control agreements and not threaten future agreements. We will likely have some kind of national missile defense system. We will likely have it because many are worried that a rogue nation now--not Russia, but a rogue nation; Saddam Hussein or North Korea testing medium-range missiles--a rogue nation gets ahold of an ICBM and puts a nuclear weapon on top of an ICBM and aims it at this country and fires it. What kind of a catcher's mitt do we have to intercept it and prevent it from hitting our country? We do not have some sort of technological catcher's mitt that goes into the heavens and intercepts that missile. Therefore, we need to have it, we are told. We didn't have that kind of a catcher's mitt to intercept missiles all during the cold war. 
   How did we avoid having a missile fired at us by the Soviet Union? By an arsenal in the cold war that assured anyone who attacked us with nuclear weapons would be vaporized and destroyed immediately. That convinced virtually anyone who would have thought about launching a nuclear attack against this country, that convinced them it was very unwise to do so. No one would launch a nuclear attack against this country. 
   Some might say that might still be the case. But suppose a madman in charge of some rogue nation who gets one ICBM; ought we not have the capability of intercepting that? The answer is yes. That is one of the threats. 
   If you take a look at the kind of threats, one of the threats is that a rogue nation will get ahold of an ICBM--it is not likely but it could happen. They are more likely to get ahold of a cruise missile, which is much more prevalent--of course, the national missile defense system will not intercept a cruise missile--that could be launched off the coast about 20 or 50 miles, fly a few hundred feet above the ground. That is not what this is designed to protect against. 
   Another area of threat is a suitcase nuclear bomb stuck in the trunk of an old rusty car at a New York City dock to terrorize this country. It doesn't do much about that. Another threat of mass destruction is a vial of the deadliest biological threats put on a subway in a major city. 
   We have a variety of threats, not the least of which is that a foreign ruler, of a bizarre nation will get ahold of an intercontinental ballistic missile, but if that happens will we have a mechanism to intercept it? The answer is yes, I believe, we will. But we must do what we are doing now with substantial research and development into developing a technology that works, and then deploying it in a sensible way that says we are deploying a technology that works in a manner that is cost effective--not a blank check, not a break-the-bank approach--a technology that will work to offer real protection in a way that offers it at an affordable price and doing so in a way that will not jeopardize our arms control agreements that now reduce nuclear weapons.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the Senator from Arkansas. I think there are far more questions than answers on the issues he raised. I think the issues of national security dealing with China are serious. The alleged spying, as I understand it, occurred in the mid-1980s; the transfer of missile technology and agreements for that transfer occurred at the beginning of the 1980s. The Senator raises very important security questions and we need answers to those questions. I am sure in the coming days we will learn more about many of these issues as we discuss them with the appropriate people who have been a part of this matter for, now, a decade or a decade and a half. 
   But I came to the floor and have waited here to speak about the national missile defense proposal. That is what is on the floor at the moment, national missile defense. Mr. President, 24 years ago our country built an antiballistic missile system in my home State. It is the only ABM, or antiballistic missile, system anywhere in the free world. That ABM--or what we would now call national missile defense--system, that ABM program, cost over $20 billion in today's dollars. 
   On October 1, 1975, the antiballistic missile system was declared operational. On October 2, 1 day later, Congress voted to mothball it. We spent a great deal of money. I encourage those who are interested in seeing what that money purchased to get on an airplane and fly over that sparsely populated northeastern portion of North Dakota. You will see a concrete monument to the ABM system. It was abandoned a day after it was declared operational. 
   Did that system make us safer? Did taking the taxpayers' dollars and building that ABM system improve national security in this country? The judgment was it was not worth the money after all. Yet here we are, nearly a quarter of a century later, debating a bill that would require the deployment of a national missile defense system, another ballistic missile defense system, as soon as technologically feasible. 
   It was technologically feasible 24 years ago. It was a different technology. The technology then was, if you see a Russian missile--or a Soviet missile then--coming in to attack this country, you send up some antiballistic missile defenses, and they have nuclear warheads, and you blow off a nuclear warhead somewhere up there in the heavens and it obliterates the incoming missiles. That was the technology then. It was technologically possible then. 
   Now the new technology is, we are not going to send a nuclear missile up to wipe out some incoming nuclear missile--or a missile with a nuclear warhead, I should say. What we will do is, we will hit a speeding bullet with another speeding bullet. If someone puts a missile up with a nuclear warhead, we send a missile up with our charge and we hit it--a bullet hitting a bullet. Of course, all the tests now demonstrate that is very hard to do. There have been far more test failures than successes in this technology. But here we are saying, let us deploy a National Missile Defense System as soon as technologically feasible. 
   It is technologically feasible for my 11-year-old son to drive my car. I wouldn't suggest that someone who meets him on the road would consider it very safe or appropriate for Brendon to be driving my automobile, but it is technologically feasible. 
   So what does that mean, technologically feasible? What does it mean with respect to missile defense? Will it make us safer? Here is what we do know. A national missile defense system cannot protect us from a low-flying cruise missile launched by a Third World despot who can much more easily access a cruise missile than an intercontinental ballistic missile and put it on a barge somewhere off a coast and lob in a nuclear-tipped cruise missile. Will we, when we deploy this system, defend against that? No, not at all. That is not what this system is for. It is to defend against an ICBM. And not just any ICBM--not a Russian ICBM, for example, because any kind of robust launch of more than a handful of missiles cannot be defended with this new technology, the kind of technological catcher's mitt that we send up to catch an incoming missile. 
   It is only a missile from a rogue nation. If a rogue nation acquires an intercontinental ballistic missile--unlikely perhaps, but let's assume a rogue nation acquires an intercontinental ballistic missile and uses that  with a nuclear warhead attached to its top to threaten this country. What are the likely threats? Among the threats, the least likely would be a rogue nation using an intercontinental ballistic missile. More likely would be their access to a cruise missile, to purchase a cruise missile someplace. Of course this system will not defend against that. More likely than that is, perhaps, a rental truck filled with a nuclear explosive or perhaps a suitcase nuclear bomb planted in the trunk of an old Yugo car parked at a New York dock--a far more likely threat by a rogue nation than access to an intercontinental ballistic missile. Will this protect us against those threats? No. 
   National missile defense shields us against one threat only--the accidental launch of a ballistic missile from an existing nuclear power or the future possibility of an attack by a rogue nation. But it is not just any accidental launch. It would be an accidental launch of just one or two or a few missiles, because any launch beyond that, of course, would be a launch that would prevail over a limited national missile defense system. 
   If we deploy a national missile defense system before it is ready--not just technologically possible, but tested and ready --then what are we getting for our money? What does the taxpayer get for the requirement to deploy a new weapons program, albeit defensive, before it is ready to be deployed? Detecting, tracking, discriminating, and hitting a trashcan-sized target traveling 20 times the speed of sound, landing in 20 or 30 minutes anywhere in the world after it is launched--intercepting that with another bullet that we send up into the skies? To put it mildly, that is problematic. Our efforts to date, under highly controlled test environments, come nowhere close to meeting the requirements a ballistic missile system would need to satisfy and justify deployment. 
   If we deploy without regard to all of the other issues and all of the other considerations, all of the efforts we have made to reduce weapons of mass destruction that pose such a danger to the world, will we make this a safer world? Or a world that is more dangerous? If we deploy this system before we have renegotiated with Russia the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, we are sure to jeopardize the enormous gains we have already made in arms reduction efforts. 
   I would like to show a picture just for a moment. I also ask unanimous consent to show a piece of an airplane on the floor of the Senate.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a piece of a backfire bomber. I suppose that some years ago, you would have thought the only way a Member of the U.S. Senate could hold a piece of a Soviet bomber or a Russian bomber in his hands would be if it were shot down somewhere in hostile action. 
   This is a wing strut from a bomber that used to carry nuclear weapons that threatened this country. This bomber, as you can see, no longer flies. This wing strut is a result of a cut from the wing of that bomber that rendered that bomber useless. How did that happen? How does it happen that we are able to cut the wings off Russian bombers, and we are able to destroy Russian missile silos? 
   Last year I held in my hand on the floor a metal flange from a missile silo in the Ukraine that used to sit on the prairies there in the Ukraine with a nuclear warhead aimed at the United States of America, and that piece of metal now doesn't come from a missile silo. I held it in my hand. The missile silo is gone. The missile is gone. The warhead is gone. Where a missile once sat aimed at the United States, there now is planted a field of sunflowers, sunflowers rather than missiles. 
   How did it happen that in the Ukraine an intercontinental ballistic missile site was dug up, the missile gone, the warhead gone, and there are now sunflowers? How does it happen that a Soviet bomber has its wings sawed off? I tell you how it happens --Nunn-Lugar. Senators DICK LUGAR and Sam Nunn offered a program here in the U.S. Senate trailing the arms control agreements we have had with the old Soviet Union and now Russia. It says the United States will help pay for the destruction of your weapons. 
   Doesn't it make good sense for us to destroy Russian bombers, not with our bullets but with saws? Doesn't it make good sense for us to destroy Russian missiles in their silo through the use of American taxpayer funds, not with people who have to go in the field and fight and risk their lives, but through a treaty of arms control in which we help pay the cost of the destruction of nuclear weapons and delivery systems controlled by Russia and the old Soviet Union? 
   Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia, the Ukraine and others have destroyed over 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles, 400. 
   In the last several weeks, I saw a nuclear weapon. I was in a weapons storage facility on a tour, and I won't describe it in great detail, probably because I couldn't. A nuclear weapon is not very big. A nuclear bomb is not large at all. You can have a nuclear bomb dozens of times the power of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. It is no bigger than that desk. 
   The Soviet Union, Russia and the Ukraine, now named, have destroyed over 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles with MIRV warheads, over 400 of them gone. Our arms control agreement has rendered them gone. They are gone. We helped pay for it. We cut the wings off the planes. We pulled the missiles out of the ground. We saw those missiles destroyed. We have cut the wings off 37 Soviet bombers. Eighty submarine missile launch tubes are now gone; 95 nuclear warhead test tunnels are now sealed. That is major progress. If the Russians ratify START II, which I think they are likely to do, we will see further dramatic reductions in the number of bombers and missiles and warheads on both sides. 
   That will happen not because we are fighting but because we 
   are cooperating, not because there are tensions but because there is an arms control regime we are following and because we are helping them destroy their weapons at the same time we are reducing our weapons. We want to deactivate over 5,000 warheads, destroy 200 missile silos, 40,000 chemical weapons. Look at the success. Eliminate 500 metric tons of highly enriched uranium. Would we or should we do anything to jeopardize this progress? What might jeopardize it? 
   We have a treaty with the Russians, and the treaty is an ABM Treaty. The proposal by some is to say ignore the treaty; it doesn't matter. These treaties are not very important. These treaties START I, START II, ABM, hopefully a START III, these treaties allow us to make this progress and reduce the nuclear threat and reduce the threat of nuclear war. 
   Thirty-two thousand nuclear weapons remain in the United States and Russian arsenals today. Some of those are theater weapons; thousands and thousands of nuclear weapons, of course. That is half the number of a decade ago, but does that give us great confidence? No. We need to reduce them much, much further. 
   How can we do that? I know how we won't do that. All of that progress in the reduction of nuclear weapons could come to an abrupt halt if we deploy a national missile defense system without any regard to the concerns raised about whether this legislation would violate the ABM Treaty that we have made with the Russians in order to slow the nuclear arms race. Instead of working cooperatively with other nuclear powers, if we act unilaterally we surely risk a return to a costly and dangerous arms race with Russia and China as well. 
   A former colleague, Dale Bumpers, said something interesting about this. He said:  
   We can ignore Russia's concerns now, but in the years to come, she will slowly recover and resume a great power role in the world. By rash actions such as abrogation of the ABM Treaty, we are far more likely to rekindle the cold war with a hostile nation than to produce a constructive relationship with a cooperative Russia.  
   Senator Bumpers, then, was wisely cautioning us that the calculations that go into our strategic defense decisions today will have enormous consequences and costly consequences for the world that we pass on to our children. Each day we move closer to eliminating the nuclear threat left over from the cold war, thanks to arms reductions mandated in START I and START II and thanks to the Nunn-Lugar threat reduction that has been so successful.  
   As I indicated, that investment has been a critically important investment in reducing the nuclear threat. I show my colleagues a chart that talks about the imbalance between money that some propose we spend on a national missile defense program versus money we spend on arms reduction. This chart shows what we are prepared to spend on a national missile defense system, a limited one, one that won't protect us against much of the threat, but compare it even at that to what is planned to be spent on arms reduction. I hope this is not a picture of our priorities. I wish it were reversed. 
   This legislation that we are considering says just do it, in the popular jargon of today. Deploy the system as soon as the military can get it up there. Cost doesn't matter. Arms control doesn't matter. Nothing much matters. Deploy it as soon as is possible. We are nervous. 
   Mr. President, let me say that I support the strongest possible defense against any threat to our country, but if you rationally think through the range of threats to our country, you must start with the understanding that the largest possible threat to our country comes from thousands of nuclear warheads that now exist, thousands of nuclear warheads already in stockpiles with delivery vehicles, bombers and ICBMs and others. We must continue the work of reducing them, and we have done that very successfully. Anything we do here to jeopardize that would be a profound mistake. 
   In addition to that, what are the other threats? A rogue nation getting an ICBM? Yes, that is a small threat way over here on the edge. How about a rogue nation getting a rental truck, as I said, with a nuclear device planted in the back somewhere? Probably more likely. Or a deadly vile of the most deadly biological agent? More likely. A suitcase nuclear bomb? More likely. 
   Should we worry about all of these? Should we prepare for all of these? Of course. We would be foolhardy as a nation to underestimate the threat of terrorism and underestimate the intentions of rogue nations. We would be fools to do that. But it would be shortsighted for us to decide, because we are concerned about all of that, we are willing to push all of our chips to the middle of the table and say we will risk the very substantial achievements we have made in arms control reductions. 
   The elimination of Russian bombers by cutting off their wings, the destruction of Russian missiles, the dismantling of Russian warheads, making Ukraine nuclear free--did anyone think they would hear that? We risk all of that if we move in a manner in the Senate that says, ``You don't matter; all that matters is our short-term nervousness about one small slice of one of the threats that exist.'' That is not a balanced approach. 
   Mr. President, I conclude by saying I think one of the more talented Senators in this country is the Senator from Mississippi, Senator COCHRAN. I enjoy working with him. I think he is bright and productive, and he is one of the people that makes me proud to be a Senator. The same is true of my colleague from Michigan, Senator LEVIN. The fact is, they have 
   pretty big disagreements about some of these issues, but this is a very big issue. 
   This idea about how this country responds to nuclear threats and what kind of nuclear threat should persuade us to respond in certain ways will have profound implications for all of us and for our children and our grandchildren. 
   I have a young son age 11 and a daughter age 9 who are in school today, at least I hope they are in school today. They are the most wonderful children any father would ever hope to have. I hope when my service is done in the U.S. Senate, whatever I might contribute to public policy, that they might say I helped in a way to reduce the nuclear threat, I helped in a significant way to have this world move away from the kind of nuclear threat that has existed now for many, many decades. 
   It is hard for people to believe because it does not get much press and it is not very sexy, but every day we are spending American taxpayer dollars to destroy missiles that used to be aimed at American cities. What a remarkable thing to have happen. What a remarkable success. 
   I think it was Mark Twain who said once that bad news travels halfway around the world before good news gets its shoes on. That certainly has to be true with respect to this nuclear issue, the nuclear threat. How much attention does this get, the day-to-day success we have in reducing nuclear warheads and delivery vehicles? Let us not jeopardize that. Let us move forward together in a thoughtful way, understanding, yes, we should prepare for some kind of missile defense. Let's do it thoughtfully, let's do it when it is technologically possible, but let's make sure we do it when it is cost effective, technologically possible, will not interrupt and will not pose danger to our arms control agreements. Let us condition it on all of those issues together and, as a country, then do the right thing. 
   Again, I thank the Senator from Michigan, Senator LEVIN, for allowing me to have some time in this debate. I hope in the coming hours we will be able to address this just a bit further. 
   Let me conclude--I know the Senator from Tennessee is waiting--let me conclude with one final statement. The majority leader said this morning that we should be clear in our intentions toward the ABM Treaty. I do not know what that means. I encourage him to tell me what that means. I agree with it, we should be clear, and I hope we are clear with respect to our intentions about the ABM Treaty to say that treaty matters, that treaty means something, and to the extent we seek changes in that treaty, we will, with the Russians, negotiate those changes, but we will not take an attitude that this treaty does not matter to this country. Let us hope that is what the majority leader meant when he said, let's be clear about our intentions toward the ABM Treaty. I yield the floor. 
   Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am happy to join my colleague, Senator CONRAD, on the introduction of the Dakota Water Resources Act of 1999. We have previously introduced similar legislation. 
   We worked on this legislation with the Governor of North Dakota, as well as the bi-partisan leadership in the State legislature in North Dakota, Tribal leaders, and many others. Republicans and Democrats together developed a piece of legislation that we think is not only good for our State and important for the State's long-term future, but which also completes the promise that was given our State many, many years ago. 
   I will not talk about the specific provisions of the bill in a way that will duplicate information which has already been provided, but let me again describe the story, just for a moment. People say, Water projects--this is some kind of proposal to enrich your region of the country. Well, there is more to the story. 
   In the 1940s, we had a wild Missouri River that would periodically flood in a very significant way, and in the downstream reaches of the river, Kansas City, MO, and elsewhere, areas would have massive spring flooding. The Federal Government said, Let's put some main stem dams on the Missouri River in order to control that flooding. As we put these dams on that river, we will also be able to generate electricity from those dams, so we will prevent flooding and provide electrical benefits. It will be a wonderful opportunity. 
   North Dakota, your deal in this is to accept a flood that comes and stays every year. You take a half-million-acre flood that comes to your State and stays there forever. If you are willing to play host to a flood forever, we will make you a deal. We know it is not in your interest to say, please, bring us a permanent flood, so if you do that, we will make you a deal. Accept a flood--the size of the State of Rhode Island, by the way--and when that flood comes, you can take the water from behind the reservoir and move it around your State for water development and quality purposes. 
   That was the original Garrison proposal. Now, that promise, that commitment has not been kept. The flood came; that part of the bargain has been kept. But we have not received the full flower of benefits that we would expect as a result of the Federal commitment. For that reason, we continue to insist that if your word is your bond and the Federal Government said take this flood and we will provide these benefits for your State, and we need these benefits for our State to be able to move good quality water around our State, for that reason we feel compelled to say to the Federal Government, finish the job. 
   That is what this legislation is about. It is not, as some environmental organizations insist, some new billion-dollar project. It is not that at all. In fact, what we are doing will, in a minor way, reduce the authorized project that already exists as a result of the 1965 authorization and the 1986 authorization. This bill makes the final adjustments to this project. 
   I have a series of charts which I will not go through, recognizing that the folks who are in charge of the timing of this institution want to go to lunch. Let me come back at a more appropriate time and go through all of my charts in great detail for the benefit of everyone. 
   I will only say in closing that my colleague and I feel that this is a very important project and a bipartisan piece of legislation that will be good for this country, allow our country to keep its promise and will especially be a good investment for North Dakota. My prepared remarks on the Dakota Water Resources Act will explain these points in greater detail. 
   Mr. President, the new bill has been substantially modified in the form of a substitute amendment (No. 3112) which we introduced on July 9, 1998. This revised bill represents a bi-partisan consensus carefully negotiated by the major elected officials in our State. 
   It's a water development bill that I am proud to sponsor. It reduces Federal costs, meets environmental and international obligations, and fulfills the Federal promise to address North Dakota's contemporary water needs. 
   This is still among the most important pieces of legislation I will introduce for my State. I emphasize once more that this is because the key to North Dakota's economic development is water resource management and development. And the key to water development in my State has come to be the Garrison Diversion Project in the Dakota Water Resources Act of 1999. 
   I want to share with my colleagues in greater detail the frustrating story of an unfulfilled promise to build a water project because some have questioned the rationale for the project. I want to explain why the people of North Dakota need and expect to have this promise fulfilled in the form of the Dakota Water Resources Act. 
   Over 100 years ago, John Wesley Powell of the U.S. Geological Survey predicted to the North Dakota Constitutional Convention that the lean years in agriculture would cause ``thousands of people ..... (to) become discouraged and leave.'' He was referring to the difficulty of making a living on farms and ranches in a state with abundant water but limited rainfall.  
   Unfortunately, Powell's prediction is as telling today as it was in the last century. Thousands of North Dakotans are leaving the State for economic opportunities in cities such as Denver and Minneapolis. Due to this substantial out-migration only 7 North Dakota counties, or less than one in seven, had population increases in the past decade. What perhaps worries me even more is the fact that our farm youth population has declined by 50% in both of the last two decades. In other words, out-migration is pummeling our State's well-being and threatening our economic future. 
   I would say to my colleagues that the root of the North Dakota's problem is two-fold. One, we need to diversify our agricultural base so that family farmers can make a more dependable living. This requires access to water for the growth and processing of specialty crops to replace or augment the usual grains that North Dakota farmers have grown for decades. Second, we must provide reliable supplies of clean, affordable water needed for economic growth in towns and cities across North Dakota. Too many of them now lack dependable water supplies for municipal and industrial growth. 
   What we need, then, is water development. And we thought we would get it! 
   Over fifty years ago, the Federal Government began building a series of main stem dams on the Missouri River to provide flood protection, dependable river navigation and inexpensive hydropower--primarily for the benefit of states in the Lower Missouri Basin. The problem became acute when flooding during World War II disrupted the transport of war supplies and spawned disaster relief needs in a budget already over-stretched. 
   When North Dakota allowed the Garrison Dam and Reservoir to be built in the State (and the consequences of the Oahe Reservoir in South Dakota are added in), it agreed to host permanent floods that inundated 500,000 acres of prime farm land and the Indian communities on two reservations. The State and Tribes did so in exchange for a promise that the Federal Government would replace the loss of these economic and social assets with a major water development project, the Garrison Diversion Unit. 
   But 50 years later, the project is less than half done. 
   I would like to explain for the benefit of my colleagues just how this bill relates to the Federal commitment to my State, what progress has been made on that commitment, what remains to be done, and how this bill will complete the project in a prudent way. 
   May I remind my colleagues that the State lost a half million acres of prime farm land, a major component of its overall economic base. To grasp the size of this negative impact, I ask my colleagues to think of flooding a chunk of farm land the size of Rhode Island. As a result, North Dakota has lost hundreds of millions of dollars in farm income. Think, too, of Indian Tribes that lost their traditional homelands, their economic and social base, hospitals and roads, and a healthy lifestyle. Their lives were disrupted and their culture was turned upside down. 
   We were promised, in exchange, a major water and irrigation project. It was designed to help meet the agricultural needs of a semi-arid state that gets only 15-17 inches of rainfall per year. We originally expected the resources to irrigate over a million acres of land, most of it in areas less productive than the land lost to the Garrison Reservoir. The Federal Government eventually started a scaled-down version of the project, with 250,000 acres of irrigation. In response to criticisms that the project was too costly and too environmentally disruptive, a federal commission proposed a major revision in 1984 and made recommendations on how to meet the State's contemporary water needs. 
   But make no mistake, the promise remained. The Garrison Diversion Unit Commission stated:  
   1. The State of North Dakota deserves a federally-funded water project, at least some of which should be in the form of irrigation development, for land lost through inundation by reservoirs of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program. 
   2. The Commission agrees with Congress that a moral commitment was made in 1944 to the Upper Basin States and Indian Tribes with the passage of the Flood Control Act of 1944. The language of the statute establishing this commission reinforces this view. The State of North Dakota sacrificed hundreds of thousands of acres, much of it prime river bottomland, for the greater benefit of the nation. In return, the Federal Government promised assistance in replacement of the economic base of the State and Indian Tribes. There is evidence this has not taken place.  
   In 1986, I renegotiated the project with the Reagan Administration, the House Interior Committee, and national environmental groups and these talks resulted in the Garrison Diversion Reformulation Act of 1986. The law implemented the Garrison Commission findings and recommendations and included a 130,000 acre irrigation project for the State and tribes, the promise of Missouri River water to augment water supplies in the Red River Valley, an installment on municipal, industrial, and rural (MR&I) water for communities across the State, the initial water systems for the Standing Rock, Fort Berthold, and Ft. Totten Indian reservations and a range of activities to mitigate and enhance wildlife and habitat. 
   So you may ask, ``What progress has been made on the project?'' 
   Although the promise of irrigation remains largely unfulfilled--with the exception of the Oakes Test Area--we have made substantial progress in laying the groundwork for water delivery and the provision of a partial network for MR&I supplies across the state. 
   Over one-third of North Dakotans now benefit from 25 MRI programs on four Indian reservations and in some 80 communities. 
   The Southwest Pipeline constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation has begun to solve water problems in the region where I grew up. For example, in my hometown of Regent the ranching family of Michelle McCormack used to struggle with coffee-colored water that stained their fixtures and clogged their distiller with sludge. Their well barely provided enough water for a family of six, let alone a herd of cattle. Because of the Garrison Project, the McCormacks can now enjoy ample supplies of quality, clean water--something most of us take for granted. And they can make a better living to boot. 
   We have also taken great strides to mitigate wildlife areas impacted by the development of the McClusky and New Rockford Canals. We now have mitigated over 200% of the required lands, developed a Wetlands Trust Fund and programs, and begun to manage the former Lonetree Dam and Reservoir as a state wildlife conservation area. Incidentally, our new legislation would complete the process by de-authorizing the Lonetree features and converting them into a wildlife conservation area. 
   For a variety of reasons, though, we have not fully realized the promise of the 1986 Act. Despite some strides, we have yet to develop a major irrigation unit under the Garrison Diversion project. We have only been able to develop a pilot research plot near Oakes, which has validated the use of irrigation for growing high value crops in North 
   Dakota. Under terms of the 1986 Act, we would have 130,000 acres of irrigation, which will be scaled back to 70,000 acres in the bill we introduce today. This will reduce project costs and target limited funds in the bill on high priority irrigation and MR&I water development. 
   We have completed Phase 1 of Municipal, Rural and Industrial development for three Indian tribes. There remains well over $200 million in needs to complete projects on all four reservations which will meet the charge of the Garrison Reformulation Act for the Secretary of the Interior ``to meet the economic, public health, and environmental needs'' of North Dakota tribes. From hearings I have held on the reservations, I can tell you that tribal members have some the worst water problems in the nation and we must fulfill the 1986 mandate. Our new legislation will provide $200 million to meet the critical water needs of North Dakota's four Indian nations. 
   We have developed major elements of a water delivery system for the Red River Valley. But the Bureau of Reclamation is currently reviewing that issue with the State of North Dakota to determine the best way to meet the needs of Fargo, Grand Forks, and other communities throughout the Red River Valley. 
   Let me illustrate the severity of the problem for the valley by noting that in many years in this century, the Red River either has slowed to a trickle or  stopped running altogether. Imagine a major city that depends on a river for its municipal and industrial water supply and that river stops running. That is why our bill provides $200 million to meet the critical water needs the most populous part of our state. But let me add that this money will be fully repaid by water users. 
   Finally, we have dozens of communities awaiting the promise of reliable supplies of clean and usable water. In several hearings I have held up bottles of coffee-like water from the McCormack ranch and several others, which have not yet been served by such projects as the Southwest Pipeline or the Northwest Area Water System. 
   Patsy Storhoff's family, for one, has to haul and store water for their household use. At times, they make 1,400 gallons last up to three weeks--what most families tap in just five days. She sometimes tells her kids they have to postpone a bath in order to conserve scarce water because the neighbor who hauls their water won't get to Nome for a couple more days. Although when you pause to think about it, taking a bath in coffee-like water is a liquid oxymoron. 
   In part because the State would forego 60,000 acres of irrigation in this bill and because we have realized only half of the Garrison Commission's promise of MR&I water for nearly 400,000 North Dakotans, we do provide $300 million for MR&I development across the state. That amount, plus the existing $200 million in authority for MR&I, will roughly match the amount promised by the Commission and the 1986 Act. 
   So the Dakota Water Resources Act provides $700 million in new authority for water development, of which $200 million is fully repayable. In order to complete this project, however, North Dakota has had to make some major changes. In November of 1997, the delegation introduced the Dakota Water Resources Act as a bill that reflected a consensus of the bi-partisan elected leadership of the state, major cities, four tribal governments, water users, conservation groups, the State Water Coalition, and the Garrison Conservancy District. 
   In a word, the bill scaled back irrigation from 130,000 to 70,000 acres, provided new resources to complete the major MR&I delivery systems for the four Indian tribes and the state's water supply network, and provided a process for choosing the best way to address Red River Valley water needs. It also made wildlife conservation a project purpose, expanded the Wetlands Trust into a more robust Natural Resources Trust, funded a critical bridge on the Ft. Berthold Reservation and a few priority recreation projects. 
   Subsequently, the Bureau of Reclamation raised several questions and concerns about the bill which we have addressed in a series of negotiations and discussions over the past months. The revisions mainly address reducing costs, meeting tough environmental standards, strengthening compliance with an international border agreement, and reaffirming the role of the Secretary of the Interior in decision-making. The bi-partisan elected leaders embraced those changes and have agreed to re-introduce the Dakota Water Resources Act with the same language as the substitute amendment (No. 3112) which I offered with Senator CONRAD last year. 
   Mr. President, permit me to outline the specific provisions in the new version of the bill: 
   1. Retain the cost share of 25% for MR&I projects, along with a credit for cost share contributions exceeding that amount. This, in place of a 15% cost share. 
   2. Reimburse the federal government for the share of the capacity of the main stem delivery features which are used by the state. This, instead of writing off these features. 
   3. Index MR&I and Red River features only from the date of enactment, not since 1986. 
   4. Expressly bar any irrigation in the Hudson's Bay Basin. 
   5. Give the Secretary of the Interior the authority to select the Red River Valley Water Supply feature and to determine the feasibility of any newly authorized irrigation areas in the scaled-back package. 
   6. Extend the Environmental Impact Studies period and firm up Boundary Waters Treaty measures. 
   Taken together with prior provisions, these changes achieve four purposes. First, they reduce costs by limiting indexing; by defining specific State responsibility for repayment of existing features instead of blanket debt forgiveness; by de-authorizing such major irrigation features as the Lonetree Dam and Reservoir, James River Feeder Canal and Sykeston Canal; and by retaining current law with respect to MR&I cost-sharing and repayment for Red River supply features. 
   Second, the changes affirm the decision making authority of the Secretary of the Interior on key issues. The Secretary consults with the State of North Dakota on the plan to meet the water needs of the Red River Valley but he makes the final selection of the plan that works best. The Secretary also negotiates cooperative agreements with the State on other aspects of the project. These arrangements protect the Federal interest while assuring that North Dakota is a partner in a project so closely linked to its destiny. 
   Third, the bill forthrightly addresses concerns of Canada. The U.S. and Canada have a mutual responsibility to abide by the Boundary Waters Treaty and other environmental conventions. The Dakota Water Resources Act states in the purpose that the United States must comply strictly with the Treaty. It further bars any irrigation in the Hudson's Bay drainage with water diverted from the Missouri River, thus limiting biota transfer between basins. Again, the Secretary of Interior chooses the Red River Valley water supply plan, but if that choice entails diversion of Missouri River water, then it must be fully treated with state-of-the-art purification and screening to prevent biota transfer. And as noted before, the bill de-authorizes the Lonetree features to which Canada previously had objected. 
   Fourth, the revised bill strengthens environmental protection and does so by incorporating the specific recommendations of North Dakota wildlife and conservation groups. It lengthens the periods for completing Environmental Impact Statements. It also protects the Sheyenne Lake National Wildlife Refuge. Moreover, it preserves the role of the Secretary of the Interior on compliance matters and drops the provision that called for a study of bank stabilization on the Missouri River. 
   In other words, these measures improve even more the proposals in the 1985 Garrison Commission Report on how to meet North Dakota's contemporary water needs. This sounds reasonable, but how does it stack up against the fiscal and environmental challenges of 1999? 
   Irrespective of the Federal commitment to North Dakota, the State has not even received a proportional share of Bureau of Reclamation funds. Although my state includes six percent of the population in western states, it has received only two percent of Bureau funding. 
   Next, most Bureau projects were awarded to augment water development and economic growth, not to compensate states for losses suffered from the construction of flood control projects by the Corps of Engineers. So just on the equities, North Dakota has a fair claim to complete Garrison project. 
   The revised bill will also save the American taxpayer $500 million--when compared to the cost of completing the current project. Moreover, of the $770 million in new authority in the revised bill, North Dakota will repay $345 million--almost half. There is no blanket debt retirement because North Dakota will pay for all facilities it uses. 
   Moreover, this bill is not just about costs, though reduced and restrained, but about investments. The Dakota Water Resources Act underpins North Dakota's entire effort to stop the out-migration of its young people, the dwindling of family farms, and the decimation of rural communities. It is a charter for rural renewal and economic growth that will help family farms keep the yard lights burning and small towns keep their shop signs glowing. 
   Finally, this bill is environmentally sound. It does not destroy wetlands, it preserves them. It preserves grasslands and riparian habitat, too. It was not dreamed up by a water development group. It was drafted with the input of tribal and community leaders, local and national environmental groups,  the bipartisan leadership of the state, and the Bureau of Reclamation and Office of Management and Budget. It reflects a balanced approach to water resource development that applies the principles of conservation while offering the hope of economic development. 
   Ultimately, this bill practices the policy of being a good neighbor that is the hallmark of our state. The Government of Canada approved the 1986 Garrison Act. This bill provides even more protection for Canadian interests. So while we can't appease the political agendas of certain folks in Canada, we can sure keep faith with the Boundary Waters Treaty. And we do. 
   In conclusion, the Dakota Water Resources Act of 1999 will guarantee that this project meets the tests of fiscal responsibility, environmental protection, and treaty compliance. It will do so while also addressing the critical water development needs of North Dakota and fulfilling the Federal obligation for water development for the communities and tribes of our State. Accordingly, I urge that my colleagues support the Dakota Water Resources Act of 1999.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senators ROCKEFELLER, BURNS, and ROBERTS today in introducing the ``Railroad Competition and Service improvement Act of 1999.'' This legislation is designed to stimulate railroad competition and level the field for shippers who need relief from unreasonable rates. Earlier this month, the General Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report on the barriers to rate relief that prevent small captive shippers from unreasonable rates. That report, outlined below, identified a number of remedies that would give captive shippers a fighting chance at rate relief. This legislation closely mirrors the GAO's findings and if enacted, would go a long way to improve rail service and promote competition. 
   In my home state of North Dakota over fifty percent of the state economy is dependent upon agriculture. Our ability to move its agricultural production to distant markets affects large sectors of North Dakota's economy. Over eighty percent of all the grain shipped out-of-state moves by rail and 97 percent of North Dakota's grain elevators have access to only one railroad. Those who survive on farming and those who live in states like North Dakota whose main business is agriculture have a great deal at stake when it comes to rail transportation. Overcharges cost us millions of dollars a year, adding a substantial cost to a product that already operates at very low margins. 
   Since virtually all of the shippers in North Dakota are subject to monopoly service, our farmers and county grain elevators are paying a premium for a service they cannot afford to live without. Rail service in this country is supposed to be competitive where the forces of competition determine shipping rates and in the absence of competition, the STB is suppose to have a process that will protect captive shippers from overcharges. Unfortunately, rail competition is more of an exception than the rule and the process that is designed to protect captive shippers is so costly and time-consuming that shippers are without recourse; left to the mercy of monopoly railroads who not only determine whether or not their product will get to market but  also how much they will charge to deliver that product. This is a circumstance that must be addressed as the Congress considers the reauthorization of the STB this year. 
   Prior to 1976, the ICC regulated almost all the rates that railroads charged shippers. The Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Act (1976) and the Staggers Rail Act (1980) limited the regulation of the rail industry by allowing the ICC to regulate rates only where railroads have no effective competition and established the ICC's process for resolving rate disputes. 
   At the time when the Congress began the process of railroad deregulation (1976) there were 63 class I railroads in the United States. By 1997, through mergers and other factors, the 
   number of class I railroads shrunk to nine. These nine carriers accounted for more than 90 percent of the industry's freight revenue and 71 percent of the industry's mileage operated in 1997. In July, 1998, the STB approved another Class I merger by splitting the assets of Conrail between CSX and Norfolk Southern (reducing the Class I count to 8 once implemented). Another merger between Canadian National Railway and Illinois Central is pending before the STB. 
   This consolidation has diminished competition, creating an even greater dependence upon a rate relief process through a regulatory body such as the STB. Agricultural, utility, and chemical industries in particular rely heavily upon rail transportation and the cost of unreasonable rail rates has a dramatic impact on these important industries. 
   According to GAO/RCED-99-46, ``Railroad Regulation: Current Issues Associated With the Rate Relief Process,'' February 1999, ``[t]he Surface Transportation Board's standard procedures for obtaining rate relief are highly complex and time-consuming'' and the GAO estimates that over ``70 percent [of shippers] believe that the time, complexity, and costs of filing complaints are barriers that often preclude them from seeking relief.'' The report documents that the process for a small captive shipper to obtain rate relief under the current regulatory and legal framework is broken and unworkable. The reasons for these barriers are multiple:

   Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Chair. 
   The second half of this amendment would allow for the opportunity to have a standardized report card on schools--not students, schools. What does it mean if your child gets the best grades in the worst school in the school district? We know about our children. Our children bring home report cards every 6 weeks or 9 weeks. We don't know about our schools. 
   Do you get a report card on your school? You sure don't. Oh, there are some 30 States that call for a certain kind of report card. Most parents have never seen one. This would suggest that parents ought to be able to understand what they have received from that school with the investment they have made. How does that school compare to other schools? How does your State compare to other States? 
   That is what this report card proposal would do. It would say, let's do for schools what we do for students, and let's allow parents the opportunity to understand how well their school does in educating children. 
   I have been joined by Senator BINGAMAN in offering this amendment. We have added it to the Feinstein amendment.

   Mr. DORGAN. I am pleased today to join my colleague from California. I was listening to her explain the first portion of the amendment which deals with social promotion and remedial education. It reminded me that the last time we joined forces here on the floor of the Senate was also on an education amendment. 
   We worked on a very simple amendment called the Gun-Free Schools Act. This is now the law in this country and has been for a number of years because we decided there ought to be a zero tolerance in this country for a student who brings a gun to school. You ought not have to worry, no matter where you are in the country, about guns in schools. Everywhere in this country, we ought to understand that guns and schools do not mix, and every student and every parent ought to understand there is a penalty of expulsion for one year for bringing a gun to school. 
   I am pleased to have joined with my colleague from California to make that Federal law, and I wonder how many tragedies may have been avoided where guns were not brought to school because a student now understands there is zero tolerance with respect to guns in schools.  
   Today we are here for a different purpose on the same subject: education. The first part of the amendment we have offered deals with social promotion. The second part is a piece that I have written with Senator BINGAMAN from New Mexico regarding the issue of a school report card. Let me explain that amendment. 
   Every 6 to 9 weeks in this country, a parent with a child in school gets a report card that tells the parent how that child has done. Parents are able to see grades that describe how their child is doing in school, an A, a B, a C, or God forbid, maybe a D or even worse. Students are graded and parents know what grades those students are achieving in their school. 
   But I raise a question: What does it mean when your child brings home the best grades from the worst school? Does that tell you much as a parent? You see, we grade students, but there aren't any grades for schools. There are no report cards for schools. Even though we spend over $300 billion on a system of elementary and secondary education in our country, parents and taxpayers have no way of knowing how that school is performing. We grade the children who are in that system, but we do not require a report card on how well our schools are doing so that parents also know how well their school is doing compared to other schools, how well their State is doing compared to other States. 
   A number of States already have school report cards, but very few of them have report cards that provide a range of information on school quality indicators important to the public. And more notably, very few states get that information to the parents themselves. So the parents, as the taxpayers who own that school, who provide the resources to run that school, have very little information about how well that school does. Again, I return to the question: What does it mean for your child to be the best student in the worst school? 
   With this amendment, we propose to offer a Standardized School Report Card Act, which would say to all the schools around the country that, most of you are already preparing some kind of report card, but let's all do it all in the same general way so that we can make some reasonable comparisons, school to school and State to State. 
   We want the report card to grade a school on six areas: 1, student performance; 2, professional qualifications of the teachers; 3, average class size; 4, school safety; 5, parental involvement; and 6, student dropout rates. 
   As I mentioned, more than 35 States now have some form of a school report card. My State does, although my State's report card doesn't do anything more than simply to ask the school to look ahead to prepare for changes in enrollment in the years ahead. It is not a very substantive report card, and most parents in my State have never seen this report card. I would like, at the end of this process, to provide virtually every parent in this country who has a child in school with a report that says, here is how your child is doing, and another report that says, here is how your school is doing related to other schools, other communities, other States. That would be good information for the taxpayers and the parents of our country to have. 
   I was thinking, as I was listening to my colleague from 
   California, about a young girl named Rosie Two Bears. She is likely in class this afternoon in Cannon Ball, ND. I toured that school some while ago. I don't know what a report card will say to the parents of Rosie. That school is unsafe and in desperate need of repair. 
   I have described on the floor on previous occasions the condition of that school. They have 150 students, one water fountain, and two bathrooms, kids cramped together in classes without an inch between their desks and no place to plug in a computer to get to the Internet, because the school won't accommodate wiring of that sort. In the downstairs area where they have band and chorus, the room frequently is evacuated because sewer gas backs up and the students can't learn in a room full of sewer gas backing up into the school. It is an awful situation. 
   What would a report card say about the school of Rosie Two Bears? Perhaps if there were a report card that drove home to parents and taxpayers the unsafe conditions of their children s school, there would be a public outcry to improve that school. 
   The Ojibwa school, up on the Turtle Hill Mountain Indian Reservation, is another example of a tragedy waiting to happen, with all of these kids learning in detached trailers, going back and forth between classes in the winter. I have been there and seen exposed wiring. I can show you the reports that show that school is unsafe. Everybody knows it, and there is no money to build a new school for those children. Addressing this problem will be part of an another debate that we want to happen, but right now, this amendment is about four or five good ideas on education that won't break the bank, that represent good investments in our kids, represent good approaches to improve and strengthen education in this country. If we can do these things together, we will have done something very important for our children. 
   When we consider a report card that all parents could receive, I go back to the point that wouldn't it be nice for the parents of students--whether they go to your school or my school or to the Cannon Ball School or the Ojibwa school--to be able to see what their child is getting from that school? What are we getting for our tax investment in that school? Are we proud, as parents, as the teachers who teach in that school, of the building we have housed our children in, of the textbooks we have provided? Are we doing the right things? 
   That is what Senator BINGAMAN and I and others would like to achieve with this standardized report card for schools. 
   The Senator from California knows, because I have heard her speak of it, that the American people view education as one of their top priorities. Often people talk about how far ahead of politicians the people are. Well, that certainly is true with respect to education. People know what is important. When people sit around the dinner table at night and talk about their lives, what are the first things they talk about? They talk about what their children are learning in school, are we proud of that school? Are our folks getting good health care? Do we have a good job? The central things in life. Children and school represent a priority for many of us. It is why I am pleased that one of the first bills on the floor of the Senate following impeachment is about education. It is why we have pushed so hard to be able to offer amendments to it. Our purpose is not to be destructive, but to focus on a number of steps we can take to improve education. I think Ed-Flex is fine. With this bill we are saying give the States some flexibility, but that is not all there is with respect to education policy. There are other ideas, good ideas. 
   The attempt around here all too often is to get the worst of what both sides have to offer rather than the best of what each has to offer. We have some good ideas. Ed-Flex is a fine idea. Let us add some other good ideas to it: dealing with class size, a school report card, ending social promotion, addressing the problems of students dropping out. Those are good ideas and are central to what the American people believe could strengthen education in this country. 
   I hope that, when we have offered these amendments--some good ideas, I think, from both sides--there will be some positive votes on these ideas, so that this Ed-Flex legislation will leave the Senate in a much stronger position to positively influence the lives of young Americans and families. I will have been proud to play one small part of that with my colleague from California. 
   Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. I will not use all of that, but I did want to say to Senator FEINSTEIN that the ending of social promotion is an opportunity to invest in young lives in a way that will solve problems now, rather than deferring them until much, much later. By ending social promotion we can prevent much bigger problems later in a young person s life. 
   I happen to have, as most parents do, a profound conflict of interest here. I have two children in public elementary school: one in fourth grade and one in sixth grade. I do homework most evenings with them, and the homework is getting tougher these days. My children are in public schools, and I don't know what people are talking about when they talk about failing scores and how the public school system does not work. 
   I am enormously proud of our public school system and what we have accomplished through public schools in this country. But I also know that the only way a public school system works is with parental involvement. If the parent is not involved in the child's education, it is not going to work very well. There are three things you need for education to work: a teacher who knows how to teach, a student willing to learn, and a parent involved in the education of that student. When those three things are present, education works. 
   The Senator from California, in the first part of this amendment, offers a proposal that I think has great merit and is long overdue. I did not speak about it when I spoke about my half of the amendment, but I just want to tell her that I think what she is offering has great, great merit and will be profoundly important to children in this country. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on Thursday evening, March 4 and Friday, March 5, I was necessarily absent because of several long-standing commitments in Bismarck. It was important  that I be in North Dakota for a conference I cosponsored, Women's Health-Women's Lives, to join Secretary of Energy Richardson for meetings on a range of energy issues, and for a meeting with the Governor and other state leaders about the state's water resources. 
   Had I been present for rollcall vote No. 32, to table the Jeffords amendment to S. 280, the Ed-Flex legislation, I would have voted ``nay.'' On rollcall vote No. 33, to table the Gramm amendment to prohibit implementation of the ``Know Your Customer'' banking regulations, I would have voted ``nay'' had I been present.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are on the right subject. The question here is education. But in this great deliberative body, as it is called, we have some who do not want us to debate the principles of education and ideas that exist, here in the Chamber of the Senate. 
   Let me show a graph, if I might. It will be hard for people to see this, but it describes where we are. We have an education bill on the floor of the Senate. To that education bill is offered an amendment by Senator GRAMM, an amendment to the Gramm amendment by Senator Jeffords, then a Jeffords substitute, then a Bingaman amendment, and then the Lott substitute. Then we come in with the Kennedy motion to recommit in order to do the class size amendment. Then we have a Lott amendment to that, followed by a Lott amendment to the Lott amendment. 
   What does all that mean? It is a legislative way of plugging up this system so nothing can happen unless those who run the place want it to happen. It is a legislative mechanism to prevent debate and action on the ideas that we have about education. 
   What are those ideas? The bill on the floor is called Ed-Flex. That is an idea about flexibility. There are other ideas--one we debated last year, reducing class size K-3; 100,000 new teachers who reduce class size, because kids learn better when they are in classes of 15 than if they are in classes of 30 kids. That is common sense. That is an idea, the Kennedy-Murray amendment. 
   School construction--repairing and renovating and building schools where we have schools in disrepair. I have talked at length about schools that are in disrepair; classrooms with sewer gas coming up into the classrooms and kids have to be removed; classrooms that are unsafe. I have talked at length about those issues here on the floor of the Senate. 
   Afterschool programs is another idea. An idea I want to offer, an amendment I want to offer that I am prevented from offering by this plugging system here in the legislative assembly is a school report card. Every 6 or 9 weeks all across this country parents get report cards about how their kids are doing. How is the school performing, however? What about how is the school doing? What does it mean if your kid gets the best grades in the worst school? What does that mean? How does your school do compared to other schools? How does your State do compared to other States? What are you getting for hundreds of billions of dollars we are spending to educate our kids? How about grading our schools? I want to offer that amendment. I want that grading system to be a system that every parent in every corner of this country can understand and recognize and use. 
   Mr. President, I graduated in a high school class of nine. We didn't have particularly advanced mathematics courses, but I know enough about what is going on from that kind of education to understand what is going on here on the floor of the Senate. We have an education bill on the floor of the Senate. A number of us have amendments we want to offer to that bill, have a debate, and have votes on our amendments. Those who run this place say no, it is not how we are going to operate. It is our ideas or no ideas. It is our agenda or no agenda. It is a vote on our bill or on our amendments, or no votes. 
   That is not the way this place ought to operate. Education is a priority and should be a priority in the legislative agenda of this Senate. But it ought not be a narrow agenda that says we will only consider a piece of legislation called Ed-Flex and then prevent everyone else from offering their amendments. 
   I heard a speaker yesterday say about this class size amendment, that is the Senate wanting to run the local school districts. Nonsense. Let me read a comment from a Republican last year when we passed a piece of legislation that called for some additional teachers. Congressman GOODLING, a Republican, said, ``This is a real victory for the Republican Congress, but more importantly, it is a huge win for local  educators and parents who are fed up with Washington mandates.'' 
   So I hear somebody stand up over there yesterday and say what we are trying to do somehow is to run the local school systems--absolute nonsense. It is nonsense, as indicated by Mr. GOODLING, a Republican, who last year said this is good public policy; this is policy everybody ought to support. 
   In fact, this is Republican policy, he said. Now it appears we cannot even get a vote on it. So I urge the majority leader and others to bring a piece of legislation to the floor, open it up, let's have a debate, let's offer amendments--let's get the best of what everyone has to offer here on the floor of the Senate. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.

   Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the courtesy. 
   One of the difficulties we have is being able to offer amendments. And the Senator seemed to suggest at some other point education issues will be brought to the floor with an open opportunity for people to offer a series of ideas and amendments. Is the Senator speaking for the majority leader on that? Because we have had great difficulty in obtaining that status on the floor.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Health Insurance Cost Tax Equity Act of 1999, to immediately put our nation's sole proprietors on par with their larger corporate competitors with respect to the tax treatment of their health insurance costs, without any further delay. 
   I have argued for some time that it's indefensible that our federal tax laws tell some of our biggest corporations that they can deduct 100 percent of their health insurance costs, while others, mostly smaller businesses, are told they can deduct only a smaller share of their health insurance costs. Although we've recently made some progress in addressing this problem, the appropriate solution remains elusive. 
   Moreover, the reasons for promptly correcting this tax inequity are even more urgent today as many small businesses, especially our family farmers, are now facing the financial struggles of their lives. Not only is continued delay of this equitable tax treatment unacceptable for family farmers and ranchers whose documented risks in business are reflected in higher health costs, but it's also diverting resources away from the operations of farms, ranches and Main Street businesses in rural America at a time when many simply can't afford it. 
   Over the past several years, Congress has taken some steps in addressing this unfair disparity in the deductibility of health insurance costs by allowing sole proprietors to deduct a larger share of their health insurance costs. But we've been taking steps that are too small and too slow. This year, sole proprietors may deduct only 60-percent of their health insurance costs for tax purposes. This glaring unfairness is scheduled to be fixed by the year 2003, when our nation's small business owners will finally be able to claim a 100-percent deduction, just like large corporations already enjoy. But this is simply too late for many small businesses. 
   We can no longer delay providing this tax relief because many of the self-employed who would benefit from it--including farmers and ranchers--are struggling through the worst farm crisis in memory. That's why my legislation would provide farmers, ranchers and other sole proprietors a full, 100-percent tax deduction for this year's health insurance costs. 
   Mr. President, the health of a farm family or small business owner is no less important than the health of the president of a large corporation, and the Internal Revenue Code should reflect this simple fact now. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and join me in immediately ending this tax inequity at the first available opportunity.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the resolution. In the past, the U.S. has rightfully been the strongest critic of human rights abuses in China. So I was disappointed, as I think most in the Senate were, that the President chose not to sponsor a resolution condemning China's human rights practices at last year's annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. The United States has sponsored such a resolution at each of these annual meetings since 1990. 
   Although I didn't agree with that decision, I understood the reasoning behind it. China seemed to be making some progress. It had signed the UN Covenant on Social, Economic, and Cultural Rights, and committed itself to signing the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Perhaps reform was at hand. And I certainly favor building a constructive and mutually beneficial relationship with China. 
   But recent history indicates that China often makes such concessions until the world's attention is focused elsewhere, and then quickly reverts back to it's policy of severe intolerance and repression. In 1993, for instance, when human rights became an issue in Beijing's bid to host the Olympics, China released its most prominent dissident, Wei Jingsheng. The Olympics were awarded to Australia, and Wei was detained again the following year. 
   Similarly, just last December, 6 months after signing the ICCPR, China sentenced three democratic activists to prison terms of 10 years or more for trying to organize a political party. A fourth dissenter was given a 10-year sentence for allegedly ``providing intelligence to hostile foreign organizations.'' His crime? He gave an interview to Radio Free Asia about farmer protests. And the Chinese premier, Jiang Zemin, recently stated that China needed to ``nip those factors that undermine social stability in the bud, no matter where they come from,'' and that ``the Western mode of political systems must never be copied.'' 
   However, this is not about ``western political systems,'' it is about internationally recognized human rights. Respect for these rights must be real, and it must be systemic. Empty commitments and token gestures are meaningless, and we should not allow them to sway us from advocating on behalf of those who are imprisoned in China, or will be, for exercising freedoms acknowledged by the world community. An international resolution condemning China's human rights practices is strongly supported by human rights groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. By passing such a resolution, the international community can demonstrate that we will no longer be duped by false promises.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this Congress, now that it will turn its attention to the committee structure and the agenda that will be developed in the authorizing committees and Appropriations Committee, will talk about a lot of different issues, will describe many different priorities. Among those priorities will be, for example, a piece of legislation we just passed in the Senate dealing with military pay. I assume that very soon there will be a national missile defense bill that will come to the floor that will be subject to dramatic and interesting debate, and there are a range of these kinds of issues. I want to raise one issue today that I think we ought to act on with some priority. 
   There is a program that not many people know of called Walking Shield. It is a program to move houses that are surplus houses scheduled to be demolished on our military bases when those houses are to be replaced with more modern houses. Instead of demolishing the old houses, they are now moved out increasingly under the project Operation Walking Shield and moved to Indian reservations where there is a desperate need for good housing. 
   Operation Walking Shield is a wonderful program that takes houses that would have been demolished and moves them to a foundation someplace on an Indian reservation to provide housing for those Americans who do not have housing. 
   We have a real emergency in this country, particularly on Indian reservations, dealing with housing, health care, and education. 
   I want to read a few paragraphs from a letter to describe this emergency and why this Congress must respond to it with some priority and why I hope the President will do the same. 
   I want to read about a woman named Sarah. Her name was Sarah Swift Hawk. Sarah died January 2. Sarah Swift Hawk died on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota. She froze to death. Let me read to you a letter that describes the circumstances leading to Sarah's death:  
   The night of January 2 was truly a dreadful night for the Swift Hawk family. They had run out of propane to heat their house. They also had no wood for their wood stove, although they tried desperately to obtain some wood, but without any success. 
   The Swift Hawk house is but one of 100,000 terribly substandard houses that exist on our nation's Indian reservations. The house had only thin plastic sheeting covering two large openings where windows were supposed to be. As night fell, and the temperature plummeted from 16 degrees below zero to 45 degrees below zero, Sarah's daughter and her son-in-law, who live in the same house with their six children, put two blankets on Sarah in an attempt to keep her warm. The mother then took the other two blankets they had, and placed them over her six children who were all huddled together on the floor where she and her husband would also sleep. Since there was only one cot in the house, that bed was given to Sarah who was the grandmother in the family. Everyone else in the Swift Hawk family has to sleep on the floor because the family is too poor to buy any furniture. 
   When the Sun came up on Sunday morning, January 3rd, the daughter got up from the floor to check on her mother, and she found that her mother had died during the night, frozen to death as a result of exposure to extreme cold. Fortunately, the body heat from the parents and the children, all huddled together on the floor, kept them alive that terrible night. 
   Sarah Swift Hawk's needless death is repeated again and again on our nation's Indian reservations, particularly those in the Northern Plains States.  
   This is a letter from Phil Stevens. Phil Stevens runs the program called Walking Shield. I have met with him a number of times, helped them on legislation to try to move some houses to Indian reservations. I have seen the joy on the faces of those who 
   received a home--one put on a foundation for them--a home that they could move into for the first time, a home for their children. But, frankly, there is just a trickle--a few hundred homes here and  there to meet the needs that are so desperate of people like Sarah Swift Hawk and her family. 
   When you hear stories like this you think, well, that happens in a Third World country someplace, someone laying down and freezing to death in their home. This wasn't a Third World country, it was in our country. 
   The poverty in these areas is so desperate, housing so inadequate, the health care so minimal and the education needs so substantial. And frankly, we have so many other priorities that folks come to the floor of the House and the Senate and they debate this or that with great gusto, and as we do, Sarah Swift Hawk dies, frozen to death in a house, a house without windows, a house with thin plastic sheets where windows should have existed at 45 degrees below zero. 
   Is that a shame? Yes. I think it is shameful that this happens in our country. This is not some mysterious illness for which there is not a cure. We know this happens, and we know how to address these questions. 
   I hope President Clinton and the 106th Congress will decide that these are emergency conditions that exist in housing, health care, and education on our Indian reservations and that we ought to address them. 
   I have spoken on the floor previously about a third grader in a school in Cannon Ball, ND, a young Native American girl who said to me, ``Mr. Senator, will you be building us a new school?'' Because that young third grade Indian child goes to a school that is not fit. It is not a school that Members of the Senate would send their children to, and it is not the fault of the school board, not the fault of the superintendent, and not the fault of the teachers who are trying very hard. 
   This is a school without a tax base, 150 kids, one water faucet, two bathrooms. They cannot connect to the Internet because about half the school is too old, too condemned, not able to access the wiring. This is a school that is in desperate need of repair. One of the rooms has sewer gas seeping up into it that requires the room to be evacuated occasionally because they can't keep children in a room where the sewer gas keeps backing up. That is the kind of school we have a third grader walk through the door of, and we say to that third grader, ``This is your school.'' 
   Are we proud of that? I don't think so. Ought we do something about it? Does that young third grader's life depend on us doing something? It does, and we should. 
   We all know the problems in health care. I just met with a group a few minutes ago, this afternoon. Let me just tell you about health care for a moment. This group was talking about foster children. On one of the reservations, a young 4-year-old boy had been in two foster homes and was being moved again, and the caseworker noticed some substantial stench when he was in the vicinity of the 4-year-old boy. 
   What was it that smelled so bad? A 4-year-old boy wearing a cast on his arm because he had a broken arm, but through two foster homes no one had bothered to take him back to the doctor and the cast had been on 6 months. He had gangrene on his arm. Now, is that an emergency in health care? I think so. It is just a symptom, just the tip of the iceberg of massive problems --massive problems--that exist in health care, education and housing. 
   You know, I am talking now about the problems on Indian reservations. I want to tell you about pinning medals one day on the pajamas of an Indian named Edmond Young Eagle, a Native American who grew up on the Standing Rock Reservation, Fort Yates, ND, a proud member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. 
   He went overseas to fight for this country--Africa, Europe--fought for America in the Second World War. And if you look at the Indian population of this country and the percentage of veterans they have and who fought in our country's wars, you will find a very high percent of the Indian population went off to fight for this country. Edmond did--fought across the world in the Second World War. 
   When I met Edmond, he was dying, laying in a VA hospital. His family had contacted me and said Edmond had never received his medals for his service in the Second World War. They wanted to know if there was any chance to get these medals he was owed from the Defense Department before he died. I got the medals and I took them to the VA hospital on a Sunday morning in Fargo, ND. 
   Edmond Young Eagle had lung cancer. I did not know it that Sunday morning, but 7 days later Edmond Young Eagle would die from lung cancer. But that Sunday morning they cranked up his bed to a sitting position, and he was wearing his pajamas. And in a ceremony, witnessed by his doctors and nurses and his sisters and some people who had come from the Old Soldiers Home, I pinned medals on Edmond Young Eagle's pajamas, the medals he had earned for his service to our country in the Second World War. 
   And this man dying of lung cancer said to me, ``You know, this is the proudest day of my life.'' I thought to myself, what a paradox it is that this man, who served his country honorably in the Second World War, fought for America's freedom, and then never had much the rest of his life, at the end of his life, lying in the hospital, suffering from lung cancer, felt so strongly about his service to his country and was so proud of receiving medals from his country for his service to America that he said it was one of the proudest days of his life. 
   We have a responsibility, it seems to me, to the memory of Edmond Young Eagle, to the third grade girl that I talked about going to a school that ought to be improved, to the memory of Sarah Swift Hawk, who goes to sleep in a house at 45 below zero, and dies in her sleep, freezes to death, we owe it to these folks--to their memories, to their children--we owe it to them to do something about these issues on an emergency basis. 
   There are a lot of things that we will debate back and forth on the floor of this Senate, as I said--defense policy, education policy, health care policy--so many issues day after day. But these are the kinds of things that we must put at the front of the line, to say people ought not to be freezing to death in our country because they run out of fuel in the winter, because they live in houses that ought not be inhabited in the winter, because they do not have housing, because they do not have health care. We can do something about this. 
   Let me conclude again by saying, I am trying to see that the White House determines this is a priority and an emergency, that we have an emergency, a housing emergency and health care emergency on our Indian reservations that we ought to address. 
   This isn't a case where any of us can just say, well, gosh, that is somebody else's problem. It is not somebody else's problem. 
   When we have young children who are not receiving the medical attention they need, who are put in foster homes that are unsafe and where they are beaten--I ve told a story about a young girl with her nose broken, hair pulled out at the roots, her arm broken in a foster home, placed in a foster home by one worker who had 150 cases to work on. 
   So you put a child at age 3 in a foster home without understanding what kind of home this is. And then there is a drunken party, and a 3-year-old girl gets her arm broken, her nose broken, and her hair pulled out by the roots. Is that what we want in this country? Of course not. It is our responsibility to address these issues. And it is, indeed, an emergency when a 3-year-old girl is beaten, when a third grade girl is denied an adequate education, when a grandmother named Sarah Swift Hawk freezes to death. These are emergencies. And we need to do something about them. 
   I am hoping the White House will declare these as emergencies. And I am hoping the Congress will understand that we can, with a small investment, make life so much better for a lot of folks who matter in this country--folks like Edmond Young Eagle--who have served this country with great distinction and great honor. In their memory, and just because it is the right thing to do, our country has a responsibility to decide this is a priority. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me, on behalf of the entire Senate, thank the distinguished Senator, Mr. BYRD, for those wonderful words. I attended the memorial service for Scott Bates on Saturday and heard Senator BYRD deliver those reflections. And I guess there is no one in the Senate who could have done what Senator BYRD regularly does in expressing the collective will of the Senate. 
   With the passing of Scott, we lost a wonderful member of the Senate family. And Senator BYRD, not just on this occasion but on virtually all occasions like this, reaches out and touches others in a very special way. 
   I recall when my daughter died that Senator BYRD reached out to me and offered me a piece of prose that still sits in my top desk drawer. Senator HATCH sent me a white leather-bound Bible that still rests behind my desk for reference. That is what the Senate is like. It is not so much about Republicans and Democrats; it is about people who work together, who have a passionate interest in serving this country. 
   And it is not just those who are elected who have that passionate interest. There are a myriad of wonderful, qualified, committed, dedicated staff persons who work in this building who make this democracy of ours work. And losing Scott Bates was a tragic loss for all of us. 
   Frankly, I did not know Scott particularly well. I knew him as a fun person to banter and visit and joke with from time to time and knew his sonorous voice as he called the roll. And I knew him as a very special member of the Senate family. But I believe on Saturday I got to know him well through his family. 
   Senator BYRD described the memorial service. I would say, as just one visitor to that memorial service, how wonderful it would be if all of us could leave such a family behind, as Scott did. His two daughters and the son who spoke at that memorial service are remarkable young people who will contribute much to our country. That is the lasting tribute to Scott. 
   So let me again, on behalf of the entire Senate, thank Senator BYRD for his presentation on Saturday. And, coincidentally, I had asked him this morning if I could have a copy of his presentation. He said he would be putting it in the Senate RECORD. Now all of the Senators will be able to share, with him, the words that he offered on our behalf on Saturday. 
   Mr. President, I would like, by consent, to be able to be recognized to speak on a different subject.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think you can hear a collective sigh of relief around the Capitol Building now that the impeachment trial--only the second in the history of our country--is complete and we can turn our thoughts to other issues, turn our energies to other enterprises. 
   Most of us seek election to the U.S. Senate--whether it be from West Virginia or North Dakota or Arizona--because we feel passionately about public issues. And there are many, many public issues--both here at home and around the world--that should and will command our attention. 
   Recently I told my colleagues a short story about Teddy Roosevelt. I want to talk today about a couple of issues, and it is probably appropriate to start with Teddy Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt lost both his wife and his mother on the same day in different rooms of his home. And he was so stricken with grief that he decided to do something different with his life. He decided to go west for some while and see if he could find himself again. 
   Teddy Roosevelt had some resources, so when he made his decision to go west, he decided to go to the Badlands of North Dakota. He knew that in the Badlands there were cowboys, and so, I am told, he went to Brooks Brothers and ordered a cowboy suit to be made for him. And Brooks Brothers made a cowboy suit for Teddy Roosevelt. He got a bowie knife, a sterling silver bowie knife with an ivory handle, I understand, that had his name on it, and it said ``Tiffany's.'' He bought it at Tiffany's. And he got silver spurs, and on the rowel of each spur were engraved his initials. 
   So when the train stopped in North Dakota for Teddy Roosevelt to disembark, to go to live in the Badlands and raise horses and cattle, this fellow stepped off the train wearing his Brooks Brothers cowboy suit and a pair of rimless glasses, with his bowie knife from ``Tiffany's,'' and his sterling silver engraved spurs. 
   The cowboys in the Badlands thought, ``What on Earth has landed here in Medora, ND''--this man they called four-eyes, with his rimless glasses and his funny Brooks Brothers cowboy suit and his sterling silver spurs. They made fun of him, poked fun at the way he looked. And then, as the story goes, in the Badlands saloon in Medora, ND, one unlucky cowboy goaded him too far and wanted to pick a fight with him. 
   It took only a matter of minutes, apparently, for this rather unusual looking character from the East, with his Brooks Brothers cowboy suit, to knock this local cowboy senseless in the Badlands saloon. Then the rest of the cowboys had a different impression of this fellow. Yes, he looked a little different, but he had some real mettle. They knew a little something about him. And Teddy Roosevelt, of course, went on to carve a rather rich chapter of his life ranching in the Badlands of North Dakota. 
   I told my colleagues that story some while ago because we are all kind of different. We gather here in the U.S. Senate, 100 of us, coming from different parts of the country with different philosophies. We even dress differently from time to time. And so we come to this place, this place of debate in our democracy, from all kinds of different perspectives. But we respect each other. We do not make fun of each other. We know that each arrives here with a passion and a mission on behalf of those who sent us here to do the best we can for this country. 
   We do not settle our disputes with saloon fights. We do it through debate.  We respect the other person's view. We might disagree with it in a very aggressive way, but we respect each other. And through the process of public debate, the give and take, the process of democracy works. 
   Now we turn our attention from an impeachment trial, which I think was difficult for every single Member of this Senate and for the country, to other issues--health 
   care, a Patients' Bill of Rights; education and how we improve our schools; what we do to strengthen Social Security and Medicare; and more. 
   There are two enduring truths about the last quarter century for everyone who serves in the Senate. One is that we have experienced a cold war that consumed a substantial amount of our energy, time, and resources; the second is that we have had crippling Federal budget deficits. Both of those enduring truths have now changed. The cold war is over and the Federal deficits are no more. The Soviet Union is gone, the cold war is over. That changes a great deal of our international issues and attention. The crippling Federal budget deficits that used to grow year after year are gone and we now see predictions and projections that year after year we will experience Federal budget surpluses. 
   Since those two enduring truths have changed, I want to focus on one aspect of them today, and that is the reason I came to the Senate floor. We have people who now say that because the Federal budget deficits are going to turn into Federal budget surpluses, let us very quickly propose returning $500 or $600 billion in tax cuts to the American people over the next 10 years. 
   I want to talk about the merit of that. It would be a tragic mistake, in my judgment, for this Congress to decide that--at the first sight of budget surpluses, after a long, dark period of mushrooming Federal budget deficits that have accumulated to a $5.5 trillion Federal debt--we should try to outbid each other on who can return more tax money to the American taxpayer. 
   I think the greatest gift that we could give to America's children would be to decide that when we turn the corner and experience real budget surpluses, we begin during good times to reduce the Federal debt. There can be no greater gift to America's children than for us, during good economic times, to begin reducing the crushing Federal debt. That debt, as I said, stands at $5.5 trillion. 
   I have a chart that shows what kind of surpluses we are expected to experience over the next 10 years, recognizing of course that none of us can know with certainty what will happen next week, next month, or next year. The budget surplus, which is the top line of this chart--and these figures came from the Congressional Budget Office--amounts to more than $2.5 trillion over 10 years. That doesn't mean very much to me because that is not a real surplus. It is a surplus that is made possible by the use of the Social Security trust funds which, in my judgment, cannot be used to calculate a budget surplus. The second line of the chart calculates what happens to our surplus if you take the Social Security trust funds and set it aside--which ought to be done--for the purpose of saving it for the time when it is needed as the baby boomers will retire. The real surplus, then, begins in the year 2001. 
   In 1993, when President Clinton took office, he inherited a budget deficit that year of about $300 billion. That has turned around dramatically. We have in this country experienced wonderful news with an improving economic outlook in this country. So we have gone from about a $300 billion deficit to a $7 billion deficit in the upcoming fiscal year--almost a balanced budget. The next year the budget will be in balance, even without counting Social Security trust funds, and that is the prediction for every year thereafter for the following eight years. 
   The question is, What do we do as a result of that? We have people rushing through the door saying, let me propose a $650 billion income tax cut. Some say a 10-percent across-the-board income tax cut. Aside from the merits on that issue, I happen to think that the crushing tax burden is not the income tax, but the increasing payroll taxes that American workers have had to pay. Most working families in this country pay more in payroll taxes than they pay in Federal income taxes. 
   My point is this: As we begin to construct a new fiscal policy rooted with the understanding that we no longer face crippling budget deficits, let us start to think about our 
   priorities. The easy politics would be to say, let's just give a lot of tax cuts, let's talk about across-the-board tax cuts. But a much more responsible approach, in my judgment, would be to say during good economic times it is required for us to begin the long process of reducing the Federal debt. Now, if that is a priority--and I hope it will be for the majority of the Members of the Senate, reducing America's debt during good economic times--that should be, in my judgment, complemented by our understanding that the Social Security system also needs shoring up. We must reserve some of our projected surplus to make that system whole and well and solvent for the long term. 
   I want to make a point about Social Security because some people wring their hands and gnash their teeth because of the problems we have with Social Security. These are not big problems. The Social Security problem--to the extent there is one--is born of success. One hundred years ago, you were expected to live to age 48 in this country; today, the life expectancy is almost 78. We have increased life expectancy by 30 years. People live longer and better lives for a lot of reasons. That is success. Does that cause some strain to the Social Security system? Of course it does, but it is born of success. And let us not wring our hands about that. We can easily resolve these issues. 
   Third, in addition to reducing the Federal debt during good economic times with this budget surplus and making certain that we are responsible for making Social Security solvent for the long term, the proposal that the President and some others have offered, to use any additional tax cuts outside of that for the purpose of providing incentive for savings, makes a lot of sense to me. Encouraging personal private savings in this country, which the President proposed through USA accounts--and there are other approaches--seems to me to make a lot of sense in terms of creating the foundation for long-term, solid economic growth for the next two, three and four decades. 
   Having said all that, let me make this point: We in this country have the strongest economy in the world right now. I studied economics in college and then I taught economics in college very briefly. That experience hasn't hindered me, but nonetheless I taught some economics. One of the things you teach in economics is that there are two principles you strive to achieve in an economy--stable prices and full employment. 
   In our country's current economy, we have virtually no inflation and we have nearly full employment. And we--at a time when the Asian economy is weak, when the Russian economy has collapsed, when the Brazilian economy is weak--have the strongest economy in the world. Is it by accident? I don't think so. I don't happen to think that Republicans or Democrats have the answer either. It is not as if, somewhere down in the engine room of this ship of state, there is an engine with dials and knobs and a lever, and if we can just find the right dials and knobs and levers to pull and push, the right amount of tax cuts, the right amount of spending, the right amount of M1, that somehow the ship of state will do fine. I don't happen to think the engine room works that way. 
   Economies have everything to do with the confidence of the people. When people are confident about the future, they make individual decisions such as: I will buy a car; I will buy a house; I will make this investment because I am confident about the future. They make those kinds of decisions based on their confidence. That creates the foundation for an economy. 
   When people are not confident about the future, they say, I will not make that purchase; I will defer buying an automobile; I will defer buying this home because I am not so confident about the future. 
   So it is the confidence of the people upon which this economy rests. All of the indices show the American people are confident about the future because the President and the Congress together--I am talking about all Members of the Congress coming together--  have made some good decisions in recent years, decisions that say deficits matter, and we are going to tame them. 
   That isn't to say that we shouldn't continue to invest--even as we tame the Federal budget deficits. We are going to invest in the kinds of things that will make this a bigger, better, stronger country. We had, as the Senator from West Virginia will recall, a vigorous debate in the last Congress about a highway bill. Some around here were just wringing their hands about the amount of money we were going to spend on highways. 
   The money that we are going to spend on highways, coming from the gasoline tax collected at the gas pump when people fill up their cars with gasoline, is going to go into improving America's infrastructure--building roads, repairing bridges, and generally making us a better country. It is an investment in our country, just as it is an investment in young people to improve schools. It is an investment in our future. Ben Franklin once said, ``Anyone who puts their purse in their head will never lose their purse.'' That is what education is about. Education is an investment in our children. 
   We have made a lot of thoughtful decisions in the last 6 or 8 years; frankly, it can go well beyond that. We can go back to the 1950s when we talk about roads and think of the decision that President Eisenhower and the Republicans and Democrats in Congress made about an interstate highway system. You could ask yourself, could anybody in this country justify building a four-lane interstate between Fargo, ND, and Beach, ND, all those hundreds of miles where there aren't a great deal of people? You could have had one of the watchdog organizations pull that apart in the fifties and say, ``Look what they are spending where not many people are living.'' But President Eisenhower and Congress said that we are going to link this country together with the interstate highway system. Transportation is universal. 
   We have done a lot of good things, and a lot is left to be done. As we deal with fiscal policy and especially with the question of tax cuts and budget surpluses, I hope we can make thoughtful and good decisions for the long-term future of this country. I think very strongly that the first priority is for us, during good economic times, to reduce the Federal debt. The second priority is to say we owe it to the Social Security system to make it whole. The third priority says let's encourage private savings through tax cuts because that strengthens America in the future as well.

   Mr. DORGAN. The answer, I say, to that is once you change the Tax Code, that change is generally permanent unless altered. We have had the experience before of a very aggressive appetite to reduce taxes, only to discover that we run into a recession, experience very significant Federal budget deficits, and then the confidence of the people about the future tends to erode and you 
   have a further economic contraction. 
   I say to the Senator from West Virginia, one of the things that I think is very important is to the extent that there would be tax cuts following a reduction in Federal debt and shoring up Social Security, I hope that it will be triggered by the actual experience of the surplus. If you don't have a mechanism to trigger the tax cuts, what will happen ultimately will be an economic slowdown--nobody has repealed the business cycle--and experience significant budget deficits.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I raise this issue today only because it will be one of perhaps five or six significant issues we will debate in the coming months. I do not think that my idea is exclusively good and that there are no other good ideas out there. I have great respect for others here who might disagree strongly with my view on these issues. I want to, as we begin this debate, at least stake out the ground that some of us would feel strongly about--debt reduction and other responsible actions in fiscal policy. 
   I look forward to this. This has been a tough 6 or 7 weeks as we have started this session because of the impeachment trial. Most of us come here relishing the idea and fostering the appetite for debate about the public issues that really matter to this country in economics, health care, and education. So I look forward to it in the coming days and weeks.

   Mr. DORGAN. Well, as the Senator knows, I have felt very strongly about our trade deficits. The one area of our economic performance that is very troubling is the area of trade indebtedness that continues now to mushroom. In fact, just in the last week, we saw an announcement that we have experienced the largest trade deficit in the country's history. I am particularly concerned about our merchandise deficits, because that reflects the deficits in terms of the goods that you produce, not services and because it is an indicator of the health of the manufacturing economy. 
   I don't think you can remain a world economic power unless you have a vibrant, strong manufacturing sector. I am very concerned about the trade deficits, and I have spent a great deal of time talking to our Trade Ambassador and this administration. 
   I think our trade policies need adjustment. It is not that I don't believe we shouldn't have expanded trade around the world; of course we should. But this country needs to stand up for its own economic interests in a thoughtful and useful way. We need to stand up for our interests with respect to the Chinese, the Japanese, the Europeans, and others to say that our market is open to your goods, it is wide open, but only on the condition that trade between our country and yours is fair. 
   During the first 25 years after the Second World War, we could have foreign policy masquerading as trade policy, or the reverse, and we could beat anybody on the globe in international trade with one hand tied behind our  back. But that has changed. We face formidable competitors in international trade. And the corporations who do the business around this world now separate themselves from nationalist interests, and they are simply interested in finding out where they can produce the cheapest and where they can sell for the best price. Often that mismatch means you can produce more cheaply if you find a Third World country in which you can produce and dump chemicals into the streams, pollutants into the air, and pay kids 14 cents an hour. You don't have all of the encumbrances you have producing in an industrialized country. You can produce whatever it is you are producing and ship it to Chicago, Pittsburgh, Charleston or Fargo. 
   The dilemma of all of that is the bifurcation of production and the means to purchase, which creates this trade deficit between countries. The trade deficit is a very serious economic problem. It is one of the few blemishes that exists on this complexion of good economic news. And we must begin to address it. I know that most people want to ignore it. They don't want to talk about it. 
   Interestingly enough, some of the economists in this town have always said that NAFTA and free trade are good. They said, ``You know, our trade deficit is just a function of fiscal policy deficits. You won't have a trade deficit if you ever get the budget balanced.'' Guess what has happened? We have gotten the deficit under control and our trade deficits are still mushrooming. I really should, as a public service, rewrite the textbook, because the answers are now apparently wrong. In fact, we should get their names--some of the best economists in time who have said that--and I should get their quotes and bring them to the floor. 
   So those are the things that we need to have a thoughtful discussion about. 
   I appreciate the Senator from West Virginia raising the issue. He and I coauthored a piece of legislation, which is now law, that created a trade deficit review commission. It is my hope that the commission will soon begin meeting and sift through all of these policy areas and hopefully make recommendations to Congress in an expeditious way to allow us to get some new ideas and some new energy and new perspectives on this very critical issue. The commitment of the Senator from West Virginia, Senator BYRD, to passing that trade deficit review commission legislation--which is, as I said, now law--is very important and very helpful to this country. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DORGAN. Thank you Senator LOTT, Senator DASCHLE, and Mr. Chief Justice for the skill and dignity you have given these proceedings.  
   I wish every American could see and hear the Senate in these deliberations. 
   There is a kind of majesty to see the Senate chamber filled with Senators listening to each other in debate and deliberation. 
   We are different people, coming from different regions with different philosophies, and that is what creates the unique character of this wonderful institution. 
   I want to tell you briefly today about Teddy Roosevelt. 
   Over a century ago, Teddy Roosevelt was consumed with grief following the death of his wife and mother who died on the same day. He decided to change his life and move out west. When he stepped off the train in the Badlands of North Dakota, he was wearing a cowboy suit hand-tailored from Brooks Brothers, rimless glasses, a Bowie knife with ``Tiffanys'' engraved on the handle, and Sterling silver spurs with his initials on each rowel. 
   The local cowboys thought he was a joke. One unlucky cowboy picked a fight with Teddy in a Badlands saloon in Medora. In minutes, the cowboy was punched senseless by this funny looking easterner. 
   And then Teddy Roosevelt was accepted. Being different, looking different didn't much matter to the folks in the Badlands after that. 
   Here in the Senate we're very different people too. No saloon fights here, though. We engage in verbal battles. And the Senate works because we accept each other, and we share a common purpose. 
   The discussion we are having today reminds me again of the unique skills and passion for our country possessed by each and every member of the Senate. 
   How do we apply these skills and that passion here and now? 
   Mark Twain once said, with tongue in cheek, that ``the next best thing to a lie, is a true story no one will believe.'' 
   Well, this sorry chapter in our rich history embraces both. Lies, yes! And truth that is almost unbelievable. 
   We meet here as Senators to consider whether to remove from office a president elected by the American people. In the entire history of our country, the Senate has never voted to remove a president. In fact, it has been tried only once. The Framers of our Constitution made it very hard to do; and they made it, with a 2/3 vote required in the Senate, impossible to do on a ``partisan'' basis. 
   The matter that calls us to this duty is a sordid one. 
   It is truly a scandal and a drama without heroes and without winners. 
   It is about a president who should be, and I'm sure is, ashamed of his behavior. Is there anyone here in the Senate who had a sexual relationship with one of their interns? Of course not! The President did. He had a sexual relationship with an intern, and he lied about it, to the country, to all of us, to try to conceal it. 
   This President has betrayed our trust and I have expressed to him personally how profoundly disappointed I am with his actions. 
   This matter is also about an Independent Counsel who you and I know has leaked confidential information from secret proceedings of a grand jury, and whose actions in detaining Monica Lewinsky should be troubling to every Senator. And an Independent Counsel who came to Congress with such prosecutorial passion that his ethics advisor resigned in protest. 
   And it is about many others as well. Major figures and bit players, some who conspired in disgraceful ways, and others who were innocently swept into the maelstrom of a sensational scandal. 
   But, for all of the intrigue, the matter here is less complicated than some would have us believe. 
   Here is a short chronology. 
   Several years after the day she claims that then-Governor Bill Clinton made unwanted sexual advances toward her, Paula Jones appeared at a conservative political gathering to announce she was filing suit against the President. 
   Some while later, following the Supreme Court ruling that the case could go forward, the President was called to a deposition in the Jones case. 
   In that deposition, which the Judge later determined to be immaterial, and in a case that was later dismissed, Bill Clinton denied having a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. That was a lie. Oh, I know about the convoluted definition of sex that was used, but I think he lied. But that's not a matter before us. The impeachment article about that deposition was defeated in the U.S. House. 
   Following the President's testimony in the Jones case, the Independent Counsel, appointed three years earlier to investigate a Whitewater land deal, and controversies called Travelgate and Filegate, swung into action to investigate this sex scandal. Linda Tripp was wired, Monica Lewinsky was detained by the Independent Counsel and the FBI, and they told her she shouldn't call her lawyer. A grand jury began hearing witnesses and after many months the President appeared before that grand jury to answer questions. 
   Then, one-and-a half months before the 1998 general election, the U.S. House, with cooperation from the Independent Counsel, released to the American public all of their investigative material and the secret proceedings of the grand jury. 
   Following the election, the U.S. House Judiciary Committee began their impeachment hearings. The Independent Counsel, in a virtual footnote to his presentation before the House on the sex scandal, admitted he had not been able to implicate the President on Whitewater, Travelgate or Filegate--but he got him on the sex matter. And so the House managers and the Independent Counsel used the President's bad behavior to weave their charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
   And finally the U.S. House on a partisan vote sent to the Senate the two articles of impeachment. 
   That's the chronology as I see it. 
   And so we gather--conducting a trial of this sordid mess. 
   What are we to do? What is our duty? What is, as Lincoln said, ``our last full measure of devotion'' to this country. 
   I am deeply troubled by this President's behavior. But I am also troubled by the constitutional gravity of removing a President. Some, with a mere wave of the hand seem to say that ``it's not such a big deal.'' But they are wrong. This decision affects the very roots of our democracy. 
   The selection of the head of government by the governed in a free election is rare. It is still the case in too many countries that power shifts through the barrel of a gun--through raw, naked power and violence. 
   In our country, the American people choose their President by the simple, elegant act of voting. It is through voting--not fighting--that power shifts. Our governments change without an army marching. With no shots being fired. What a remarkable thing to behold. 
   The Constitution does contain a very special provision allowing for the removal of a President ``for bribery, treason, and other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' It does that because the Framers wanted to provide a method to remove a president who was acting in a manner that threatens the country. 
   But the Framers worried that a partisan majority could try to remove a President for political gain. 
   Hamilton, in the Federalist 65 said, ``the greatest danger ..... that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of the parties than by the real demonstration of innocence or guilt.'' 
   Mason said that the President should be removed for ``great and dangerous offenses'' that amount to ``attempts to subvert the Constitution.'' Hamilton wrote that impeachable offenses result from a ``violation of public trust'' and ``relate chiefly to injuries done to society itself.'' 
   It is also clear that the impeachment process was not meant to punish a transgressor. In fact, the Constitution provides that any such ``crimes'' would still be punishable in the criminal justice system. 
   In short, impeachment is a device to prevent grave danger to the Nation. 
   I believe that the Framers of the Constitution would be startled by this impeachment effort. 
   That this impeachment process was passionately partisan in its birth in the U.S. House is not in question. In fact, two of the House managers who brought these articles of impeachment to us called for the impeachment of President Clinton long before they had ever heard of Monica Lewinsky. Seventeen Republican Congressmen had  called for impeachment hearings long ago. Theirs was a cause searching for a reason. 
   Nearly two years ago, before Linda Tripp, before Monica Lewinsky, before Betty Currie, before knowledge of sex with an intern, before a stained dress, before the deposition in the Jones case, before the testimony to the grand jury, two of the House Managers who argued for these impeachment articles had introduced an impeachment inquiry resolution. Representative BOB BARR and Representative LINDSEY GRAHAM said then that it was about ``the rule of law.'' They were asking for the nullification of an election before they knew the existence of a Monica Lewinsky and before the action that led to the two articles of impeachment now before us. 
   Isn't there room to wonder then, that maybe this is exactly the partisan passion that persuaded our Framers to place the impeachment bar just above the vertical leap of those Members of Congress who would carry ``fill in the blank'' impeachment papers for every reason and every season. 
   Take the partisan flavor away. I don't think the case has been made that the President's behavior, while reprehensible, poses a grave danger to the Nation. Therefore I cannot vote to nullify the results of the last election. The people chose Bill Clinton and I do not believe the case made against the President meets the constitutional threshold for removing a president. 
   I respect those here who differ. I do not allege that your guilty vote is partisan. You have reached a different conclusion charge than I did, and I respect you for that. 
   But I cannot vote for these articles of impeachment. This is not a case of high crimes and misdemeanors. It's a case of bad behavior by a President who has shamed himself. 
   But let us not respond to his bad behavior by hurting our country. 
   Let us not aim at Bill Clinton and hit the Constitution. 
   I do not vote to support our President. I vote against these articles of impeachment to support our Constitution. 
   In the final analysis, however, the President should take no solace in this vote. I and others in the Senate have joined in a censure resolution that expresses a harsh judgement about the President's actions. 
   Now, it is time for the country to move on.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President. When the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement came into effect ten years ago, part of the understanding on agriculture was that our two nations were going to move rapidly toward the harmonization of pesticide regulations. It is now a decade later and relatively little actual progress has been in harmonization that is meaningful to our agricultural producers. 
   Since this trade agreement took effect, the pace of Canadian spring and durum wheat, and barley exports to the United States have grown from a barely noticeable trickle into annual floods of imported grain into our markets. Over the years, I have described many factors that have produced this unfair trade relationship and unlevel playing field between farmers of our two nations. The failure to achieve harmonization in pesticides between the United States and Canada compounds this ongoing trade problem. 
   Our farmers are concerned that agricultural pesticides that are not available in the United States are being utilized by farmers in Canada to produce wheat, barley, and other agricultural commodities that are subsequently imported and consumed in the United States. They rightfully believe that it is unfair to import commodities produced with agricultural pesticides that are not available to U.S. producers. They believe that it is not in the interests of consumers or producers to allow such imports. However, it is not just a  difference of availability of agricultural pesticides between our two countries, but also in the pricing of these chemicals. 
   In recent times as the cost-price squeeze has escalated, our farmers have also been deeply concerned about pricing discrepancies for agricultural pesticides between our two countries. This past summer a survey of prices by the North Dakota Agricultural Statistics Services verified that there were significant differences in prices being paid for essentially the same pesticide by farmers in our two countries. In fact, among the half-dozen pesticides surveyed, farmers in the United States were paying between 117 percent and 193 percent higher prices than Canadian farmers. This was after adjusting for differences in currency exchange rates at that time. 
   As a result of the pricing concerns raised by our producers, the recent agricultural agreement between the United States and Canada included a provision for a study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Ag Canada into the pricing differentials in agricultural chemicals between our two countries. While such a study is a welcome step forward, our farmers deserve more concrete steps. Harmonization cannot continue to be an illusive goal for the future. We must provide meaningful tools by which we can bring some fairness to our farmers. 
   Today, I am reintroducing legislation that would take an important step in providing equitable treatment for U.S. farmers in the pricing of agricultural pesticides. This bill would only deal with agricultural chemicals that are identical or substantially similar. It only deals with pesticides that have already undergone rigorous review processes and have been registered and approved for use in both countries by the respective regulatory agencies. 
   The bill would establish a procedure by which states may apply for and receive an Environmental Protection Agency label for agricultural chemicals sold in Canada that are identical of substantially similar to agricultural chemicals used in the United States. Thus, U.S. producers and suppliers could purchase such chemicals in Canada for use in the United States. The need for this bill is created by pesticide companies which use chemical labeling laws to protect their marketing and pricing structures, rather than the public interest. In their selective labeling of identical or substantially similar products across the border they are able to extract unjustified profits from farmers, and create unlevel pricing fields between our two countries. 
   This bill is one legislative step in the process of full harmonization of pesticides between our two nations. It is designed to specifically to address the problem of pricing differentials on chemicals that are currently available in both countries. We need to take this step, so that we can start creating a bit more fair competition and level playing fields between farmers of our two countries. This bill would make harmonization a reality for those pesticides in which pricing is the only real difference. 
   Together with this legislation, I will be working on other fronts to move forward as rapidly as possible toward full harmonization of pesticides. The U.S. Trade Representative, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have the responsibility to make harmonization a reality. Farmers have been waiting for a decade for such harmonization. We should not make them wait any longer.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation today, along with other colleagues, that is designed to inject more airline competition and improve air service to small communities. Since the deregulation of the airline industry two decades ago, hundreds of small communities have experienced service degradation and many have lost service altogether. Vast geographic regions of our country have suffered unacceptable geographic isolation as the airlines have withdrawn service in smaller communities. This trend needs the serious attention of the Congress and the Department of Transportation. 
   Included in this legislation are several provisions designed to promote airline competition and develop air service to the many rural areas of the country that have suffered the consequences of laissez-faire deregulation. The consequence can be summed up in one phrase: ``unregulated monopolies.''  
   Unregulated monopolies result in a number of effects: (1) higher prices and fewer choices for consumers and (2) the elimination of competition and the establishment of entry barriers that make competition a nearly impossible task. 
   While deregulation has been a wonderful success for the people who travel between the major metropolitan areas of the country, it has been an unmitigated disaster for most rural areas and smaller communities. Transportation Department studies have documented that 167 communities has lost air service in the past two decades and hundreds have suffered service degradation manifested by loss of jet service or loss of access to a major hub airport. 
   In a report by the General Accounting Office issued in October, 1997 entitled, ``Airline Deregulation: Barriers to Entry Continue to Limit Competition in Several Key Domestic Markets'' [GAO/RCED-97-4], operating limitations and marketing practices of large, dominate carriers restrict entry and competition to an extent not anticipated by Congress when it deregulated the airline industry. The GAO identified a number of entry barriers and anti-competitive practices which are stifling competition and contributing to higher fares. The GAO issued a similar report in 1990 and the 1996 report said that not only has the situation not improved for new entrants, but things have gotten worse. 
   These mega carriers have created theifdoms, securing dominate market shares at regional hubs. Since deregulation, all major airlines have created hub-and-spoke systems where they funnel arrivals and departures though hub airports where they dominate traffic. Today, all but 3 hubs are dominated by a single airline where the carrier has between 60 and 90 percent of all the arrivals, departures, and passengers at the hub. 
   The fact is that deregulation has lead to greater concentration and stifling competition. The legislative history of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 shows that Congress was as deeply concerned about destructive competition as it was with the monopolization of air transportation services. Thus, the CAA sought to ensure that a competitive economic environment existed. As we can see, deregulation is realizing the fears anticipated by the Congress in 1938. Competition has not become the general rule. Rather, competition is the exception in an unregulated market controlled largely by regional monopolies. 
   Deregulation has also resulted in disproportionate air fares. It has been demonstrated that hub concentration has translated into higher fares and rural communities that are dependent upon concentrated hubs have seen higher fares. 
   Studies from DOT and the GAO have demonstrated that in the 15 out of 18 hubs in which a single carrier controls more than 50% of the traffic, passengers are paying more than the industry norm. The GAO studied 1988 fares at 15 concentrated airports and compared those with fares at 38 competitive hub airports. The GAO found that fares at the concentrated hubs were 27% higher. 
   The difference between regulation and deregulation is not a change from monopoly control to free market competition. Rather, the change is from having regulated monopolies serving 93% of the market to deregulated monopolies serving 85% of the market, according to Dempsey. Today, nearly two-thirds of our nation's city-pairs are unregulated monopolies where a monopoly carrier can charge whatever they wish in 2 our of 3 city-pairs in the domestic market.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to call the attention of my colleagues to a piece that was written by our distinguished Senator from West Virginia, our colleague, Senator BYRD, that appeared in today's Washington Post entitled ``Don't Tinker With Impeachment.'' 
   The reason I want to do that is there are discussions occurring now, according to some of my colleagues and accounts in the newspaper and on television, about trying to create a mechanism to require a vote in the Senate during the impeachment trial on the findings of fact prior to a vote on the articles of impeachment themselves. 
   I was just looking at the Constitution in our Senate manual, and, of course, article III in the Constitution establishes the basis for impeachment, and it is simple, direct and provides nothing of the sort that would lead Senators to believe that they can bifurcate the vote in the Senate in an impeachment trial first to findings of fact and have a majority vote on findings of fact and then to move toward a vote on the two articles of impeachment that are currently in front of the Senate.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the article, in part, by Senator BYRD says:   
   The notion of trumping the articles of impeachment with even a ``broad'' findings of fact flies in the face of what the Framers of the Constitution intended. They deliberately set the bar high when it came to the vote on articles of impeachment, first by requiring a supermajority of two-thirds of the Senate to convict, and second, by fusing the penalty--[that is] removal from office [being the penalty]--into the question of guilt. 
   In voting on articles of impeachment [he goes on to say] senators must answer not one but two questions: Is the president guilty or not guilty of committing high crimes and misdemeanors, and, if he is guilty, do his actions warrant removal from office?  
   Continuing to quote from Senator BYRD's article:  
   This was not a casual coupling on the part of the Framers. Their intent was to force senators to set aside their own passions and prejudices and focus instead on the best interests of the nation. To lift this burden from the shoulders of senators by offering them a way to convict the president without having to accept responsibility for removing him from office would, in effect, bastardize the impeachment process. 
   Moreover [he says] the aftershocks would be felt long after this impeachment has faded into history. No longer would senators be confined to the articles of impeachment formulated by the House of Representatives. No longer would senators need a two-thirds majority vote to pronounce a president guilty. From this time forward, they could cite the precedent set by the Senate in the 106th Congress as giving them carte blanche to write, and approve by a simple majority, ersatz articles of impeachment cloaked as ``findings of fact.''  
   Senator BYRD, as always, finds the bull's-eye in this debate. This is not some ordinary debate; this is a debate about constitutional requirements and responsibilities and what the provisions of the Constitution mean with respect to impeachment. 
   The impeachment article provisions of the Constitution require, when impeachment articles are voted by the U.S. House of Representatives and sent to the Senate, that a trial must commence, and the vote on the articles of impeachment would be conducted by the Senate; and two-thirds of the Senate would have to vote guilty on those articles of impeachment in order to remove a President from office. 
   But it doesn't bifurcate the vote, doesn't call for extra procedures, doesn't call for findings of fact, doesn't allow some Senators to say, ``Yes, that's what the Constitution says but we're going to create a new, or pretend there's a new, provision in the Constitution without having the difficulty of debating Madison and Mason and Hamilton and Franklin over our proposal. We'll just pretend it's in the Constitution. And we'll have separate votes on findings of fact. And in fact, doing that, we can have our own little vote and create our own little result with only 51 Members of the Senate voting in favor of our resolution.'' 
   That is a terrible idea and, in my judgment, stands this Constitution, and the article of impeachment provisions in this Constitution, on its head. But Senator BYRD says it much better than I do. I will, as I indicated, include his article at the conclusion of my remarks. 
   This Constitution, written in a room in Philadelphia over 200 years ago, is quite a remarkable document. It established the separation of powers. It established the framework for a new kind of Government that has worked remarkably well. If those who watch these proceedings and become interested in the Constitution would go to that room in Philadelphia, they would see that that room still exists. It is called the Assembly Room in Constitution Hall. 
   That room, which is smaller than the Senate Chamber, has a chair in the front of the room where George Washington sat as he presided over that Chamber. The same chair sits there today. And you will see where Mason sat, Madison, Franklin, and others who wrote this Constitution. They wrote it on a hot Philadelphia summer with the curtains drawn to keep the heat out of that room, and they created this remarkable document that is printed here in the Senate Manual. And that is the document by which we in the Senate are now conducting an impeachment trial. 
   I come to the floor today only to say that I think there is great danger in believing there are things written in this Constitution that don't exist in the Constitution. There is danger, in my judgment, in suggesting ways or mechanisms by which some can vote and create majority votes on some extraordinary findings of fact that are not provided for in this Constitution. 
   In this impeachment trial, there is one of two results, and that is a vote on the two articles of impeachment that have been sent to the U.S. Senate by the House of Representatives. That vote will be a vote cast by each and every Member of this Senate, and the vote will be either a vote to convict or a vote to acquit--guilty or not guilty on the two articles of impeachment. And my hope is that when the Senate reconvenes in the impeachment trial, all Senators will have read this rather remarkable article by the preeminent constitutional scholar in this Chamber and the historian of this U.S. Senate, the esteemed Senator BYRD.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today Senator HAGEL of Nebraska and I rise to introduce a bill to correct a fundamental flaw and inequity in the tax code that we need to fix immediately. This legislation is identical to a bill that I authored in the last Congress. 
   Too often, family farmers are not able to take full advantage of the $500,000 capital gains tax break that city folks get when they sell their homes. Today, this inequity is particularly onerous for thousands of family farmers who are being forced to sell their farms due to depressed commodity prices, crop disease and failed federal farm policies. Once family farmers have been beaten down and forced to sell the farm they've farmed for generations, they get a rude awakening. Many of them discover, as they leave the farm, that Uncle Sam is waiting for them at the end of the lane with a big tax bill. 
   One of the most popular provisions included in the major tax bill in 1997 permits families to exclude from federal income tax up to $500,000 of gain from the sale of their principal residences. That's a good deal, especially for most urban and suburban dwellers who have spent many years paying for their houses, and who regard their houses as both a home and a retirement account. For many middle income families, their home is their major financial asset, an asset the family can draw on for retirement. House prices in major growth markets such as Washington, D.C., New York, or California may start at hundreds of thousands of dollars. As a result, the urban dwellers who have owned their homes through many years of appreciation can often benefit from a large portion of this new $500,000 capital gains tax exclusion. Unfortunately this provision, as currently applied, is virtually useless to family farmers. 
   For farm families, their farm is their major financial asset. Unfortunately, family farmers under current law receive little or no benefit from the new $500,000 exclusion because the IRS separates the value of their homes from the value of the land the homes sit on. As people from my state of North Dakota  know, houses out on the farmsteads of rural America are more commonly sold for $5,000 to $40,000. Most farmers plow any profits they make into the whole farm rather than into a house that will hold little or no value when the farm is sold. It's not surprising that the IRS often judges that homes far out in the country have very little value and thus farmers receive much less benefit from this $500,000 exclusion than do their urban and suburban counterparts. As a result, the capital gains exclusion is little or no help to farmers who are being forced out of business. They may immediately face a hefty capital gains tax bill from the IRS. 
   This is simply wrong, Mr. President. It is unfair. Federal farm policy helped create the hole that many of these farmers find themselves in. Federal tax policy shouldn't dig the hole deeper as they attempt to shovel their way out. 
   The Dorgan-Hagel bill recognizes the unique character and role of our family farmers and their important contributions to our economy. It expands the $500,000 capital gains tax exclusion for sales of principal residences to cover family farmers who sell their farmhouses or surrounding farmland, so long as they are actively engaged in farming prior to the sales. In this way, farmers may get some benefit from a tax break that would otherwise be unavailable to them. 
   Our bill is not a substitute for larger policy reforms that are needed to restore the economic health of our farm communities. This tax relief measure is just one of a number of policy initiatives we can use to ease the pain for family farmers as we pursue other initiatives to help turn around the crippled farm economy. 
   Specifically, the Dorgan-Hagel bill would expand the $500,000 tax exclusion for principle residences to cover the entire farm. This provision will allow a family or individual who has actively engaged in farming prior to the farm sale to exclude the gain from the sale up to the $500,000 maximum. 
   What does this relief mean to the thousands of farmers who are being forced to sell off the farm due to current economic conditions? 
   Take, for example, a farmer who is forced to leave today because of crop disease and slumping grain prices and sells his farmstead that his family has operated for decades. If he must report a gain of $10,000 on the sale of farm house, that is all he can exclude under current law. But if, for example, he sold 1000 acres surrounding the farm house for $400,000, and the capital gain was $200,000, he would be subject to $40,000 tax on that gain. Again, our provision excludes from tax the gain on the farmhouse and land up to the $500,000 maximum that is otherwise available to a family on the sale of its residence. 
   We must wage, on every federal and state policy front, the battle to stem the loss of family farmers. Reforming tax provisions has grown increasingly important as a tool in helping our farm families deal with drought, floods, crop disease and price swings. 
   We believe that Congress should move quickly to pass this legislation and other meaningful measures to get working capital into the hands of our family farmers in the Great Plains and all across the nation. Let's stop penalizing farmers who are forced out of agriculture. Let's allow farmers to benefit from the same kind of tax exclusion that most homeowners already receive. This is the right thing to do. And it's the fair thing to do.

    Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, earlier this week, I joined the Chairman and Ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in introducing the Air Transportation Improvement Act. While I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation, I am sorry that we are in the position of introducing a bill that should have been passed last year. Due to a number of unfortunate circumstances, including the unqualified mess at the end of the 105th Congress where 8 out of the 13 appropriations bills had to be lumped into a single massive bill, the Congress failed to complete its duty to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and related programs in the regular order of doing business. As a result, the FAA and important infrastructure programs such as the Airport Improvement Programs, were only extended until the end of March 1999. Thus, we are forced to begin the new Congress by taking up last year's business. 
   The FAA bill introduced yesterday needs to be one of the first priorities of this Congress. This is the case not only because of the pressing deadline of the short term extension, but also because this legislation contains some very important policy initiatives that will inject more airline competition and improve air service to small communities. While I support the general thrust of this legislation, I still believe that we need to consider some adjustments to this legislation. In particular, I believe that the Small Community Air Service Development Program established under this legislation is too modest in size to have much of an impact. Since the deregulation of the airline industry two decades ago, hundreds of small communities have experienced service degradation and many have lost service altogether. Vast geographic regions of our country have suffered unacceptable geographic isolation as the airlines have withdrawn service in smaller communities. This trend needs the serious attention of the Congress and the Department of Transportation. 
   Thanks to the bipartisan cooperation on this legislation among the leadership of the Senate Commerce Committee, we have developed the Small Community Air Service Development Program which could go a long way to address the small community air service problems. However, the authorization level proposed in the legislation introduced yesterday does not provide adequate enough resources for this demonstration program to make much of a difference. I hope that as the Commerce Committee works on this bill that we will be able to increase the authorization levels for this important new program. 
   I also realize that there is some serious controversy surrounding some provisions in this bill. It is my hope that we will be able to reach some fair compromises over the contentious provisions and that this bill will pass the Congress in very short order. 
   I want to commend Chairman MCCAIN and Senator HOLLINGS for their leadership on this legislation. I know that there is a strong desire on both sides of the aisle to work on this legislation and pass it as soon as possible.

   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to take just a moment following the presentation by the majority leader to  say that he begins this session of Congress with a very substantial weight on his shoulders. He is a leader in a Congress that is facing a very unique challenge. I consider the majority leader a friend. I know that these are not easy times for him, and I hope that as we proceed with the important matter of impeachment that all of us in this Chamber can work together with Senator LOTT and the Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE, to see that we do the job that we are required to do by the Constitution in a thoughtful, deliberative, and bipartisan way. 
   I know there are some outside these Chambers who are worried about the Senate proceeding too quickly with the impeachment trial. Those who have had an opportunity to read two centuries of history of the U.S. Senate know that one of the last worries that one ought to entertain is that the Senate will ever move to quickly, or follow too closely.

   Mr. DORGAN. President Clinton has proposed at a meeting I was at with the bipartisan leadership of the Congress, that this is the year in which we tackle the challenges facing Social Security and Medicare. I think the Presiding Officer was at that meeting. I think there is a determination by Republicans and Democrats in Congress, by the President and Congress, that we owe it to the American people to address these entitlement questions, to make the kinds of changes that are necessary so that we can give the American people confidence that these programs will be around for a long, long while. But I do want to emphasize this challenge is born of success because people are living longer and better lives. I don't want people to come here saying these programs don't work. The Social Security program and the Medicare program have been remarkably successful. Just before the Medicare program was developed, over half of the senior citizens in America had no health care coverage at all. None. Now, 99 percent of the senior citizens in America are covered with health care. That is a dramatic difference and an improvement in the lives of tens and tens of millions of Americans. 
   Mr. President, those are some of the challenges we face. I agree with the majority leader that the sooner we get to them the better. We must discharge our responsibility first on the impeachment issues, but then we must turn to the business of this country and respond to the challenges I have just described. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I make a point of order a quorum is not present.
