Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to explain section 109 of Division C regarding the registration of container chassis. This section addresses the application of registration fees to trailers used exclusively for the purpose of transporting ocean shipping containers, which the Section refers to as `container chassis.' 
The section provides that a State, such as California, that requires annual registration and apportioned fees for container chassis may not limit the operation, or require the registration in the State, of a container chassis registered in another State, if the container chassis is operating under a trip permit issued by the non-registration State. Further, the non-registration State may not impose fines or penalties on the operation of such a container chassis for being operated in the non-registration State without a registration issued by that State. For example, the Attorney General of California or any other person in California, may not seek to impose fines or penalties from companies operating container chassis in California, when the container chassis are registered in another state such as Maine or Tennessee. 
Further, under this language, a State that requires annual registration of container chassis and apportionment of fees for such registration may not deny the use of trip permits for the operation in the State of a container chassis that is registered under the laws of another State. A trip permit provides for a daily use fee that is the prorated annual registration fees for the vehicle. Under the section, a trip permit is required only on days when the container chassis is actually operating on the State's roads and not, for example, when it remains at an ocean terminal for the entire day. 
This section also provides that a State, political subdivision or person may not, with respect to a container chassis registered in another State, impose or collect any fee, penalty, fine, or other form of damages which is based in whole or in part on the nonpayment of a State's registration related fees attributable to a container chassis operated in the State before the date of enactment of this section unless it is shown by the State, political subdivision or person that the container chassis was operated in the State without a trip permit issued by the State. 
This provision is intended to prevent the imposition of any liability on this basis for the current and past practice of many companies in the container shipping industry which register chassis in one State and operate them in another State under trip permits issued by the non-registration State. The provision is intended to ensure that past and current practices which are consistent with the objectives of this section will not be the basis for the imposition of fees, penalties, fines or other forms of damages on this segment of the Nation's intermodal transportation system. 
Using the congressional power to regulate interstate commerce, this section is intended to facilitate movement of containerized cargo in interstate commerce and to remove an unreasonable impediment to interstate commerce. It simplifies and rationalizes registration requirements for this critically important segment of the Nation's interstate intermodal transportation system. 
It is important to note that extensive discussion and consideration was given to this section. Members from the Senate Commerce Committee, Appropriations Committee, and the House Appropriations and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee worked on this language and came to the conclusion that it is necessary. It is clearly the intent of both Chambers of Congress that States, such as California and others, which want to limit the operation of chassis that are not registered in their State, are prohibited from doing so. Further, it is clearly the intent of both Chambers of Congress that States, such as California and others, are prohibited from collecting fines or penalties from companies which register chassis in another State and operate under a trip permit issued by the State where the chassis is operated.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering S. 1259, the Coast Guard Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1998, 1999, and 2000. Members of the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries have been working on this legislation for much of the past year. My substitute amendment incorporates changes made to the bill since the Commerce Committee reported it, and which enjoys strong bipartisan support. These changes are based on comments that we received from a number of senators. 
The Coast Guard is one of our nation's most important agencies. It aids people in distress, prevents injury and the loss of life, defends our oceans borders from the scourge of illegal drugs and other national security threats, maintains the safety of our waterways, and performs many other essential missions with a high degree of professionalism. My State of Maine has a 3,500 mile coastline, and the Coast Guard plays an indispensable role in the safety and economy of the many people who live along the coast. The same is true for every other coastal state in the nation. 
In 1996, we enacted the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996, which authorized the Coast Guard through fiscal year 1997. The substitute amendment before us today reauthorizes appropriations and personnel levels for the Coast Guard through fiscal year 2000. In each of fiscal years 1999 and 2000, it authorizes $100 million over the administration's fiscal year 1999 for drug interdiction activities. These increases will restore Coast Guard drug interdiction to the fiscal year 1997 level. The amendment also includes various provisions that, among other things, are designed to provide greater flexibility to the Coast Guard on personnel administration, streamline the inventory management process, eliminate an unnecessary reporting requirement, enhance the safety of marine transportation, and strengthen Coast Guard law enforcement activities. 
Several provisions of the amendment that are particularly important to people in Maine and other states deserve special mention. Section 301 requires the Coast Guard to ensure that alcohol testing of vessel crew members is conducted within 2 hours of marine accidents, unless safety considerations prevent it. This section also increases the maximum civil penalties for failure to adhere to alcohol/drug testing procedures and for operating a vessel while intoxicated. 
Section 310 requires the Coast Guard to issue a report identifying U.S. waters out to 50 miles that cannot currently be reached within 2 hours by a Coast Guard search and rescue helicopter. The report must identify options to ensure that these areas can be covered by a helicopter within 2 hours. 
Section 313 authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to establish, in consultation with the International Maritime Organization, two mandatory ship reporting systems in Cape Cod Bay and the Great South Channel (east of Cape Cod). Ships entering these areas will have to report to the Coast Guard so that the Coast Guard may track their movements and provide them with information on whale sightings. The provision is intended to protect against ship strikes of the highly endangered Northern right whale. 
Title V of the bill contains S. 1480, the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act, a bill that I have sponsored with a number of senators on both sides of the aisle. The Commerce Committee recently reported the bill with unanimous bipartisan support. It directs the administration to develop plans for dealing more effectively with harmful algal blooms like pfiesteria and hypoxia, or the dead zone, in the Gulf of Mexico. It also authorizes additional funding for NOAA's research and monitoring activities on harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. 
Mr. President, I wish to emphasize one very important point with respect to these plans in title V, particularly the plan on Northern Gulf of Mexico hypoxia. The language in its provision requires the plan to be developed in conjunction with the States. The intent of this language is to ensure that the States play a substantial and constructive role in each stage of the development of the plan, and that their concerns and recommendations will be address by the administration before a plan is completed. Finding creative and sensible solutions to the Gulf of Mexico hypoxia problem will not be possible without the advice and cooperation of the affected States. 
This bipartisan bill reflects many months of painstaking effort and compromise. It will help to ensure that the Coast Guard will be able to perform its critical missions over the next 2 years. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise because the Treasury-Postal conferees have bypassed the will of the majority and decided to kill the contraceptive coverage language in the Treasury/Postal bill. 
This is an outrage. Our contraceptive language was included in the original legislation passed both in the House and in the Senate, and conferees last week signed off on including the House language in the bill. At the same time, conferees agreed to include the Senate's provision specifically excluding coverage of abortion or abortion-related service, and conferees signed the report, closed out the conference and sent the report to the House for consideration. 
The language the House of Representatives passed by a vote of 224 to 198 on July 15, 1998. The Senate language was agreed to by unanimous consent. 
It isn't very complicated language. If you take the time to read the two versions, you will see that their intent is the same. The main difference in the two versions is the conscience clause in the Senate bill. 
In addition to listing the five plans that OPM identifies as being religious-based, it goes a step further by providing a waiver to future or existing plans that have reason to oppose contraceptive coverage because of their religious beliefs. Also the Senate language clarifies that this provision is not intended to cover abortion--and again I would note that this provision was in the conference report when it was signed the first time. 
So last week the conferees accept the language and this week it becomes a `killer provision' that would keep us from passing the Treasury/Postal appropriations bill. Mr. President that fallacious argument is belied by the fact that not one person--not one of the 435 members of the United States House of Representatives--stood up on the House floor when the rule on Treasury-Postal was debated last Thursday night and cited this provision as a reason for opposing the bill. Not one! 
Why is this a `killer amendment'? 
It can't be because of the cost. CBO won't even score the bill, because they don't score legislation that costs less than a million dollars. And they put the price tag on this language at $500,000. 
It can't be about the rights of religious plans, because this language protects the health care plans that OPM identifies as being religious-based. 
It can't be about abortion, because it does not cover abortion in any way, shape or form and it says so. 
So, why is it a `killer amendment', Mr. President? The answer to that question will remain a mystery, as it is opposed by a few people in a backroom at the expense of 1.2 million American women who are being denied affordable access to a basic health care need--contraception. These opponents lurk in the shadows, unwilling to come out in the daylight and discuss their opposition--and apparently these few make the decisions and they decided on their own that it was coming out. They have made a mockery of the democratic process. 
Let's consider the language the House and Senate agreed to. It is very simple--all this language will do is provide women who work for the federal government and the spouses and daughters of federal employees equality in health care and the affordable access to prescription contraception coverage they need and deserve; and it will help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in this country. 
The provision we are talking about requires plans that participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) that provide prescription drug coverage to also cover prescription contraceptives. What exactly is wrong with that? Nothing, according to 224 members of the United States House of Representatives. 
Today 81 percent of these plans do not cover all five of the most basic and widely used methods of contraception and 10 percent of these plans do not cover any type of contraception at all. Yet all but one of the more than 300 FEHBP plans covers sterilization. Think about that for a moment--we are willing to cover sterilization but not contraceptives. Unbelievable! 
Today, the victory may go to those who have lurked in the shadows, but I have something to say to those few. Do not let yourselves believe that you have had the final word on this issue because the women of America will not `go quietly into that good night' on an issue as basic to their health and well being and that of their family as contraceptive coverage. 
It took us 72 years to get the vote and it wasn't until 1978--only 20 years ago--that Congress finally passed legislation requiring health care plans to cover maternity leave. This is not an issue that will go away, Mr. President. You can rest assured that we will be back next year, and the year after that and as many votes and debates as it takes until we win.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to address a serious health concern for veterans infected with the hepatitis C virus. This legislation would make hepatitis C a service-connected condition so that veterans suffering from this virus can be treated by the VA. 
Specifically, the bill will establish a presumption of service connection for veterans with hepatitis C, meaning that we will assume that this condition was incurred or aggravated in military service, even if there is no record of evidence that the condition existed during the actual period of service, provided that certain conditions are met. 
Under this legislation, veterans who received a transfusion of blood during a period of service before December 31, 1992; veterans who were exposed to blood during a period of service; veterans who underwent hemodyalisis during a period of service; veterans diagnosed with unexplained liver disease during a period of service; veterans with an unexplained liver dysfunction value or test; or veterans working in a health care occupation during service, will be eligible for treatment for this condition at VA facilities. 
I am introducing this legislation today because of medical research that suggests many veterans were exposed to hepatitis C in service and are now suffering from liver and other diseases caused by exposure to the virus. 
I am troubled that many `hepatitis C veterans' are not being treated by the VA because they can't prove the virus was service connected, despite that fact that hepatitis C was little known and could not be tested for until recently. 
Mr. President, we are learning that those who served in Vietnam and other conflicts, tend to have higher than average rates of hepatitis C. In fact, VA data shows that 20 percent of its inpatient population is infected with the hepatitis C virus, and some studies have found that 10 percent of otherwise healthy Vietnam veterans are hepatitis C positive. 
Although hepatitis C is a very serious infection, it was actually unknown until recently. Hepatitis C was not isolated until 1989, and the test for the virus has only been available since 1990. Hepatitis C is a hidden infection with few symptoms. However, most of those infected with the virus will develop serious liver disease 10 to 30 years after contracting it. For many of those infected, hepatitis C leads to liver failure, transplants, liver cancer, and ultimately death. 
And yet, most people who have hepatitis C don't even know it and often do not get treatment until it's too late. Only five percent of the estimated four million Americans with hepatitis C know they have it, but with new treatments, some estimates indicate that 50 percent can have the virus eradicated. 
Vietnam Veterans in particular are just now starting to show up with liver disease caused by hepatitis C. And detection and treatment now may help head off serious liver disease for many of them. However, many veterans with hepatitis C will not be treated by the VA because they cannot establish a service connection for their condition in spite of the fact that we now know that many Vietnam-era and other veterans got this disease serving their country. 
Many of my colleagues may be interested to know how veterans likely were exposed to this virus. Many veterans received blood transfusions while in Vietnam. This is one of the most common ways hepatitis C is transmitted. Medical transmission of the virus through needles and other medical equipment is possible in combat. And Medical care providers in the services were likely at increased risk, and may have, in turn, posed a risk to the service members they treated. 
Researchers have discovered that hepatitis C was widespread in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam war, and that some blood sent from the U.S. was also infected with the virus. Researchers and veterans organizations, including the Vietnam Veterans of America, with whom I worked to prepare this legislation, believe that many veterans were infected after being injured in combat and getting a transfusion or from working as a medic around combat injuries. 
Yet, veterans cannot establish a service connection because frequently there were no symptoms when they were infected in Vietnam. In addition, while medical records may show a short bout of hepatitis, hepatitis C was not known then and there was no testing to detect the hepatitis C infection at discharge. 
The hepatitis C infected veterans are essentially in a catch 22: the VA is reluctant to depart from their routine service connection requirements and veterans cannot prove that they contracted hepatitis 
C in combat because the science to detect it did not exist during the period of service. Without congressional authority in the form of legislation providing for presumptive service connection, thousands of Vietnam vets infected with hepatitis C in service will not get VA health care testing or treatment. I believe the government will actually save money in the long run by testing and treating this infection early on. The alternative is much more costly treatment of end-stage liver disease and the associated complications, or other disorders. 
I would like to describe some of the research that has led me to the conclusion that hepatitis C may be service connected in many veterans. A number of studies have established a link between hepatitis C in veterans and high risk factors for hepatitis C that are unique to combat or are highly prevalent in combat situations. 
A study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology in 1980 found that veterans have a higher incidence of hepatitis C compared to non-veterans. The study of veterans receiving liver transplants at the Nashville, Tennessee VA medical center, which was conducted by researchers at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, found that there `was a significantly greater incidence of hepatitis C . . . in veterans compared with non-VA patients.' The study claims to confirm that `veteran patients have a higher incidence of hepatitis C. . .' 
A study published in Cancer in 1989 found that veterans have increased risk of liver cancer as compared to non-veterans. The study found that there was a 50 percent increase in the rate of liver cancer among male veterans using VA medical systems from 1970 to 1982. 
A study published in Military Medicine in 1997 found that from 1991 to 1994, the number of veterans diagnosed with hepatitis C increased significantly from 6,612 in 1991 to 18,854 in 1994, which is an increase of more than 285 percent. The study notes that `total patients seen nationally . . . increased by only 4.87 percent during the same period.' Therefore, this increase cannot be explained by increased in workload. Over the subsequent year, this increased to 21,400 (in 1996), and has since continued to increase. 
Some will argue that further epidemiologic data is needed to resolve or prove the issue of service connection. I agree that we have our work cut out for us, and further study is required. However, while the research being done is providing more and more data on the relationship between military service and hepatitis C, we should not force those who fought for our country to wait for the treatment they deserve. 
It should be noted that some progress has been made in recent years in the effort to address this health concern. This is not a new issue. 
The VA has done some screening and testing for hepatitis C in veterans. VA Under Secretary for Health, Ken Kizer, issued a directive that all VA medical centers should test veterans for hepatitis C if they fall into certain risk categories. However, I understand that medical centers are not complying with this directive uniformly. In addition, there is no mention of treatment in the Kizer directive. Therefore, if the virus is detected, the VA does not necessarily treat it. 
I would also note that the FY98 VA-HUD Appropriations report contains the following language: `The Committee is concerned that the rates of serious liver disease, liver cancer and liver transplants related to hepatitis C infection are expected to rise rapidly among veterans populations over the next decade. Veterans health care facilities will bear a large part of the treatment cost. Those costs can be reduced with early screening and treatment of veterans infected with hepatitis C. Therefore, the Committee directs the Department to determine rates of hepatitis C infection among veterans receiving health services from the VA and to establish a protocol for screening new entrants to the VA health care system. The Committee also directs the Department to provide counseling and access to treatment for veterans who test positive for hepatitis C. The Department should pay special attention to rates of hepatitis C among veterans of Vietnam and more recent deployments.' 
Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, well respected both within and outside of the medical profession, has said, `In some studies of veterans entering the Department of Veterans Affairs health facilities, half of the veterans have tested positive for HCV. Some of these veterans may have left the military with HCV infection, while others may have developed it after their military service. In any event, we need to detect and treat HCV infection if we are to head off very high rates of liver disease and liver transplant in VA facilities over the next decade. I believe this effort should include HCV testing as part of the discharge physical in the military, and entrance screening for veterans entering the VA health system.' 
The VA requires that a veteran demonstrate onset during service or within requisite presumptive periods with chronic residuals of a disease or injury that had its onset during active military service. How does a veteran prove service connection under these criteria for a condition that did not even have a name until 10 years ago. 
Veterans have already fought their share of battles--these men and women who sacrificed in war so that others could live in peace shouldn't have to fight again for the benefits and respect they have earned. 
In closing, let me say that we are just now beginning to learn the full extent of this emerging health threat to veterans and the general population. We still have a long way to go before we know how best to confront this deadly virus. A comprehensive policy to confront such a monumental challenge can not written overnight. It will require the long-term commitment of Congress and the Administration to a serious 
effort to address this health concern. 
I hope this legislation will be a constructive step in this effort, and I look forward to working with the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the VA-HUD appropriators, Vietnam Veterans of America, and others to meet this emerging challenge.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to create an Advisory Committee for the National Museum of Women's History. And I am pleased to be joined by 20 of my colleagues: Senators Mikulski, Collins, Dodd, Jeffords, Rockefeller, D'Amato, Hutchison, Kerrey (NB), Lieberman, Moseley-Braun, Murray, Reid, Torricelli, Durbin, Sarbanes, Kerry (MA), Lautenberg, Boxer, Inouye, and Leahy. 
For far too long, women have contributed to history, but seem to have largely been forgotten in our history books, as well as our monuments and museums. It is long past time that the roles women have played be removed from the shadows of indifference and given a place where they can shine. 
The bill we are introducing today will create a 26 member Advisory Committee will look at the following three issues and report back to Congress on (1) identifying a site for the museum in the District of Columbia; (2) developing a business plan to allow the creation and maintenance of the museum to be done solely with private contributions and (3) assistance with the collection and program of the museum. 
It is important to note that this bill does not commit Congress to spending any money for this museum. The Committee's report will tell us the feasibility of funding the museum privately. And I believe that the Museum's Board has shown that they have the ability to do just that. 
The concept for the National Museum of Women's History (NMWH) was created back in 1996. Since that time, the Board of Directors, lead by President Karen Staser, has worked tirelessly to build support and interest for this project. And judging by the fact that they have raised close to $10 million for the project, lent their support to the moving of the Suffragette statute from the crypt to the Rotunda, and raised $85,000 for that effort, I'd say they are well on their way to success. 
In fact, just this summer they donated a bust of Sojourner Truth that was unveiled during the 150th anniversary of the Suffragette movement. And on September 28 they opened their `cyber museum' to the computer-going public (www.nmwh.org), which will serve as the Museum's `home' until there is a building. To steal a line from a song, these sisters are truly `doing it for themselves'! 
They have also spent a lot of time answering the question `why do we need a women's museum when we have the Smithsonian.' The first answer to that comes from Edith Mayo, Curator Emeritus of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, who notes that since 1963 only two exhibits--two--were dedicated to the role of women in history. 
Is it any wonder, then, that Congress got in the habit of designating March as National Women's History Month? The fact is, in the story of America's success, the chapter on women's contributions has largely been left on the editing room floor. 
Here's what I mean: We all know that John Glenn, the distinguished Senator from the State of Ohio, was the first American to orbit the earth on board Friendship 7 in 1962--and we wish him godspeed as he embarks on his second journey into space at the end of this month. But how many people know that Margaret Reha Seddon was the first U.S. woman to achieve the full rank of astronaut, and flew her first space mission aboard the Space Shuttle `Discovery' in 1985, twenty three years after Senator Glenn's historic flight? 
And I can guarantee you more people know the last person to hit over .400 in baseball--Ted Williams--than can name the first woman elected to Congress--Jeannette Rankin of Montana, who was elected in 1916, four years before ratification of the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote. And how many people can tell you that, in 1924 Nellie Ross of Wyoming was the first woman elected governor of a state? Or that it wasn't until 1974 --50 years later--that the first woman governor was elected in her own right: Connecticut's Ella Grasso? 
History is filled with such little known but important milestones: like the first woman elected to the United States Senate was Hattie Wyatt Caraway from Louisiana in 1932. That Maine's own Margaret Chase Smith was the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate in her own right in 1948, and in 1962 became the first woman to run for the U.S. Presidency in the primaries of a major political party. Or that the first female cabinet member was Frances Perkins, who was Secretary of Labor for FDR. 
Hardly household names. But they should be. And with a place to showcase their accomplishments, perhaps one day they will take their rightful place beside America's greatest minds, visionary leaders, and groundbreaking figures. 
But until then, we have a long way to go. Many of us know that women fought and got the vote in 1920, with the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. But how many know that Wyoming gave women the right to vote in 1869, 51 years earlier, and that by 1900 Utah, Colorado and Idaho had granted women the right to vote? Or that the suffragette movement took 72 years to meet its goal? And few know that the women of Utah sewed dresses made from silk for the Suffragettes on their cross country tour. 
Rosie the Riverter was the name given to the hundreds of thousands of women who entered the workforce to help the war effort during World War II on the home front. But our history books don't discuss Jacquline Cochran and Nancy Harkness Love. 
Jackie was a pilot who went to Great Britain with 21 other women and ferried planes. In fact, she created quite a stir when she ferried a new bomber from Canada to England on the trip overseas. 
Nancy created a ferrying program in Connecticut, known as the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron, which also ferried planes in the states. They made an important contribution to our war effort, yet both of them have `flown under the radar screen' of history for far too many years. 
We now have two women on the Supreme Court; Sandra Day O'Conner appointed in 1981, and Ruth Bader Ginsberg who joined her in 1993. But what we never learned is that in 1870, Iowa became the first state to admit a woman to the bar: Arabella Mansfield. Or that the first woman was allowed to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1879, and her name was Belva Lockwood. 
Whatever period of history you chose--women played a role. Sybil Ludington, a 16 year old, rode through parts of New York and Connecticut in April of 1777 to warn that the Redcoats were coming. Sacajawea, the Shoshone Indian guide, helped escort Lewis and Clark on their 8000 mile expedition. Rosa Parks, Jo Ann Robinson and Myrlie Evers played important roles in the civil rights movement in the 50's and 60's. And as we move into the 21st century, the role of women--who now make up 52 percent of the population--will continue to be integral to the future success of this country. 
In fact the real question about the building of a women's museum is not so much where it will be built--although that remains to be explored. And it's not even who will pay for it--as I've said, it will be done entirely with private funds. The real question when it comes to a museum dedicated to women's history is, where will they put it all! 
I would argue that we have a solemn responsibility to teach our children, and ourselves, about our rich past--and that includes the myriad contributions of women, in all fields and every endeavor. These women can serve as role models and inspire our youth. They can teach us about our past and guide us into our future. They can even prompt young women to consider a career in public service--as Senator Smith of Maine did for me. 
Instead, today in America, more young women probably know the names of the latest super models then the names of the female members of this Administration's Cabinet. That is why we need a National Museum of Women's History, that is why I am proud to sponsor this legislation, and that is why I hope that my colleagues will join us in supporting the creation of this Advisory Committee as a first step toward writing the forgotten chapters of the history of our nation.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, on Wednesday there will be a period of morning business until 10 a.m. Following morning business, under a previous order the Senate will proceed to two stacked rollcall votes. The first vote will be on the adoption of the motion to proceed to H.R. 10, the financial services reform bill. The second vote will be on the motion to invoke cloture on S. 442, the Internet tax bill. Assuming cloture is invoked, the Senate will remain on the Internet tax bill with amendments being offered and debated throughout Wednesday's session. 
In addition to the Internet tax bill, the Senate may also consider any available appropriations conference reports, executive nominations, or any other legislative items cleared for action. The leader would like to remind all Members that there are only a few days left in which to consider remaining appropriations bills and other important legislation. Members are encouraged to plan their schedules accordingly to accommodate a busy week with votes occurring early in the morning and extending late into the evening.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, because I believe it is unnecessary and could prove detrimental to mail order companies. 
For these reasons, I urge that my colleagues reject this amendment, just as they rejected it at the start of the 104th Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 73 to 25. 
Mr. President, I do not believe that the bill currently before us--the Internet Tax Freedom Bill--is the appropriate place for the Senate to consider the imposition of new taxes. This amendment contains major compliance and tax issues that should be properly considered and reported from the Finance Committee before being brought to a vote on the floor. 
In addition, my strong opposition to this amendment stems from my belief that this measure will be detrimental to the mail-order industry nationally, as well as posing a stark threat to a company whose quality craftsmanship, durable outdoor products, and legendary commitment to excellence has made it the pride of my home state of Maine--L.L. Bean of Freeport. 
L.L. Bean was established 86 years ago as a small, Maine-based store catering to the surrounding community and a limited number of mail-order customers. In 1912, who would have guessed that someday L.L. Bean would rise to become one of the premier international manufacturers and marketers of outdoor gear and other goods? But by focusing on unquestioning customer satisfaction and unparalleled quality products, L.L. Bean succeeded in bringing to our state and the local community many jobs and much pride. 
In Freeport alone, 4,000 people are employed by L.L. Bean full-time while over 11,000 are employed part-time during the Christmas holidays, making it the third largest employer in the State of Maine. At the same time, L.L. Bean's retail store brings to Freeport and its surrounding communities 4 million customers every year, and attracts an additional 4 million catalog customers annually--a powerful generator of tourism and business for the entire state. 
Mr. President, the amendment offered by my colleague, Senator Bumpers, would threaten the present and future job prospects of Freeport's residents needlessly, as well as any other community that employs individuals in the mail-order industry. 
And even as this amendment would prove harmful in Maine and across the nation, the irony is that this amendment is not even necessary to accomplish the goal being sought by my friend from Arkansas. 
Specifically, states already have the ability to collect sales taxes, just as Maine has demonstrated, and can easily collect these taxes through the voluntary income tax. 
In Maine, taxpayers are given the option on their personal income tax form of either stating the actual amount of sales tax due for out-of-state purchases in a given year, or entering a flat tax amount based on a percentage of the taxpayer's income. 
The bottom line is that states have the ability to collect these taxes--they do not need Federal legislation to do so. 
Mr. President, the State of Maine has proven that the legislation being proposed by the Senator from Arkansas is not necessary. I urge my colleagues join me in opposing this proposal, just as they opposed it four years ago. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the fiscal year 1999 Defense authorization conference report. 
This bill emerges in the turmoil of a post-cold-war world--one demanding a U.S. military that can face transnational developments such as weapons proliferation, regional tyrants such as Saddam Hussein, and emerging powers such as China. 
As a result, the authorization cycle of the last few months allowed Congress to bring the Pentagon's budget into alignment with the changing Armed Services on which the nation will rely to deter a broad and unpredictable spectrum of global threats to U.S. national security. 
The conference report emphasizes a type of warfare that will loom large in future defense planning: littoral operations near coastal plains. Accordingly to the Navy's official definition, littoral engagements require forces to maneuver `close enough to influence events on shore if necessary.' 
This post-Soviet mission connects our force structure to our security interests since 80 percent of the world's population lives near the shorelines and waterways that open into the littorals. 
The priorities established by the conference report demonstrate how littoral concepts have started to displace more conventional ideas of weapons development. 
Major research and modernization programs, for example, share the common goal of delivering increased firepower, speed, and precision at a lower cost. 
Ship and aircraft architectures have sacrificed the hard angles prone to enemy detection in favor of modular composite materials that leave smaller signatures on a radar screen. 
Smaller crews will maintain more advanced command an control systems configured for instant data transmission. 
And self-guided missiles now assume the targeting role that concentrated divisions of heavy armor had to bear in the past. 
In addition to high technology hardware, Mr. President, efficient training programs remain critical to the evolution of the military. I am therefore pleased that the bill allows the Armed Services to manage their gender-integrated training policies as commanders and instructors have designed them. 
The new international security environment gives us new guidelines to measure the readiness of the Total Force. Active duty men and women must subsequently continue to train as they will deploy to accomplish the gender-neutral task of supporting our war fighters. 
Common sense means that recruits destined to repair fighter-bombers, frigates, submarines, and missile launch tubes should train the same way, under the same standards, and at the same time. 
Common sense means that radar operators, quality assurance engineers, and military police should follow universal rules of engagement for males and females who wear identical uniforms. 
Yet we would suspend our common sense by pretending that the solution to workplace harassment means the segregation of enlistees into isolated training components. 
We have to move beyond the charge that integrated training fosters sexual misconduct to ask how the men and women of the All-Volunteer Force can each play a decisive role in support of combat readiness. 
It is for this core mission purpose, rather than the testing of social policy theories, that the armed services unite men and women to acquire the skills expected of all soldiers. 
Gender-integrated training maximizes the return on the taxpayers' defense investment in making all service members accountable for a range of logistical, medical, and technical jobs that sharpen the ability of the Defense Department to protect both our homeland and the country's core interests abroad. 
Finally, Mr. President, both the House and Senate defense authorizing committees struggled this spring with the nation's incoherent contingency operations policy. By the end of the coming fiscal year, the taxpayers will have devoted $9.4 billion to the maintenance of our Bosnia mission since the conclusion of the Dayton peace agreement in November 1995. 
But the administration has requested this enormous sum of money in a vacuum of silence about our strategic purpose and an aura of deception about the length of our commitment. 
Officials perpetuate their failure of leadership with the assumption that Congress supports the Bosnia deployments simply by funding them. This assessment, however, only uncovers the cynicism of the administration's foreign policy. 
Neither the House nor the Senate, as the President knows, would intentionally place our overseas forces in a position of jeopardy by depriving them of money for daily operations and self-protection. 
At the same time, the Pentagon cannot continue to hold the safety of our troops hostage to unjustified budget requests for keeping between 6,000 and 8,000 military personnel in a country struggling to restore its political institutions. 
The confusion underpinning U.S. policies toward Bosnia led Senator Cleland and I to draft an amendment requiring the submission of statutory reports to Congress on the purpose and potential endpoint of military contingency operations involving more than 500 people in uniform. The reports must accompany all budget requests made for such operations. 
Our amendment, including in the Senate's version of the bill and approved by the authorization conferees, reflects the lessons that the Bosnia experience teaches us about the interaction between the executive and legislative branches on the Defense Department's non-wartime deployments. 
Congress must insist on a regular process under which we can match the administration's own peacekeeping policy arguments with its ongoing budget demands. 
We need to determine more definitively if the Pentagon has a contingency operations strategy that advances the security interests of the United States rather than the false hope of relying on our military presence to solve the domestic political, economic, and cultural problems of other nations. 
The Snowe-Cleland amendment, I believe, will equip Congress with the tools necessary to exercise aggressive oversight of the administration's peacekeeping initiatives. 
The fiscal year 1999 Defense authorization conference report, Mr. President, foreshadows both the challenges and the phenomenal capabilities that the Armed Forces will manage in the new century. I, therefore, urge the Senate to uphold its tradition of bipartisan support for the military by adopting this responsible legislation.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the Wendell H. Ford National Air Transportation Improvement Act of 1998. As a member of the Commerce Aviation Subcommittee, it has been my privilege to work with Senator Ford on this and other bills to improve the quality and safety of air transportation in this country, and I believe it is a fitting tribute that we name this bill in his honor. 
I appreciate the assistance I received from the Senator from Kentucky and from my good friend, the Chairman, Senator McCain, in adding three amendments to this bill which I believe will help improve safety, quality and access. 
I will vote for this bill because on the whole, it will benefit our airports and air travelers. But I do want to make it clear that I do not support sections 606 and 607. These sections will be detrimental to commercial air service to Maine and the other markets within the perimeter rule. While I will not be offering an amendment to strike these two sections, I would encourage the conferees to seriously consider the detrimental effects these sections will have on air service. 
Section 606 will negatively alter the perimeter rule at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in a way that jeopardizes air service to Maine. It is my opinion that expanding the number of slots would clearly result in more negatives than positives. 
Due to the current Federal Aviation Administration guidelines on the distance required between aircraft, adding flights at National airport will require air traffic controllers to chose between staying on schedule or sacrificing safety. 
If more flights are added through the creation of these new slots in Section 606, the controller will have to place these flights more closely together in order to prevent delays in arrivals and departures. By decreasing the spacing of the flights in and out of Reagan National, it will create an unsafe situation by subjecting the flights to the jet wash, or turbulence, of flights in front of them. Such exposure to the jet wash, especially at take-off creates a terrible safety situation. One which will jeopardize lives of the traveling public. 
I am also concerned about the way that section 606 distributes the new slots are distributed. Specifically, the section gives priority consideration to air carriers who have already had slots withdrawn from them. This will result in the majority of new slots to go to one dominate carrier and further increase already overpriced business airfares. Further, this language will overturn a March 1998, Department of Transportation decision concerning the distribution of slots. 
I would also like to note my opposition to section 607, which modifies the perimeter rule. It is well established that the perimeter rule maintains a delicate balance between National Airport and Dulles International Airport. Under the perimeter rule, Dulles has flourished as an international gateway, and National has provided regional service to states such as Maine. 
I believe that in the long run, violating the perimeter rule will hurt travelers from Maine. Eroding the perimeter rule will bring long-haul flights to National--short haul flights, in turn, will be rerouted to Dulles or eliminated altogether. Ironically, violating the perimeter rule would also hurt those underserved communities the legislation is designed to assist. Modifying the perimeter rule could encourage airlines at National to substitute long-haul flights for existing service to smaller communities within the perimeter. 
I believe that the amendment offered by the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Robb, which I have cosponsored, will mitigate some of the potential impact of modifying the perimeter rule by making it incumbent on the Secretary of Transportation to ensure that these changes will not reduce travel options for communities served by small and medium sized airports within the perimeter and not result in meaningful increases in travel delays. 
I also would want to note the Dorgan-Snowe amendment that was adopted and to thank the Chairman and Ranking member for their helping in working through the language. The Dorgan-Snowe amendment would facilitate air service to under-served communities and encourage airline competition through non-discriminatory interconnection requirements by permitting the Secretary of Transportation to require major carriers to enter into agreements with new entrant air carriers which serve rural or underserved markets. 
This amendment will give the Secretary of Transportation the authority to require an air carrier that serves an essential airport facility, such as a major hub, and has an exclusive--almost monopolistic--agreement with another airline which serves an under-served market to enter into a joint fare or interline agreement with a new air carrier, trying to enter the underserved market so that the people living in the rural or underserved area will have a competitive alternative and not be beholden to one airline. 
This would allow a new airline to fly from a rural or underserved market to a hub airport which is dominated by a major carrier and permit the traveler to continue to another market on the megacarrier without having to purchase a second ticket or worrying if their bags will be transferred to the megacarrier. 
I want to make it perfectly clear. States which are primarily rural or have a large number of underserved markets will benefit from this amendment. Opponents of this amendment argue that this is re-regulation. Nothing is further from the truth. Senator Dorgan and I are establishing a mechanism which will allow new entrant carriers to be able to compete with the mega air carriers. Only if the Secretary believes that underserved markets will benefit and that competition will result, will an interline agreement be sanctioned. 
It is interesting to note that when the commercial air carrier industry was deregulated, there were 19 domestic trunk-line and local service carriers. Of those 19, only 5 (American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, and United) airlines are still in existence. At the time of deregulation, eight of the 15 airlines controlled 80% of the market share. Today, the seven largest carriers control more than 90% of the market. 
Some say that this is positive result of deregulation, claiming that deregulation was designed to promote a `survival of the fittest' type industry and promote profitability. Unfortunately, deregulation has actually hurt the vast majority of communities in the United States and the passengers who travel from small and medium sized markets. According to a Government Accounting Office report, the full benefits of deregulation have yet to be realized because of problems with entering the markets dominated by a major airline. 
As a result of deregulation, consumers are actually paying far more for air travel. In fact, a doubling of an airline's market share on a particular route translates into a price increase of almost nine percent. Today, as a result of the lack of competition at small and medium sized markets, it is cheaper to fly from Washington, D.C. to Mexico City on an unrestricted ticket than it is to fly from Washington to Portland, Maine. 
Our amendment would require carriers who enter into interline and joint fare agreements with other carriers, like those which have already been proposed and implemented on a limited basis by the megacarriers, to provide these agreements on a non-discriminatory basis to carriers seeking to provide service between an underserved market and a large hub airport in which one carrier has market dominance. 
Open access like that proposed in this amendment is nothing new. In fact Congress, just two and one-half years ago, approved legislation with similar requirements. When Congress de-regulated the telecommunications industry, the fundamental element to promote competition in that legislation was the requirement that the incumbent carriers would be required, by law, to allow their competitors to interconnect into their network. 
In a situation analogous to the telecommunications market, in order to develop competition in the local market, we must impose, by law, the requirement that the dominant megacarriers, allow its competitors to interconnect into their networks. By adopting this amendment, new entrant carriers will be allowed to interconnect into the flight network of a major carrier which dominates a hub airport. In light of what has been required of other industries under the goal of promoting competition, this amendment makes sense if one wants to see a competitive airline industry. 
The only way to allow for competition in this environment is to impose conditions on the major carriers to cooperate with their competitors. Interline and joint fares are necessary to ensure that the dominant carriers will not kill potential competitors. 
Through the adoption of this amendment, much like the principle underlying the local competition in the telecommunications industry, we will be able to provide more choices, lower costs, and better service to the majority of markets across the country.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman, Senator McCain, and the ranking member, Senator Ford, for their assistance with my three amendments. 
One way that the FAA reauthorization bill will improve the nation's air service is through the new Community Carrier Air Service Program. This program will provide assistance to communities so that underserved markets can attract carriers. 
The Secretary of Transportation will select communities to participate in this program based on geographic diversity and other unique circumstances that presently hinder communities from attracting adequate air service. It is important to note that the intent of this language is to ensure that participation in the program will promote the development of a national air transportation system. And my amendment will ensure that it involves the Transportation must ensure this diversity so that every region of the nation can benefit from the program. 
An important provision for Maine's pilots is included in my amendment on the ASOS program. This amendment requires that the Federal Aviation Administration retain human observers at the automated surface transportation system stations which have had a high rate of reporting error. The language in the amendment requires the FAA to correct the problems and notify Congress that the problems have been solved before it can remove a human observer from an ASOS station. 
ASOS is an automatic weather observance system which uses electronic sensors, computers and display units to detect weather. It is fully automated and computerized and is intended to replace human observers of on-the-ground weather conditions in specific locales. Information from ASOS sensors are transmitted to a computer, and users, like pilots, can call a special phone number or tune into a special radio frequency to obtain information. 
ASOS is intended to make weather information collection and 
dissemination more cost-effective by replacing the human element with electronics. The problem is that in the northern tier states, such as Maine, the ASOS system has problems discerning certain weather conditions. For example, sleet falls faster than snow so ASOS records it as rain and recently heavy smoke from Canadian forest fires caused the ASOS at the Houlton airport to report heavy fog at the airport. Needless to say, flying through fog is very different than flying through smoke. This is a very serious matter and could result in life threatening problems if a pilot does not have the proper weather information. 
The ASOS systems in Maine have been very unreliable. The station in Houlton recorded more than 1,400 mistakes in one year. A letter from the FAA dated May 26, 1998, to you admits the problems with the system. 
My third amendment increases fines for those airlines which chose to discriminate against the handicapped. Although the airlines have been working to improve their treatment of the handicapped, there have been some incidents which warrant a sizable fine by the Department of Transportation. 
For example, one of my constituents, Ms. Alice Conway, of Portland, Maine was returning from Mexico in 1994 after attending a disabilities related conference. Her story is a very unfortunate one and clearly illustrates the need for penalties which will deter such treatment by the airlines and their employees. 
The problem began for Alice in Mexico City. There a mechanical problem forced a 45 minute delay in departure. While other passengers were able to exit the plane, nobody offered to help Ms. Conway off the plane. After the flight finally got underway, Ms. Conway, who is paraplegic, asked to use the aisle chair in order to visit the restroom. Ms. Conway was denied access to the restroom because the chair had been forgotten. 
At one point of the flight, the plane landed in Indianapolis. On the ground there, the flight attendants refused to bring her a chair and denied her any assistance which would have allowed her to visit the restroom. As the flight traveled to Chicago, she asked is she could scoot along the aisle of the aircraft to get to the restroom, a flight attendant told her that sitting in the aisle was illegal and if she did so, she would be arrested when they landed. 
Finally, after seven hours of travel, an attendant gave her a blanket and a bottle so that she could empty her colostomy pouch while sitting in her seat. 
She had to empty her colostomy pouch in her seat! 
How can any of us condone such behavior? Thankfully, this bill contains language that will create stiff penalties for those who violate the law. 
Again, I thank the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Kentucky and their staff for their assistance in coming to agreement on these three amendments.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this attempt to override the President's veto of H.R. 1122, the so-called `Partial Birth' Abortion Ban Act of 1997. 
Mr. President, let it be clear that this legislation puts women's lives and health on the line. If we vote today to override the President's veto we will bear the burden of putting women's lives and health at risk by substituting the judgement of politicians for the judgement of medical doctors. And that just isn't right. 
Twenty-two years ago, the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision in Roe versus Wade that held that women have a constitutional right to an abortion, but after viability, states could ban abortions--as long as they allowed exceptions for cases in which a woman's life or health is endangered. 
H.R. 1122 is in direct violation of the Court's ruling. It contains no exception for the health of the mother, and therefore represents a direct, frontal assault not only on Roe, but on the health and reproductive rights of women everywhere. 
It should be no surprise, then, that similar efforts around the country to ban the so-called `partial birth' abortion procedure have not stood up to constitutional muster. 
In fact, legal challenges have been mounted in 20 of the 28 states that have passed these laws. Nineteen out of twenty states have had their laws enjoined or severely limited. Seventeen courts have issued temporary or permanent injunctions stopping laws from taking effect. And one attorney general has limited enforcement of the law. 
And I want to be just as clear that innocent women will suffer if we vote to override the President's veto. It is not simply the Constitution which demands a health exception be included in any such legislation--it is compassion for the lives of our nation's women. 
There is no question that any abortion is an emotional, wrenching decision for a woman. No one would debate this. And when a woman must confront this decision during the later stages of a pregnancy because she knows that the pregnancy presents a direct threat to her own life or health, the ramifications of such a decision multiply dramatically. 
So, too, is it beyond debate that all of us want to see the instances of abortions reduced in America. Unfortunately, contrary to what proponents of this legislation believe, H.R. 1122 will not bring us closer to this goal. In contrast, it will force women and physicians to choose another, less safe and potentially life threatening procedure. Is that what we really want? To put women's lives and health at risk? 
Because that is exactly what H.R. 1122 will do. It will put women at unacceptable risk, while in turn doing absolutely nothing to lower the number of abortions in this country. 
I suggest that there is a better way. I suggest we are not stuck with an all-or-nothing approach, even on this most contentious of issues. 
That is why last year, I supported an amendment which would have decreased the number of abortions in this country without putting the lives and health of women on the line. 
This substitute would have ensured that no abortion will take place after viability unless it is absolutely necessary to avoid grieve physical injury to a woman, while protecting women's lives and health. And most of all, unlike the underlying bill, it would have reduced the number of abortions in this country. 
Critics of this proposal, unfortunately, believed that this language contains a loophole because it leaves it to the doctor to determine when the fetus is viable. 
I find this viewpoint curious on two fronts. First, it begs the question, why did H.R. 1122 proponents trust doctors to determine when an abortion is necessary to protect a woman's life, when they do not trust doctors to determine when a woman faces a grievous health risk or when the fetus is viable? 
And second, who is in a better position than doctors to determine when the fetus is viable? Are opponents honestly suggesting the federal government has the answer to that question? 
The Supreme Court has said in Planned Parenthood versus Danforth, and I quote `the time when viability is achieved may vary with each pregnancy, and the determination of whether a particular fetus is viable, is, and must be, a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending physician.' 
It comes down to who should be making these decision. Will it be politicians, whose extent of medical knowledge may be little more than what they see on `E.R.'? Or will it be physicians, who live `E.R.'? 
The substitute language we championed would have required that a doctor certify that a post-viability abortion is necessary to protect a woman from grievous injury. Any doctor who violated this requirement would not only have faced still civil penalties, but will risk having his or her medical license revoked. 
Curiously, H.R. 1122 does not require a doctor to certify that this procedure is necessary to protect a woman's life. For this reason, it appears far easier for a doctor to falsify information under the underlying bill, because there is no certification requirement. 
Mr. President, what the vast majority of American people really want from their leaders on this issue is an answer to the problem of late term abortions, not a ban one procedure which will only force women to and doctors to choose other less safe procedures. 
Because, despite the terrible conflict over H.R. 1122, there is one area where almost all Americans agree: That no viable fetus should be aborted--by any methods--unless it is absolutely necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. 
By coming together on this issue, we can bridge the chasm that has developed in this debate. And despite the fact that the substitute amendment failed in this body last year, I still strongly believe this is the right course to take. 
Forty-one States, including my home State of Maine, already ban post-viability abortions. We need to ensure that healthy pregnancies are never terminated after a fetus is viable, regardless of the procedure used. We also need to ensure that any such measure is in keeping with the Constitution and the best interests of the life and health of women. 
These are not mutually exclusive goals. This is not a gulf that can never be crossed. And this is an issue that is not going to go away. 
That is why we are coming back this year, and renewing our effort to ban all abortions after viability. On Wednesday, Senator Durbin and I, along with Senators Collins, Mikulski, Landrieu, Lieberman, Graham, and Torricelli introduced a bipartisan measure, the Late-Term Abortion Limitation Act, because we believe this can and will solve the problem of late term abortions. 
While the Durbin-Snowe legislation is similar to last year's substitute, it states that, prior to an abortion, both the performing physician and an independent physician certify in writing that, in their medical judgment, the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health. With the opinion required from another doctor, this will ensure that the abortion was absolutely medically necessary. 
And finally, let me be clear that the health exception for `grievous physical injury' could only be invoked under two circumstances. 
The first involves those heart-wrenching cases where a wanted pregnancy seriously threatens the health of the mother. The Durbin-Snowe language would allow a doctor in these tragic cases to perform an abortion because he or she believes it is critical to preserving the health of a woman facing: Peripartal cardiomyopathy, a form of cardiac failure which is often caused by the pregnancy, which can result in death or untreatable heart disease; pre-eclampsia, or high blood pressure which is caused by a pregnancy, which can result in kidney failure, stroke, or death; and uterine ruptures which could result in infertility. 
Second, the language also applies when a woman has a life-threatening condition which requires life-saving treatment. It applies to those tragic cases, for example, when a woman needs chemotherapy when pregnancy, so the families face the terrible choice of continuing the pregnancy or providing life-saving treatment. These conditions include: Breast cancer; lymphoma, which has a 50 percent mortality rate if untreated; and primary pulmonary hypertension, which has a 50 percent maternal mortality rate. 
Now, I ask my colleagues, who could seriously object under these circumstances? 
In closing, Mr. President, let me restate that this is not a problem without a solution. The Durbin-Snowe language very clearly provides this body with an alternative that will not only ensure that healthy pregnancies will never be terminated after a fetus is viable; not only reduce the number of abortions in this Nation; not only put medical decisions in the hands of medical doctors; but will be in keeping with the requirements of the United States Constitution and our responsibility to America's women. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to vote to sustain the President's veto, and I hope we can coalesce around support for the Durbin-Snowe bill.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to create a commission on the advancement of women and minorities in science, engineering and technology development. The House version, H.R. 3007, introduced by my good friend, Congresswoman Morella, passed the House under suspension of the rules on Monday. 
Six years ago, I testified before the House Education and Labor Committee in support of this legislation, as cochair of the Congressional Caucus on Women's Issues. It was a priority for the Caucus in 1992, and it remains one of the top seven priorities for the Caucus this year. 
Since the 102d Congress, when Congresswoman Morella first introduced this bill on behalf of the Caucus, we have learned more about the barriers facing women and minorities when they try to enter nontraditional jobs, such as engineering and research, but unfortunately the general facts haven't changed much. 
For example, the National Science Foundation's 1996 report, `Women, Minorities and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering,' found that even those women who have obtained a degree and are teaching in science and engineering still face barriers to climbing up the ladder to success. The report found that a substantial salary gap exists between men and women with doctorates in science and engineering. It also found that among doctoral scientists and engineers, women are far more likely to be employed at 2 year institutions and, are far less likely to be employed in research universities, and are much more likely to teach part-time. 
And the National Research Council's 1995 report, `Women Scientists and Engineers Employed in Industry: Why so Few?,' found that women are still facing paternalism, sexual harassment, allegations of reverse discrimination, lower salaries and different standards for judging the work of men and women. 
The purpose of the 11 member Commission created under this bill is to review the information on the problems facing women and minorities in moving into the areas of science and engineering and make recommendations for changes in policy that would remove these artificial barriers which currently prevent women and minorities from entering and excelling in these fields. 
We are all aware of the important role that technology plays in our economy today, and for the nation, a workforce possessing technological skills is more than just an earnings issue--it's an issue of meeting national employment needs. Today, experts agree that more than half of the new jobs being created require some form of technology literacy. And by the year 2000, six out of every 10 new jobs will require computer and networking skills currently possessed by only 22 percent of the labor force. We must bridge the gap between `skills demanded' and `skills known' if our Nation is to even fill the jobs that will be available just four years from today. 
In order to meet those demands--which are crucial to the future economic growth of our country--we must ensure that women and minorities have access to, and are not kept from, jobs in the science, engineering and technology fields. The bill I am introducing today will help us find ways to level the playing field and take down artificial barriers that are keeping women and minorities from careers in these areas.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Early Hearing Loss Detection, Diagnosis and Intervention Act of 1998, which will serve as a companion bill to H.R. 2923, introduced in the House by Representative Jim Walsh. I am pleased to have, as the lead cosponsor, my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, who has long been a champion of the hearing impaired. 
We have a tendency to associate hearing problems with the aging process, and it is true that the largest group of Americans suffering from hearing impairment are those in the 65 to 75 year age range. At the other end of the spectrum, however, approximately 1.5 to 3 out of every 1000 children--or as many as 33 children per day--are born with significant hearing problems. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, as many as 12,000 infants are born each year in the U.S. with some form of hearing impairment. 
In the last several years, scientists have begun to tell us that the first years of a child's life are crucial to their future development. This makes early detection and intervention of hearing loss a necessity if we are to ensure that all our children get the strong start they deserve. Currently, the average age of diagnosis of hearing loss is close to three years of age. Yet it is believed that speech and oral language development can begin as early as 6 months of age. Without early diagnosis and intervention, these children are behind the learning curve--literally--before they have even started. They should not be denied a strong start in life simply for the lack of a simple screening test. 
There are many causes of hearing loss, and in many states a newborn child is screened only if the physician is aware of some factor that puts that baby in a risk category. Our four states--Rhode Island, Hawaii, Colorado, and Mississippi--currently require the screening of all newborns. in 16 other states, babies are screened only if they are believed to be a risk. This screening process, while important, detects only 50 percent--or half--of the hearing problems in young children. 
Universal screening is not a new idea. As early as 1965, the Advisory Committee on Education of the Deaf, in a report of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, recommended the development and nationwide implementation of `universally applied procedures for early identification.' In 1989, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop used this year 2000 as a goal for identifying 90 percent of children with significant hearing loss before they are one year old. And just last year, the National Institutes of Health convened an expert panel at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, and the panel made a recommendation that the first hearing screening be carried out before three months of age to ensure that treatment can begin before six months of age. 
It is time to move beyond the recommendations and achieve the goal of universal screening. In addition to the four states that require screening, the Bureau of Maternal and Child Health, in conjunction with the Centers for Disease 
Control, is helping 17 states commit to achieving universal hearing screening by the year 2000. This plan will lead to the screening of more than 1 million newborns a year, but it still leaves more than half the states without universal screening programs. 
The purpose of the bill I am introducing today is to provide the additional assistance necessary to help all the states in implementing programs to ensure that all our newborns are tested and to ensure that those identified with a hearing impairment get help. Specifically, the bill:

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance amendment before us. It is often said that when it comes to the important things in life, we don't get a second chance. Well, today, we are presented with such a second chance this year to pass comprehensive, meaningful campaign finance reform. We have a third chance this Congress, for which I thank Senators McCain and Feingold for their unflagging determination. I also want to thank the majority leader for allowing us an opportunity to have another vote on this issue on the Interior appropriations bill. 
Indeed, it seems, to paraphrase Mark Twain, that reports of campaign finance reform's demise have been greatly exaggerated. I hail authors of the House bill for their tenacity and the Members of the House who defied conventional wisdom and passed a comprehensive reform bill along the lines of McCain-Feingold. 
We are back here to attach this legislation to this appropriations bill because the House of Representatives courageously chose to do their part to dispel the cynicism that hung over the Capitol like a cloud. They have brought this issue out into the light of day, and it is long past time that we here in the Senate do likewise. 
When you consider the veritable mountain, indeed, the sheer cliff wall of legislative obstacles the Shays-Meehan bill had to overcome, it is unthinkable that we cannot overcome our hurdles in this Chamber. It was truly a `long and winding road' for the Shays-Meehan bill which, at first, wasn't even going to be considered. Finally, when the drumbeat for the Shays-Meehan bill would not die, a process was devised that would allow for the consideration of 11 different plans and more than 250 amendments. 
The so-called `Queen of the Hill' contest played itself out from May 21 through August 6. But in the end, when the smoke finally cleared, the Shays-Meehan bill remained standing in what has to be one of the most remarkable legislative victories in recent memory. 
By a vote of 252-179--including 61 Republicans--Shays-Meehan was passed in the House in the face of overwhelming odds and, thus, our mandate was handed to us here in the Senate. 
Like the House, we, too, have a majority who are already on record in favor of reform--52 Senators--thanks to the leadership of Senators McCain and Feingold in bringing this 
legislation to the floor earlier this year. Unlike the House, we have twice failed to pass a bill. We have twice failed to reach the 60 votes necessary to defeat a filibuster. But for the very first time, as a result of the McCain-Feingold vote we had earlier this year, we received a majority in support of that legislation--the very first campaign finance reform bill to receive a majority vote here in the U.S. Senate. 
Mr. President, I cannot believe there aren't eight other Senators in this body who understand the fundamental issue we are faced with: the very integrity of this institution, as well as the process that brings us here. When the House of Representatives can get a bipartisan majority of 252 Members to understand the implications, people might wonder why it is so hard to find eight more Senators to do the same. I have asked the same question myself. 
Last week, Senator Lieberman, during a widely and deservedly praised speech, stood in this Chamber and appealed to a higher principle than partisanship or the politics of self-preservation. He wasn't speaking of election reform, but his appeal to our more noble instincts is relevant to this debate. In fact, it is integral. 
Reforming our broken campaign system is not a Republican thing, not a Democrat thing, but the right thing. It is something we owe to ourselves as leaders, it is something we owe to this institution, and it is something we owe to the American people as participants in the world's greatest democracy. 
I know that some have said that the American people actually aren't very concerned about this issue. They point to studies, such as a poll conducted this year by the Pew Research Center, which ranked campaign reform 13th on a list of 14 major issues. But let's look at the reason: The report also said that public confidence in Congress to write an effective and fair campaign law had declined. In other words, the American people have given up on us. They are betting we won't do it. That is a sad commentary. I say, let's surprise them and do the right thing. I say, we have a solemn obligation not to justify their cynicism. 
And to those who argue that now is not the time to take up this issue, my response is: What better time than now? This is the most optimum time to change the political dynamic today. 
After an election in which the most corruptive elements were brought to bear, after we learn of illegal donations from the Chinese in an attempt to gain influence, after we learn of more than 45 fundraising calls from the White House, after we learn that the President may have controlled advertising paid for by the DNC but aimed at reelecting the President, after the Attorney General launched three separate preliminary investigations in the last 2 weeks into these allegations, after we learn of the explosion of soft money and electioneering ads--after all of these things, now is the time to clean up the system. 
Mr. President, I come to this debate as a veteran supporter of campaign finance reform. As someone who has served on Capitol Hill for almost 20 years, I understand the realities and I know there are concerns on both sides of the aisle that whatever measure we may ultimately pass, it must be fair, it must treat everyone as equitably as possible. 
In fact, I agree with those concerns. That is the challenge that brought Senator Jeffords and me to the table last October when we first attempted to consider this issue. It is what brought us back in February, and it is the reason I am here again today. 
I said last year that we should be putting our heads together, not building walls between us with intractable rhetoric and all-or-nothing propositions. Senator Jeffords and I attempted to bridge the gulf between two sides and expand support for McCain-Feingold by making sensible incremental changes. 
We were joined in this bipartisan effort by both Senators McCain and Feingold, as well as Senators Levin, Chafee, Lieberman, Thompson, Collins, Breaux, and Specter. 
I thank them again for their tremendous help and support. 
Together we not only won adoption of the amendment, but we helped bring this body to the first real vote on campaign finance reform and moved the debate forward by actually having the debate, and we solidified majority support for McCain-Feingold. 
I would like to take a few moments to speak about the provisions of the Snowe-Jeffords measure and why I think this measure is now considered worthy of the support of my Republican colleagues. 
The McCain-Feingold measure we are now considering takes a tremendous step forward by putting an end to soft money, tightening coordination definitions, and working to level the playing field for candidates facing opponents with vast personal wealth spent on their own campaigns. It also addresses the issues concerning the use of unregulated and undisclosed advertising that affects Federal elections, and the concerns that the original bill's attempt at addressing this issue would not withstand court scrutiny. This is important because if the courts had ruled the bill's efforts to address the distinction between true advocacy ads that influence Federal elections to be unconstitutional, then essentially all that would remain would be a ban on soft money. If that were to happen, we would be left with only one-half of the equation, and I share the concerns of those who want to see balanced reform--and a level playing field, not throw it even further off kilter. 
The Snowe-Jeffords approach would be much more likely to pass court muster. It was developed in consultation with noted constitutional scholars and reformers such as Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute and Josh Rosenkrantz, Director of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU, as well as others. And it goes to the heart of the `stealth advocacy ads' which purport to be only about issues but are really designed to influence the outcome of federal elections.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, 
the approach in this amendment is a straightforward, two tiered one that only applies to advertisements that constitute the most blatant form of electioneering. It only applies to ads run on radio or television, 30 days before a primary and 60 days before a general election, that identify a federal candidate. And only if over $10,000 is spent on such ads in a year. What is required is disclosure of the ads' sponsor and major donors, and a prohibition on the use of union dues or corporate treasury funds to finance the ads. 
We called this new category `electioneering ads'. They are the only communications addressed, and we define them very narrowly and carefully. 
If the ad is not run on television or radio; if the ad is not aired within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election, if the ad doesn't mention a candidate's name or otherwise identify him clearly, if it isn't targeted at the candidate's electorate, or if a group hasn't spent more than $10,000 in that year on these ads, then it is not an electioneering ad. 
If is an item appearing in a news story, commentary, voter guides or editorial distributed through a broadcast station, it is also not an electioneering ad. Plain and simple. 
If one does run an electioneering ad, two things happen. First, the sponsor must disclose the amount spent and the identity of contributors who donated more than $500 to the group since January 1st of the previous year. Right now, candidates have to disclose campaign contributions over $200--so the threshold contained in McCain-Feingold is much higher. Second, the ad cannot be paid for by funds from a business corporation or labor union--only voluntary contributions. 
The clear, narrow wording of the amendment is important because it passes two critical first amendment doctrines that were at the heart of the Supreme Court's landmark Buckley versus Valeo decision: vagueness and overbreadth. The rules of this provision are clear. And the requirements are strictly limited to ads run near an 
election that identify a candidate--ads plainly intended to convince voters to vote for or against a particular candidate. 
Nothing in this provision restricts the right of any group to engage in issue advocacy. Nothing prohibits groups from running electioneering ads, either. Let me be clear on this: if this bill becomes law, any group running issues ads today can still run issue ads in the future, with no restrictions on content. And any group running electioneering ads can still run those ads in the future, again with absolutely zero restrictions on content. 
So to those who will argue, as they did in February, that this measure runs afoul of the first amendment, I say that that is simply a red herring, Mr. President. And you don't have to take my word for it. Constitutional scholars from Stanford Law to Georgia Law to Loyola Law to Vanderbilt Law have endorsed the approach that is now part of this legislation. 
If anything, Mr. President, this provision underscores first amendment rights for union members and shareholders by protecting them from having their money used for electioneering ads they may not agree with, while maintaining the right of labor and corporate management to speak through PACs. 
This is a sensible, reasonable approach to addressing a burgeoning segment of electioneering that is making a mockery of our campaign finance system. How can anyone not be for disclosure? How can anyone say that less information for the public leads to better elections? Don't the American people have the right to know who is paying for these stealth advocacy ads, and how much? 
This problem is not going to go away, Mr. President. The year 1996 marked a turning point in American elections--make no mistake about it. 
The Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania published a report this year on so-called issue advertising during the 1996 elections, and if any member of the Senate hasn't read it I recommend you get hold of a copy. 
As this first chart demonstrates, the report finds that, during the 1996 elections, anywhere from $135 million to $150 million was spent by third-party organizations in the 1996 election on radio and TV ads. This totals almost one-third of the amount of money that was spent in the election; $400 million was spent by all candidates for President, U.S. Senate, and the House, but other organizations spent a third of all of the money that was spent in the last election. 
Then chart two, if there is any doubt about the intent of these ads, indicates, according to the Annenberg Report, that in a study of 109 ads that were supported by 29 different organizations, almost 87 percent of those so-called issue ads referred to a candidate, and 41 percent of those issue ads were identified by the public as being `attack ads'--41 percent. Almost 87 percent of these so-called issue ads identified a candidate. That is the highest percentage recorded among a group that also included Presidential ads, debates, free-time segments, and news program organizations. 
Clearly, these ads were overtly aimed at electing or defeating targeted candidates, but under current law they aren't even subject to disclosure requirements. We are only talking about those individuals who provide $500 or more to an organization that runs ads identifying a candidate 30 days before a primary and 60 days before a general election. 
But let's look at the ads that I am talking about. Again, we are talking about stealth advocacy ads. First, you get the `True Issue Ad,' according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center, which says that `McCain-Feingold would have no impact on True Issue Ads.' It says here that it is `A True Issue Ad.' It says: 
This election year, America's children need your vote. Our public schools are our children's ticket to the future. But education has become just another target for attack by politicians who want huge cuts in education programs. They're making the wrong choices. Our children deserve leaders who will strengthen public education, not attack it. They deserve the best education we can give them. So this year, vote as if your children's future depends on it. It does. 
That is a true issue ad. 
Look at chart four. This is what I call a `Stealth Advocacy Ad.' This is what McCain-Feingold would define as `Electioneering Communications.' 
That is totally permissible under any of the rulings that have been made and rendered by the Supreme Court, because those distinctions can be made between electioneering and between constitutionally permitted freedom of speech. 
This is a stealth advocacy ad:  
Mr. X promised he'd be different. But he's just another Washington politician. Why, during the last year alone he has taken over $260,000 from corporate special interest groups. . . . But is he listening to us anymore? 
That identifies a candidate. 
I defy anyone to tell me with a straight face that the intent of this stealth advocacy ad is anything other than to advocate for the defeat of candidate X. That is the kind of ad that is covered by the McCain-Feingold measure. 
Let me tell you something. This ad could still run. Any group in America can run any ad that they want before the election identifying a candidate. But the fact is it would require disclosure of those donors who provide more than $500 to that organization, if these ads run 30 days before a primary or 60 days before a general election. 
And the money could not be funded by unions or corporations through their treasuries. If they want to finance these ads, by unions or corporations, they will have to do so by a PAC, if these ads run 30 days before a primary and 60 days before a general election. 
So what are we talking about? Disclosure. That is what we are talking about. And 87 percent of these issue ads, these so-called issue ads, are what I would call stealth advocacy ads, because they identify a candidate but we don't know who finances these ads. This, on the other hand, is a true issue ad. It doesn't identify a candidate. Groups can run ads saying: `Call your Senator. Call your Member of Congress.' They don't have to identify the candidate. But if they do, it requires disclosure of their major donors. 
Mr. President, we are accountable to the people. We are required as candidates for office to file disclosure forms as candidates. PACs are required to disclose. But hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on these ads without one dime being reported--not one dime. And I remind you that one-third of the money that was spent in the last election, in 1996, was spent by organizations that did not have to disclose one dime. And there is no reason to think it will not get worse. 
You do not need a crystal ball. Just look at some of the special elections this year. For example, it has been widely reported that just one group spent $200,000 on special election TV commercials. We don't have the total of exactly how much was spent overall, because there is currently no accountability, no disclosure. That is what the McCain-Feingold legislation is addressing. 
And think about this. Overall, national party committees raised over $115 million in soft money during the first 18 months of the 1997-1998 election cycle, the most money ever on a nonpresidential election cycle. Total soft money contributions to both Democrats and Republicans have more than doubled during the past 4 years. In fact, soft money contributions to national party committees have grown by 131 percent from the first 18 months of the 1993-1994 election cycle compared to the same period in this 1997-1998 election cycle--grown 131 percent. 
Enough is enough. I have said before that it is the duty of leaders to lead, and that means making some difficult choices. I know this is not an easy vote. It requires looking at ourselves and asking what is important, protecting the status quo, or is it protecting the integrity of our system of elections? 
How we choose our elected officials goes to the heart of who we are as a nation. It defines us as a country and it defines whether or not we will continue to maintain the integrity of this process. But there is a very great danger that if we do nothing, if we shroud ourselves in the rhetoric of absolutism, if we turn our backs on a monumental opportunity that we now have, then our mantle of greatness will decay from the inside, because if the American people lose faith in the system that elects our public officials, they have lost faith in the integrity of Government itself, and we cannot allow this to happen. We cannot preside over this disintegration of public trust. 
Eight votes stand between us and a reform bill. Eight votes stand between us and the passage of the McCain-Feingold legislation. After two tries in the Senate, the labyrinthian parliamentary procedure, hundreds of amendments, and a `Queen of the Hill' contest in the House, all that is holding back a reform bill this year is eight Senators. This is our chance, my friends, and I implore my colleagues to seize this historic opportunity. After this vote, there will be no doubt who stands four square behind fair, sensible, meaningful reform and who does not. 
Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for yielding me the time and for his leadership and his commitment. 
I yield the floor. 
Exhibit 1 BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE 
at NYU School of Law, New York, NY, February 20, 1998. Re NRLC objections to the Snowe-Jeffords amendment. 
Dear Senator: We write to rebut letters from the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC), dated February 17 and February 20, 1998, in opposition to the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment to the McCain-Feingold Bill. NRLC mischaracterizes what the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment would achieve and misrepresents constitutional doctrine. The Amendment would not restrict the ability of advocacy groups such as NRLC to engage in either issue advocacy or electioneering. But it would prevent them from (1) hiding from the public the amounts they spend on the most blatant form of electioneering; (2) keeping secret the identities of those who bankroll their electioneering messages with large contributions; and (3) funneling funds from business corporations and labor unions into electioneering. These goals, and the means used to achieve them, are constitutionally permissible.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I think it is important this morning to review some of the facts regarding this conference report before the Senate that creates this Texas Compact, because I do think that some of the facts have been lightly regarded during the course of this debate. 
This is nothing that hasn't been done before. This conference report will ratify a compact between the States of Texas, Maine and Vermont for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste, as has been done on nine previous occasions by the U.S. Congress in response to a mandate by the Congress in both 1980 and 1985 that required the States to accept responsibility for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste. 
Mr. President, 41 States--including the State of Minnesota, the State which the Senator represents and who opposes this compact--have entered into a compact over the last 20 years in response to the mandate that was issued by the U.S. Congress. There are nine such compacts. 
This compact in this conference report does not deviate from the previous compacts. The fact of the matter is this compact gives greater control to the State of Texas in terms of the determination of the siting and all of the other factors to repeatedly and safely dispose of low-level radioactive waste. This compact allows the State of Texas, the State of Vermont and the State of Maine to do what 41 other States, including Senator Wellstone's own State of Minnesota, do--to dispose of this low-level radioactive waste. The States are responsible for making this determination, whether it is in their State or out of their State, for the waste that is generated within their borders. 
There are other factors that have to be clarified here today. The Senator from Minnesota said no other States in these compacts have determined or designated other sites--which is incorrect--at the time of the ratification. In fact, three other compacts--the Northwest, the Rocky Mountain and the Southeast, which passed by the Congress in 1985--had operating facilities that were intentionally designated as the compact's regional facility. 
As has been said, the failure of this Congress to ratify this conference report to create this compact will result in no facility being built in Texas. 
As this chart illustrates, there are 684 such storage sites in the State of Texas. They are temporary. They are interim storage facilities. What does that mean? It means that they don't have to meet all the same strict requirements that a permanent storage facility will have to meet. So if this conference report is ratified by the Congress, that means the State of Texas can consolidate into one permanent facility to meet all of the State, local and Federal requirements. 
It is not, as the Senator from Minnesota has suggested, that we are running roughshod, we are going to override all of the strict Federal, State and local regulatory requirements with respect to safety and health regulations, and of course environmental regulations. This issue isn't going to go away. The waste has already been generated. In fact, even the administrative law judge wants the commission to go back to review essential factors to indicate that the process is working so that all of the requirements under Federal, State and local law are examined very carefully, 
in terms of the site, so that it is environmentally and geologically safe and sound. But even the administrative law judge determined on July 7 that, indeed, the State of Texas is in need of a low-level waste disposal site. 
Congress did not put conditions on the nine other compacts that were ratified by Congress on previous occasions. So this compact should not be dealt with any differently. We are going to adhere to all of the safe requirements that have been established in law. So the siting in Texas is not being done in a vacuum. To the contrary. 
Just to name a few of the regulatory requirements that have to be reviewed and have to be satisfied and have to be adhered to and are being done, as included in this book right here that goes through the entirety of the process that has been implemented in the State of Texas for a siting of a facility, there is the Civil Rights Act, which has to be adhered to; title VI of the Civil Rights Act has to be regarded; the Clean Water Act; the Clean Air Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Atomic Energy Act; the 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act; the 1985 Amendments; the Texas Radiation Control Act, and the Texas Health and Safety Code. They all must be adhered to. 
So there is a process. The Senator from Minnesota suggests that there has not been a process, or public participation. To the contrary, there has been extensive public participation, and the process is not over. This compact is site neutral. That doesn't mean to say that the State of Texas hasn't been examining the site in Sierra Blanca, but the process has not been completed. It is being examined very carefully. There has been public participation. There have been numerous hearings within Hudspeth County and Sierra Blanca specifically about this issue. The Texas Legislature overwhelmingly has supported it in both the house and senate, as have the Governors, Governor Richards and Governor Bush; the State of Vermont, both legislatures, and the State of Maine, on a bipartisan basis. In fact, 24 of the 30 members of the Texas congressional delegation are all in support of this conference report. So it has been regarded.

Ms. SNOWE. I want to read this open letter that was placed as an advertisement in a local newspaper: 
We support the approval of the license for the proposed radioactive waste disposal facility near our town. It offers hope for a better future and tangible, real-life advances that will make Sierra Blanca and Hudspeth County more livable. The overwhelming majority of residents support this project near our town for the following reasons: 
A halt to exporting our children to other areas for employment; a larger job market for all residents of Sierra Blanca and Hudspeth County; the ripple effect seen from additional businesses and services to support the facility; improved medical care; increased property values; a broader tax base; enhanced infrastructure; disposal fees paid to the county; upward mobility, and an improved standard of living; a better perception of our community by ourselves and others. 
The critics--almost all of whom live outside the community--say the proposed site is not a reasonable road to economic development for Sierra Blanca. We say that these people do not speak for us and that this is our only road in sight.

Ms. SNOWE. The fact of the matter is that there has been extensive public participation, and it has not been completed. In fact, there were local elections in Hudspeth County, and all of the candidates who were in support of this facility were elected or reelected. I think that speaks volumes. This was an issue in those campaigns. I will also submit for the Record the list of supporters of the compact and the following letters; a letter from nine Texas Members of the House of Representatives; the Governors of Maine, Texas and Vermont; a letter from the National Governors' Association; the National Conference of State Legislatures; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; a `Dear Colleague' by two members of the Texas House of Representatives. All of them are in support of the Texas Compact before us here today.

Ms. SNOWE. The fact of the matter is that there has been a public process. There has been very careful evaluation and concern about the views of the constituents in the local area of Hudspeth County, of Sierra Blanca, of the State of Texas. The fact is, the Senator from Minnesota wants to treat the States of Texas, Vermont, and Maine differently from 41 other States, including the Senator's own State of Minnesota. 
The States of Texas, Vermont, and Maine are doing just what the Congress required them to do--enter into a compact. The failure of this Congress to approve this conference report and ratify this compact would mean that the State of Texas could not create one safe permanent disposal for low-level radioactive waste; that they would have to maintain 684 temporary storage facilities that do not meet the strict Federal, State and local requirements that this permanent facility would be required to meet. 
So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to adopt this conference report. I reserve the balance of my time.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, let me make a final comment. I think we have had very extensive debate. 
I believe that the facts have been emphasized and clarified with respect to this issue. The fact of the matter is, this compact adheres to all of the standards that have been applied to previous compacts ratified by the Congress, 
nine such instances as mandated by the U.S. Congress. The fact is, 82 Senators in this body represent States that have compacts, but the Senator from Minnesota is saying that somehow the States of Texas and Vermont and Maine should be discriminated against, that they should not be allowed to enter into a compact to safely dispose of low-level radioactive waste--waste, yes, that is generated by universities, by medical centers, by defense facilities, by power plants. 
The Senator from Minnesota is saying that somehow we should be treated differently from his own State of Minnesota and all of the other 40 States that are included in these compacts. The State of Texas has procedures, has a public process, has a political process to determine where the site should be located. The Senator from Minnesota is somehow suggesting that the State of Texas does not have the trust and the confidence of the people that it serves to make a judgment in adherence to their State environmental and public and health and safety laws as well as the Federal Government, all of which, I might add, have to be adhered to, all of which have been outlined in this process throughout. This has not been something that somehow has materialized out of thin air, overriding and breaching all of the environmental and safety laws in America.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I say to the Members of the Senate, I rise today to ask for my colleagues' support for the conference report on H.R. 629, the Texas Compact Consent Act of 1998, which reflects the original language ratified by the States of Maine, Vermont, and Texas to address the safe disposal of their low-level radioactive nuclear waste. The 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act states that it is the policy of the United States that each State is responsible for providing for the availability of disposal capacity, whether in 
State or out of State, for waste generated within its borders, and the act authorized interstate compacts as a principal means of providing for this capacity. 
The policy was reinforced in the 1985 amendments to the act. The States of Maine, Vermont, and Texas are now approaching the end of a long journey that started in 1980 when Congress informed the States to form compacts to solve their low-level radioactive waste disposal problems. 
My first chart shows the extent of the nine compact networks that have already been ratified by Congress. California, for instance, has had a compact with North and South Dakota, and Hawaii and Alaska ship their low-level waste to Washington State. 
This chart designates all of the nine previous compacts that have been established with the various States across this country. As you can see in the second chart with the list of States in the compact, Mr. President, when we adopted this report, Texas, Maine, and Vermont will become the 42nd, 43rd, and 44th States to be given congressional approval to enter into a compact and will meet their responsibilities of disposal of their low-level waste from hospitals, medical centers, powerplants, and shipyards. We will be the 10th compact to receive the consent of the U.S. Congress. Only 6 States out of 50 will not yet have formed a compact with other States. 
Again, in referring to this chart, it shows that 41 States have entered into nine different compacts, all of which have been ratified by the Congress in previous years. So this compact is not unlike any of the other nine previous compacts that have been adopted by the U.S. Congress. 
It is very important for my colleagues to understand that the language ratified overwhelmingly by each State legislature is the same language that has been passed by the conferees, so that the compact will not have to be returned to each State to go through a reratification process that would, in all practicality, as well as reality, take several more years. 
The compact that is before the Senate has been approved by large majorities in all three State legislatures. The Texas Senate approved the compact in May of 1993 with a vote of 28-0, and by a voice vote in the Texas House of Representatives. Governor Ann Richards at the time signed the compact. The compact is supported by the current Governor, Governor George Bush. 
The Vermont House voice voted the compact in March of 1994, and the Vermont Senate voice voted the compact in April of 1994. Governor Howard Dean signed the compact. 
The Maine Legislature approved the compact in June of 1993, by a house vote of 131 yeas to 6 nays, and a senate vote of 26 yeas and 3 nays. 
Additionally, Maine held a public referendum on the compact in November of 1993, which passed by 73 percent. Then-Governor John McKernan signed the compact. Today it is supported as well by the current Governor, Angus King. 
As Congress intended in the original law, the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Act of 1980, and in amendments enacted in 1985 by the Congress, the Texas Compact is site neutral. Site location questions are the exclusive purview of the State of Texas and can only be addressed through Texas political and regulatory processes. The chosen site must, of course, meet Federal environmental, public health and safety laws. To date, no site location has been finalized. No license has been granted. 
The compact does not determine who pays what, how the storage is allocated, or where the site is located. To the contrary, the intent of the law is for the States to develop and approve and finalize these details after Congress has ratified the plan. 
The compact is only an interstate agreement providing the terms under which Maine and Vermont can dispose of their waste at a licensed facility in Texas, irrespective of where that facility is located. As we all know, there has been a proposed site. 
As to the statements by the opponents and by the Senator from Minnesota that there is no local support for the proposed site, all I can say is that earlier this year local support was certainly evidenced through local elections that were held in Texas. The Hudspeth County judge, who is the top elected official in the county where the site has been proposed, and who has strongly declared his support for the compact, won his race for reelection. This was an issue in his reelection, and the elections at the local level in this county. 
Two candidates for county commissioner who also support the compact won their races over two opponents of the compact. And a local individual in opposition to the compact was the only person on the ballot for Democratic Party Chair, and he lost to a write-in candidate. 
In an August 25 letter, a top-elected official from Hudspeth, Judge Peace, stated: `The truth is the socioeconomic benefits for the residents of Sierra Blanca are enormous and overwhelmingly positive.' 
Judge Peace also says, `I want you to know that the majority of citizens favor the development of such a facility.' Further, he says, `The people of Sierra Blanca and Hudspeth County voiced their opinions for a better future and tangible real life advances that will make our communities more livable.' 
There is a grave concern in Maine and Vermont and Texas 
that there are some in Congress who want to add stipulations on to the Texas Compact that no other compact has had to endure. And that would be action that would discriminate against these three States. 
Again, as I mentioned earlier, there have been nine previous compacts. Not one of them have had any conditions or stipulations as the ones that have been suggested by the Senator from Minnesota and others--none. And the compact is site neutral because that is a decision that has to be made by the State that will have the proposed facility. That, of course, is the State of Texas--but all consistent with the environmental and safety and health guidelines, not only at the Federal level, but at the State and the local level as well. This is not irrespective; it is not overriding those concerns. 
In fact, the conference report and the statute that is being proposed before the Senate is very clear that they have to follow specific and certain guidelines. So that is the environmental justice that we are pursuing. No one is saying to override environmental justice principles or regulations--absolutely not. That is for the State in question. I have faith and confidence in the State of Texas and the elected officials and other officials involved in this procedural approach in determining where the proposed site should be located. But that is a judgment that has to be made by the State of Texas and consistent with their laws, and Federal laws as well. 
I might add that Senator Wellstone's own State of Minnesota is already part of a compact that was ratified by Congress. And like all the other compacts that Congress has approved, Congress made no changes or added any conditions or stipulations to that compact. There again, it was a decision made by the State who is going to have the facilities, but again in keeping with Federal environmental and health and safety regulations, as well as the State and local guidelines. 
With congressional ratification of H.R. 629 and the conference report that is before us today, Texas will move forward to select an appropriate site for the disposal facility in a timely manner, most importantly, consistent with all of the applicable State and Federal environmental, health and public safety laws, as I have already mentioned. It has always been the decision of the State of Texas as to where the facility will be sited. And it is not within the purview of the U.S. Senate to decide for them. And I applaud the conferees in their judgment of passing out a conference report with the original language ratified by Maine, Vermont and the State of Texas. 
Without the protection of the compact, Texas will be compelled to--and I repeat, compelled to--open their borders to any other State for waste disposal if they decide to create a new facility or they will be in violation of the Interstate Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. This compact will protect Texas' right to decide what is best for the State of Texas. The State will be able to construct a single engineered facility for storing and management of all of its low-level waste rather than its current situation illustrated again on this chart in which 684 temporary storage sites are strewn far and wide across the State. Again, it shows in this chart 684 different facilities across the State of Texas. 
This compact will allow them to consolidate into one facility. But if the Congress did not approve this compact, and the State of Texas wanted to go ahead and develop a new site, they would be required, without this compact, to open up their facility to all of the other States in the country for the transport of low-level radioactive waste. So that is why the State of Texas wants this compact, because then they would only be accepting waste from the State of Vermont and the State of Maine. 
Texas Compact members will now be able to exercise appropriate, responsible control of their low-level nuclear waste as Congress has mandated. 
I would like to put into the Record the entire letter that I received from the Organizations United for Responsible Low-Level Radioactive Waste Solutions--a coalition made up of such organizations as the American Society of Nuclear Physicians, the American Heart Association, and the National Association of Cancer Patients--who are dedicated to socially, environmentally, technically and economically responsible solutions to low-level waste disposal. I would like to quote one of their lines within the letter that I think speaks to this issue.  
Please support the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact bill which will allow the continued use of low-level radioactive materials that provide critical health, environmental, and safety benefits to millions of Americans.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, to sum up this issue, first and foremost, I think we need to understand that most other States have already entered into compacts that have been ratified by the Congress. In fact, 41 States already have compacts. The same compact that we are asking for support here in the U.S. Senate has been already adopted by the House of Representatives by an overwhelming margin. It has been supported by the conferees of both the House and the Senate. 
I urge my colleagues to support this conference report that allows these three States to enter into a compact that is consistent with the mandates of the laws that have been passed by the Congress both in 1980, with the original act instructing the States that they must make decisions with respect to the disposal of low-level radioactive waste, and consistent with the amendments to that act in 1985. 
This compact is in keeping with the spirit and intent of those thoughts. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I will just make a few brief concluding comments in response to some of the issues that were raised by the Senator from Minnesota. I respect his views and his opinions although we certainly differ on the perspective on this issue. This isn't a unique or different approach to this issue of the disposal of low-level radioactive waste. Indeed, the U.S. Congress mandated that the States assume the responsibility of the disposal of low-level radioactive waste in or out of their States. And this is in response to a congressional mandate that began in 1980 and, as I said earlier, reinforced by amendments to that act in 1985. 
So this isn't a diversion from that approach. It isn't different from all of the other compacts that have been ratified by the Congress over time. And, as I said earlier, there are nine different compacts, that include 41 different States, including the State of Minnesota, the State that the Senator represents. So why should Texas and Maine and Vermont be any different? 
The Senator referred to some of the amendments that he had offered to this legislation, but they did not prevail. Those amendments did not prevail because those conditions and stipulations would require years of reratification. And I mention the fact that those conditions were not included in any of the other nine compacts that were enacted and ratified by the Congress over the years. 
We all respect the Senator's perspective on the issue of environmental justice. No one is suggesting for a moment that we should override the environmental issues, any of the issues that would adversely, and disproportionately adversely, affect a community with respect to public health and safety questions, environmental issues, or income. 
We believe in the State of Texas--through its procedures, through its public procedures, through its political process, through its State laws, through the Federal laws--to make the appropriate decision, environmentally and scientifically and geologically, in terms of the safe disposal of low-level radioactive waste. That is the issue here. And we are doing this consistent with all of the other compacts and all of the other statutes that have been enacted by the U.S. Congress over the last 20 years. 
In fact, I was in the House of Representatives back in 1980 when this was a major question: How do we resolve it? It is not an easy question. It is not as if we do not have low-level radioactive waste. We have a problem, as we do with high-level radioactive waste. But we have hospitals and we have research laboratories, and we have to dispose of the materials that result from those facilities; we have no choice. And that is why we have this compact before the U.S. Senate, as do so many of the other States. 
Forty-one States, including the Senator's own State of Minnesota, have a compact. But now we are saying Texas and Vermont and Maine are not allowed to enter into a compact? Are we saying that the Governor of the State of Texas or the legislature, the house and the senate, are not concerned with the views of their constituencies with respect to this issue? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>105-snowe-me-8-19980901</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Ms. SNOWE. Are we saying that senators and representatives are not concerned with the views of the constituents who live in Sierra Blanca or any other locations where these facilities are sited? Are we trying to override the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that are all referenced, I might add, in the conference report? None of this can be sited anywhere on Earth without regard to environmental and public health and safety questions. It has to go through a process. 
In fact, the Senator from Minnesota mentioned two administrative law judges in Texas who have been conducting evidentiary hearings on the license application to construct and operate this disposal site. And the judges issued a proposal for decision on the application in Hudspeth County saying they needed more information in two aspects of the potential site. And the appropriate Texas agency is now taking the recommendation under consideration and responding on the safety question. And the judges want more information as to whether there are any negative socioeconomic impacts in this facility to the citizens and to tourism. So environmental justice is being considered. 
This isn't ignoring those issues. That is why this legislation is site-neutral, because we want the appropriate agencies and statutes at the Federal, State and local levels to take hold and determine what is the safest location, respecting the wishes of a community. 
Now, the Senator mentioned the people who don't support it in Hudspeth County. We don't even know, in the final analysis, if that is where it is going to be. That is up to the State of Texas through its process. That has been stipulated in law in terms of what they have to consider. 
It says:  
Nothing in this compact that diminishes or otherwise impairs the jurisdiction, authority, discretion of the either the following: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Nothing in the compact confers any new authority to the State commission to do any of the following: Regulate the packaging or transportation of low-level waste, regulate the health, safety and environmental hazards from source byproducts and special nuclear materials, or inspect the activities of licensees of the agreement of the States or U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
All of it is in place, just like it has been done for 41 other States over the years. That is what we are talking about. We are not saying we are going to run roughshod over anybody's wishes or rights. That is a determination that has to be made with the State of Texas through the public process, which has been done and is continuing at this moment. That is what we are asking. 
So I hope that my colleagues will support the conference report, which is not unusual, not unlike any of the 9 previous compacts that have been ratified by the Congress over the last 20 years. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today, along with my colleague Senator Reid, to offer an amendment to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill that will produce two critical results: It will provide women who work for the federal government the equality in health care and the affordable access to prescription contraception coverage they need and deserve; and it will help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in this country. 
The Snowe-Reid amendment says that if a health plan in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, or FEHBP, provides coverage of prescription drugs and devices, they must also cover FDA-approved prescription contraceptives. It also provides that plans which already cover outpatient services also cover medical and counseling services to promote the effective use of those contraceptives. 
That's it, Madam President. That's the extent and scope of the Snowe-Reid amendment. It only prevents health plans in the FEHBP from carving out exceptions for FDA-approved prescription contraceptives that prevent pregnancy. 
It does not cover abortion in any way, shape or form. It does not cover abortion related services such as counseling a woman to seek an abortion. And it does not require coverage of RU-486, because RU-486 is not a method of contraception. Let me repeat, this amendment does not require coverage of RU-486. 
The Snowe-Reid amendment also respects the rights of religious plans that, as a matter of conscience, choose not to cover contraceptives. Again, I want to make it clear that this amendment clearly exempts such plans. 
Finally, the Snowe-Reid plan isn't going to break the bank or burden American taxpayers. In fact, CBO has estimated that the cost to the federal government would be less than $500,000, and under CBO's practice of scoring bills to the nearest million dollars, CBO stated: `this provision would have no effect on the budget totals in FY 1999.' 
So the Snowe-Reid amendment is a practical, common sense, cost effective approach to effecting the kind of public health policy that should set an example for the rest of the nation's insurers to follow. 
The need for this visionary measure is clear. Today, nearly 9 million Federal employees, retirees, and their dependents participate in the FEHBP. Fully 1.2 million are women of reproductive age who rely on FEHBP for all their medical needs. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these women are currently denied access to the broad range of safe and effective methods of contraception. 
In fact, according to the Office of Personnel Management, which administers the FEHBP, 81 percent of plans do not cover all five of the most basic and widely used methods of contraception and 10 percent of these plans do not cover any type of contraception at all. 
The ramifications of this are dramatic. When 8 out of 10 women enrolled in the FEHBP aren't covered for the leading methods of contraception, their choices are unfairly limited. Who are we to pick and choose what method works best--or is most medically suited--for each individual woman? 
The fact is, different women require different methods of contraception due to a variety of factors. If there is only one method of contraception her plan offers, where does that leave her? And even more to the point, why do we leave this decision to her health care plan, instead of her health care provider? 
Across America, this lack of equitable coverage for prescription contraceptives contributes to the fact that women today spend 68 percent more than men in health care costs. That's 68 percent. And this gap in coverage translates into $7,000 to $10,000 over a woman's reproductive lifetime. 
So I ask my colleagues: with 25 percent of all Federal employees earning less than $25,000--and nearly 18,000 Federal employees having incomes below or slightly above the Federal poverty level--what do you think is the likely effect of these tremendous added costs for these Federal employees? 
Well, I'll tell you the effect it has: many of them simply stop using contraceptives, or will never use them in the first place, because they simply can't afford to. And the impact of those decisions on these individuals and this nation is a lasting and profound one. 
Women spend more than 90 percent of their reproductive life avoiding pregnancy, and a woman who doesn't use contraception is 15 times more likely to become pregnant than women who do. Fifteen times. And of the 3.6 million unintended pregnancies in the United States, half of them will end in abortion. 
I can't think of anyone I know, no matter their ideology, party, or gender, who doesn't want to see the instances of abortion in this nation reduced. Well, imagine if I told you we could do something about it, and do it at almost no cost to the federal government. 
That is what the Snowe-Reid amendment does. When the Alan Guttmacher Institute estimates that the use of birth control lowers the likelihood of abortion by a remarkable 85 percent, how can we ignore a provision like the Snowe-Reid amendment that will make the use of birth control more affordable to our Federal employees, and do so with negligible cost to the Federal government? 
And yet, as thoughtful an approach as the Snowe-Reid amendment may seem, I know that there will still be some in this body who will argue against it. Well, I believe these arguments do not withstand scrutiny, and I would like to take just a few minutes to explain why. 
Some may voice concern that the Snowe-Reid amendment requires coverage of abortion of drugs that induce abortion, such as RU-486. To which I will reiterate, the Snowe-Reid amendment only requires coverage of FDA-approved methods of contraception--that means contraception to prevent pregnancy. 
It is important to make it clear that we are only talking about methods of contraception under this amendment. And I might add, methods of contraception which will reduce the number of abortions in this country--so the fact is--if you want to see fewer abortions performed in the United States, you should support this amendment. 
When it comes to the incredibly personal issue of abortion we should be celebrating common ground, not condemning it. This amendment achieves that goal. It does not pretend to settle the issue of abortion in America--far from it. It does, however, provide a rallying point for those who want to see abortions reduced--all of us, I would think--and that's the reason people like Senator Reid who is prolife, support it on one side of the abortion debate and people like me on the other. 
Some opponents may say that pregnancy isn't really a medical condition, and therefore we shouldn't be requiring its coverage in the FEHBP. Obviously, anyone who says this hasn't been through pregnancy or childbirth. If pregnancy isn't a medical condition, then I'd like to know what is! 
And in this day and age when prevention is the buzzword--as it should be--how is it we can support prescription coverage to treat a variety of biological conditions but not to prevent one of the most dramatic and life-altering conditions of all? 
Still others may argue, `Pregnancy is a lifestyle choice, and shouldn't be covered like diseases that are not'. Such an argument simply ignores reality as well as the facts. 
As Luella Klein, the director of women's health issues at ACOG, put it: `There's nothing `optional' about contraception. It is a medical necessity for woman during 30 years of their lifespan. To ignore the health benefits of contraception is to say that the alternative of 12 to 15 pregnancies during a woman's lifetime is medically acceptible.' 
Of course, we shouldn't be too surprised at the attitude of our opponents. Indeed, it wasn't until 1978--only twenty years ago--that Congress passed a law requiring that maternity benefits be covered like any other medical care. Before we passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 43 percent of insurance policies didn't include coverage of maternity care. Sound familiar? 
So here we are, twenty years later, battling some of the same insurance companies that in 1978 didn't want to provide the same coverage we now take for granted. How can they still not cover the means to prevent what they already acknowledge through existing coverage as a medical condition? 
The fact is, all methods of contraception are cost effective when compared to the cost of unintended pregnancy. And with unplanned pregnancies linked to higher rates of premature and low-birth weight babies, costs can rise even above and beyond those associated with healthy births. 
As the American Journal of Public Health estimates, the cost under managed care for a year's dose of birth control pills is less than one-tenth of what it would cost for prenatal care and delivery. 
So the question, then, is not `How can we afford to expand coverage to prescription contraceptives?' but `How can we afford not to?' 
No, the cost argument doesn't hold water, Mr. President, and neither do any of the other arguments. The bottom line is, the Snowe-Reid amendment makes sense from a standpoint of fairness, from the standpoint of compassion, from the standpoint of cost effectiveness and from the standpoint of good public health policy. 
Maybe that's why the concept is supported by such diverse groups as the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the American Medical Women's Association, and the Society for Adolescent Medicine. 
Whatever the reason, as an employer and model for the rest of the nation, the federal government should provide equal access to this most basic health benefit for women. This amendment would allow federal employees to have that option, one already provided an option for contraceptives through the Medicaid program. Why shouldn't the same federal commitment be extended to women employed by the federal government? 
In closing, Madam President, let me say that if we, as a nation, are truly committed to reducing abortion rates and increasing the quality of life for all Americans, then we need to begin focusing our attention on how to prevent unintended pregnancies. The Snowe-Reid amendment is a significant step in the right direction, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to address my colleagues on a matter of critical importance to our national drug interdiction program. 
I am very concerned about the condition of some of the currently deployed drug interdiction vessels. I understand that some of the vessels currently deployed in the U.S. Customs Service's marine program fleet are 30 years old and may pose a threat to U.S. Customs Service agents and the viability of our drug interdiction program. 
The Customs Service already has a contract to build replacement vessels on demand. However, this contract will expire at the end of FY 1999, and no vessels have been purchased to date. I believe the Customs Service should extend this contract and make efforts to replace aging vessels in the field a high priority.

Ms. SNOWE. In recent years, drug seizures by the Customs Service have increased significantly. This progress is due in no small part to the Customs agents who put their lives on the line to help stem the flow of illegal narcotics into the United States. Protecting our borders and reducing the proliferation of narcotics is an enormous challenge. 
It is imperative that we maintain the viability of our drug interdiction program and the fleet we use to enforce our drug laws on the high seas. I believe procurement of drug interdiction vessels would be an invaluable investment in our drug interdiction program. 
In 1995, the U.S. Customs Service entered into a contract to build 82-foot `blue water' vessels for drug interdiction. As I mentioned, the contract was effective through FY 1999 but no vessel has been built. 
These vessels have a proven track record, and the contract was awarded by Customs in anticipation of resources for replacement vessels. However, the FY 1995 budget request proposed a 50-percent reduction in Customs marine program operations and staffing. The Congress restored some of the funding for this program. However, no additional funds were appropriated to Customs for the replacement costs of vessels.

Ms. SNOWE. I am grateful to Senator Campbell and Senator Kohl for their leadership on this important program. In the Committee's report on FY 1999 Customs' appropriations, the Committee recognizes the importance of the blue water vessels as a central component of the marine interdiction strategy, and urges the Customs Service to maintain its fleet of blue water vessels at a level which is safe for its agents. 
I understand the delicate funding balance that the Customs Service and the Committee must strike. I had hoped to see some replacement blue water vessels built in FY 1999. Unfortunately, it was not possible to allocate the funding for this purpose this year. However, we should not let this opportunity to upgrade these vessels slip by--I believe we should ensure that the option to fund these vessels remains in the event that funding becomes available next year. 
Again, Customs already has a contract to build these vessels on demand scheduled to expire in the 1999 fiscal year. I strongly believe that Customs should extend this contract.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the two Capitol Police Officers who gave their lives to protect members of Congress, their staffs and visitors from throughout the world during last Friday's tragic shooting at the United States Capitol. 
For those of us who work in the Capitol, Special Agent John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut were among the people who are part of our daily lives. And over the twenty years I have served in Congress, I've been constantly impressed with their courteous manner and their friendliness and the way they know all of us by name, all the while maintaining the highest degree of professionalism in carrying out their solemn duties. They become extensions of our staffs, and they become our friends. 
Sometimes, in the commotion of everyday life around here, it is easy to forget that each new day brings the potential for unknown dangers for these brave men and women. The fact is, those assigned to protect the sanctity and safety of the U.S. Capitol put themselves in harms way on a daily basis, and three days ago, two of them came to work in the morning never to return to the lives and families they loved. 
It is difficult for us to understand how a day which began like so many other summer days here on Capitol Hill could so suddenly end in violence and terror. Here beneath this dome of marble and stone; here behind these historic walls; and here at the epicenter of the world's greatest democracy; we feel somehow that such heinous acts are simply too incongruous with our noble surroundings to be possible. And yet, history and reality tell us they are, in fact, all too possible. 
It vividly brings back to me one such incident fifteen years ago, when I was in the House of Representatives. My future husband, Congressman Jock McKernan, and I were standing with others on the House floor when, right above us, two officers tackled a man brandishing a bomb in the House gallery. These two men unhesitatingly put the safety of the entire House chamber before their own, without questioning the danger they faced. 
Such was the case last Friday--as certainly more would have been injured or killed had it not been for the willingness of Special Agent Gibson and Officer Chestnut to put their lives on the line. Their actions not only prevented what could have been an even greater catastrophe, but sent a message to those who would violate the people's house that they will never prevail. 
During what I know is the most difficult of times for the families of Agent Gibson and Officer Chestnut, I hope it will be at least some measure of comfort for them to know that so many here and across America are keeping them in their thoughts and prayers. The entire nation shares in their sense of loss, and our hearts go out to the loved ones that these brave individuals have left behind. 
I also want to extend my sympathies to all the men and women of the Capitol Police force. They have lost two of their finest--men whose actions under the most dire circumstances have brought tremendous credit to the Capitol Police. As members of the force go about their vital duties, I want them to know that they have our fullest support, trust, and appreciation for all they do to keep us safe. 
Last Friday's shootings stunned the nation and affected us all in very personal ways. For those of us here on Capitol Hill, we lost two members of our family. And in Maine and throughout the country, people felt a sense of outrage that this symbol of freedom of democracy--the greatest public building in the country--would be stained with the mark of violence. 
Today, let us as a country be grateful that people like Special Agent John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice so that this building will always remain the people's house. Let us mourn their loss, celebrate their lives, and never forget their courageous deeds on behalf of all the citizens of our great Nation.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Authorization Act of 1998. This legislation authorizes appropriations for NOAA research, operations, and other activities, reforms the operation of NOAA's hydrographic activities, authorizes continuation of the NOAA Corps, requires the development of a revised NOAA fleet modernization plan, and makes administrative changes related to NOAA. 
Mr. President, I consider NOAA to be one of the most important agencies of the Federal government. It manages and conserves living marine resources; explores, maps, and charts the ocean and its resources; describes, monitors, and predicts conditions in the atmosphere, ocean, and space environments; and issue whether forecasts and warnings, among other missions. 
Certain specific NOAA activities are authorized through individual statutes such as the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the National Sea Grant College Program Act, and the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act. But many NOAA activities are conducted pursuant to longstanding general authorizations, and the specific details of these programs are determined administratively 
Congress last enacted a general NOAA authorization in 1992 (Public Law 102-567). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Authorization Act of 1992 authorized funding for NOAA programs through FY 1993. As Chair of the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries of the Commerce Committee, I think it is time for the Congress to pass an updated authorization for these NOAA programs. 
My bill authorizes funding in various accounts in fiscal years 1999 through 2001 for the National Ocean Service, the National Weather Service, the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service, the Office of Ocean and Atmospheric Research, the National Marine Fisheries Service, Program Support, Facilities, and Fleet Maintenance and Planning. 
Mr. President, the Congress should make a concerted effort to reauthorize NOAA's programs. This legislation will accomplish that objective and I would urge my colleagues to support it.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as the Senator from New Hampshire knows, I recently urged the Federal Trade Commission to reconsider their decision to close the Boston Regional Office and move all area activity for consumer protection and antitrust matters to New York City. The Boston office has served the people of Maine--and the rest of New England--well for over 40 years and I am concerned that thee may be adverse consequences as the Boston office is uniquely situated in New England to focus on fraud and deception issues that target senior citizens, or for unsubstantiated advertising claims that affect consumers' pocketbooks. 
The Boston office has been a leader in coordinating efforts to combat consumer fraud in the New England area, partnering with regional FBI and IRS officials in its efforts to detect fraud on the Internet. The office has also worked with Canadian officials on cross-border fraud. In addition, the office has been active in addressing false and unsubstantiated advertising claims that affect consumers' health and safety, for instance stopping a company from claiming that their calcium product prevented osteoporosis, or preventing misleading food safety claims for a food thawing tray, or stopping a company from selling water treatment devices that did not meet the claims made. 
The Boston office has also worked with senior citizens to detect and avoid telemarketing fraud specifically targeted at them, and also spends a great deal of its time performing other consumer and business outreach and educational services, including educational outreach to the next generation of consumers--the schoolchildren throughout New England. 
I hope that the FTC can be urged to first consider the findings of a GAO independent evaluation due out in September before they continue with their planned closure of the Boston Office in December.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, S. 2260 provides funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to support a joint marine aquaculture education project in Maine. The committee report lists the project sponsor in Maine as the Island Institute, but the actual sponsor is the Teel Cove Sea Farm. While Teel Cove is associated with the Island Institute, the two organizations are separate entities. In this case, Teel Cove is the chief sponsor of the project in Maine and should be listed as the recipient in the bill or report. I believe that this was the committee's intention. I would like to ask Senator Gregg if his understanding of this matter is consistent with mine, and also whether he would be willing to take appropriate action to ensure that a correction will be made and Teel Cove will be designated as the project sponsor in Maine.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great Maine company that this week celebrates a remarkable milestone--its 150th Anniversary. 
It was thirteen years before the Civil War began that the UNUM Corporation of Maine was founded as the Union Mutual Life Insurance Corporation. Since that time, UNUM has grown to employ more than 7,400 employees worldwide, and almost 3,800 in their World Headquarters in Portland alone--and has become an industry leader in the area of long term care disability insurance. 
We in Maine are proud of UNUM's growth and longevity--outstanding achievements that don't happen by accident. But what is even more impressive is UNUM's commitment to providing an outstanding environment for its employees. Indeed, UNUM has been recognized by Fortune magazine as one of the nation's top 100 employers, and named as a leading `family-friendly' company by both Business Week and Working Mother magazines--evidence that UNUM's vision and innovation is garnering accolades throughout the professional world. In fact, UNUM has been on Working Mother's list a remarkable nine years in a row. 
From the standpoint of one who has consistently fought in Congress for opening up possibilities and opportunities for women in business, as well as family-friendly legislation such as the Family and Medical Leave Act, I appreciate UNUM's commitment to fostering a work environment that recognizes that the values of hard work and family are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, UNUM's philosophy shows that responding to employees' concerns is not only the right thing to do, it's also sound business practice. 
In particular, I applaud UNUM's commitment to providing safe, affordable child care options to employees. UNUM was one of the first companies in America to establish an on-site child care center, and UNUM subsidizes child care costs for qualified employees. Hopefully, this will blaze a trail that others in corporate America will be eager to follow. 
UNUM also exemplifies the principles of corporate citizenship, and the corporation as a partner in the community. UNUM has consistently been a responsible and integral member of the Portland community--where most of their employees live--and UNUM will be celebrating their anniversary in part with a day-long community service effort involving thousands of employees and hundreds of projects. I commend UNUM's dedication to the community and to the use of corporate resources for the betterment of others, and believe that their model is one which should be replicated throughout the country. 
This tone of corporate responsibility is set at the top, and UNUM President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Orr deserves much of the credit. A recent article in Portland's Maine Sunday Telegram elaborated on Jim's many talents, saying that, `he preaches a gospel of shared goals, clear vision and intense focus'. A member of UNUM's board of directors stated, simply, `The guy knows how to lead'. Obviously, he has used that skill to build a company that not only knows how to satisfy the bottom line, but to set an example for others to follow. 
Mr. President, in Maine we like to speak of `the way life should be', and we cherish a quality of life that is second to none. UNUM exemplifies `the way business should be' and for 150 years--that's two-thirds of this nation's existence--it has been contributing to the effort to build an even better Maine in which to live, work, and raise a family. Again, I congratulate the leadership of UNNM, and the outstanding employees who have guaranteed the company's success over the past 150 years.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this amendment will help ensure that America's veterans get the health care and services they deserve as close to home as possible. 
My amendment does two things: It expresses the sense of the Senate that it should be the goal of the VA to serve all veterans at health care facilities within 250 miles of their homes, and minimize travel distances if specialized services are not available at a health care facility operated by the VA within 250 miles of a veteran's home. 
Second, it mandates that the VA submit a report to Congress on the estimated cost to and impact on the health care system administered by the VA of making specialty care available to all veterans within 250 miles of their homes. 
Mr. President, I represent a rural state, Maine, which is served by one Department of Veterans Affairs facility, the Togus VA Medical Center outside the state's capital, Augusta. Many of Maine's veterans already must travel hundreds of miles just to reach Togus--and often, if specialized services are required, they must travel even further to facilities in Boston. This means long drives, frequently in terrible weather, and separation from the vital support that family and friends can provide. 
This is not a problem limited to Maine--far from it. It is a problem that exists anywhere where there are vast distances between cities--out west, in the heartland, and down south. 
The level of our commitment to this nation's veterans should not be contingent upon the whims of geography. I understand the financial constraints under which the VA must operate, however, the debt we owe our veterans will never be repaid until we do all we can to ensure that all our nation's veterans have appropriate access to services. 
Mr. President, this amendment does not all any additional funding to the VA/HUD bill. All it does is to recognize that there is a serious disparity in terms of veterans' access to the services which they earned and to which they are entitled, encourage the VA to make a priority of serving all veterans equally, and require the VA to explore the situation further. 
I think we can all agree that we owe our veterans that much. I know that the VA is facing challenging times, but my hope is that the VA will also recognize that our veterans are facing serious challenges in accessing the services they were promised. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.

Mr. President, I rise today to thank the distinguished Chairman of the FY99 Subcommittee for Agriculture, Rural Development, FDA and Related Agencies appropriations for honoring the requests of Senator Collins and myself for additional funding of $300,000 to fund a scientist and technical support for the New England Plant Soil, Water and Research laboratory at the University of Maine in Orono. I also greatly appreciate the fact that the appropriators have also agreed that the lab, which has been threatened with closure in the President's FY99 budget, should remain open. 
This lab, under the capable leadership of Dr. C. Wayne Honeycutt, conducts research to develop and transfer solutions to problems of high national priority in the potato industry and is critical to the State of Maine, its potato growers, and its economy. Ninety five percent of New England's potato acreage is in Maine, and this lab has the benefit of being in close proximity to growers' fields. The additional funding provided by the appropriations will preserve and expand this vital research program and maintain New England's only agricultural research laboratory, and I thank Senator Cochran for his attention to our requests.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, we have before us the important task of reauthorizing the Higher Education Act for the next five years. I rise today in support of reauthorization, and I want to congratulate my friend, the Chairman, Senator Jeffords, for his efforts to bring the Senate a bill that makes a higher education more affordable to all Americans. 
The Higher Education Act of 1998 continues a vital component of our nation's commitment to providing the very best education possible to our citizens. In particular, it is the programs reauthorized in this bill that to a great degree determine the shape of our federal presence in postsecondary education. In fact, nearly all of the available federal student aid, and about 70 percent of all financial aid awarded to postsecondary students, comes as a result of this act. And overall, Higher Education Act programs are responsible for an estimated $35 billion in grant, loan, or work-study assistance. 
As we all know, the principal objective of the HEA is to expand postsecondary education opportunities, particularly for low income individuals, as well as increasing the affordability of postsecondary education for moderate income families. Since 1966, the Guaranteed Student Loans Program within the Higher Education Act--now called the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL)--has provided over $143 billion to students. In 1993, the program reached an all time high of $16.5 billion in new loans. 
Today, at a time when 71 percent of Americans--71 percent--think a college education is not affordable for most families, building on these successes is all the more pressing. That is why, throughout the reauthorization process, I have expressed the belief that it is critical we ensure the student loan program is strengthened in ways that will increase access. 
I have always said that there is more to balancing the budget than making our debits equal our credits. Rather, it's about leadership, fiscal responsibility and being visionary in our investments. In order to survive the many multi-faceted challenges of the 21st century, we will have to invest heavily --more than ever before--in giving the essential tools to our country's greatest natural resource: today's students who are tomorrow's workforce. 
That's why, as a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I have continuously fought to make education a priority during the balanced budget debate, and--specifically--have fought to preserve funding for the Student Loan program. In a world of increasing global competition, now is NOT the time to be reducing the Federal commitment to higher education! 
The fact is, education is the great equalizer in our society that can give every citizen of our nation--regardless of race, income, or geographic background--the same opportunity to succeed in the global economy of the 21st century. This point is especially important when one considers that of the new jobs that are being created--and will be created--more than half of the new jobs that are being created will require education beyond high school. 
Education is also the biggest single factor in the so-called `income gap'. Consider these statistics from the Census Bureau: In 1990, for example, the average 
income for high school graduates was almost $18,000. But those who had 1 to 3 years of a college education, earned on the average $24,000. And those who graduated from college and received a college diploma received an average salary of $31,000. We simply must ensure that our young people have access to our system of higher education if they are to succeed in the changing global environment and maximize their earnings potential. 
That's why the bill we're considering is so important. It maintains and improves the various grant, loan, and work study assistance programs already available under the Higher Education Act. It reduces the interest rate on student loans. It increases the maximum Pell Grant award by $200 per year, up to $5,800 by 2004. It removes various barriers for independent students seeking financial assistance. And it cancels loans for students who agree to teach for at least three years in high-need areas. 
This is a significant step forward in our commitment to building a brighter future for the generations that will succeed us. I want to thank the members of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources for their work on this bill, and in particular the Committee Chairman, Senator Jeffords, for accommodating some of my concerns in his manager's amendment. Because the federal role in higher education extends beyond loans, I believe that the changes which were incorporated have made for a stronger bill, and I appreciate his willingness to work with me on their inclusion. 
The first provision increases the personal liability and responsibility of owners of proprietary schools to ensure their students receive the education that they were promised and purchased. This is important when you consider what happened to students at the Maine Academy of Hair Design, where the school was closed and the students left without recourse--or the education they paid for. I am pleased that the House bill already contains this provision, and its inclusion in the Senate version will ensure that it will be adopted in the upcoming House-Senate conference. 
The second provision requires the General Accounting Office in consultation with the Inspector General at the Department of Education to issue a report to Congress outlining changes in federal law, and changes in administrative procedures at the Department, that would ensure property transfers, such as the recent one involving Nasson College and its former owner in my home state of Maine--could be prevented in the future. In the case of Nasson, the Department of Education conducted an auction in which purchaser and seller represented the same individual--the person ultimately responsible for paying on the mortgage, who for ten years had failed to make payments toward the $600,000 he owned to the Department, or to pay $28,500 in back property taxes to the community. It is an outrage--but, according to the Department of Education, perfectly legal. The language in the bill will help us in rewriting the law to prevent this from happening again. 
And finally, I am pleased that the Committee, during markup, included a provision I authored along with Senator Dodd to address the needs of low-income students who are parents. The `Child Care Access Means Parents in Schools' provision, or `CAMPUS', authorizes three-year grants to institutions of higher education to support or help establish a campus-based child care program serving the needs to low-income student parents. The Secretary will award grants based on applications submitted by the institution, and the grant amount will be linked to the institution's funding level for Pell Grants, in order to assure that the program reaches low-income students. 
Senator Dodd and I have worked together before on child care issues and I want to thank him for his leadership on the CAMPUS Act. 
The bottom line is, students are more likely to remain in school, and to graduate sooner and at a higher rate, if they have CAMPUS-based child care. These services are particularly critical for older students who go back to school to get their degree or to improve their skills through advanced education. This is especially important in today's economy, where people need to continuously train and retrain in order to meet the demands of high-tech jobs. 
Mr. President, this has been a carefully crafted bill that fulfills one of America's most important needs as we close out this century and look to the next. I wholeheartedly support this reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference report to H.R. 2676, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act. 
Mr. President, the people of this nation have watched as Congress has finally taken serious strides toward the reform of our federal tax collection arm--the Internal Revenue Service. They have watched and they have waited because they know that meaningful changes in the way in which we collect income taxes in this country is sorely needed and long overdue. 
Well, today we have an opportunity to send to the President a reform package that is not only meaningful, but one that will strike at the heart of some of the most serious abuses exemplified by some of the real-life horror stories we've all heard over the past few months. 
Indeed, the Senate Finance Committee in their hearings during the past year uncovered an agency that, in many instances, simply ran roughshod over taxpayers rights and the IRS' very own rules. 
Agents misused files, violated privacy, made arbitrary decisions concerning the payment of delinquent taxes, demoted those who sought to report improper tactics. They were evaluated on statistics based on seizures of personal property and finances; they lied and misled the public. In short, the high level of trust that must exist when people's privacy, dignity, and very livelihood are at stake had disintegrated into a quagmire of duplicity and dishonesty. 
Now, that's not to say that everyone at the IRS engages in such dubious practices. I have no doubt that the majority of Americans who work for the IRS are attempting to do an often unpleasant and thankless job with integrity and the best interests of the taxpayers at heart. 
Unfortunately, as is always the case, it is the transgressions of the few that foster the decay of the whole. In fact, I'm sure that the majority of the honest, hardworking people of the IRS would welcome a cleanup of the system just as much as any American taxpayer. 
This conference report provides such relief from the practices of the past and is a giant step forward in rebuilding the trust that has slowly but steadily been eroded over the years. It provides $12.9 billion over the next 10 years for reforms, which will include an oversight board to keep careful watch over the management and administration of the IRS. It shifts the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS, where it belongs. It provides relief for divorced or separated spouses who unwittingly become embroiled in the tax liabilities of their estranged husbands or wives. It requires the IRS to report annually to Congress regarding employee misconduct. In short, it helps put government back in the hands of those it is supposed to serve. 
We still have a long way to go in terms of simplifying our tax system--something we must do if we are to follow through on our promise to not only reduce the burdens of our archaic tax structure but to reduce instances of abuse. So, even with the passage of this legislation, our work will be far from done. But this bill will create a more level playing field between the IRS and taxpayers, and it will make the IRS more accountable to the American taxpayer. As I said when I spoke on this issue in May, the issue comes down to trust. The people of this nation must be able to trust that their government will be fair, will be discreet, will be responsive. Taxpayers should not fear the very institutions that are supposed to be serving them. 
The House put their overwhelming stamp of approval on their version of the legislation with a 426 to 4 vote, and passed the conference report 402-8. In the Senate, there was not one vote against the measure when we last considered it. It's now time that we send this bill to the President with the message that it has strong, bipartisan backing in Congress and the overwhelming support of the American people. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting for this Reform Act and putting `service' back into the IRS.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my Commerce Committee colleagues Senators Kerry, Stevens, and Hollings in introducing legislation today to reauthorize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Corps. 
The NOAA Corps is a uniformed officer service that fulfills a variety of important missions for the agency and the public. NOAA Corps officers manage the operations of NOAA's research and survey vessels, as well as its aircraft. They serve as pilots and navigators, and as key scientific and engineering personnel involved with the missions for which the vessels and aircraft are being used. These missions include fisheries research, hydrographic surveys, oceanographic research, and airborne research on hurricanes, among others. 
In addition to field missions, NOAA Corps officers perform a variety of shoreside tasks, from managing the ground support for the vessel and aircraft operations, to serving in management and technical support positions in offices throughout NOAA's line agencies. 
At the outbreak of World War I, personnel and equipment from the Coast and Geodetic Survey--one of NOAA's predecessor organizations--were transferred to the War Department for military missions during the war, and the personnel were given military commissions. In World War II, about half of the Survey's commissioned officers and vessels were transferred to the war effort. Although all Survey personnel resumed civilian duties after the war, the commissioned Corps has continued to exist since that time. 
But in recent years, some questioned whether it still makes sense to retain a uniformed Corps to perform these missions for NOAA. As part of its National Performance Review in 1994, the Clinton Administration determined that a uniformed Corps was no longer necessary, and it recommended that the organization be disestablished and replaced with a civilian staff. The Administration argued that the disestablishment of the Corps would result in some budget savings to the federal government and increase operational flexibility. 
Unfortunately, the Congress did not receive a legislative proposal for disestablishment from the Administration until May of last year, and in the interim, the Corps was subject to administrative hiring freezes and annual appropriations riders that whittled the Corps' ranks by more than 25%. Since last year, the Corps has continued to shrink through attrition. Understandably, the morale of the Corps members has been negatively affected by these actions and the uncertainty about their future. As a result of these developments combined, important NOAA operations have been negatively affected. 
Last fall, the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries, which I chair, held a hearing on the Administration's disestablishment proposal. The Administration claimed that the replacement of the Corps with civilian personnel would save $2 million or more annually for the Federal government, primarily because of lower retirement costs for a civilian workforce. But upon examination by the Subcommittee, these estimated savings appeared to be suspect. The non-retirement costs of a civilian workforce could be much higher than the Administration estimated, and the likelihood of finding qualified civilians to replace the Corps officers in a short period of time is likewise very uncertain. In my view, the budget savings achieved by disestablishing the Corps would be marginal at best, but the American people would be losing a highly dedicated and professional cadre of men and women to perform many of NOAA's essential missions. 
Very recently, the Administration reconsidered its disestablishment proposal and has decided to abandon it. The Administration now proposes to maintain a streamlined NOAA Corps of 240 officers. While I appreciate the Administration's willingness to honestly reassess a proposal that it had advocated since 1994, I fear that the 240 number is too low to effectively operate NOAA's vessels, aircraft, and associated support units. The bill that we are introducing today reauthorizes the Corps and establishes a force range of between 264 and 299 officers. This represents a substantial down-sizing of the Corps from a level of over 400 in 1994, but it ensures that a sufficient number of officers will be available to maintain NOAA's missions at a high level of effectiveness while providing a substantial degree of management flexibility to the agency. The bill also requires the Administration to immediately rescind the current moratorium on the commissioning of new officers and it requires the director of the Corps to be a Corps officer. 
This legislation is the product of careful examination and deliberation by the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries and it represents a responsible solution to a problem that has been lingering for four years. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the nomination of John O'Leary to be the next United States Ambassador to Chile, and my appreciation to the Foreign Relations Committee for their prompt and favorable review. I urge the Senate to do likewise. 
I know that Mr. O'Leary will be a credit to his fellow Mainers and the citizens of the United States. On June 13th, I was proud to join with my colleagues in the Maine delegation--Senator Collins, Representative Allen, and Representative Baldacci--to introduce this outstanding candidate to the Foreign Relations Committee. Mainers have had a long and proud tradition of service to this nation and John O'Leary is the latest individual to carry on this tradition. We in Maine are proud of him and know he will make the nation proud as well. 
Mr. O'Leary brings a wealth of talents to the table, and a review of his background reveals a man well-qualified for the demands and responsibilities of the post for which he has been nominated. 
Since his graduation from Yale Law School in 1974, John O'Leary has built an impressive career in law distinguished by a strong intellect and a commitment to the highest ethical standards. He is a leader in the American legal field, having recently served as the Chair of the American Bar Association's eleven-person Standing Committee on Environmental Law. He has also been entrusted with one of eight seats on the First Circuit Advisory Committee on Rules. 
Mr. O'Leary's outstanding leadership and organizational skills are also evidenced by his management of complex litigation. In fact, his efforts led one major national retailer to choose Mr. O'Leary's firm, Pierce Atwood, for its annual award for quality and value--the first time a law firm had ever been chosen from among the retailer's global vendors for such an honor. His analytical mind coupled with a studious attention to detail would be of tremendous benefit to the United States' interests in Chile. 
Mr. O'Leary is also no stranger to public and community service. His commitment to civic affairs in Maine are evidenced by his election to the City Council of Maine's largest city, Portland, and his service as Mayor. He has also contributed of his time and talents as a trustee and president of the Portland Public Library. 
Finally, John O'Leary's extensive background and interest in Latin American affairs would be invaluable to U.S.-Chile relations. His impressive resume includes participation on an arbitration panel for the Inter-American Commercial Arbitration Commission, working on a matter involving Venezuela; and service on a three member United States team that assisted Bolivia in sustainable development matters. From 1991 to 1997, Mr. O'Leary also served as President of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Committee of the Inter-American Bar Association (IABA), which was charged with overall responsibility for the IABA committee's activities in Chile and throughout the Americas. 
And finally, in March of 1997, he both chaired and organized a major conference in Argentina on `Development, the Environment and Dispute Resolution in the Americas'--which incidentally was the first such American Bar Association program ever run in South America. 
Mr. President, we in the Senate have the solemn responsibility of ensuring that those Americans we send abroad to represent our nation and her interests are individuals of the highest character and most outstanding qualifications. Today, we have before us a nominee who fulfills those criteria most ably. I met with Mr. O'Leary prior to his confirmation hearing and that meeting only confirmed what I have already stated--that I believe him to be an outstanding choice for Ambassador. He is a man of intellect and integrity, who knows how to work with people and knows how to get things done. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is about to act to confirm John O'Leary as our next Ambassador to Chile. It is a decision I believe all of my colleagues will be proud that we made.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington, Senator Murray, for taking the leadership on this issue once again. I am sure she shares my disappointment that we are even in the position we are in today that we have to offer this amendment. That this amendment is even necessary is regrettable. We will continue to offer it because we think it is important to make sure that women in the military have access to health care treatment, as well as their spouses and dependents of military personnel who are stationed overseas. Therefore, we will continue to offer this amendment to ensure that there is equal access to the high level of health care that the women who serve in our military have earned and deserve. 
We are here today, once again, because U.S. law denies the right to choose to the dependents of more than 227,000 service men and women stationed overseas, and it denies the more than 27,000 servicewomen who have volunteered to serve their country access to safe medical care simply because they were assigned to duty outside this country. 
I do not understand, Mr. President, why we insist on denying these women and the families of our Armed Forces their rights as Americans. We ask a great deal of our military personnel and their families--low pay, long separations, hazardous duty. When they signed up to serve their country, I do not they believe they were told they would have to leave freedom of choice at ocean's edge. It is ironic that we are denying the very people we ask to uphold democracy and freedom the simple right to safe medical care. 
The New York Times summed it up several years ago when they noted:  
They can fight for their country. They can die for their country. But they cannot get access to a full range of medical services when their country stations them overseas. 
The Murray-Snowe amendment would overturn the ban and ensure that women and military dependents stationed overseas 
would have access to safe health care. And I want to clarify that overturning this ban will not result in Federal funds being used to perform abortions at military hospitals. Federal law has banned the use of Federal funds for this purpose since 1979. 
From 1979 to 1988, women could use their own personal funds to pay for medical care they needed at overseas military hospitals. As we know, a new policy was instituted in 1988 that prohibited the performance of any abortions at military hospitals, even if paid for with personal funds. 
I should reiterate this point because I think it clearly is an important one. It is not the use of Federal funds or any public moneys; in fact, it is the use of one's own personal funds for this procedure. 
As Senator Murray illustrated, what are the choices for women who are stationed overseas and have to make a very difficult decision as to whether or not to have an abortion? She must either find the time and money to fly back to the United States to receive the health care she seeks or else possibly endanger her own health by seeking one in a foreign hospital whose quality of care cannot compare with ours. Or she may have to fly to a third country--again, where the medical services do not equate to those available at the base--if she cannot afford to return home. 
When people sign up for the service, we assure them that we will do our best to provide for them and their families as part of the arrangement that we make in return for their willingness to serve our country. Yet we prohibit women from using their own money to obtain the care they need at the local base hospital. They are all alone in a foreign country, facing a very difficult, wrenching, personal, difficult decision, and all we can say is, `Sorry, you are on your own.' 
The amendment that Senator Murray and I are offering here today is only asking for fair and equitable treatment. It says to our service men and women and their families: If you find yourself in this difficult situation, in order to ensure you receive safe and proper medical care, we will provide the service if you pay for it with your own money. 
I happen to believe we owe it to our men and women in uniform, and their families, the option to receive the care they need in a safe environment. They do not deserve anything less. 
I think it is really unfortunate that we are faced with this situation year in and year out in seeking what is equitable treatment for women who are serving in our military. Fourteen percent of the military is now represented by women. They vote, they pay taxes, are protected and punished under American law. They are serving in our military to protect the ideals and rights that this country represents. 
Whether we agree with abortion or not, we all understand that safe and legal access to abortion is the law of the land. It is a choice and it is a right that has been affirmed by the Supreme Court. This ban takes away a fundamental right of personal choice for them. I don't believe we should create a dual standard because one happens to serve in the military and happens to be stationed abroad. You have that choice in America. You have your choice of facilities within your own State. You can go where you want to make that decision to have access to that legal medical procedure. But when you are stationed abroad, it is another matter in terms of receiving the quality care that women deserve. 
They may well be required to travel to another country, not facing the same medical standards that one is accustomed to here in this country. 
This ban puts women at risk. It puts their health at risk and it puts their life at risk, because they may well be forced to seek unsafe medical care in other countries where the blood supply may not be safe, procedures are antiquated, equipment may not be sterile. I don't believe that, in addition to the sacrifices that people in the military already make, they are now required to add unsafe medical care to the list. 
I happen to believe that the Department of Defense in this country is required to give the same kinds of options and access to quality medical care. In fact, it is a constitutional right for women to have this choice, whether they are serving in the military or not serving in the military. Back in 1992, the Supreme Court rendered a decision in the case Planned Parenthood v. Casey. It said that Government regulation of abortion may not constitute an `undue burden' on the right to choose abortion. An undue burden is defined as having the `purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion.' 
Well, certainly a combination of military regulations and practical hurdles means that a pregnant servicewoman who needs an abortion, who makes that very difficult decision, may face lengthy travel, serious delays, high expenses to fly her home, substandard medical options, and restricted information. Therefore, in my opinion, the ban appears to unconstitutionally burden the right to choose of American servicewomen. 
So for all of these reasons, Mr. President, I hope that this body will do the right thing here today and overturn the ban that currently is in the statute so that it allows women to have the option to make a safe choice for herself and her well-being. 
Again, I should remind this body that it isn't a requirement that we now have to use Federal funds to pay for abortions. In fact, to the contrary, it allows women to use their own personal funds for that option--a decision they may have to make if they are stationed overseas in the military. At one time in our history, they had that option. But now, in the last few years, they have been denied that choice. I don't think it is right or fair to women who serve in our military. 
I urge this body to adopt the Murray-Snowe amendment. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. President, I just make several observations in response to some of the comments that have been made here this afternoon. First and foremost, this doesn't cost a single cent to the Federal Government. When we hear about the fact, well, it is going to cost some money because of the use of the hospital, the use of medical personnel, I think we all recognize the rates that are charged by hospitals today. They set a rate, they set a cost, a charge for recovery of all of the costs. The fact is, under Medicare and Medicaid, we reimburse hospitals and providers for a specific cost. So are we saying that we are not able to create a charge for that particular procedure and in this case the option to have an abortion? I doubt it. 
Obviously, the charge that is set is the recovery of all of the costs, all of the overhead. Hospitals all across America and throughout the world set that rate. So this doesn't cost a dime of taxpayers' money--not a dime. 
I think it is an important point to emphasize, that no public funds are used; it is only personal funds. 
Second, it has been mentioned: What is the law of the land? Row v. Wade is the law of the land, and it includes the constitutional right for a woman to have an abortion, to make that decision, to make that very difficult personal choice. And, in fact, between 1973 and 1988, it was permissible for a woman to have this procedure done at military hospitals, and between 1993 and 1995 the same was true. Unfortunately, in the years in which it wasn't allowed, we were denying a woman's right. Unfortunately, it got embroiled as to whether or not you were pro-life or pro-choice. 
That is not the issue here. It should not be the issue. The issue should be whether or not a woman who serves in the military, who has an overseas assignment, has access to the same health care as everyone else who serves in the military--in this case, with an abortion procedure, using her own personal funds. That is the issue here. That is why this right was allowed between 1973 and 1988 and between 1993 and 1995. It was permissible because it is the law of the land for a woman to have the right to choose. 
The fact is, because she goes across the border of the United States, she all of a sudden loses her right to make this decision and is denied access to quality care. So, that is the issue here today. It is not a question of using public funds, because that is not what this amendment is all about; it never has been. It is a question of whether or not a woman in the military who is assigned overseas is going to be treated differently, treated as a second-class citizen, being the victim of a double standard because individuals have differences over whether or not women in America have a right to choose. 
Because she is in the military, because she is assigned overseas, she should not be treated any differently and she should not be required to leave those rights behind. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished Senator from Georgia, I offered an amendment incorporated into this bill requiring the President to explain to Congress the goals and potential endpoint of any military contingency operation involving more than 500 troops. Our provision furthermore mandates this report whenever the administration submits a budget request for the operation. 
During its June 9th Executive Session, the Armed Services Committee unanimously approved this amendment, and I am grateful for the eloquent expressions of support made by Senators Thurmond and Levin. 
The Snowe-Cleland amendment, Mr. President, received the Committee's broad endorsement regardless of our differences over the scope and purpose of U.S. contingency operations because Senators from both parties agree that the administration must express its mission objectives in tandem with a funding request. 
The President, however, has ignored this obligation in seeking funds to sustain our units in Bosnia. By the end of Fiscal Year 1999, the administration will have budgeted an estimated $9.4 billion for our participation in the Bosnia Stabilization Force since the completion of the Dayton peace accords. But it has never offered us a comprehensive readiness and mission assessment of U.S. Contingency Operations (CONOPS) policy to justify the expenditure of these funds. 
Our amendment, therefore, mandates a dual report on the `clear and distinct objectives' that `guide the activities of United States forces' as well as the proposal of an approximate date, or set of conditions, `that defines the endpoint' of a contingency operation. 
Congress, Mr. President, needs more constructive guidance in advance from the administration as the era of peacekeeping claims billions of dollars in funding that might otherwise go to core readiness and modernization programs. 
Approximately 47,880 American soldiers have undertaken 14 international contingency operations between 1991 and 1998. As a result, we need to match the administration's policy arguments with its budget demands to determine if the Pentagon has a clear peacekeeping strategy that reflects the major security interests of the United States and its allies. 
We did not have the benefit of this policy blueprint the first time that Congress approved Bosnia mission funding to monitor the Dayton peace accords with the FY96 budget. One year later, when the incremental cost of the Bosnia operation totaled $2.28 billion, we still had no mission guidance. 
For FY98, the House and Senate appropriated two packages of $1.5 billion and $490 million a few months after a Presidential press conference that made our commitment in the Balkans open-ended. 
And in FY99, Mr. President, the White House would not even label its Bosnia funding request. It chose instead to place $1.86 billion in an ambiguous `emergency operations' category and forced the Senate Armed Services Committee to move this sum into the defense budget. 
When the Committee took this action last month, we did not know, after almost a three-year deployment, the conditions that would set the stage for an orderly force withdrawal. 
We did not know whether adequate stability had been achieved so that diplomats and community leaders could build self-sustaining civic institutions. 
We did not know why the administration extended the time frame of our deployment three times since November 1995. 
And we did not know, Mr. President, for how long and to what end the White House planned to keep rotating thousands of Service people in and out of the Bosnian vortex. 
Were our troops creating a Bosnian security environment for political reconciliation, or digging deeper into a country with a peace agreement that everyone signed but no one accepted? 
The administration cannot expect either Congress or the taxpayers to plow billions of dollars every year into protracted peacekeeping exercises. Our Bosnian experience teaches us that we will achieve clarity of goals and accountability in financing if the President develops a strategy before he submits a funding request, not as he asks for more to do what remains unclear. 
Ironically, this amendment stipulates what the administration once declared as its own strategy. Presidential Decision Directive 25 of May 1994 outlined the scope and purpose of the administration's contingency operations policy. It promised the application of strict standards to determine whether the U.S. should participate in any overseas peace operation. The reporting categories specified by my amendment intentionally overlap with the President's directive. PDD-25 specifically declared that potential CONOPS commitments would depend on `clear objectives' and an identifiable `endpoint.' 
As the new century unfolds, the need for a rational peacekeeping policy, as promised by PDD-25, will only grow. The May 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review concluded that `the demand for smaller-scale contingency operations is expected to remain high over the next 15 to 20 years' while also acknowledging that peacekeeping commitments could cause a `chronic erosion' of procurement funding. 
At the same time, the National Defense Panel, created by Congress to review the guidelines of the QDR, analyzed the Pentagon's peacekeeping policy as one that forces troops `too often and too quickly' into disputes of a purely political or diplomatic character. 
This year, the Armed Services Committee received Navy and Air Force Posture Statements that contained warnings of negative readiness impacts from long contingency deployments. Navy Secretary Dalton specifically cited the `requirements of the Unified Commands'--those that participate heavily in peacekeeping missions--as effecting the readiness of non-deployed fleet units. 
The number of Air Force personnel dedicated to contingency operations grew fourfold since 1989 to 14,600 by FR97. `Caution indicators,' as the report summarized it, have emerged in the areas of retention, reenlistment, and depleted inventories of spare parts. 
In addition, by October 1999, the Army, the most peacekeeping intensive of the Services, could lack the heavy armored divisions designed for rapid deployment to crisis areas. Two of the divisions that train full time for this mission may have one-third of their troops on duty in Bosnia or Kuwait. 
In FY94, the Army had 541,000 active duty soldiers and no commitments in Bosnia, and the Armed Services Committee considered this level the minimum necessary for effective crisis response. Yet today, the Army faces the challenge of preparing for two Major Theater Wars, at a reduced force strength of 491,000, and with a deployment in Bosnia. 
We must act upon these warning signals from military leaders, Mr. President, by aligning the law with the new requirements placed on our war fighters. It only makes common sense to mandate a contingency operations policy rationale with a contingency operations budget request. I therefore commend the Senate for adopting the Snowe-Cleland amendment.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Authorization Act. This legislation focuses on the military of tomorrow by establishing priorities that will allow American forces to prepare for the conflicts of the 21st Century. 
We consider this measure under the leadership of a remarkable Senator whose personal sacrifice and professional insight have contributed to the molding of the military in our time. The public life of Strom Thurmond has reflected the evolution of conflict and war fighting capabilities in the last half-century. Emerging as a Colonel from World War II, he persevered through the traumas of Korea and Vietnam; the turbulent `hollow force' years of the 1970s; the recovery of our might under President Reagan; the collapse of imperial communism; and the computer-age attacks during the Persian Gulf War. 
Today, he manages a bill that capitalizes on the lessons of the military history to which he contributed. The FY99 Defense Authorization Act increases the speed, precision, and analytical capacity of soldiers who will face post-Soviet adversaries as determined or dictatorial, but more numerous, than those whom we have confronted in the past. 
While he steps down at the end of the year as Committee Chairman, his leadership will resonate in our deliberations and hearings for years to come. He brings an authorization before the Senate this week having groomed three generations of successors in the byzantine ways of defense legislation. 
Mr. President, this bill includes several programs that enhance the readiness and modernization of the military. Our Committee has worked diligently during the 1990s to control the bleeding of funds from next-generation procurement systems and the stress on our forces from escalating peacekeeping commitments. President Clinton's out-year budget projections bring defense outlays as a percentage of GDP to 2.7 percent, the lowest level in almost 50 years. The President targets the military as the only federal function that sustains deep outlay decreases between 1993 and 2003. While mandatory domestic expenditures will increase over time by 23.6 percent, those for national defense fall by exactly the same level. 
In modernization accounts--those for weapons procurement--funding has fallen by 67% since 1985. This trend, in constant dollars, means that at the height of the Reagan build-up thirteen years ago, the Pentagon obligated $138.7 billion for procurement. This spending fell to its lowest point--$44.2 billion--in FY97. The FY99 budget finally increases the account to $48.7 billion, and I commend Secretary Cohen for submitting the first budget by this administration that brings procurement back to the annual average threshold of $60.1 billion, as recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, starting in 2001. 
Exploding expenditures for peacekeeping operations since the end of the Persian Gulf War directly threaten spending for procurement and modernization. To confirm this point, we only need to read the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). Among all Pentagon programs, the QDR singled out `incremental costs of unplanned deployments and smaller-scale contingencies' as the `least predictable operating expenses' which `displace funding previously planned for procurement.' 
America's 29 contingency operations since the end of the Persian Gulf War have cost us a total of $18 billion. Our Bosnia commitment alone has consumed $7.2 billion. Even excluding Bosnia, the American taxpayers gave another three billion dollars just to support U.N. peacekeeping programs throughout the 1990's. The administration, however, has never offered us a comprehensive readiness and mission assessment of U.S. Contingency Operations (CONOPS) policy to justify or rationalize the expenditure of this $21 billion, or eight percent of the whole defense budget. 
The Committee, therefore, supported an amendment that I offered along with Senator Cleland during the mark-up session making the Pentagon statutorily responsible for providing all congressional defense committees with a Contingency Operations budgetary, mission, and readiness assessment by January 31, 1999. We did not establish the deadline by coincidence. I strongly believe that the Committee should consider any CONOPS authorization or supplemental appropriations requests next year only with the benefit of the president's strategic analysis of how and why the Armed Services will obligate their peacekeeping budgets. 
This amendment subsequently directs the department to address five issues: the effects of ongoing CONOPS on Service retention and reenlistment rates; whether they cause sustained or significant shortages of military personnel and equipment in other regions of the world; the specific programmatic accounts on which the department has relied to underwrite CONOPS deployments; what clear objectives guide each of these undertakings; and the conditions, based on such objectives, that would define the end of each operation. 
Presidential Decision Direction 25 of May 1994, Mr. President, outlined the scope and purpose of the administration's CONOPS policy. It promised the application of strict standards to determine whether the U.S. should participate in any overseas peace operation. 
The reporting categories specified by my amendment intentionally overlap with this directive. PDD-25 specifically declared that potential CONOPS commitments would depend on whether our participation advanced U.S. interests, the `unique and general risks' to American personnel, if `clear objectives' could determine the role of our forces, and the identification of an `endpoint.' 
We would not impose an unfair burden on the Defense Department by mandating a pre-posture hearing or pre-budget request report on the steps that the administration has taken to implement its own plan. 
This year, the Committee received Posture Statements from the Navy and the Air Force that contained warnings of potential negative readiness impacts as a result of long CONOPS deployments. Secretary Dalton cited the `requirements of the Unified Commands'--those that participate heavily in peacekeeping missions--as effecting the readiness of non-deployed fleet units. 
The number of Air Force personnel dedicated to contingency operations grew fourfold since 1989 from 3,400 to 14,600 by FY97. `Caution indicators,' as the report characterized it, have emerged in the areas of retention, reenlistment, and depleted inventories of spare parts. 
In addition, by October 1999, the Army, the Service most involved in peacekeeping, could lack the heavy armored divisions designed for rapid deployment to crisis areas. Two of the divisions that train full time for this mission may have one-third of their troops on duty in Bosnia or Kuwait. 
Four years ago, the Army had 541,000 active duty soldiers and no commitments in Bosnia. The Armed Services Committee, according to former Chairman Nunn, considered this level the minimum necessary for responding to two regional crises. Yet today, the Army faces the challenge of preparing for two Major Theater Wars at a reduced force strength of 491,000, coupled with a deployment in Bosnia. 
Consider the exorbitant contingency operations costs that the Army absorbed in just one fiscal year. The amount, $1.5 billion, represented more than one-fifth of the entire research and development budget for the Service. It exceeded the total Army aircraft procurement line by almost two hundred million dollars. If we take these examples of the strains imposed by peacekeeping commitments on Army research and hardware programs, how can the administration state that it has adequately weighed the `unique and general risks' of these missions, as required under PDD-25, to our people in uniform? 
Despite the alarming budgetary trends, the QDR predicts that contingency efforts will dominate the Pentagon's planning agenda over the next two decades. The law, Mr. President, must also move in this direction by requiring a CONOPS policy rationale with a CONOPS budget request. My amendment supports this transition by mandating the first pre-budget report to Congress on the national security and OPTEMPO implications of our increased contingency commitments. 
Whether for contingency operations or more traditional missions, naval modernization programs will remain vital to the overseas projection of American forces. As a result, I salute the Chair of the Seapower Subcommittee--Senator Warner--for this support of the $2.680 billion continuation of the DDG-51 multi-year destroyer procurement, the $2.003 billion going to produce the second ship of the New Attack Submarine class, and the $639 million going for the next LPD-17 Amphibious Transport Ship. In addition, I am pleased that the Subcommittee fully authorized the Navy's $85 million DD-21 land-attack destroyer Research and Development request to keep this new effort on schedule and within budget. 
These four programs meet the Navy's requirements for the type of warfare that will dominate our military strategy of the future: littoral operations near coastal plains. Littoral engagements require the Navy to maneuver `close enough to influence events on shore if necessary.' This post-Soviet mission continues to match our force structure with our security interests since 80 percent of the world's population lives near the coastal areas and waterways that open into the littorals. 
Littoral concepts of war stem directly from the changing worldwide political environment in which the United States operates. Soviet power no longer threatens the open plains of Central Europe. Soviet ships and submarines no longer prepare for platform-to-platform battles on the open seas. For the first time since the end of World War II, a Pentagon planning document, the QDR, steered the military in the direction of deterring conflict and instability wherever it might occur rather than containing a single enemy force. 
The surface ship and submarine programs authorized in this bill will provide the Navy more firepower and endurance at a lower cost. Smooth and modular construction materials will deceive the enemy radars that can detect the hard angles of older vessels. Electronic integrators will give ships and submarines split-second systems for communications and munitions targeting. A new series of rapid transporters will bring unprecedented levels of forces and weapons to the shorelines of instability or humanitarian rescue. From safe distances at sea, smaller crews will program missiles for strategic inland targets. 
A littoral Navy, Mr. President, also corresponds with lower life-cycle costs. Carriers and surface combatants will carry more firepower and fewer people. This development, in addition to a greater reliance on commercial `off-the-shelf' technologies, holds the promise of decreasing maintenance expenditures by between 50 and 70 percent. 
We also cannot forget that political limitations as well as political changes shape the new Navy. The visible and invisible forward presence provided by the Fleet assumes greater importance in an age when we no longer enjoy permanent bases throughout Europe or Southern Asia. As a result, the administration will increasingly rely on the Navy as a key agent of force behind our diplomacy. 
For this reason, I was honored to participate in a Subcommittee markup that also expanded naval air programs. To stabilize the transition from the Nimitz-class of nuclear aircraft carriers to the new-generation CVX system, the Subcommittee allocated $124.5 million for acceleration of advance procurement and component construction of the CVN-77 system. We furthermore instructed the Navy to invest carrier research and development budgets in a way that will directly enhance the planned capabilities of the CVX. Our mark-up also placed the P-3 Orion Anti-Surface Warfare Improvement Program on an efficient 12-month modification track. 
The changing mix of threats to our national security represented by these maritime and other high-technology defense programs finally influenced the Committee vote against authorizing another base closure (BRAC) round. 
This amendment tried to address two of the many problems with the BRAC process: the fact that no law guarantees the proper investment of any quantifiable returns from base closures, and the president's temptation to manipulate commission rulings in his own political interest. 
But the Committee rejected the BRAC amendment because it did not, nor could it, solve the fatal flaws in the process. No base closure round, Mr. President, has yielded the taxpayers any clear or proven savings. We do not need to rely on the claims of congressional BRAC opponents to demonstrate this point. We only need to consider the conclusion of the leading advocate of BRAC: The Department of Defense. DoD's April 1998 base closure report to Congress states explicitly that `no audit trail, single document, or budget account exists for tracking the end use of each dollar saved through BRAC.' 
We can also turn to the findings of independent evaluators. Last summer, the GAO flatly told us that `DoD accounting systems are not designed to track savings.' The Congressional Budget Office concluded in December 1996 that the Pentagon `is unable to report actual spending and savings for BRAC actions.' Accounting uncertainties, Mr. President, have made apparent base closure savings a frustrating mystery rather than a confirmed fact. 
The Defense Department cannot continue to decide which installations to downsize or close by making arbitrary comparisons to personnel reductions. The standard should not focus, as DoD contends, on closing 36% of our bases if 36% of all people in uniform have left the military since the peak of the Cold War. The standard must remain the adaptation of infrastructure to new or developing security threats. But as it did last year, the administration rests the argument for more base closures on the premise that facility cuts have lagged behind those in personnel by 15 percent. 
A simple percentage, Mr. President, cannot answer the questions that should determine the future of domestic military bases. What depots, for example, do we require to provide competition with the private sector and to insure the precision and endurance of fighter aircraft? 
What shipyards can provide the Navy with a diversified industrial base to sustain the next-generation modular vessels that will maneuver in littoral waters? 
What air bases must stay active to support our long-range power projection capabilities now that we have a diminished forward presence in Europe and Southern Asia? 
These questions do not exhaust the list. But I raise them as examples of the factors absent in most of the base closure assessments that have come to Congress from the Pentagon. 
Page one of the April base report estimates that the military could save 21 billion dollars between 2008 and 2015 if we approve two more BRAC rounds. Even if the Committee had accepted this projection, the QDR acknowledges that it could re-capture $18 billion of this amount in three ways: by following through with DoD management reforms and technology upgrades, providing consistent guidance to the Services on budget priorities, and controlling the costs of contingency operations. 
The QDR indicated that this $18 billion dollar loss as from three specific causes, came exclusively from procurement accounts. It therefore has three specific plans, all of which relate to policy changes and internal reforms, and none of which relate to base closures, for restoring funds to modernization. The April base closure report even admits that if the Pentagon could quantify BRAC savings, there would be no guarantee that procurement programs might gain from the extra dollars because the four separate Services make their own investment decisions. 
To assert that the department cannot save $18 billion dollars through rigorous budget management, Mr. President, is to assert that it cannot follow the mandates of the QDR, which called for `reducing unneeded standards and specifications,' and the `leveraging of commercial technology.' 
And how unreasonable or impractical is it to control the level of unplanned expenditures on Bosnia through clear policy objectives? According to the administration, while it predicts extensive U.S. involvement in contingency operations beyond 2015, our engagement `must be selective, depending largely on the interests at stake and the risk of major aggression elsewhere.' 
The Clinton Administration advertises a commitment to multi-billion dollar defense management reforms while asking for base closures to generate savings that it can neither find nor re-invest. At the same time, it has submitted very real Bosnia bills that now exceed seven billion dollars and freeze our forces in a political vacuum. 
By rejecting the BRAC amendment, the Committee invited the administration to provide us with a more compelling plan that links facility to mission needs. In the meantime, DoD can also realize billions of dollars of savings through firm policy decisions about our overseas strategic interests, internal reforms, and Service programmatic goals. The Defense Department must continue to work directly with Congress on the issues that will improve the military of the next decade instead of shifting them to yet another panel for which we can claim no responsibility. 
Mr. President, the FY99 Authorization Bill accelerates the modernization of the Armed Services while recognizing the strong evidence of the degrading impact of open-ended contingency Operations on Personnel Tempos and unit readiness. It ultimately holds the Pentagon accountable for documented savings through policy and management reforms rather than accepting the unproven promises of BRAC savings that would come 15 years away. I therefore urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this responsible legislation.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment that has been offered by the Senator from West Virginia. As I said earlier, I was very much surprised that he would offer such an amendment because, first of all, last night, the Senate affirmed the position of supporting the initiative that was taken by this Senate last year in creating a commission to examine all of these far-reaching issues with respect to gender-integrated training. That vote was 56-37. It was a very strong vote in reinforcing the position of this body and, yes, this Congress, that we needed to have an independent analysis of many of the issues surrounding gender-integrated training. 
In fact, I was very much surprised because the author of this amendment, the Senator from West Virginia, was a primary cosponsor of the initiative that was introduced in the Senate last year to create this commission. I was a cosponsor of the amendment, and the prime sponsor was Senator Kempthorne as Chair of the Subcommittee on Personnel. We discussed that initiative in the committee. At first, I didn't think it was necessary. After all, we had the Kassebaum-Baker commission, and I didn't think we needed to duplicate those efforts. But as I thought about it, I realized how important it was to create a consensus on this issue because there were many Members within Congress and outside that were still concerned about various aspects of gender-integrated training at the basic training level. 
I visited many installations. I understand the importance of creating cohesiveness within a unit from day one. But I was also prepared to accept the compromise, and the compromise was the creation of this commission that was sponsored by Senator Kempthorne, cosponsored by the Senator from West Virginia and myself in the committee. 
I would like to read to you some words by the Senator from West Virginia in the committee last year, with reference to this commission. He said:  
May I thank and congratulate Senator Kempthorne in offering this amendment and conducting the hearings in relation to the subject matter of the amendment. I congratulate, also, the distinguished Senator from Georgia, Mr. Cleland, who was present at the hearings while Senator Snowe and all who participated took an active part. Let me say that I am a cosponsor of the Kempthorne amendment, and I thank Senator Kempthorne for including me as a cosponsor. It will give us an integrated set of conclusions and recommendations on the various parts of the military gender issue, including training, fraternization and adultery practices and regulations. It will allow us an independent review by a body selected by the Senate of the assessment and recommendations to be made by all 3 bodies, established by Secretary Cohen to look at the various elements of the issue. I congratulate Secretary Cohen as well, in absentia, for proceeding to take action as he has. The American people need to know we are thoroughly investigating and settling the great uncertainties that have arisen about the management of our Armed Forces. A national debate is underway on this issue, and if we do not resolve the issue satisfactorily, recruitment and retention may be seriously affected. The deadline of April 15, 1998-- 
Which we ultimately postponed and deferred. gives us ample time in the next session to act on whatever recommendations we may choose to act upon. 
The final legislation created a deadline of March of 1999, in which this commission will come back to this Congress and make recommendations with respect to all the issues that now have been included in the Byrd second-degree amendment. 
The second-degree amendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia includes all kinds of issues on basic training, separate platoons, separate housing--all of the issues that ultimately will be evaluated by this commission that is represented with a breadth of experience and qualifications by 10 different individuals--individuals that are appointed by the Chairman of the Armed Forces Committee here in the Senate, ranking members and the leadership here in the Senate, as well as the Chairman and the ranking member of the House National Security Committee and their leadership. 
But the commission will appoint individuals of knowledge and expertise in one or more of the following areas: 
Training of military personnel, social and cultural matters affecting military service, military training, military readiness, knowledge and expertise to be found through research, policymaking, practical experience as demonstrated by retired military personnel and members of the Reserve components of the Armed Forces, representatives from educational organizations, civilian, as well as other government agencies. They will look at functions related to gender-integrated training and segregated basic training--looking at all of the dimensions of these issues and the various components. 
So that is why I hope the Members of the Senate will reject the amendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia. I hope the Senate will elect to uphold the authority of this commission in place of legislative segregation of males and females living together during basic training and training together. We have separate housing for men and women in basic training. And gender-integrated training has been endorsed by every military leader who has come before the Senate Armed Forces Committee. It has been endorsed by the Secretary of Defense; the military chiefs of the Army, Air Force, and Navy; military training commanders; senior noncommissioned officers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; and the U.S. Army. Every uniformed person who has testified before the committee has endorsed gender-integrated training. 
We should not be legislating our assumptions, as this amendment would do which has been offered by the Senator from West Virginia. Rather, we should, as we agreed to last year, allow a qualified panel of experts and former military leaders to consider the myriad questions that impact the effectiveness of gender-integrated training. 
We have instructed the panel to assess the historic and current rationale behind the implementation of gender-integrated training at all skill levels. It requires an opinion of the policy within basic training programs and teaching troops as they would operate. And, towards this end, there are five standards to which the commission must filter the training as operating concepts. It has to review adequate physical conditioning, technical skills, proficiency, knowledge, military socialization, to include the delegation of social values and attitudes, as well as basic combat proficiencies. 
Does anyone think in this Chamber that we can legislate answers and insights on these complex questions with the incentive of adjourning in time for a recess? Do we really think that we will be able to come up with the rationale necessary to govern basic training for our Armed Forces? 
Mr. President, and Members of this body, I hope we will reject the amendment that has been offered by the Senator from West Virginia. It certainly will contravene the intent of this Congress last year in creating a commission to examine all of these issues. But it also will contravene the judgment of all of our top military officials who have endorsed gender-integrated training. 
Then we have had the support of gender-integrated training by diverse groups such as the Rand Corporation, the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute, the Army Research Institute, and the Defense Advisory Commission on Women in the Services, or DACOWITZ. I would like to have you listen to a few of their recommendations.

Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair. 
The Byrd amendment goes even further than the amendment that was offered by the Senator from Kansas last night which we rejected by a vote of 56 to 37. 
The Byrd amendment would essentially eliminate all gender-integrated training at basic levels. The decision we made last night was to uphold the congressional commission that was created on military training and gender-related issues to complete its assessment and to report back to this Congress in March of 1999. 
This commission was created by Congress last year with the active cosponsorship of the Senator from West Virginia--in fact, in deference to the position he held on the issue of gender-integrated training. This commission is made up of 10 distinguished individuals who are selected by both the Armed Services Committee of the Senate and the House National Security Committee that will examine a myriad of gender-related issues 
and the relationship that gender-integrated adds to our performance levels, to readiness and cohesion and to the morale of our All Volunteer Force. Will we permit this panel of experts to deliberate on the views and the experiences of the commanders in the field, or are we going to decide this evening to legislate with an instant result through the Byrd amendment that defies the views of the Secretary of Defense, to the service chiefs of the Air Force, the Navy and the Army, the training commanders of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, the senior noncommissioned officers of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, or the Association of the U.S. Army, or every active duty service member who has testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee over the last 2 years. 
Yesterday, we chose the path of deliberation by a commission of our own design, rather than imposing on the military another set of regulations without the benefit of testimony from the field. 
The position of many of the military, including all of our top level military officers, support gender-integrated training, because they believe it is an anchor of that readiness. Far from an invention of social policy activists, they recognize that it is an absolute necessity in a military that cannot maintain an effective and efficient volunteer force without the contributions of our women in uniform. And it is a force multiplier, teaching service members the blend of operational skills, the codes of personal behavior necessary to our gender-neutral position, which is to win wars. 
Last night, we upheld the integrity of the commission that was created by this Congress.

Ms. SNOWE. Last night, we upheld the decision to uphold the integrity of the commission that we created that includes two retired Marine Corps generals, a retired master sergeant, two military sociologists, the former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management and the former Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Personnel. 
I urge Members of this Senate to reject the Byrd amendment and to support the views of those of us, including the Senator from West Virginia, that we should have a commission to provide an independent evaluation and analysis of gender-integrated training, and the importance of it to the readiness and the cohesiveness of our armed services. 
I urge the Senate to reject the Byrd amendment, that we confirm the action that was taken last year by this Congress, which was to create this commission, and to reaffirm the vote that was taken last night to support the commission in its work and to report back to this Congress. I yield the floor.

Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I appreciate this opportunity to address this body on the subject of an important issue and what it means, I believe, to the future of our Armed Forces. 
The participation of women in the armed services today is very important. As the Secretary of Defense said recently in reaffirming his support for gender-integrated training, and the recommendations of the services with respect to gender-integrated training, he said clearly that the military depends upon women. 
Women now represent 14 percent of our armed services. So their role and their well-being is an essential ingredient to upholding the importance of certain standards with respect to our national security and performance of our Armed Forces and personnel. 
I offered a second-degree amendment to the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas, because it will reaffirm the judgment that was made first in the Armed Services Committee last year to the DOD 1998 authorization. The amendment that was offered created a congressional commission to examine many of the issues that were raised by the Senator from Kansas. Obviously, they are not new issues. They are ones in which we have been wrestling with time and time again, not only here in Congress but, of course, within the Defense Department. 
There are no simple solutions. But what I find amazing in hearing the discussion with respect to women in the military and the gender-integrated training and the problems that have resulted from gender-integrated training, no one seems to raise the issue as to what about the responsibilities and the moral authority of those people who are in positions of leadership within our military? 
I have had the opportunity to visit many installations, including Fort Jackson, the one which the Senator from Kansas referred to and that his staff visited. I also visited that facility. I well remember the facilities that are there that separate men and women. Men and women are separated within the Army, within the Air Force, within the Navy. They have separate entrances. They have separate wings, separate bays, separate bathrooms, separate alarms. They have security guards, security cameras. So there are certain security measures that are already in place. Now the question has arisen as to whether or not we should have separate barracks. 
With all the misconduct and sexual harassment that has occurred that we have heard so much about over the last few years, much of it, interestingly enough, has occurred in advanced integrated training programs, not with basic training. But nevertheless, one of the critical areas that we must focus on is developing standards and upholding and enforcing those standards that are consistent with the well-being of both men and women who serve in our Armed Forces, the basic rights of all human beings, whether they are in the military or in the private sector. 
And these questions have to be considered as proposed by the Senator from Kansas through a simple disposition of an amendment? We in the committee last year said no, and, frankly, I was prepared to debate and fight this issue in the Chamber with respect to gender-integrated training, whether or not to have separate barracks, and so on and so forth. But in the good judgment and the wisdom of the committee, we decided to create a consensus-based amendment that was offered by the chairman of the Subcommittee on Personnel, Senator Kempthorne, Senator Byrd from West Virginia, and myself. We knew that the Department of Defense had already created its own commission to evaluate these questions and many more. We decided that it was also important to create a commission that was independent to evaluate these issues as well. 
Now we have to decide in this Chamber whether or not we should subjugate the recommendations of the commission that will be coming forward next spring to the amendment that is offered by the Senator from Kansas. I say not. This is a major and fundamental issue. How we proceed is important, and that is why the Committee on Armed Services approved an amendment that was included in the 1998 authorization to create this commission that is now part of law, and it was approved in the Senate and approved by Congress. So now we have to decide whether or not we are going to allow the Senator from Kansas to override the judgment of the members of this commission that will come forward with recommendations next spring. There will be 10 members of this commission that are appointed by the chairman and ranking member of the House National Security Committee and the ranking member and the chairman of this Committee on Armed Services in the Senate with consultation with the majority and minority leaders in both bodies. 
They represent a cross-section of experience, expertise on some of these critical issues--that is what we are welcoming--that is independent of the kind of decision that we can make here in an amendment that is offered by the Senator from Kansas without the examination and the evaluation of these issues. 
We have represented on the commission a Marine Corps general who commanded a division during Operation Desert Storm; we have a former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management; a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower; a board member of the Virginia Military Institute; the Provost of the University of Michigan, two military sociologists, a former Marine Corps Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower and Reserve Affairs and a retired sergeant major from the Training and Doctrine Command. The men and women in our commission have held these positions or are currently holding them. We should give them the opportunity to meet their responsibilities under law. 
The proponents of the amendment that is offered by the 
Senator from Kansas would require by the year 2001 the construction of separate barracks. It basically will not allow any flexibility by the service chiefs with respect to the construction of those facilities; that, yes, will cost more than $167 million to construct. It will not permit trainees, instructors, commanders, to offer their own assessments of whether the way the recruits live supports the process for developing a soldier. 
They should be in a position of making those decisions--in fact, have had the ability to accept the decision that was recommended by the Kassebaum-Baker Commission. In fact, the Secretary of Defense gave the service chiefs the opportunity to respond within 90 days to that recommendation as to how they wanted to proceed and to develop criteria on the basis on which they decide they would advance or implement those recommendations. The service chiefs responded. They all upheld their current status because they have made adjustments in the living quarters. They are separate. They are not in separate facilities, but they are in separate wings and bays, as I mentioned earlier, and they believe that the current process is working. They support gender-integrated training because they feel that this is the way in which you build a cohesive unit. 
We have thousands and thousands of women who are currently serving in Bosnia without complaint. We have had thousands and thousands of women serving in the Persian Gulf without complaint. We have had more than 1,000 women who participated in our operations in Somalia, and we have had no complaints. 
Are we now not saying that it is possible for men and women, on the day in which they begin their basic training, cannot work and train together as they will be required to do after their basic training, as they are required to do right now in Bosnia? We have over 5,000 women currently serving in Bosnia. In fact, the Washington Post had an in-depth story last year that described the circumstances under which both men and women were serving, and they were doing an extraordinary job without hindrance, without barriers, without complications under some most arduous of conditions. We had 41,000 women in the Persian Gulf. Did we hear of complaints? No. It is because they trained together. They understood the professionalism of their responsibilities, and they carried them out as we could expect them to do. They upheld the highest moral standards. 
The amendment that I offer here today reinforces the recommendation that was made by the Armed Services Committee last year by the creation of this commission to examine many of the questions that have been raised. Frankly, I had my doubts as to whether or not it was necessary to create another commission, but I also personally had to recognize that, in fact, many here in this Chamber and elsewhere had concerns about basic training and about gender-integrated training, and that perhaps the best way to proceed was to create another commission that would represent a breadth of experience and professionalism and qualifications and skills that are necessary to make the kinds of decisions that we would expect of them. 
Their mandate is substantial. We have more than 10 different areas with respect to gender-integrated training and all of the other dimensions to the question--the living conditions, the impact on readiness, on morale, on fitness standards, the rationale for the establishment or the disestablishment of gender-integrated or gender-segregated basic training, the rationale that was used at the time in which these decisions were made by the services to integrate training or to segregate in the case of the Marines, or assess whether or not the concept of training as you will fight is a valid rationale for gender-integrated basic training; 
identify the requirements that are unique to each of the services that could affect a decision by the Secretary considering adopting a gender-integrated or gender-segregated format for basic training; to examine all the facilities for feasibility or the implications of requiring drill inspectors to be of the same sex. 
There are a number of issues that are embodied in this statute that was approved by the Congress last year to the authorization that will be examined by the men and women who are serving on this commission. So the question is, Should we adopt the amendment by the Senator from Kansas or should we adopt the amendment that I have offered as a second-degree to the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas that will give this commission the opportunity to evaluate these questions so that we can make a reasoned, informed decision as to what approach should be taken by the military? 
This amendment that I have offered is supported by the civilian, the officer, and the enlisted leadership of the Pentagon to retain the current training programs at each of the armed services until this Commission on Military Training and Gender-Related Issues files its final report in March of 1999. It reaffirms this decision. It reaffirms the bipartisanship and the consensus that was produced last year in the Senate Armed Services Committee and in the Congress on these difficult issues of obtaining the most comprehensive use of professionals and military leaders outside of Congress. And the charter stipulates very clearly the aspects that will be examined of the training practices and the policy directives and the regulations that enumerate the professional relationships between men and women in uniform. It also assigns the commission the obligation and responsibility to evaluate the findings of the Kassebaum-Baker panel on gender-integrated training and the Pentagon's rules regarding fraternization as well as adultery. 
So we have to decide here whether we are going to approve my amendment that is supported by the Secretary of Defense and the service chiefs and many of the Members here in this body, or are we going to support the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas that presumes to answer this in three pages this afternoon with a new regulation imposing a $167 million military construction cost on the Defense Department. I think we have an obligation to give the commission the opportunity to work its will as we have asked them to do. 
I would like to read to you, Mr. President, some excerpts from the various letters and statements that have been made by the service chiefs and by the Secretary of Defense about the issues concerning gender-integrated training and separate barracks. The Secretary of Defense wrote to the chairman of our committee, Senator Thurmond:  
Training in the Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps is a complex matter given each Service's unique mission, traditions and conditions of service. Each Service has their own approach in how they conduct basic training. This training must not be characterized by any one issue such as billeting or any one policy such as the extent of gender integrated training. We must, however, identify the right set of standards to produce a safe and secure environment for the rigorous training our young men and women need for military service. 
This is exactly what the Department is doing. We are making sure that we have the very best personnel to staff our training establishments and to serve as role models for our new recruits. . . . * * * * * 
I urge you not to tie the Department's hands by enacting legislative provisions that address one or two components of a far more complex force management issue. 
I should remind Members of the Senate, there are about 30 recommendations that were made by the Kassebaum-Baker Commission back in December; 28 of those 30 recommendations were implemented by the Secretary of Defense--28 of the 30 recommendations. But let's hear from the United States Army, again, in a letter to the chairman of the committee, Chief of Staff, General Reimer. He says in his letter: 
Segregating their units into gender unique platoons for training and billeting the soldiers by gender in separate buildings will degrade the commander's ability to command and control his or her unit. 
Admiral Johnson, Chief of Naval Operations, said in a letter to the chairman: 
During basic training, Navy's gender-integrated divisions perform at least as well as their all-male counterparts. * * * * * 
We agree wholeheartedly that Sailors in basic training must have safe, secure housing and living arrangements that promote effective training. But Sailors should also learn to live and work together from the first day of training. This is how they will serve at sea, as part of a gender-integrated unit. * * * * * 
I ask that you continue to allow Navy to build our gender-integrated team from the first day of basic training. 
Admiral Pilling, who is the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, in his letter to the chairman of the committee: 
This experience builds effective teamwork and establishes Navy standards during the crucial transformation from civilian to Sailor. Roughly a third of all recruits and 40 percent of women report to the Fleet without follow-on advanced training. For these men and women, preparation for shipboard life is limited to boot camp and less than three weeks of Apprentice Training.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to also quote a letter from the Senior Noncommissioned Officers of the Armed Forces of the United States, representing the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy. They said: 
As the Senior Noncommissioned Officers of the Armed Forces of the United States, we feel compelled to state our disagreement with a proposed amendment on recruit training that might be considered during the Senate's debate of the FY99 Defense Bill. A mandatory requirement to house recruits in completely separate barracks is unnecessary. 
Based on our experience, each Service is different and therefore has different needs in training its recruits to join operational units. The determination as to how to train recruits is best determined by the individual Services based on the specific needs of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. Any attempt to make a training policy that applies across all Services is not in the best interests of the nation and will impact the readiness of the total force. 
Their many successes in our gender-integrated all-volunteer force is a direct result of the training the Services currently provide. 
We are grateful for Secretary Cohen's support of the Services in determining how best to conduct recruit training. We respectfully request the same vote of confidence from you as the Senate considers the fiscal year 1999 defense authorization bill. 
We also had a quote from the Army Research Institute study, and I think it is interesting to note, about the standards that have also been developed in this environment of basic training, so that there is no misunderstanding, unless there is any concern about the role that women are playing and their ability to perform during the course of basic training. I quote: 
Females trained in a gender-integrated environment improved their performance in all measures of physical fitness (push-ups, sit-ups, 2-mile run) and the males in gender-integrated training improved in two of three events. This has occurred without the Army fitness standards being changed or adjusted for gender-integrated training. 
In the December report of the Federal Advisory Committee, which is, of course, the Kassebaum-Baker commission, it said: 
The committee believes that the increasing number of women in expanded roles is an important reason why the United States is able to maintain an effective and efficient volunteer military force. 
Another letter, from the Secretary of the Army in 1997 to Congress. He said: 
Turning the clock back to gender segregated training will result in unrealistic training which degrades readiness. 
I mention these quotes, Mr. President, because I think it is important that we remind ourselves of the role that women do play in our military and will play in our military, and as they have in the last 100 years. They represent 14 percent of armed services, and the armed services cannot perform without them. 
I just believe it is important to make sure that we can ensure the stature and the well-being of all those who serve our country. That is why I believe we should follow the wisdom and the judgment of the Senate Armed Services Committee--indeed, the Congress last year, when we enacted a provision to create a congressional commission to examine all of these issues and to report back to the Congress next March. 
I hope the Senate will not adopt the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas that basically presumes to substitute for the operational conclusions thus far of the Secretary of Defense; the chiefs of the Army, Air Force, the Navy; the training commanders of the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy; the senior noncommissioned officers of the Army, the Air Force and the Navy; the president of the Association of the United States Army; and the tens of thousands of recruits who train and live in security on a daily basis. 
I hope, Mr. President, that the Senate will adopt the amendment that has been offered by the Senator from Michigan, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, the Senator from Georgia, Senator Cleland, and myself to reaffirm the judgment that has been rendered by the Congress last year in creating this commission. 
The amendment that is offered by the Senator from Kansas mismatches a problem and a cure. Professional relationships and effective performance throughout the Armed Forces flow from a training world that overlaps with the real and the uncertain 
ones in which men and women will ultimately be deployed as we have seen in Bosnia, as we have seen in the Persian Gulf, as we have seen in Somalia over and over again. 
I urge the adoption of the amendment that has been offered by myself, Senator Cleland, and Senator Levin.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the passage of S. 2138, the FY99 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. In particular, I thank my colleagues for approving $6 million for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' funding for the harbor dredge in Portland, Maine. 
I have supported the timely advancement of the harbor dredging because of public safety and environmental concerns and the project is the top priority for the state. Portland Harbor badly needs dredging, and it is to the great credit of the Portland Harbor Dredge Committee, made up of officials from the state, local, not-for-profit agencies and the private sector that the dredging project is now ready to begin, at least a year ahead of what the US Army Corps of Engineers expected. Corps officials had already made it clear that the project needed to begin this next winter in order to minimize environmental impacts, but could not be started until environmental determinations were made. The Dredge Committee, working together since 1994, was successful in obtaining the necessary permits, including allowing the bulk of the dredged material from Portland Harbor to be deposited at sea. 
As I pointed out in the Budget Committee back in March when I first brought up the harbor dredging during Budget Reconciliation, the Corps project simply could not wait another year for funding to be included in the federal budget. It is to the credit of the state, the surrounding communities and the agencies working for the dredging that the project is ready to begin, and the window for the dredging to occur so as to mitigate the environmental risks, according to the Corps, is from October, 1998 to April, 1999. This should now be possible if the Senate funding level is protected in conference with the House. 
I would also like to thank Senator Domenici and his Appropriations Subcommittee for federal funding for the Ft. Fairfield levee in rural Northern Maine, and also for including language in the appropriations bill that will allow construction of a levee to protect the town against further flooding. This Corps small flood control project is considered essential to the economic survival of Fort Fairfield. The town has experienced severe flooding over the last several years, and as recently as two months ago, was once again on emergency alert because of river flooding, and some senior citizens had to be evacuated from the their homes. 
Back in April 1994 alone, flood waters exceeded the 100-year flood plain and caused an estimated $7 million in property damages to businesses and residences. The town is prepared to embark on a redevelopment project once a levee has been built to prevent future floods. Once again, we thank the appropriations committee for realizing the importance of the levee to me and to this small rural town in Northern Maine.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 629, the Texas Compact Consent Act of 1997, as originally ratified by the three states of Maine, Vermont, and Texas to address the disposal of their low-level radioactive nuclear waste. 
The States of Maine, Vermont and Texas are now approaching the end of a long journey that started in 1980, when Congress told the states to form compacts to solve their low-level waste disposal problems. 
When this Compact is adopted as ratified by the three states, Mr. President, Texas, Maine and Vermont will become the forty second, forty third and forty fourth states to be given Congressional approval for forming a compact and will meet their responsibilities for the disposal of their low-level waste from universities, from hospital and medical centers, and from power plants and shipyards. 
It is very important for my colleagues to know that the language ratified by each state is exactly the same language, and if any amendments are included by the conferees, the Compact would have to be once again returned to each state for reratification. 
For the nine compacts that have been consented to by the United States Congress, not one of them has been amended by Congress. Not one of them. 
Let me be clear: the law never intended for Congress to determine who pays what, how the storage is allocated, and where the site is located. To the contrary: the intent of the law is for states to develop and approve these details, and for Congress to ratify the plan. 
The Compact before us does not discuss any particular site for the disposal facility, but only says that Texas must develop a facility in a timely manner, consistent with all applicable state and federal environmental, health, and public safety laws. It is the decision of Texas as to where the facility will be sited and is not within the purview of the U.S. Senate to decide for them. 
Further, absent the protection of the Compact, Texas must, I repeat must, open their borders to any other state for waste disposal or they will be in violation of the Interstate Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Compact gives Texas the protection that oversight commissioners, mostly appointed by the elected Governor of Texas but also with a say from Maine and Vermont, will decide what is best for Texas. 
As we send the Texas Compact to a Senate-House conference, I ask my colleagues to keep in mind that all that is required is the prompt approval of Congress for the Compact as originally ratified by Maine, Vermont, and Texas so that the Texas Compact members will be able to exercise appropriate control over their low level nuclear waste as Congress mandated. 
I thank the Chair and look forward to my colleagues continued support of the Texas Compact as ratified by the States when it returns from conference.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be the lead cosponsor of the Microcredit for Self-Sufficiency Act of 1998. This bipartisan measure is an excellent means of fighting poverty and allowing the world's enterprising poor to escape it. 
Microcredit programs extend small loans to very poor people for self-employment projects that generate income to allow them to care for themselves and their families. These loans are provided without collateral to poor people so they can start or expand small businesses. Microcredit encourages entrepreneurship and productivity among the poorest people in the world and allows them and their families to escape from poverty with dignity. 
I have always believed that the foreign assistance expenditures made by the United States should provide the maximum benefit in a cost-efficient manner. Microcredit meets this most important test. Microcredit loans are repaid by borrowers at commercial interest rates or higher, and repayment rates reach 95% and above. The money invested in microcredit programs is continually recycled, allowing lenders to reach more people over time. 
This assessment is borne out by the Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA) which is a non-governmental organization working in Latin America, Africa, Asia and the United States. It estimates that, over 5 years, $1 million invested in one of their microcredit programs generates $15 million in new loans. 
The microcredit concept has been a great success. Around the world, small investments have allowed an estimated 10 million poor people to begin self-employment ventures as opposed to relying on government handouts. Far more families could benefit from microcredit, but do not yet have access to such opportunities as this type of lending is not typically done by most financial institutions. It is microcredit institutions that will undertake such opportunities to provide a poor woman in Bangladesh, for example, with the funds to buy an extra cow or goat to increase her modest farming output. 
Indeed, one real-life illustration of the success of this program has been the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. In 1976, a man named Muhammad Yunus conducted an innovative research endeavor to examine the possibility of designing a credit delivery system to provide banking services to help the rural poor. These are individuals who want to escape poverty but find that conventional sources of lending are unavailable to them because they lack the collateral to get a loan. 
The Grameen Bank Project began with the goals of extending banking facilities to poor men and women, and creating opportunities for self-employment. It also aimed to reverse the vicious cycle of low income, low savings, and low investment by providing these individuals with credit that would yield greater investment and income. 
Today, the Grameen Bank is the largest rural credit institution in Bangladesh. It has over two million borrowers--94 percent of whom are women. The Grameen Bank covers more than half of all villages in Bangladesh and the repayment of its loans, which average $160 in United States dollars, is over 95%. The Bank has also helped train approximately 4,000 individuals from about 100 nations over the last 10 years. There have been 223 Grameen style programs replicated in some 58 nations in the last decade. This success story demonstrates what an individual is capable of when given the opportunity to help himself or herself escape poverty. 
Take the instance of Amena Begum, who in 1993, lived in poverty with her family in a village in Bangladesh. She and her family survived by living as squatters and earning money as day laborers or by operating micro-businesses in constant debt to loansharks. That same year, she convinced her husband to move the family to another village and joined the Grameen Bank. A neighbor told her `We're all poor--or at least we all were when we joined. I'll stick up for you because I know you'll succeed in business.' 
Well, she was elected secretary of her Grameen Bank group and repaid a loan she received to start a chicken and duck raising business. Grameen then gave her a second loan and, today, her business is growing and providing for her family's basic needs. 
A continent away in Ethiopia another woman, Alemnesh Geressu, her landless husband, and their seven children were also struggling. For several years, she bought grain from a trader and sold it in the local market. However, most of her profit went back to the lender who charged more than 10 percent interest per month. With loans from a Catholic Relief Services Program, she was able to buy grain at a lower price from nearby farmers and make higher profits. Her business grew dramatically and she now sells a local beverage, grows vegetables and even raised a cow--all in addition to her grain marketing activities. 
Alemnesh now pays back her loan at a commercial rate that is ten times less than she used to pay to the local money lenders. She has enough to feed her family well and to send two of her children to school. Alemnesh says she now has `more confidence and skills in myself and I wish the program could accommodate more women to improve their lives.' 
More families need to be touched by such programs. Just last year, at the 1997 Global Microcredit Summit, donor nations and international institutions established the goal of reaching 100 million of the world's poorest families, especially the women in those families with microcredit loans by the year 2005. I believe that this bill, the Microcredit for Self-Sufficiency Act of 1998, puts the United States on track to provide its share of funding to help achieve this worthwhile goal. 
This bill authorizes not less than $160 million in Fiscal Year 1999 for the United States Agency for International Development's microenterprise program. To ensure that microcredit assistance goes to those most in need of assistance, the bill targets at least half of these resources to institutions serving the world's poorest families, with loans under $300. Further, the bill channels a larger proportion of microcredit assistance through effective nongovernmental organizations that promote the development and expansion of microcredit programs worldwide. 
Mr. President, microcredit programs enjoy broad bipartisan support not only because they help millions to work their way out of poverty but because they also recycle foreign aid dollars through loan repayments. Microcredit programs are self-sustainable, can be replicated, and are powerful vehicles for social development. 
This bill would increase the number of families that have access to such programs. Microcedit programs would be raised to a higher priority among our nation's foreign aid initiatives. And the investments called for in this bill will help bring the possibility of financial independence to millions of potential entrepreneurs who struggle to survive on less than $1 a day.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for their support of my legislation, S. 1531 and S. 1532, introduced on behalf of the towns of Tremont and East Boothbay, Maine. S. 1531 deauthorizes certain portions of the navigational project for Bass Harbor, and S. 1532 deauthorizes the final portions of East Boothbay Harbor. 
Bass Harbor has the greatest concentration of fishing boats on Mt. Desert Island and all mooring spaces are currently full, with a long waiting list to obtain future moorings. When the townspeople approached the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to obtain a permit for expansion, they were told that no improvements could be made until the federal project area boundary was moved to the proper location by legislative action. I was happy to do this on their behalf. The Selectmen, Town Manager, and Harbor Committee will now be working with the Corps and the State in anticipation of having the harbor dredged, which last occurred in 1966, so that they may make space available for more and larger boats.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to address the Senate this morning with respect to the national tobacco policy legislation that has been on the floor this week. I hope in the final analysis we will be able to come to a common agreement and find common ground on this critical issue and legislation. Clearly, the significance of this issue and the promise of related legislation cannot be overstated with respect to the fact that it certainly could improve the health of our Nation's children. 
As a Member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I had the opportunity to work on the original legislation that was reported out of the committee by a 19-1 vote. The committee voted overwhelmingly for the bill because we thought it was important and necessary to move the debate forward on this critical issue. There is no question that the bill which is now on the floor of the Senate is very different from the legislation that was considered in the Commerce Committee, where we began the process of defining and refining the issue, and knew full well that amendments would be offered on the floor to improve it and to reflect the interests and the desires of the Members of this body. 
Unfortunately, what ultimately occurred is that we had a total rewrite of the bill through the White House. 
It is not unusual to have the White House involved and be an integral part of the discussion in terms of shaping legislation. But, ultimately, the bill was significantly rewritten in most pieces. I can't say it wasn't improved in some places, but other areas raise significant questions. It is one thing to amend a bill and change it on the floor; it is quite another to have this issue altered in a way that is outside of the scope and purview of the committee, and which has now resulted in some of the problems that have contributed to the delay of this legislation and its passage. 
But be that as it may, I hope in the final analysis we don't overlook the reason why this legislation is on the floor of the U.S. Senate, what brought us to this point, why this legislation was crafted, and what we hope to accomplish from the passage, ultimately, of this legislation. 
First and foremost, we have to remember this legislation was the result of a settlement reached by the tobacco industry and 40 states attorneys general across the country more than 11 months ago. And the bottom line is that the proposed settlement would not have been reached if it weren't for one simple truth: tobacco products have been killing and continue to kill 420,000 Americans each and every year--and every day, 3,000 children become addicted to tobacco and one-third will eventually die as a result of tobacco-related disease. 
If it weren't for this simple truth, the tobacco industry would not have been subjected to years and years of lawsuits and litigation, and this comprehensive settlement would not have been reached. And the fact is, if not for this simple truth, the industry would not have settled with States such as Minnesota recently to the tune of $6 billion, and three other States across this country. And that is why they were interested in reaching this agreement, because they knew what the truth was. And the most insidious aspect of this whole tobacco debate is the fact that this dangerous and addictive product was marketed to children. 
In listening to the debate this past week and hearing the many arguments that have been put forward from divergent points of view, I believe that we cannot afford to forget, nor can we overlook the fact, that this product was deliberately, in a calculated fashion, targeted to young people and teens--even to children as young as 11-year-olds. This product was marketed to individuals who were not old enough to vote, not old enough to drink, not old enough to enlist in the military, not old enough to make any of the life-altering decisions that should be made by adults, and not old enough, ironically, to even purchase this product legally. By the way, these facts aren't just based on hypothetical views or assumptions or conjecture; these are based on more than 40,000 documents that have been unveiled during the course of recent litigation and in crafting the proposed settlement. 
When you look at the documents, it provides a disturbing glimpse into the mindset and tactics of the tobacco industry. From this paper trail, we have learned of repeated efforts by the industry to manipulate scientific research, racially stereotype minorities in marketing plans, contrive the nicotine levels in cigarettes, and play down the risks of smoking. They even demonstrated the manner in which they studied the smoking habits of teenagers, to the extent that they would exploit the teen market so they would have the lifelong support of a group of Americans. They even considered ways to make cigarettes taste better for teens. So this was a very deliberate, calculated effort to hook kids on tobacco. The thousands and thousands of documents outline this effort. 
That is the crux of this issue. This is not to say that Americans didn't know that smoking cigarettes was harmful; of course, they did. The question is, `Did the industry deliberately contrive the nicotine levels to make it addictive and then to attract young people so they would smoke throughout their lifetime?' 
For the answer, listen to some of the industry's own 
documents. `The basis of our business is the high school students,' said one memo. Another one said, `It is a well-known fact that teenagers like sweet products. Honey might be considered.' Another one said, `If our company is to survive and prosper in the long run, we must get our share of the youth market.' Another memo said, `. . . to ensure increased and longer-term growth . . . the brand must increase its share penetration among the 14-24 age group . . . which represents tomorrow's cigarette business.' Another one said, `Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer.' 
So these are glaring demonstrations of unscrupulous and unethical conduct on the part of companies. 
And that is what brings us to the floor of the Senate. The industry discovered and knew the truth, and they could not escape their past practices. And that is why they entered into a settlement with 40 attorneys general. 
While last June's proposed settlement may have been the catalyst for comprehensive tobacco legislation, it did not mean that Congress could not change that settlement. We were not a party to those negotiations, but we have a right to make changes, and it had to come to Congress. 
And what has been the result of these industry documents and their intent to market an addictive product to young people in America? This has been the result: More than 5 million children under the age of 18, alive today, will eventually die from smoking-related diseases unless current rates are reversed. Approximately 4.1 million kids age 12 to 17 are current smokers. Almost 90 percent of adult smokers began at or before age 18. Among high school seniors who have ever used smokeless tobacco, almost three-fourths began by the ninth grade. And 3,000 of our children will become addicted to this deadly product every day. 
That is what this is all about. That is the debate. That is the heart of this issue, Mr. President. 
In my State of Maine, we have one of the highest rates of teen smoking in America and we have the highest rate of smoking for individuals between the ages of 18 and 30. In fact, a full 38 percent of high school students in Maine currently smoke cigarettes, and 16 percent of high school boys use smokeless tobacco. That is what has happened. Smoking is habit-forming and 35 percent of males between the ages of 18 to 34 reported smoking cigarettes in 1996. That is the result of what we are talking about. That is why we are here in the U.S. Senate debating this comprehensive framework. 
If this habit was harmless, we would not be here today. But tobacco is not harmless, and we know it. Furthermore, this harm has been spread by an industry that has marketed to young people, which has resulted in a senseless loss of life. Now, we have the responsibility to take action. 
For those who oppose doing anything, regardless of what the content of this legislation is, I say to them: What is the alternative? What else will we do here in the U.S. Senate? The bottom line is that this is our only chance. We only have one opportunity and it is before the U.S. Senate. It is a historic opportunity to bring to an end these past practices and, more importantly, to help young people in America so they don't become addicted to this deadly tobacco product for the rest of their lives. That is what this debate is all about. I hope the essence of this issue doesn't get lost as we look at it from a variety of dimensions, because there is no possibility of ever dealing with this kind of framework ever again. This is our chance once and forever. 
So I hope that once we get to the point of having gone through all of the amendments, the debate and discussion, it doesn't defeat the ultimate passage of comprehensive tobacco legislation. Those objections cannot override this one important national interest, which is to change the tobacco culture in America, and to hopefully stop young people from smoking, or help them never to start in the first place. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.  
Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997. 
Last week, our nation's intelligence apparatus was surprised by the Indian government's decision to test a hydrogen bomb. Pakistan may follow suit with a retaliatory test. The fact that last week's test caught our intelligence community by surprise raises serious questions about our ability to monitor such developments. However, while the prospect of a nuclear arms race on the Asian subcontinent could threaten our long-term security interests, the United States enjoys productive relations with the two regional adversaries. 
Iran, however, is neither a democracy nor a friend. While the new President, Mohammed Khatemi, is seen by some as a `moderate,' his government continues a twenty year tradition of bitter hostility towards the United States. Iran remains opposed to the peace process, its role in the bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 1996 is still not known, and it is still vigorously pursuing efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction, including a nuclear capability. We must not be caught off guard with Iran as we have been with India and Pakistan. 
When this measure was introduced last fall, I had hoped that events would prove it unnecessary. I furthermore remained optimistic that the meetings of the Vice President with then Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would have convinced Russia of the seriousness of the issue of Iran's efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction. 
I had hoped the Administration would have done a better job of convincing the Russians of the seriousness of this matter. I had hoped that the Russian government would have realized that whatever financial benefits they get from such help to Iran are far outweighed by the loss of investment from the United States. Even more importantly, I had hoped that Russia would realize that such assistance to Iran does not contribute to political stability in such a turbulent part of the world. Unfortunately, none of these developments have come to pass. 
I was disturbed to learn that Iranian nuclear officials just visited Moscow to view a demonstration of gas centrifuge technology--which if successfully mastered will provide Iran the easiest type of material to use in a nuclear weapon. If such a sale occurs it would be a gross violation of a promise made by President Yeltsin to the President in May 1995 when the Russians agreed not to sell centrifuges to Iran. This follows the sale of a radioactive gas called tritium which can be used to increase the size of nuclear warheads and that a second sale is being discussed. 
In addition to this development, I was disturbed to learn how close Iran came to obtaining some 22 tons of missile-grade stainless steel from Russia as reported in the April 25th edition of the New York Times. While I do not believe Russia supports the further development of weapons of mass destruction, I am concerned about the Yeltsin government's ability to stem the proliferation of dangerous weapons technology and equipment. When this shipment of steel can be halted by customs officers in Azerbaijan but not in Russia, we are entitled to ask serious questions about Russia's ability to cooperate in limiting the global spread of weapons components. 
Mr. President, I understand that Iran has begun a program to build a missile called the Shahab 3 which has an 800 mile range. This range is double the capacity of a SCUD missile and is long enough to reach Israel and Saudi Arabia. This type of missile would give Iran more power with which to threaten the West's strategic interests in the Middle East only seven years after we fought a war with Iraq--another state that may still be trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction. We cannot allow Iran, just as President Bush did not allow Iraq, to assert control over the majority of the world's oil supply. 
Mr. President, we should not view this bill as an anti-Russian statement. This bill does not detract from our support for Russian democracy or Moscow's efforts to build a strong free-market economy. However, it does reflect our concern over the actions of many firms in Russia that have an interest in trading with either rogue states or nations that are inclined to develop the ability to deploy weapons of mass destruction. Under this legislation, Russian firms will have to choose with whom they want to do business--the United States or an Iranian regime that has yet to show the moderation promised by the election of President Khatemi. Since persuasion and shared intelligence with Russia may not be sufficient to stop Iran from acquiring dangerous weaponry, this bill has become regrettable but necessary. I urge my colleagues to support it today before this menacing military threat from Iran grows even larger tomorrow. 
Thank you and I yield the floor.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Agricultural Research Conference Report. The bill, S. 1150 reauthorizes our agricultural research programs and provides $600 million in funding on a competitive grant basis for new and alternative uses of agricultural commodities and products, natural resources management, farm efficiency and profitability, agriculture biotechnology, and food safety, technology and nutrition. 
This is good news for our scientists and the agriculture community in Maine. They know their chances of receiving more competitive research funding are excellent because they know they can compete head to head with agriculture researchers from all around the country. This bill gives them that opportunity. 
As the Chairman of the Committee is aware, I do have some concerns with provisions in this conference report that were not part of either the House or Senate passed bills. In addition to the food stamp provisions, which have been widely discussed on the floor today, I am concerned with addition of the research title of the Northern Forest Stewardship Act that was included in conference. I voted to recommit the report to the conference committee in hopes that these two provisions, which are unrelated to the important agricultural research, would be removed from the report. Since the vote to recommit failed, I will vote for the report, and will continue to work with Chairman Lugar to address my concerns. 
I have been working with the Chairman and Subcommittee Chairman Santorum to obtain a field hearing in Maine on the Northern Forest Stewardship Act (NFSA) before any action was taken by the full Senate. I requested this hearing because many people in Maine are both interested and concerned with the potential impact of this bill on the economies of their rural communities. 
I was dismayed, therefore, when I learned that the research title from the NFSA bill was included in the Agriculture Research conference report. Also the language inserted in the report does not include the provision which requires that a governor's request is required before federal assistance can be made available to the state. This language is fundamental because it involves an elected state official in the process, ensuring that the state controls its land use decisions. I will be working to restore the role of the states in making the request for federal assistance, and I thank the Chairman of the Agriculture Committee for his offer of assistance in this matter. 
Historically, our state has been defined by our agriculture--from the natural resources of its extensive forests, to the potatoes crops of Aroostook County and to the Wild blueberries of the Down East area of Maine. The Wild lowbush blueberry is unique to Maine, and one of only three berries native to the U.S. that are utilized commercially. 
Virtually all of the commercial U.S. lowbush blueberries are produced in our state, with 99 percent of the blueberries being processed and used as a nutritious ingredient in many food products throughout the country. The industry is concentrated in the Down East region of Maine, which is an economically depressed region that relies heavily on natural resource based jobs, such as those in the Wild blueberry industry. 
An increase in competitive research grants funding will help to continue a series of research projects that target critical aspects of lowbush blueberry culture and processing challenges, and transferring research solutions to the growers and processors. Much of the research completed to date provides techniques for a sustainable approach to production with environmental benefits. 
Research objectives include implementation of a research program that is designed to ensure a consistently productive, high quality, low input crop that is successfully marketed in the U.S. and worldwide, with ongoing projects for such as pesticide reduction/efficacy, pollination alternatives, effects and reduction of low temperature injury, micro nutrient fertility requirements, and fruit quality improvements. 
The bill also funds the federal crop insurance program that will give a healthy measure of peace of mind to Maine's wild blueberry industry, who, until recently, could not participate in the program. This report will allow the wild blueberry industry to renew their contracts for crop insurance, giving them protection against an economically devastating total crop loss caused by circumstances beyond their control. 
Research for the potato industry is being conducted on new chemical-resistant strains of late blight, now detected in virtually every major potato growing state, and the last blight fungus is quickly developing into the most serious threat to potato production in the United States. History reminds of us the great potato famine in Ireland in the last century caused by late blight, and today's research helps us to never again realize such an devastating experience. 
In Maine, late blight has already resulted in millions of dollars in crop losses since 1993, which is not only a concern for our largest agriculture industry, but for potato states throughout the eastern U.S. since Maine is the primary source of seed potatoes for these states. 
Comprehensive late blight Integrated Pest Management research programs through current grants and future competitive research grants offered in the bill before us today will continue to prevent a full-scale epidemic from occurring in our region. Needless to say, this is one initiative in which a modest federal investment will help prevent a very costly crop disaster. 
The Hatch Act and the McIntire-Stennis Act are the cornerstones of the cooperative/federal/state research effort that has made the U.S. agriculture and forestry industries the world's leaders. Under these programs, and under broad federal guidelines, states can continue to further identify their local research priorities. 
Additional competitive research grants for the McIntire-Stennis Program will provide continued funding to 62 universities nationwide, including the University of Maine, that conduct research, teaching, and extension programs in forestry and related natural resource areas. The research focuses on the biology of forest organisms, forest ecosystem health, management of forests for wood, and forest product development. Each dollar of McIntire-Stennis funding is now matched with five dollars from nonfederal sources for these university programs. 
Wood utilization research contributes to research at six land-grant Regional Research Centers, including Maine. The work conducted at these universities specializes in the efficient use of wood resources, developing new structural applications for wood, exploiting wood chemical extractives for safer and less expensive alternatives to current pesticides, preservatives, and adhesives, and exploring the pharmacological properties of trees. Wood utilization research is particularly important to forest-based economies in rural areas. In Maine, the annual total contribution in forest products manufacturing is over $5 billion. 
Mr. President, our agricultural communities, some of the best stewards of our land, produce the safest, the most nutritious and reasonably priced food products in the entire world. Furthering the competitive grants research system through the Agricultural Research bill before us will go a long way towards the continued improvement of our nation's bountiful harvests and the continued health and productivity of our nation's forests.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the legislation now before the Senate--S. 1618, the Consumer Anti-Slamming Act--and to urge for its adoption and enactment. 
This legislation--which was crafted by the distinguished Chairman of the Commerce Committee, John McCain, and the Ranking Member of the Committee, Ernest Hollings--will help eliminate a reprehensible practice of unscrupulous telephone companies, and I congratulate them for their leadership on this issue. As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I am pleased that my friend and colleague, Chairman McCain, has moved rapidly to address the slamming epidemic that is occurring in Maine by bringing this legislation to the floor of the Senate. 
In addition, I would also like to thank my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, for highlighting this issue by holding oversight hearings in her capacity as Chair of the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Permanent Investigations, including a recent hearing in the State of Maine--and she has also offered legislation that is designed to combat slamming. In case there is any doubt about the importance of this issue in Maine, the involvement of both Senators should put that to rest! 
Mr. President, as many of my colleagues are aware, `slamming' is a term that has been used to describe any practice that changes a consumer's long-distance carrier without the consumer's knowledge or consent. A variety of tactics and techniques can be used to accomplish this goal, including vague or inaccurate phone solicitations; unsolicited `welcome packages' that look like an advertisement but automatically lead to a consumer changing phone companies unless the individual returns a rejection card; and `drawings' for giveaways that also serve as a means of unwittingly changing services. 
Regardless of the tactic used to slam a customer, the bottom line is that it's an unfair and illegal practice--and it's one that must be brought to a halt. 
Mr. President, phone customers expect high-quality phone service for a fair price. If a phone company is going to `reach out and touch someone,' it must be done legally and with fairness to the customer. Consumers who are slammed often receive lower-quality service or higher rates, and sometimes they are not even aware that they have been slammed until they get their bills. This is an outrageous practice and I think we can all agree that its demise is long overdue. 
Last year, in my home state of Maine, the number of slamming complaints doubled to a total of 1,000 between 1996 and 1997. Nationwide, more than 20,000 consumers filed slamming complaints with the FCC, the largest category of complaints the agency received. In 1996, it received more than 16,000 total slamming complaints. As a result of these complaints, the FCC has taken enforcement action against 15 companies for slamming violations over the past two years, while assessing more than $1 million in forfeitures and consent decrees with another $500,000 in additional penalties pending. 
Mr. President, as these numbers clearly indicate, this is a serious problem that is only going to get worse. In particular, the threat exists that--as competition develops in other communications markets--slamming could extend into new services and become an even more onerous consumer problem if it is left unchecked. 
As has been indicated, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) already has the authority to combat this practice by assessing fines against telephone carriers that slam. But with a 25 percent increase in the number of slamming complaints that were filed in just the past year--and even with the level of fines and penalties that have already been imposed on companies--it is obvious that the FCC's current approach is not working. And it is for this reason that the legislation before this body is so critical. 
Mr. President, S. 1618 will put this reprehensible practice to an end by providing definitive procedures for telephone companies to follow in changing a customers's telephone service; giving federal and non-federal authorities the power to impose tough sanctions on companies that are guilty of slamming; and providing measures to ensure that slamming victims are fully-compensated. 
Specifically, to ensure that changes in phone service are made in a verifiable manner, the bill requires phone companies to obtain written, verbal, or electronic verification from a consumer who is changing providers. 
To ensure that customer complaints are dealt with in a timely manner, carriers accused of slamming will be required to defend their actions in no more than 120 days, and the FCC will have no more than 150 days to resolve any outstanding disputes. 
If slamming has occurred, the bill gives the FCC the authority to provide compensatory or punitive damages to consumers that companies would be required to pay within 90 days. In addition, provide a strong disincentive to potential slammers, the FCC would be required to impose fines on phone companies that are guilty of slamming of at least $40,000 for a first-time offense and $150,000 for repeat offenses. And If a company refuses to pay these fines, the bill provides that the FCC will also have the authority to prosecute slammers. 
Finally, if a consumer wishes to pursue redress through means other than the FCC, this bill allows consumers to pursue their grievances in court through state class-action lawsuits instead of through the FCC. And in the event a specific state does not believe these penalties are strong enough, the bill specifically retains the rights of each state to impose stiffer sanctions. 
This bill and the provisions it contains are based on common sense and good policy, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it. 
Mr. President, while this bill is a very sound approach to addressing the slamming epidemic, there is one additional technique that consumers already have at their disposal to prevent slamming from occurring, and I believe we should seek to fully-protect this consumer option in this bill. 
Specifically, if customers are concerned that they will be unwittingly tricked--or unknowingly forced--into changing their phone company, they can now `freeze' into place the long distance carrier of their choice at the local phone company. As a result, no order to change phone companies can be completed without the express, direct authorization of the customer to the local phone company. 
To ensure that this option is in no way impeded in the future, I have prepared an amendment that would ensure that no subsequent action by the FCC can be undertaken to restrict or impede the customer's ability to `freeze' in place the carrier of their choice. I understand that this amendment is acceptable to the manager's of the bill, and has now been included in the manager's amendment. Therefore, I would like to thank the Chairman and Ranking member for addressing this issue and accepting my provision. 
Mr. President, the bottom line is, slamming is a serious crime, and this is a serious solution. Companies engaged in slamming will no longer be able to hide behind the anonymity of the phone lines. Phone companies and their customers should reach agreements on phone services, but slamming destroys that relationship. Therefore, this bill will restore an element of trust that has been lost through this abhorrent practice. 
Mr. President, slamming is nothing less than high-tech extortion, and the law must be changed to deal with this new criminal threat, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important legislation.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, S. 1618 is a well-crafted bill that is designed to prevent the unauthorized transferring of a customer's phone carrier. This is accomplished through a variety of provisions, including the threat of strong penalties on telephone companies that engage in slamming. 
While I strongly believe that the penalties established in this legislation should be fully-enforced, I would like to clarify the type of conduct that these penalties are being targeted to address. Specifically, is it the Chairman's intent that the significant financial penalties contained in Section 1(f) be imposed for all cases of unauthorized carrier changes, including changes that are accidental or innocent mistakes, such as when an order to change service providers in improperly keyed-in by a customer service agent? Or are these penalties designed to address cases of slamming that involve willful or intentional misconduct on the part of companies?

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my good friend and colleague from West Virginia Jay Rockefeller, in offering the Consumer Protection Act as an amendment to the Consumer Anti-Slamming bill. 
Just as the slamming bill is designed to protect consumers from unscrupulous phone companies that change a customer's phone service without consent, this amendment will protect consumers from misleading or inaccurate billing practices by phone companies. Therefore, I urge that my colleges support this pro-consumer amendment that complements the underlying pro-consumer Anti-Slamming Act. 
Mr. President, our nation's $260 billion telecommunications industry is undergoing a period of rapid growth and change. This change is being driven by the enactment and progressive implementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996--a law that is gradually shifting the industry from being one that is heavily-regulated to one that is open and competitive. 
As would be expected for an industry of this size, the transition from a regulated environment to a competitive environment has not been entirely smooth, nor has it been as rapid as many of us would prefer. 
To date, there have been countless proceeding at the FCC to restructure the way that services are delivered to consumers and the way that telecommunications companies pay each other for these services. In response to these restructuring efforts, there have been a variety lawsuits filed in court by telecommunications companies, and members of Congress have weighed-in when they believe the new rules do not accurately reflect the intent of the law. 
And--as would be expected in an emerging competitive market--there is non-stop haggling between the telecommunications companies that are now able to tread on each other's turf after years of being statutorily limited to their own market niche. But don't get me wrong . . . that's not a bad thing--that's what competition is all about. 
Mr. President, during this time of rapid transition and daunting change, it is critical that we not forget the individuals for whom the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was crafted in the first place: the American consumers. Afterall, this landmark law was not passed because Congress simply wanted to deregulate an industry--rather, it was passed because competition will bring consumers a wide array of new and advanced telecommunications services at lower prices. 
The amendment we are offering today is specifically designed to protect consumers during this time of transition in the telecommunications industry. Specifically, the Consumer Protection Act will require `truth-in-billing'--a guarantee to consumers that what they see on their phone bills is thorough and accurate. 
Mr. President, as my colleagues have undoubtedly heard from their constituents--and may be experiencing themselves--there is a great deal of confusion being generated by new line-item charges that have been added to phone bills in recent months. Since January, many telephone companies have started to place new line-item charges on customer phone bills for a variety of purposes and under a variety of names, including `national access charges,' `universal service charges,' or both. While the descriptions for these charges vary, the central theme is that these new fees are being imposed because of recent federal actions stemming from the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 
In response to these new charges, telephone customers are understandably confused and angry, and want to know why Congress would pass a law--and the President would sign a law--that imposed a host of new costs on them with no apparent benefits. They were told that this legislation would bring competition and lower prices, but all they see is new charges on their phone bills. They want to know what happened to the benefits of deregulation! 
Mr. President, customers deserve an answer to these questions and they deserve to know that what they see on their phone bills is accurate. And the simple fact is that the implementation of the Telecommunications Act has brought--and will continue to bring--countless benefits to consumers, and they deserve to know about them. 
For instance, in July 1997, access charges--which are the fees paid by long distance companies to local phone companies for use of their networks--were reduced by $1.7 billion. The long distance companies state that these reductions have been passed on to consumers in the form of reduced rates, and I 
 won't dispute their contention. The problem is that their customers don't know the first thing about this federal action to benefit customers--all they know is that new line-items for various charges prescribed to the federal government have been added to their bills! 
By the same token, consumers have no idea that the phone companies stand to reap substantial benefits as new markets are opened for competition. As companies are allowed to enter the markets that were previously closed to them, those that are competitive will reap substantial profits that can greatly benefit their customers--but you'd never know this from reading a company's bill. 
To remove the confusion that these line-items have generated--and to ensure that companies exercise full disclosure on the impact of deregulation--the amendment we are offering does three things. 
First, it directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to investigate the billing practices of the telecommunications industry to ensure that all fees are being fairly described on bills. If any company is found to be using misleading billing practices, these agencies would be directed to consider disciplinary actions against that company. 
Second, the bill ensures that if a company puts a new line-item charge on a phone bill that are attributed to federal actions, it must also include line-items that delineate the benefits of federal actions as well. Customers deserve to know the whole story when it comes to federal regulatory actions--not just the side of the story that is in the company's best interests. 
Third, to ensure that the federal regulator of telephone service has all relevant documents available for review, the bill requires that companies submit the same financial disclosure forms to the FCC that they now submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This requirement won't impose a new, excessive burden on phone companies--rather, it simply requires that they make a photocopy of the forms that are already being sent to the SEC and mail them to the FCC. 
Overall, this bill ensures that accurate information is being depicted on phone bills--and that customers are told the whole story about federal actions, not just the side that companies would like to tell. 
The bottom line is that changes are occurring as part of the transition to a more competitive telecommunications market that will bring substantial benefits to consumers and phone companies alike--but some companies would only like to tell their customers half of the story. That's simply not fair. 
The amendment that we are offering is fair. It is a fair for companies, and fair for consumers. 
Of critical importance, our amendment does not re-regulate the telecommunications industry--the companies will still decide for themselves if they want to use line items. Our amendment simply ensures that if a company does want to use a line-item for costs, it also will include line-items for benefits. In addition, it ensures that the billing practices of companies are properly examined and improper practices are eliminated. 
I would like to thank my friend from West Virginia for offering this amendment today, and urge that my colleagues support this bipartisan, pro-consumer amendment.

Ms. SNOWE. Thank you. 
Mr. President, I thank Senator D'Amato for yielding me such time. I want to applaud him for his leadership on this very important issue for women in America. And I thank my colleague, Senator Feinstein, for her leadership as well and commitment that she has demonstrated on this issue. 
Mr. President, I regret that we have reached a point here where we cannot pass one bill because it is being held hostage to another. No one disagrees with the Senator from Massachusetts in terms of the importance of some of the issues that he has raised with respect to a Patients' bill of rights. But this legislation should not be held hostage to that legislation. 
We all know that there are many questions with respect to the approach that he has taken--relevant questions, understandable concerns--that should be appropriately discussed and explored in the committee process and then ultimately here on the floor. But this should not hold up this particular bill. And Senator D'Amato is absolutely correct, we should move forward, because this has strong bipartisan support. 
There is not a Senator on the floor who would not support this legislation. So the women of America should not be held hostage because of internal divisions, because of parliamentary maneuvers, because of legislative gridlock. 
This legislation has the support of Democrats as well as Republicans. We have 180,000 women every year who are diagnosed with breast cancer. One in eight women in their lifetime will be detected with breast cancer. We have now discovered that, in many instances, mastectomies are being performed on an outpatient basis, and we need to take action to prevent that. Mastectomies are very complicated surgical procedures. 
There is no way that that is a decision that should be made by a bureaucrat; but rather, the length of a woman's stay in a hospital, how that procedure will be handled, should be determined by her as well as her doctor. Those are the only two individuals who ought to be making that decision. It should not be a bureaucrat's bottom line. 
We have found time and time again women who have had to endure this procedure on an outpatient basis. The physical scars left by mastectomy, which can be complicated and difficult to care for, often require supervision. Women prematurely released may not have the information they need, let alone the care. And dangerous complications have arisen hours after the operation. And all of this is occurring within the context of a traumatic circumstance, and that is having a mastectomy. We want to make sure that this decision is made appropriately within the confines of medical supervision and medical providers. 
We have also found that breast reconstructive surgery is considered cosmetic surgery. Well, it is not. Forty-three percent of women who want to undergo breast reconstructive surgery cannot because it is deemed cosmetic. And that is wrong. Breast reconstructive surgery is designed to restore a woman's wholeness. Fortunately, my State has passed legislation to guard against that and to require health insurance companies to consider it as breast reconstructive surgery. But unfortunately for those who are employed by those who are self-insured, they do not receive this kind of coverage. 
That is why this legislation that is offered by Senator D'Amato is so essential. We cannot allow women to have to endure this kind of decisionmaking under the most arduous circumstances because of the indecision and the difficulties that have arisen here. 
This legislation had a hearing back in November of 1997 before the Senate Finance Committee. We are entitled to get this legislation through the legislative process. In fact, the President, during his State of the Union Address in January of 1997, had a physician in the gallery who drew attention to the need to change the guidelines that had encouraged outpatient masectomies. Therefore, he called on Congress in January of 1997 to pass this legislation.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am offering a resolution today which expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States, at the next meeting of the International Whaling Commission in two weeks, should remain firmly opposed to commercial whaling and should oppose so-called `scientific whaling.' 
This resolution is very timely and important. As we work here in the Senate today, representatives of nations from around the globe are preparing for a meeting in Oman later this month that could determine the fate of the world's whales. The International Whaling Commission, to which the U.S. and many other countries belong, will be meeting there to consider proposals to end the existing global moratorium on commercial whaling. I think that the adoption of any such proposals by the IWC would mark a major setback in the cause of whale conservation. It is imperative that the United States remain firm in its opposition to any proposals to resume commercial whaling, and that we, as a nation, continue to speak out against this practice. 
Commercial whaling has been prohibited for many species for more than sixty years, but whaling for some species persisted into the 1980's. Despite the partial protections in place for some species, however, commercially targeted whale stocks continued to decline and the IWC declared a global moratorium on all commercial whaling which went into effect in 1986. The United States was a leader in the effort to establish the moratorium, and since then we have consistently provided a strong voice against commercial whaling and have worked to uphold the moratorium. In addition, we have worked through the IWC process to establish sanctuaries around the world to permanently protect whales. 
Unfortunately, Norway, Japan, Russia and other countries have begun an aggressive campaign to eliminate the moratorium and to return to the days when whales were treated as commodities. In fact, Norway has begun killing hundreds of whales a year in defiance of the moratorium. Despite international efforts to protect and rebuild whale stocks, the number of whales harvested has increased in recent years, tripling since the implementation of the global moratorium in 1986. This is a dangerous trend that does not show signs of stopping. 
It is also time to close a loophole in the IWC rules used by nations to conduct so-called scientific whaling to kill whales without regard to the moratorium or established whale sanctuaries. The practice of scientific lethal whaling is outdated and the value of the data of such studies has been questioned by many scientists who work on the same population dynamics questions as those who harvest whales in the name of science. Japan is the most prominent practitioner of scientific whaling, killing 400 to 500 whales annually. Although the scientific merits of Japan's program are dubious at best, the meat taken from whales killed in the name of science is processed and sold in the marketplace. Also, Japan has reportedly killed many whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary established by the IWC around Antarctica. In response to Japan's practices, the Scientific Committee of the IWC has repeatedly passed resolutions calling for the cessation of lethal scientific whaling, particularly that occurring in designated whale sanctuaries. 
The resolution that I am offering today reaffirms the United States' strong support for a ban on commercial whaling at a time when our negotiators at the IWC most need that support. It also addresses the dubious practice of scientific whaling by stating that the U.S. should oppose scientific whaling unless it is specifically authorized by the Scientific Committee of the IWC. 
Mr. President, here at home we work very, very hard to protect whales in U.S. waters, particularly those considered threatened or endangered. Our own laws and regulations give whales one of the highest standards of protection in the world, and as a result, our own citizens are subject to strict rules designed to protect against the accidental taking or even harassment of whales. Intentional killing, including commercial whaling, is, of course, completely prohibited. Given what is asked of our citizens to protect against even accidental injury to whales here in the U.S., it would be grossly unfair to them if we retreated in any way from our position opposing commercial, intentional whaling in other countries. Whales migrate throughout the world's oceans, and as we protect whales in our own waters, so should we act to protect them internationally. Indeed, the sacrifices that we make here at home to protect whales would be seriously undermined if those same whales could be killed by commercial hunters the moment they leave the jurisdiction of the U.S. 
Whales are among the most intelligent animals on Earth, and they play a critically important role in the marine ecosystem. Yet, there is still much about them that we do not know. Resuming the intentional, large-scale harvest of whales is irresponsible, and it could have ecological consequences that we cannot predict. While the IWC was able to implement the global commercial moratorium, it has not had the opportunity to conduct thorough and updated population assessments to determine the status of whale stocks. Therefore, it is premature to even consider easing the current conservation measures. Mr. President, the right policy is to protect whales across the globe, to oppose the resumption of commercial whaling, and to halt the unscientific practice of scientific whaling. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the legislation before the Senate--H.R. 2676, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act. I beieve it is vital that this critically-needed legislation be passed by the Congress and enacted by the President as rapidly as possible. 
Mr. President, Congress has been working to reform many aspects of the Federal government and its programs over the past several years, including welfare, Medicare, and telecommunications laws. And now, with April 15--the deadline for filing tax returns--only a few weeks past, I can think of no better time for Congress to continue its reform efforts than with a substantial overhaul of the IRS. 
While reforming our tax system is an idea that has been bandied about for years--and will likely continue to be a topic of great interest in the months and years ahead--at the very least we have an obligation in this Congress to address the abuse of our nation's citizens by the agency that is responsible for enforcing federal tax laws: the Internal Revenue Service. 
Mr. President, the hearings that were conducted in the Senate Finance Committee over the past nine months have provided a chilling reminder of how government power can run amok. Tax files are used for information on boyfriends of IRS employees. IRS managers are trained that it is permissible to lie or mislead the public. Employees are evaluated on statistics based on seizures of personal property and finances. Some business owners are allowed to make monthly payments on delinquent employment taxes while others are forced into bankruptcy--the decision is arbitrary and up to IRS management. And IRS agents that seek to report improper tactics and practices face demotion or outright replacement. 
While I wish that the horror stories told by the Finance Committee witnesses were isolated incidents, the real-life stories I have heard from constituents in Maine only reinforce the fact that these problems are occurring nationwide. 
Take for example the family in Lebanon, Maine, who was audited for the year 1993 after they saw their convenience store, home, and all their financial records destroyed by a 1994 fire. While they originally had no problem with the audit and anticipated a relatively brief process, it is now four years later and the IRS has finally just completed the 1993 audit. One can only imagine how long--and at what cost--the 1994 and 1995 audits they are being subjected to will last. 
Or consider the story of a sheet metal company employee in Maine who was taking money on the side for jobs--which meant that his employer wasn't being paid for the contracts that they thought were outstanding. As a result, when it came time for the business to pay their taxes, they didn't have the funds. 
Negotiations between the IRS and the company broke down, one thing led to another, and the company was behind to the point where the IRS took everything from the company's bank account. The result: the company was unable to pay its employees, it was seized by the IRS, and it was sold at auction to cover the taxes. 
Finally there is the waitress who, over the years, didn't pay all the taxes she should have on the tips she made. She was reported, found guilty, and it was estimated that she owed more than $100,000 in back taxes, penalties and interest payments. Fair enough, you might say, except for one twist: her husband never had a clue that his wife was cheating the IRS. But he's been paying the price ever since. 
He lost his home, his vehicles, and his camp in order to help pay his wife's debt. In the meantime, they divorced--and to this day the wife does not work because, if she did, she would still owe the IRS. Instead, she has remarried and is supported by her new husband, while the ex-husband remains responsible for the debt he never knew a thing about. 
Now, I'm not saying that the IRS doesn't do a good job in many--if not most--cases. They have a difficult and unpopular task, and the law must be enforced. The delays, unfair treatment, and--in some cases--improper actions that have occurred with the IRS have undoubtedly been the result of a variety of factors, and the complexity of the tax code only compounds the problems for taxpayers who must interact with the IRS. 
In fact, to test the difficulty of the current income tax system, Money magazine had 45 different tax accountants prepare a tax return for the same family--and the result was 45 different returns that varied by 160 percent! When considering that there are 555 million words in the tax code, 480 different tax forms, and IRS employees give the wrong answers to taxpayers 30 percent of the time, it's no wonder the expects can't even agree on what a taxpayer owes! 
Therefore, although we won't be eliminating the complexity of the tax code today, I am pleased that the Senate is now considering comprehensive reform legislation that will attempt to end the abuse of already confused taxpayers by the IRS, and ensure that the enforcer of the tax law is no longer one of its greatest abusers. 
Mr. President, this legislation--which builds on the restructuring bill that was overwhelmingly passed by the House of Representatives this past November--includes a variety of critical reforms that will dramatically improve the oversight and management of the IRS. And, most importantly, the bill will make this agency more accountable to the very individuals they 
were intended to serve: the American taxpayer. 
Specifically, to improve the oversight and administration of the IRS, this legislation will establish an oversight board including the IRS Commissioner and six members from the private sector, which would have broad authority to review and approve strategic plans. In addition, it will establish local taxpayer advocates in every state, and strengthen the internal auditing of the agency. 
To create a more level playing field between the IRS and taxpayers, the bill will modify the practice of considering taxpayers guilty until they prove their innocence by shifting the burden of proof to the IRS in cases where the taxpayer is cooperative in providing information. It will also provide for greater taxpayer protection against interest assessments and penalties. 
To streamline congressional oversight of the IRS, it provides a means for ensuring that the IRS and Congress are aware of the most complicated aspects of the tax code that are generating the greatest compliance problems for taxpayers, and provide clear accountability to specific committees in the Congress. 
To be more responsive to taxpayers, this legislation provides critically needed relief to an `innocent spouse' who has no knowledge of the improper tax filings of his or her husband or wife; ensures that a taxpayer who has entered into an installment agreement to settle an outstanding tax bill will no longer be forced to pay `failure to pay' penalties during the period of repayment--which has never made any sense; and gives taxpayers more time to dispute IRS claims. 
And finally, to create a better IRS from the inside out, the bill provides increased flexibility for the IRS to recruit and retain the best agents possible, while establishing new performance measures that ensure agents are not ranked based on enforcement results or collections. 
Mr. President, the issue comes down to trust. The people of this nation must be able to trust that their government will be fair, will be discreet, will be responsive. Taxpayers should not fear the very institutions that are supposed to be serving them. We must ensure that government works for people, not against them. We must end the abuses at the IRS. 
The bill before us today will help restore taxpayer confidence in the system and rebuild the trust that has been eroded through years of egregious abuse. I commend the chairman of the Finance Committee for crafting and championing this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as we approach a new century with a globally competitive economy that increasingly puts pressure on many domestic industries, I believe it is critical that Congress recognize and address a serious need in our nation's workforce: the need to provide increased access to training for incumbent workers at small businesses. 
As the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources are aware, many states have seen workers displaced as long-standing local businesses have been downsized or closed. In Maine, we have endured dramatic shifts in our labor force as footwear manufacturers, textile manufacturers, and paper mills have been closed, and workers have been forced out of long-standing jobs that had been the cornerstone of their communities. This shift in long-standing industries is occurring not only in Maine, but across the nation as cities, towns, and communities attempt to stay one step ahead of the changing demands of the global job market. 
These displacements have demonstrated time and time again that the only certainty in the workforce is uncertainty--and the most important attribute that any worker can have when a job is in jeopardy is to have a broad base of training and skills. For only with a wide array of skills can any worker be truly confident that they have the knowledge and abilities necessary to rapidly adapt to today's changing work environment on-the-job--and the changing business environment that is driven by global competition. Therefore, I believe it is critical that we increase access to training for American workers and bring them some peace of mind that they will be ready for the changing skills demand--and the changing job market--that tomorrow will bring. 
In light of this need for increased training and skill development, I am particularly concerned about the plight of individuals who work at small businesses because--among all workers--these individuals are the least likely to receive training. I have had the opportunity to view this problem firsthand, and discuss it with individuals who have studied the problem extensively, as co-chair of the bipartisan Senate Manufacturing Task Force and as a member of the Senate Small Business Committee. 
Over and over again I have heard of the inability of workers at small businesses to have access to training--and the reason for this lack of access is clear: many small businesses simply do not have the financial resources necessary to provide training to their workers. 
Therefore, in response to the gaping training needs of workers at small businesses, I have offered legislation that is designed to directly address the inability of small businesses to afford training. Specifically, my legislation--S. 1170, the Working American Training Voucher Act--would provide $1,000 training vouchers to one million working men and women at small businesses across the United States. 
The legislation was crafted from the premise that we should not wait until a worker has been laid-off from their job, or a company shuts its doors and shutters its windows, to take steps to help the American worker receive adequate training. Rather, we should take steps to ensure that our nation's workforce is confident of their future and feels prepared to address the rapid changes that are occurring both in the global economy and on-the-job--especially as new technologies are introduced in the workplace that require an ever-expanding base of skills. 
Increasing access to training for incumbent workers at small business will not only address this need, but I think we would all agree that the best way to reduce the impact and cost of unemployment is to take steps to keep those who are already employed on-the-job.

Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Kennedy. Mr. President, while my legislation has not yet been acted on, I believe the legislation now before the Senate--S. 1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act (WIPA) provides us with an excellent opportunity to address the training needs of incumbent workers at small businesses. 
Mr. President, as has been outlined on the floor of the Senate today, the WIPA restructures and streamlines federal job training programs to improve the delivery of these services to millions of Americans in need, including disadvantaged adults and dislocated workers. For crafting a bill that improves the delivery of job training services nationwide, I would like to commend the authors of this legislation: the Chairman of the Labor and Employment Subcommittee, Senator DeWine; the distinguished Chairman of the Labor Committee, Senator Jeffords; the Ranking Member of the Labor Committee, Senator Kennedy; and the Ranking Member of the Employment and Training Subcommittee, Senator Wellstone. 
While I am very supportive of this legislation, I urge that provisions be added and modifications made during the upcoming House-Senate conference on the bill to improve access to training for incumbent workers at small businesses. Specifically, I urge that the Senate conferees look for opportunities to improve such access during the consideration of the newly-created training vouchers in Section 315; the transfer authority of job training monies by local partnerships in Section 306; the demonstration and pilot projects in Section 367; and any other section in which increased flexibility of job training monies would lead to improved access to training for incumbent workers at small businesses.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Old Orchard Beach High School of Old Orchard Beach, Maine, for winning first place at the Maine state competition of the `We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution' program, and for their strong effort at the national finals which took place here in Washington May 2 through May 4. 
I am proud that these outstanding young men and women have represented my home state. Their participation in the national finals is a direct reflection on the tremendous amount of hard work and commitment that the Old Orchard Beach students have invested in this project. The outstanding members of this class are: Lauren Asperschlager, Lucy Coulthard, Chad Daley, Rose Gordon, Krista Knowles, Nathan LaChance, Sarah Lunn, Sandra Marshall, Katie McPherson, Cindy St. Onge, Sam Tarbox, and Sharon Wilson. 
Also deserving of recognition is their teacher, Mr. Michael Angelosante, whose dedication to his students has played an integral role in their success. John Drisko, the Congressional District Coordinator, and Maine State Coordinator Pam Beal also each have contributed a great deal of time and effort to help Old Orchard Beach High's team. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that these students as well as others who competed from across Maine have increased their knowledge on the topic of our nation's governing document, the Constitution. One of the most critical components of a democracy is a knowledgeable citizenry. If our young people are to grow up to fully participate in their government, they must have a sound understanding of both the rights and responsibilities that come with citizenship in this great country. 
This program, `We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution', is one innovative way in which we can help provide that understanding. Students, in a simulated Congressional hearing, answer questions, make arguments and defend positions on a variety of contemporary and historical constitutional issues. I am proud that my staff in Maine has been involved in this program over the years. 
Again, I am pleased to congratulate the students of Old Orchard Beach High School. They are a credit to Maine and have made us proud.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the disaster supplemental conference report. I would like to thank the conferees and Chairman Stevens for their efforts to meet the additional needs Maine and the other Northeast states identified after the January ice storm. 
Since early January I have worked with the State, FEMA, SBA and other federal agencies to ensure that the devastation from Ice Storm `98 would become a memory and not a long-term problem in Maine. The impact of the storm was such that every Mainer who lived through it, will always remember it--whether it be for the length of time they were without power, the loss of trees throughout the state, the amazing utility crews from up and down the East Coast who worked to restore power or simply the viciousness of mother nature. 
The conference report provides assistance in several areas where current federal programs simply couldn't handle the entire problem or where no program existed. Our forests are in shambles due to the damage inflicted on the trees by the ice. The conference report provides $48 million to the US Forest Service in order to help the states and private land owners assess the damage and develop plans for clean up and for ensuring a healthy future for the forests. There is an additional $14 million in the Tree Assistance Program for cleanup. This funding is much needed and very welcome. 
There is $4.48 million included in the Emergency Conservation Program to help the maple syrup industry. This money, which will be matched, will help restore tubing which was torn from the trees by the ice and replace taps that were lost. 
I am pleased that the conference report also contains funding for the Northeast dairy farmers. The lack of electricity prevented many farmers from milking their cows or from being able to store their milk at the necessary temperature. The $10.8 million in the report will help cover some of these losses as well as pay for stock that was lost as a result of the storm. 
The $130 million included for the Community Development Block Grant program (CDBG) is not as much as I would have liked, but I understand that the conferees had a large gap to negotiate as the House bill provided only $20 million while the Senate bill had $260 million. This money is very important to Maine as it will assist the state in covering disaster-related costs unmet by FEMA, including the biggest unmet need in Maine--the costs associated with the damages to our utility infrastructure. 
I wish to reiterate my appreciation for the support that the Committee Chairman has shown for the needs of Maine and the Northeast states. His leadership has been vital in ensuring that the recovery from the Ice Storm of `98 for Maine, Vermont and New York will be completed as quickly as possible. Again, I appreciate his assistance and attention to the special needs of our states because of this one hundred year storm, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the conference report.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference report to H.R. 1757, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act. 
My opposition is tinged with a measure of regret, for this bill contains many provisions that I have worked on, first as Ranking member on the House International Operations Subcommittee for ten years and for two years as Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on International Operations. This bill consolidates our foreign policy apparatus by merging the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the United States Information Agency into the State Department--which will make our foreign policy machinery run more efficiently. 
With regard to arrearages owed to the United Nations, I supported the provisions of this bill--which are similar to provisions in my own UN Reform bill--which linked payment of funds owed by the United States to the United Nations implementing certain benchmark reforms including a reduction in the dues charged to the United States for the United Nations regular budget as well as our share of peacekeeping assessments. 
I have worked on six State Department authorization bills during my time in the Congress and know how difficult a process it is to assemble a consensus on the reorganization of the State Department. I was extremely pleased that this bill built upon the foundation the Foreign Relations Committee laid in the last Congress when I was Chair of the International Operations Subcommittee, I worked with Senator Helms on these most important foreign policy issues. The work done by Senators Helms and Biden on these matters is to be commended. 
However, this bill also contains a provision that would reinstate the Mexico City Policy in a way that imposes unacceptable restrictions in international family planning efforts. And for that reason I cannot support it. 
Mr. President, this issue is often referred to as the `Mexico City policy' issue because it was at the 1984 United Nations Population Conference in Mexico City that the Reagan Administration adopted for our international family planning programs a precursor of what became known as the `gag rule' for our own domestic family planning programs. Under the Mexico City policy, the Reagan Administration withheld international family planning funds from all groups that had even the slightest involvement in legal abortion-related services using their own private funds. 
Before I address what I believe to be the most troubling aspects of the current version of the `Mexico City policy,' let me first emphasize that no United States taxpayer funds are being used to pay for abortions overseas. Since 1973 an amendment, authored by the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, prohibits the use of United States funds for abortion services. That needs to be made clear in discussing United States funding for international family planning efforts. 
However, the current version of the so-called `Mexico City policy' contained in this bill is most troubling. Foreign nongovernmental organizations would still be barred from receiving family planning assistance if they, with their own funds, perform legal abortions. While the President can waive the ban on the performance of abortions, he is prohibited from using waiver authority granted him under section 614 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to permit these groups to lobby on abortion matters. 
As Secretary of State Albright noted, this lobby ban `is basically a gag rule that would punish organizations for engaging in the democratic process in foreign countries and for engaging in legal activities that would be protected by the First Amendment if carried out in the United States.' 
Let me take just a moment to illustrate what the practical effect this lobbying ban would have on international family planning efforts. 
If a foreign nongovernmental organization, or NGO, were to produce a paper that noted that a certain percentage of all maternal deaths in a certain part of the world are due to illegal abortion, it would lose their US family planning funds. The reason? This paper would be calling attention to `defects' in abortion laws. 
If the president of an NGO were to give a radio interview and make a `public statement' giving an opinion about his or her nation's own abortion law, that NGO would lose its US family planning funds. The reason? A question about abortion law was answered on the airwaves. 
These restrictions greatly concern me and they should concern anyone interested not only in the free exchange of ideas but the welfare of developing nations. 
Ever since the 1974 United Nations Population Conference in Bucharest, Romania the United States has been the traditional leader in international family planning assistance. Many of the world's developing nations at that time perceived family planning to be a western effort to reduce the power and influence of Third World nations. By the time of the Mexico City Conference ten years later, most developing nations had come to understand the importance of widely-available, voluntary family planning to their own nation's development potential. 
I believe that the absence of family planning assistance may well lead to more, not fewer, abortions being performed. If organizations such as the International Planned Parenthood Federation would be denied United States funds, we would be unable to support some of the most effective and capable family planning programs in the developing world. These programs are vital in preventing unplanned pregnancies, in reducing infant mortality and in promoting maternal and child health. 
I am also troubled by the message that this `gag rule' sends to nations all around the world about American values that I cherish--freedom of speech and participation in the political process of one's country. Under the restrictions imposed by this bill, a foreign nongovernmental organization would be required to remain silent on this issue. This restriction on public debate is unhealthy for the democratic process and is something Americans would not tolerate if attempts were made to impose it here at home. 
Finally, I am troubled by the fact that these restrictions would place the weight of the United States government behind efforts to tell NGOs what they can and can not do with their own, let me repeat that, their own, funds. These groups should not have to check in with the United States whenever they wish to issue a public statement, sponsor a conference, or distribute materials with their own money. 
Mr. President, international family planning should not be held hostage to these restrictions. The benefits of population control are substantial. Funds invested in family planning yield savings in maternal and child health care costs. Lower population growth rates make it easier for developing nations to institute the types of free market reforms that offer them their best hope for long-term sustainable development. Lower population growth places fewer strains on these nations political institutions which means there is less of a risk to international stability and peace. 
Lower population growth also places less of a strain on the environment. Reduced environmental trauma, improved standards of living, and reduced immigration pressures benefit every single living person on the planet. 
This conference report endangers all of these potential benefits. For this reason I will oppose its adoption and I urge my colleagues to do likewise.

Ms. SNOWE. I rise to express my intention to vote for the admission of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
In taking up this decision, the Senate takes up one of its basic constitutional mandates. A nation's most sacred obligation is to protect its citizens and its territory from hostile forces. The NATO alliance has been the cornerstone of our efforts to do so on behalf of free citizens for nearly 50 years. It has emerged as the most successful enterprise of common defense in human history. Any changes in the membership of the Alliance that we contemplate must undergo careful consideration. 
I have done so and am confident that this enlargement is in our national security interests and will ensure that NATO continues to do in the 21st century what it has done in the latter half of the 20th for the United States, and the people of Europe--guarantee their security, freedom and democratic forms of government. 
Mr. President, last year, I was asked by the Senate Majority Leader and the Senate Democratic Leader to join a bipartisan group of 28 Senators to study the issues associated with NATO enlargement. I was honored to join in such a task. The NATO alliance has been for nearly 50 years the greatest force for maintaining peace and security in the world. When it was funded, the United States had just emerged from fighting the most destructive war in history on the European continent and was just beginning to lead the fight against imperial Soviet communism--a Cold War against a totalitarian foe who was committed to imposing another form of tyranny first in Europe and then around the world. 
The nations of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland, therefore, faced the bitter prospect of exchanging one form of tyranny for another. I knew that if NATO was to continue to protect freedom and democracy in Europe, it needed to face the changing circumstances posed by the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact and communist ideology. The Alliance had to change in form to preserve the principles that it had safeguarded in modern times. 
Today, the United States and the other 15 members of the Alliance hope to move the frontiers of NATO eastward at a time when there is not a visible threat to the security of any of its members. When the Alliance expanded between the 1950s and the 1980s to add Greece, Turkey, West Germany and Spain, the grim shadow of Soviet power menaced Europe and the West. 
I believe that the parallels with the decision to expand NATO in the 1990s are in some ways similar to those which existed at the end of World War II. At that time, the strategic security situation on the continent of Europe was also in flux. The threat from Nazi Germany had collapsed, but no protective machinery had yet been set up to prevent the emergence of a new tyranny. As the great statesman Winston Churchill noted, `From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended upon the continent [of Europe].' 
Unlike the era beginning at the end of World War I, when we retreated 
from victory to a fateful isolationism, the United States realized that our own security depended upon the building and maintenance of a free and democratic Europe. 
President Harry Truman, with the able leadership of Senator Arthur Vandenberg, began the shaping of what became known as the `containment' policy. The United States and its friends in Europe would resist the westward march of communism. Harry Truman and his generation were determined to block the Soviet Union from leveraging the political fate of a continent that had drawn millions of Americans into war by ensuring that its expansion not go any further. 
At first it was thought that economic assistance to Europe was sufficient. The Marshall Plan, named for the then Secretary of State George Marshall, was first articulated in 1947 and approved by the Congress in 1948. Just as today some believe that membership in the European Union is enough to ensure the security of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, it was hoped in the 1940s that economic aid alone would suffice in strengthening Europe to resist the designs of the Soviet Union. However, that was not to be the case. Both the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia, and the 1948 Berlin blockade, convinced the United States that more than economic aid was needed to protect freedom and democracy in the Western world. 
As a result, on April 4, 1949, the United States and eleven nations of Western Europe signed the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington. NATO was born, and for the first time in history, a military alliance was created for the sole purpose of defending freedom and democracy. And without firing one shot in 40 years, it gave ready firepower to the policy of containing Communism until that system collapsed under its own contradictions. 
Our commitment to security in the North Atlantic Treaty is spelled out in Article V. The words `an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all' signify the commitment of this country to forego isolationism and to play a critical role in helping to guarantee freedom and security in Europe. 
Today of course, there is no immediate threat to the security of Western Europe. The United States and the other 15 members of NATO face an incipient Russian democracy. Communism as a system and a power 
has receded from the tormented heart of Europe. The mighty Red Army of the 1940s is now a force that is in military decline. Today, we live in a different world--but not one without dangers or threats. Today, we face our own set of challenges--and we must create our own set of solutions. 
The end of the Cold War has not meant that freedom has suddenly become free-of-charge. While the Soviet Union has disintegrated and the threat of invasion from a much weaker Russia has receded, this development by no means signals that NATO's mission has evaporated. To the contrary, just as NATO protected and guaranteed the freedom of the United States and Western Europe during the latter half of the twentieth century, it can, and must, continue to do so for all of Europe as we prepare to enter the new millennium. 
For forty years, NATO could protect only the Western half of Europe--the other half was trapped behind the Iron Curtain of communism. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, three of those nations--the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland are now poised to enjoy the freedoms that the totalitarians so long withheld and to take fresh responsibility for their political pluralism as members of a voluntary alliance. 
I know that some of my colleagues in this chamber, whose opinions I respect, assert that it is more important for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to achieve membership in the European Union and to enjoy the economic benefits that it offers as a prelude to joining NATO. This proposal brings the echoes of history to the Senate if we recall that some advocates of the Marshall Plan thought economic health was sufficient for the protection of freedom and democracy. Unfortunately, it was not true then, and it is not true today. 
The European Union is not a substitute for the NATO alliance. If that were the case, then the nations of Western Europe would not need the benefits of NATO membership to ensure their security. They realize that the two entities each serve their purpose and reinforce rather than substitute for each other. The European Union is an economic entity that will shepherd the prosperity of Europe well into the next century. I have little doubt that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will eventually become members. However, membership will only be part of the way they help fulfill their desire--for the first time in over fifty years--to determine for themselves how they will ensure their security. 
NATO was and is more than a defensive military alliance. It reflects the civic values underpinning trans-Atlantic security through the cultivation of peaceful ties among governments that rest on the consent of the governed. It is a tangible symbol of the resolve of democratic nations, united in a common purpose, to promote freedom and democracy. While the threat in the Cold War was from a large conventional army led by the Soviet Union that could sweep across Germany, today the threat is far more subtle but just as real. Today we all face threats from terrorism, weapons of mass destruction in the hands of rogue states and nationalistic passions liberated from Cold War restraints. The Gulf War showed that the United States and the European members of NATO face threats far from their borders. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic must deal with these same threats, and they can overcome them as members of the NATO alliance. 
Already, we have seen a preview of some of the potential security 
benefits of having these nations--all of which are now strong democracies that have worked to strengthen civilian control of the military--as NATO members: 
All three have contributed to the success of the SFOR mission in Bosnia. Hungary's base at Taszar has been host to over 95,000 U.S. military personnel rotating in and out of IFOR and SFOR duty. And if there had been a need to fight Iraq, our new NATO members would have been ready to assist. Poland has chemical weapons experts ready to support us if necessary. The Czech Republic would also supply chemical weapons experts. Hungary's Foreign Minister would have urged his nation's parliament to open its airspace and airports to U.S. aircraft if military action had been needed. 
The spur to all of these actions was prospective membership in NATO, and the assumption of a fair share of responsibilities as full fledged members of the Western community. This enthusiasm should make us realize how important NATO is and how established members often take the Alliance and its benefits for granted. 
It would be unjust to deny the Poles, Hungarians and Czechs a role in safeguarding the freedom of the European-American community--a freedom, incidentally, we rhetorically upheld for these nations over the past four decades. It would be morally wrong to create an artificial dividing line in Europe just a decade after another such line was erased. 
Mr. President, what would happen if the Senate were to reject NATO expansion? I believe that we would signal the willingness of the West to confuse the tranquility of today with the potential turmoil of tomorrow for which history warns us to prepare. If we reject expansion now, we would also reject the enduring link, shown by our experience in NATO, between democratic institutions and the defense of peace. 
The incentive of NATO membership has furthermore stabilized democratic forces in all three candidate nations. Poland instituted civilian control of the military and formed a joint battalion with the Danes and Germans. Hungary and Romania, the latter a possible future member of NATO, signed a treaty respecting the rights of the Hungarian minority in Romania. If NATO membership did not provide the framework for these actions, the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians could still be struggling with the social and military legacies of authoritarianism. 
Mr. President, if we were to reject the logical first step of NATO membership for these three states, then the progress made by these nations might be reversed. All three nations could and would be entitled to feel that NATO and the West do not care about them. We in the Senate would be sending a message that while the United States and Western Europe are entitled to the benefits of freedom and the confidence that a military alliance will sustain them that NATO is an exclusive club which will not admit those willing to make it even better. All three nations might then form another military bloc. 
Such an organization might turn inward or Eastward to make security arrangements without the participation of the West. But I would rather see Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic work within the NATO alliance to address the concerns of the Baltic states and other regional parties. 
Another aspect of this issue which has concerned me and I know, many Senators, is the 
cost of this expansion. It is a legitimate concern. The General Accounting Office produced a report just last month concluding that the Defense Department's assessment of the NATO cost of expansion was reasonable if the current environment of a diminished military threat to the continent will continue for years into the future. New members, in turn, will sustain their own internal budgets for critical defense modernization. It is also up to them to meet their formal treaty commitments to the commonly-funded budgets of the Alliance. 
The governments of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have agreed to specific 10-year obligations on payments for the integration of military systems and command structures with existing Alliance members. I commend our prospective new partners and the Defense Department for developing this blueprint for enlargement. They must also expect that NATO as well as Congress will hold them accountable for it. 
Mr. President, Secretary Albright summed it up well last year when she said: `Let us not deceive ourselves. The United States is a European power.' We fought two world wars because much of Western Europe was threatened, invaded and occupied. The Cold War was fought because some of these nations were again threatened and others forced to endure Communist tyranny. 
The enlargement of NATO will mean that more of Europe is part of an alliance designed to protect freedom and democracy. That makes conflict and the defense of our security interests much greater. 
NATO will be stronger with the addition of more territory and more armed forces--200,000 in fact--a valuable addition if we account for the reductions in Western military forces since the end of the Cold War. Peace through strength may be a slogan to the cynics, but to me, it summarizes the invaluable lesson that we learned on the post-war ashes of a Europe leveled by aggression. 
One of the Senate's most illustrious members, Senator Arthur Vandenberg, said at the time of NATO's founding in 1949 that `[NATO] is not built to stop a war after it starts . . . It is built to stop wars before they start.' 
The admission of these three applicants will strengthen NATO's ability to prevent war. I cannot imagine that the United States and the other members of NATO would do nothing if the territorial integrity of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were threatened--even if they were not a part of NATO. But by having them become members, we would bring into the democratic family a region that has hosted the century's bloodiest conflicts. 
Furthermore, by formally extending NATO's territorial jurisdiction further east, the Alliance will be even better placed to prevent any security threat to all of its members. NATO's role has evolved from deterring an invasion of the West by the Soviet Union to preventing armed conflict on the continent of Europe, and admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will augment this shift in mission. 
Others will argue that NATO expansion will cause problems in relations with Russia; that expansion undercuts efforts to build democracy in Russia; that we are still treating Russia as a Cold War adversary, instead of a nation building a democracy and a free-market economy or that expansion will anger Russia at a time when we need to work together on issues such as Iraq and the danger of weapons proliferation. Mr. President, I do not agree with these arguments. 
Even if NATO had never promised to expand, the United States and Russia would continue to have international policy differences. There is also no evidence that the prospect of NATO expansion has hurt efforts to ratify arms control treaties or to address concerns over the need to control nuclear weapons of all varieties. 
I also do not believe that enlargement will harm efforts to build a secure and strong democracy across the 11 time zones of Russia. The stability an enlarged NATO will bring to Eastern Europe will provide a more secure environment in which democracy's roots can grow stronger. NATO is furthermore not building a military force which can threaten Russia, as demonstrated by its intention not to station either nuclear weapons or substantial forces in the territories of the new members. 
Finally, the United States and NATO have worked hard to address Russian concerns over expansion through the Founding Act and the creation of the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council. The Permanent Joint Council allows NATO and Russia to talk directly about ways to promote and enhance Europe's security. It offers a means to discuss matters of concern to either or both parties. If Russia chooses to work with the Permanent Joint Council in a cooperative manner, then this Council can help take NATO-Russia relations to a level of cooperation that benefits all of Europe. The Permanent Joint Council, however, will never substitute for or supersede any NATO policy making organs. Russia does not have a veto over NATO actions and must never be allowed to obtain one. 
It is not possible for NATO to remain static and at the same time effective in the post-Cold War environment of Europe. NATO is, and must remain a military alliance that will guarantee the security of its members. However, it does face a different set of challenges as the 21st century approaches. Because the threat to NATO's territorial integrity today is significantly diminished, the Alliance has the opportunity to vanquish the dangers posed by unbridled nationalism and great power policies and to replace them with free-market democracies that can grow and prosper. 
Mr. President, when Secretary of State Madeleine Albright testified before the Foreign Relations Committee, she quoted an individual who appreciates what freedom means and that is not to be taken for granted. Czech President Vaclav Havel stated that `Even the costliest preventive security is cheaper than the cheapest war.' 
By admitting the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, NATO will be taking a giant step toward insuring that the freedoms won by Eastern and Central Europe at the end of this century will survive and prosper in the next. By expanding NATO, the West will ensure that the freedoms it preserved through the darkest days of World War II and the Communist threat of the 20th century will survive and prosper through the millennium. 
In conclusion, NATO enlargement will enhance our national security and the stability of Europe. As my former Senate colleague and current Defense Secretary Bill Cohen stated, `a stable Europe is necessary to anchor America's worldwide presence.' 
The addition of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to NATO will mean a stronger NATO, and our approval of this enlargement will show that the United States is ready to do so in the 21st Century what it did for the latter half of this one: be a force, with other democracies, for the protection of freedom today and for the generations to come.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my colleagues, Senator Collins from Maine and Senator Chafee from Rhode Island, in the wake of yesterday's 97 to 0 vote by the Senate to pass Senate Concurrent Resolution 90 acknowledging the historic Northern Ireland peace agreement reached just 2 weeks ago. 
The agreement was produced through the hard work and patience and goodwill of representatives of Northern Ireland's political parties, the Prime Ministers of both Britain and Ireland, President Clinton, and a man well known in this Chamber, the former Senator from Maine and former majority leader, George Mitchell. 
Senator Mitchell's skill, patience, and determination were largely responsible for bringing opposing parties to the point where they were able to broker a historic agreement that offers the people of Northern Ireland the opportunity to put an end to the longstanding fear and suffering they have endured and to achieve a future that will be as bright as the spirit and potential of her extraordinary people. 
In describing Senator Mitchell's pivotal role, one of the participants in the talks said, `Here the United States sent one of its most able, skilled, talented, humble politicians, a supreme diplomat, and frankly we didn't deserve him.' 
Well of course, the people of Northern Ireland deserved his leadership that has provided, as we now know, the very best opportunity for these talks to succeed. 
After his retirement from the Senate, President Clinton invited Senator Mitchell to serve as a special economic adviser to Northern Ireland. However, before he finished his efforts to attract business investment to Northern Ireland, Senator Mitchell was selected by both the British and Irish governments to join a panel that recommended the decommissioning of arms by the paramilitary factions in Northern Ireland. He assumed responsibility for taking over the peace talks in June of 1996. 
Senator Mitchell faced tremendous obstacles in attempting to win the trust of the parties involved in seeking an agreement. After all, previous efforts resulted in failure. However, his patience, diligence and sincerity won them over. I know that Senator Mitchell's long experience in the Senate helped prepare him for this unique challenge. As one who served with him for more than 14 years in the Maine Congressional Delegation, I know he has an excellent ability to understand the concerns of whomever he is talking with--whether it is a constituent from Bangor, or Augusta or Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland. 
Being an effective majority leader in the Senate, as we know, requires one to be a good listener, to know when to compromise, to know when to coax and cajole, to know when to be patient and to know when to be firm. All these qualities served George Mitchell well in this body and served him well in his most recent role which consumed 22 long, hard months of negotiations. 
This was by no means an easy task and often it must have seemed a hopeless one. However, the toll of the continuing violence in which over 3,200 people have died since 1969 led in the end to a deep yearning for peace. Individuals who grew up accustomed to violence were tired of going to funerals and watching their friends and family members die. Senator Mitchell led an effort that promised a way out--a path toward a future of peace and hope. In 1996 he proposed the decommissioning of weapons be addressed during the talks and that participants make a commitment to nonviolence. That was the same year that bombings took place in London and Manchester. Yet none of that deterred Senator Mitchell. When the agreement was concluded, he commented that `no one wants to go back to the bitterness of the past.' 
In his understated way, Senator Mitchell commented that `This agreement is a reason to celebrate. But by itself, it guarantees nothing.' I fervently hope that the agreement does indeed turn out to be the harbinger of a new era in Northern Ireland. Ultimately it is the Irish people, voting on May 22nd, who will determine whether or not this agreement will succeed. I am optimistic that it will. 
The agreement is a landmark achievement. There will be a 108 seat assembly in which Protestants and Catholics share responsibility and powers. It will be elected this June, and I hope those who are chosen in that election will share the dream that Senator Mitchell cited when he talked about the babies who were born in Northern Ireland on the same day his new son Andrew was born 6 months ago. 
Senator Mitchell said, `I believe that they are entitled to the same chance in life that I want for my son. Peace, political stability and reconciliation are not too much to ask for. They are the minimum that a decent civilized society provides.' 
Eloquent words that I am sure touched the hearts of mothers and fathers on both sides of the historic divide that has scarred Northern Ireland. 
In the agreement Senator Mitchell helped to forge, in addition to the afore-mentioned assembly, there will be a North/South Ministerial Council which will provide an opportunity for ministers from the Republic of Ireland to promote joint policymaking with the Northern Ireland Assembly. This council will have the opportunity to implement policies for the entire island of Ireland but only with the approval of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Irish Parliament in Dublin. This remarkable opportunity will allow the benefits of peace to be provided and to be shared by all the Irish people. 
At the conclusion of the talks, Senator Mitchell said, `It doesn't take courage to shoot a policeman in the back of the head, or to murder an unarmed taxi driver.' But he knows it does take courage to finally face down the horrors of sectarian violence, that it does take courage to realize that sometimes you have to make compromises for a future of peace. 
When he first visited Belfast and saw a 30-foot wall dividing neighborhoods, I am sure he was reminded of the most famous wall of all, the Berlin Wall, which came down in 1989 when communism crumbled. Just 2 years before a new millennium, the wall in Belfast still divides people. But this agreement may bring us one day closer to the day it, too, crumbles. 
Senator George Mitchell has helped broker an agreement that will, I hope, be the spark for an era of peace and prosperity for Northern Ireland and bring to a close one of this century's most tragic and stubborn conflicts. This agreement is one that should be celebrated for all it can bring to Northern Ireland. It should also be celebrated as proof of how one remarkable individual can make a difference for his fellow human beings. It is my fervent hope that the people of Northern Ireland will long remember and celebrate the contributions of this one man, George Mitchell, toward providing them the key to a lasting peace. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I rise to express my support for Senate Concurrent Resolution 90, which acknowledges the historic Northern Ireland Peace Agreement reached just two weeks ago. 
Both the governments of the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom have worked for many years to facilitate a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Northern Ireland that has cost so many lives and caused so much suffering. Ultimately, it was the willingness of the representatives of Northern Ireland's political parties to adhere to the principles of non-violence that helped create an atmosphere that led to this most historic agreement. 
I commend all those who helped lay the groundwork for this achievement: Prime Minister Tony Blair, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and President Clinton for their dedication to the peace process. And I am especially proud of my former colleague, Senator George Mitchell, for his patient and herculean efforts to heal the deep wounds of this tragic conflict. 
It will come as no surprise to my fellow Mainers and my Senate colleagues that Senator Mitchell would be unduly modest in recognizing the role he has played. As he noted, it may be true that the agreement alone `guarantees nothing.' But it does bestow the precious gift of hope upon a people who finally have `the chance for a better future.' 
In his quiet, understated way, George Mitchell brought individuals who had been in conflict for the past thirty years out of the shadows of distrust and into the light of faith--faith in a nonviolent, democratic resolution. As one of the participants in the talks commented, `Here the United States sent one of its most able, skilled, talented, humble politicians, a supreme diplomat, and frankly we didn't deserve him.' 
That is a poignant and appropriate tribute to a man who has helped bring the promise of peace to a region most deserving of its blessings. As one who served with him in the Congress for nearly 15 years, I am proud to extend my gratitude to Senator Mitchell for his extraordinary work. And I do so knowing that the honor which would please George Mitchell most would be the true and lasting success of the remarkable agreement he helped to broker. 
May the Northern Ireland Peace Agreement finally bring an end to the fear and suffering, and may the future of Northern Ireland be as bright as the spirit and potential of her extraordinary people.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Vice Admiral George R. Sterner, United States Navy, who will retire on May 1st upon completing 36 years of faithful service to our nation. 
During his distinguished career, Vice Admiral Sterner played a significant role in reshaping the way the Navy develops, acquires, modernizes, and maintains its ships and systems so that our Sailors and Marines have the best equipment in the world at an affordable price. 
Vice Admiral Sterner's career began in 1962 upon his commissioning as an Ensign in the United States Navy. During the years that followed, he served aboard four submarines and commanded two others. His shore assignments included duty on the staff of the Commander in Chief, United States Atlantic Fleet; Branch Head for submarine tactical weapons on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations; Program Manager for the Mark 48 Advanced Capability Torpedo; and Program Executive Officer for Submarine Combat and Weapons Systems. 
After serving in two senior Naval Sea Systems Command positions, Vice Admiral Sterner took charge of this organization on April 25, 1994. As Commander of the largest of the five Navy Systems Commands, Vice Admiral Sterner re-energized an agency in turmoil as a result the largest restructuring since World War II. Managing a budget of approximately $14 billion annually and managing more than 180 acquisition programs, he has been a responsible steward of taxpayer dollars while insuring that we have technically-superb, world-class naval fleet. 
As a testament to his dynamic leadership, the National Performance Review chose to honor him and his command with 27 Hammer Awards for contributions to create a government that works better and costs less. 
Closer to home, Vice Admiral Sterner has been a friend to the dedicated men and women who works at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. Thanks in part to his vision, the Shipyard retains its important military-industrial capabilities and continues to provide critical jobs for the region. 
Vice Admiral George Sterner's innovation has positioned the Naval Sea Systems Command for the 21st Century. He is an individual of uncommon character and his professionalism will be sincerely missed. I am proud, Mr. President, to thank him for his honorable service in the United States Navy, and to wish him `fair winds and following seas' as he closes his distinguished military career.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support of Justice Kermit Lipez's nomination to become a judge on the First Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. 
Justice Lipez has many qualifications to recommend him and I want to take a few minutes to touch on them. But before I begin, I want to take this opportunity to thank the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, for all that he has done in getting the Committee to promptly consider Justice Lipez's nomination and bringing us to this vote today. Throughout this process, Senator Hatch has been consistently thoughtful and cooperative, and I want him to know how much I appreciate his invaluable contributions and assistance. 
The Senate's action today will be the culmination of an exemplary career on the state bench--a career that has earned Justice Lipez universal respect in Maine's legal community, regardless of political affiliation. This is a man who was appointed to the state bench by a Democratic Governor, was promoted to the Maine Supreme Court by a Republican Governor--my husband, John McKernan, Jr: and whose nomination to the First Circuit was enthusiastically supported by Maine's current Independent Governor. 
Likewise, it was no coincidence that Maine's entire Congressional Delegation--representing both parties--stood proudly with Justice Lipez and testified on his behalf at his nomination hearing. All of this points to one irre- futable fact: by all accounts and by any measure, Kermit Lipez is an exceptional judge. And he will make us proud. 
At Justice Lipez's hearing before the Judiciary Committee, my friend from Delaware, Senator Biden, noted the high regard in which the First Circuit is held. He wanted to impress upon Justice Lipez that, if confirmed, he would join a very impressive and effective court. I trust and share my friend from Delaware's assessment of the First Circuit--and I want to assure him and all of my colleagues that in this regard, Justice Lipez and the First Circuit are an ideal match. 
That is not a statement I make lightly. The facts reveal a judge that for 
thirteen years on the state bench has been a judge personally and professionally dedicated to excellence. 
But you don't have to take my word for it. Since the President nominated Justice Lipez for this post, I have been privileged to read numerous letters in support of his nomination. 
Justice Lipez's has been called a `. . . truly outstanding nomination,' by a senior member of the First Circuit, Judge Frank Coffin. He has been characterized as `. . . at the top of Maine's jurists' by the Dean of the University of Maine's Law School, Donald Zillman. And his present colleagues on Maine's Supreme Court have commented that he works as hard on their cases as he does on his own, and for that, they will miss him. 
It's not just Justice Lipez's colleagues or his congressional delegation who support him, but just about anybody who has taken the time to review his record. An editorial that ran in Maine's largest newspaper, the Portland Press Herald, put it this way: `. . . (he) has proven to be a fair and thoughtful judge during his 12 years on the state Superior and Supreme Courts. . . . Lipez's resume and record . . . transcend politics.' 
Maine's second largest newspaper, the Bangor Daily News, echoed this sentiment, commenting that Justice Lipez was `remarkably talented' and that `. . . the state should feel nothing but honor that Kermit Lipez will represent Maine on the second-highest court in the nation.' Mr. President, I couldn't agree more. 
I believe we should expect any federal judge to demonstrate a personal dedication to his or her work, a thorough understanding of the law, and a balanced approach to jurisprudence. Justice Lipez has demonstrated all of these attributes with admirable regularity. 
What makes me so proud to support his nomination, however, is the fact that he will bring so much more than just the prerequisites to the federal bench. 
For with Justice Lipez also comes a deep respect for the law--and a judge's role in its administration. With him comes an outstanding legal mind that is not only able, but willing to make the right decision even when it's not the easy or expeditious one. And with the nomination of Justice Lipez, the federal bench will welcome a man of the utmost personal integrity--a man well represented by his work ethic, his tremendous talent, and his irreproachable personal character. 
Mr. President, I am proud that Justice Lipez will represent Maine on the First Circuit. He has precisely the kind of experience and disposition that we should expect from all our nominees. He is well-tested, remarkably talented, and perfectly suited for the demanding work of the federal bench. The President and the Judiciary Committee have acted wisely in forwarding Justice Lipez's nomination, and it is time for the Senate to do likewise by confirming him. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this outstanding nominee.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the FY 1999 budget resolution is the first resolution that has been crafted since the historic balanced budget agreement was reached and enacted just 10 short months ago. 
I would first like to congratulate the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Pete Domenici, for bringing us to the point where a balanced budget is no longer just a projection at end of some indeterminate period of time--but may actually be a reality by the end of the current fiscal year. His years of dedication to balanced budgets and his ongoing commitment to being a responsible steward of the taxpayer's dollar may soon be rewarded--and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to serve with him on the Budget Committee during this historic time. 
Furthermore, I believe that the resolution that Chairman has crafted deserves the support of no less than each of the 76 members who voted for last year's bipartisan agreement. This resolution is not only consistent with that agreement, but also adds critical funding for a multitude of programs that are priorities for many in the Senate: child care, health research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), smoking cessation programs, and federal funding for the Individuals with Disability Education Act (IDEA), to name just a few. Any member who heralded last year's budget agreement--or who voted in favor the provisions and spending targets it contained--would be hard-pressed to explain why this resolution does not deserve their support this year. 
Mr. President, as I stated during the recent markup of this resolution in the Budget Committee, I believe it is important that we establish several guiding principles in crafting the FY 1999 budget resolution. I am proud to say that the resolution we crafted--and which is now being considered by the full Senate--achieves all of these goals. 
First, based on the 29-year losing streak we have had in balancing the federal budget, we have an obligation to craft a resolution that puts us on a credible and prudent path that will keep the budget balanced for many years to come. 
Second, we must craft a budget resolution that is based on the balanced budget agreement that was enacted 10 short months ago. 
Third, with an eye to the future, we must preserve the Social Security program before utilizing any portion of forthcoming surpluses for spending increases or tax cuts. 
And, fourth, we must ensure that any monies generated by tobacco revenues in the months ahead be utilized to preserve and protect Medicare. 
Although it would seem that these principles will be easy to attain, Congress' unproven track record of keeping the budget in balance, the tenuous nature of our economic assumptions, and the overwhelming desire of some individuals to `spend' money we don't even have, will make this difficult. 
As I said, Congress has been on a 29-year losing streak when it comes to balancing the budget--we have no track record of getting the budget in balance or keeping it in balance. Therefore, much as I am pleased that CBO now projects an $8 billion surplus this year and total surpluses of $151 billion over the next five years, I believe we have an obligation to prove to the American people that we will ensure these projections become a reality not only for the next five years, but year-after-year in the future. 
Achieving this goal will be harder than it looks. The simple fact is that the current outlook and surplus estimates are based on extremely tenuous projections. Therefore, to modify a well known saying, `we shouldn't count our surpluses before they're hatched.' 
First, our estimated surpluses are based on the assumption that we will have no recessions or economic downturns in the coming 10 years. Based on the fact that we are now in the midst of one of the longest stretches of sustained economic growth in our nation's history, this seems to be a fragile estimate at best. 
Specifically, as the chart behind me indicates, the current period of sustained economic growth first started in March 1991. If it continues until December 1998, it will match the duration of the longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history--the `Reagan expansion'--which lasted 92 straight months (i.e. November 1982 to July 1990). 
Furthermore, if this expansion continues until early 2000, it will be longest period of expansion ever--peacetime or wartime--which was set in the 1960's (106 straight months, from February 1961--December 1969). 
Therefore, If CBO's projection come true and growth is sustained through 2008, we will double the all-time record of 106 straight months set in 1969. Needless to say, with 61% of the economists surveyed by Blue Chip believing a recession is likely to occur before March 2000, these estimates of prolonged economic growth leading to substantial surpluses should be viewed with a health dose of skepticism. 
Furthermore, our estimates for growth in even the current year are predicated on shaky estimates. Specifically, although the impact of the Asian economic crisis has seemed only slight up until now, we still do not know how severe the overall impact will be--and we certainly won't know until later in the year when it's too late to alter the budget. 
Already, just two weeks ago, we learned that the U.S. trade deficit for the month of January soared to a new all-time record of $12 billion, as exports to Asia dropped precipitously. According to a recent Washington Post article, many economists expect that because of problems in Asia, the trade deficit will widen substantially this year from the $114 billion deficit posted in 1997--which was already the largest trade deficit our nation had posted in nine years. Needless to say, if this situation persists and worsens, there will be a drag on the U.S. economy. 
In light of these risks, we would be wise to heed the caution of CBO when it comes to touting the budget outlook. As CBO outlined in their own January report, the economy is `highly unlikely to develop precisely as the forecast predicts'--and even a moderate recession, such as the one experienced in the early 1990's, could lead to the budget outlook deteriorating by `more than $100 billion' for a year or more. In fact, if projected growth is even 0.5% lower than CBO projects over the next 10 years, the budget outcome will be $150 billion worse than projected in 2008. 
It is because of CBO's own cautions that I am especially concerned with the economic and budget estimates of OMB. Although the CBO and OMB estimates are very close together, the simple fact is that OMB still provides a more favorable economic outlook in coming years. Specifically, as 
a result of more favorable growth estimates and lower inflation estimates, OMB's estimated surpluses are $66 billion--or 30 percent--higher than CBO. Therefore, prudence dictates that OMB's estimates be viewed with even greater skepticism than the already optimistic projections of CBO. 
Clearly, if we are to establish a track record of balanced budgets, we must chart a prudent course in the budget resolution. And for this reason, we must adopt a resolution that not only follows CBO's more modest economic estimates, but that also adheres strictly to last year's balanced budget agreement. This body should do nothing to jeopardize that agreement, which put in place strict spending limits that will improve the chances of projected surpluses becoming actual surpluses. 
Regrettably, the President does not seem to share this view. Rather, he views the recent favorable estimates as an opportunity to spend money, create new programs, and violate the terms and spirit of the budget agreement we reached just 10 short months ago! 
By proposing to increase taxes by $105 billion and to increase spending by $118 billion, the President's budget would revert to the tax-and-spend policies that the American people believed we abandoned three years ago. 
Furthermore, although President Clinton has urged that Congress not spend the surplus until Social Security is fixed, CBO now tells us that the President's own budget would not only spend the surplus, but also cause a deficit in three years! Specifically, as CBO stated in their March 4 preliminary analysis of the President's budget: `CBO estimates that the President's policies will reduce projected baseline surpluses by $43 billion between 1999 and 2003--and will temporarily dip the budget back into red ink by a small amount in 2000.' 
Needless to say, these aren't the kind of policies that Congress agreed to when we crafted the bipartisan balanced budget agreement last year--and that's not what the American people were led to believe would happen when President Clinton unveiled his budget proposal in February. 
While some may argue that the President is not bound by last year's budget agreement because the budget may be balanced sooner than expected, I have only one thing to say: I don't remember any clause in the agreement that read: `If a balanced budget is achieved prior to 2002, the terms and spending limits of this agreement are automatically waived.' 
Fortunately, the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Pete Domenici, understands the need for prudence, and crafted this resolution accordingly. 
As the budget before us demonstrates, the Chairman believes that we have an obligation to treat this favorable budget news as a chance to prepare for the future and address the long-term demands that retiring Baby Boomers will place on our budget in 10 short years. 
Specifically, this resolution adheres to the budget agreement we struck 10 months ago. Also, he leaves every dime of every future surplus to the Social Security Trust Fund--which is just as the President urged us to do, though his own budget does not. And, finally, he ensures that Congress does not forget or ignore the plight of Medicare--a critical program that will be insolvent in 2008, which is long before Social Security will be insolvent, and sooner than many would like to remember. 
To achieve this final goal, the Chairman has wisely walled-off any monies we receive from tobacco legislation and dedicated it to Medicare. In comparison, the President would like to target these monies to a host of new programs that he believes will have popular appeal. Perhaps targeting windfall revenues to a program that our elderly rely on for their medical needs isn't as appealing as handing out new `goodies' in an election year, but I certainly believe it would be more responsible and prudent. 
In addition, when considering the cost of smoking-related illnesses on the Medicare program each and every year, linking any forthcoming tobacco revenue to the Medicare program is imminently appropriate. As the chart behind me indicates, Columbia University found that smoking-related illnesses cost the Medicare program $25.5 billion in 1995 alone. In fact, of the various forms of substance abuse that affect the Medicare program, tobacco-related illnesses accounted for 80% of the approximately $32 billion total costs in 1995. 
Therefore, even assuming that these costs have not risen since 1995--which is doubtful--then the President's budget, which assumes tobacco revenues of approximately $13 billion in each of the coming five years, will not even come close to covering the costs of tobacco on the Medicare program. In fact, the President's assumption would cover only slightly more than half of these annual costs. Needless to say, the budget resolution's assumption that these monies be used to shore-up the Medicare program is more than justified when considering these facts. 
Now, some members have expressed concern that walling-off tobacco revenues in this manner will harm our efforts to pass comprehensive tobacco legislation later this year. As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee--the Committee that will soon be marking-up this legislation--I cannot emphasize enough that this concern is unfounded. 
The tobacco reserve fund does not imperil comprehensive tobacco legislation, as some members on the other side of the aisle will contend. Rather, just the opposite is true: It will protect future tobacco legislation. 
The simple fact, Mr. President, is that the more uses we identify for possible tobacco revenues in the budget resolution, the more the urge to spend money will become the driving force for tobacco legislation. If that happens, the only winners will be the tobacco companies, because Congress 
will have lost sight of the true goal of that legislation: reducing--if not eliminating--teen smoking. 
Tobacco companies would like nothing more than for those of us who are committed to passing comprehensive tobacco legislation to argue about how money will be spent. The simple fact is that if we divvy-up the pot of potential tobacco money in this resolution, we will face enormous pressure to simply pass a tobacco bill at all costs, regardless of its merits. Such a bill could well-contain many weak provisions that favor tobacco companies--but the pressure to `spend the money' will drive members to overlook the inherent flaws of such a bill. 
As the Washington Post stated in a February 3 editorial: `Mr. Clinton would pay for a fair amount of his program with a tobacco bill that he has thus far not submitted. He is relying on Congress to write it. He says that as a deterrent to smoking, it should raise the price of smoking $1.50 a pack in real terms over 10 years, and he proposes a division of the revenue. The problem with that will be if the money becomes more important than the rest of the bill, and the tobacco companies are able, as is their intent, to buy weaker legislation than might otherwise be passed.' 
That's not an outcome that I want for tobacco legislation--and that's not the outcome that I believe the American people want either. 
Unfortunately, those who would attempt to push for an advance-divvying of the tobacco `piggy-bank' drive us toward that outcome. 
The fact of the matter is that the Chairman's mark will ensure that tobacco legislation to reduce teen smoking is able to move forward based on sound policy--not politics. Limiting the use of the federal share of future tobacco monies to Medicare is not an impediment to tobacco legislation--it is an enabler. 
Mr. President, if I understand the argument of the minority accurately, they believe that limiting the use of the federal share of tobacco monies to Medicare will impose an additional hurdle to tobacco legislation. They are saying that it will prevent tobacco monies from being used for important tobacco-related purposes, such as smoking cessation programs and health research. 
As the Chairman has outlined, his budget resolution does more for these programs today than any theoretical tobacco bill is able to do. This resolution provides $800 million for tobacco cessation and prevention programs, and $15 billion for research at the NIH. That's real money--not the illusory money that we simply hope tobacco legislation will generate in the future. 
Now, some may argue that this budget simply does not provide enough for these or other smoking-related programs, and that any forthcoming tobacco legislation should provide additional monies for these purposes. That's a legitimate argument. 
But the simple fact is that this budget will not prevent additional monies from being provided for such purposes if a tobacco bill is passed. In fact, the budget resolution will not even prevent tobacco monies from being diverted to programs that have nothing to do with tobacco. 
The bottom line is that if tobacco legislation is brought up on the floor of the Senate and members wish to divert monies for any number of purposes--either related to smoking or not related to smoking--they can do that. It will simply take 60 votes to waive the point of order that this resolution would create against such spending--which is the same margin of votes that will be required to end debate on that same tobacco bill (achieve cloture). 
Therefore, in light of the fact that it will take at least 60 votes to end debate on a tobacco bill and--ultimately--to pass a tobacco bill, this point of order is not onerous. It simply ensures that we keep our priorities straight from the start (Medicare), and ensures that the various ways we spend tobacco monies will have the same level of support as the tobacco bill itself. 
The bottom line is that if Congress believes that more money is needed from the tobacco bill to pay for smoking cessation and other tobacco-related programs, garnering 60 votes to waive the point of order will not even be an issue. Therefore, arguing that this requirement--which is no more onerous than the 60-vote margin that will be required to end debate and pass the tobacco bill--endangers tobacco legislation, is completely inaccurate. 
The bottom line is that this resolution seeks to protect tobacco legislation from being weakened or undermined by a `rush for the money.' So I hope that those who are concerned about tobacco legislation will join us in this effort to keep the focus of tobacco legislation on reducing teen smoking--not on spending money. 
I want a strong, effective tobacco bill--I don't want it undermined and weakened because the `politics of spending' got in the way of good policy. 
Mr. President, these and other principled decisions that are embodied in this resolution will undoubtedly be challenged by those who would like to open the fiscal floodgates and start spending at will or pass another round of tax cuts. However, I believe that as we move from a period of deficit politics 
to surplus politics, we should exercise discipline and prudence to ensure expectations are met--not re-open the federal credit card account that got us into so much trouble in the first place. 
At the same time, maintaining fiscal discipline and adhering to last year's balanced budget agreement does not mean that we must ignore important issues confronting our nation today. Specifically, within existing budget constraints, we can and should address the educational needs of our children and tackle the child care crisis that is affecting countless families nationwide. 
But funding these and other priorities doesn't require that we violate last year's spending caps--rather, they require that we prioritize our spending and have the will to target our spending accordingly. 
In particular, I would like to highlight the manner in which the Chairman properly accommodated one such priority--child care--in this resolution. As the leaders of both parties an the Administration have demonstrated through a variety of proposals, improving child care should be a priority during the current Congress. And in light of the ever-expanding need for child care assistance, such a decision is not surprising. 
In 1995, 62 percent of women with children younger than 6 years of age--which means 12 million children--were cared for by someone other than a parent during working hours, and the numbers have not improved. Yet the supply of child care does not meet demand, and existing child care is often unaffordable. In fact, on average, child care costs range from $3,000 to $8,000 per year, and can be even higher for infant care. 
Safety is also a factor that looms heavily on parents' minds--in fact, a U.S. News and World Report article last August found that 76 children died in day care in 1996. This is tragic and should not be the case. Placing children in child care should be an act of confidence, not a leap of faith. 
Finally, many families who wish to care for a young child at home--even for a short period of time--cannot afford to forgo the second income, while other families undertake great scarifies to do so. But what many American families share is that terrible feeling that they have no option. And it should not be this way. 
That is why the assumptions of this budget resolution are so critical. Not only would this budget double funding for the Child Care Development Block Grant (CCDBG)--going from $5 billion to $10 billion--over the coming five years, but it would also ensure that any tax package subsequently passed by the Finance Committee provide tax relief to families struggling with child care. I believe that these are policies that both Democrats and Republicans alike can and should embrace. 
In January, I introduced a comprehensive bill--the Caring for Children Act--with Senators Chafee, Hatch, Roberts, and Specter, that is designed to increase the availability of a safe and affordable child care. That legislation would expand the Dependent Care Tax Credit, and for the first time make this credit available to families where a parent stays at home to care for a child. It also encourages public-private partnerships, provides increased funding for quality, and doubles funding for the Child Care Development Block Grant. 
Although the budget resolution does not advocate any particular child care bill, I am pleased that the assumptions included in this budget would comport with our bill, and I hope that policies along these lines will be enacted in the coming months. 
I know that other child care bills have been introduced in the Senate--including a bill introduced by Senator Dodd, along with Senators Murray and Conrad. I truly believe that we are not that far apart in terms of policy, and I look forward to a time when we can work together to bridge these differences. 
At the same time, I also know that there are those who will be adamant that the increased funding provided in the budget resolution for the Child Care Development Block Grant be mandatory in nature. However, I believe that the large increase in discretionary funding provided in the resolution is the most fiscally responsible approach to this nation's child care needs--and is quite an accomplishment when considering the fiscal constraints imposed in last year's bipartisan balanced budget agreement. 
To those who will say that the Appropriations Committee will not be able to locate additional funds within the discretionary caps for child care, say, If child care is truly a priority, then it is simply a matter of having the will--and casting the votes--to ensure that an additional $1 billion per year is identified during the appropriations process for child care as we weigh our spending priorities. And considering that the President has proposed more than $47 billion in non-defense discretionary cuts over the coming five years, this is hardly a practical impossibility--it is only a matter of will. 
Mr. President, this decision to dramatically increase funding for child care is but one of many decisions contained in this resolution that will address shared priorities. While some may argue that the recent favorable budget outlook gives us leeway to fund these priorities out of surplus monies or hoped-for tobacco revenues, the bottom line is that Republicans and Democrats alike fought hard for, and agreed to, this bipartisan agreement only ten months ago. 
We should not take steps now to violate not only that agreement, but our trust with the American people. We have a responsibility to abide by this agreement, and the Chairman provided very generous funding within these constraints to ensure that child care and other priorities are properly addressed. 
The bottom line is that this resolution abides by last year's balanced budget agreement; provides increased funding for critically needed priorities; preserves every penny of every surplus over the coming five years to protect Social Security; and ensures that any windfall revenues from tobacco legislation will be used to buttress the Medicare program. 
The fact that this budget resolution abides by last year's agreement should be reason enough for each of the 76 members who voted for last year's agreement--including 36 Democrats--to vote for this budget plan. And the fact that it contains these other strong provisions should lead to even stronger bipartisan support. Therefore, I urge that my colleagues support this soundly-crafted resolution. 
Mr. President, there is a saying: `Money's only something you need if you're around tomorrow.' While this may be true for an individual, it doesn't make for good federal policy. Therefore, I congratulate the Chairman of the Budget Committee for recognizing that being a good steward of the federal budget requires that we ensure there is money around tomorrow--even if we are not. 
Our children and grandchildren are counting on us to make decisions today that will ensure they are not left with a mountain of unpaid bills and a host of unresolved problems on the horizon. The budget that you have crafted--and that is now before this body--would protect them from both of these dangers, and I congratulate you for your continued foresight. Thank you, Mr. President, and I look forward to voting in favor of this resolution.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of HR 629, the Texas Compact Consent Act of 1997, which addresses the disposal of low-level radioactive nuclear waste for Maine, Vermont and Texas--and to thank the cosponsors of this bill: Senators Collins, Leahy, and Jeffords, as well as Senators Hutchison and Gramm of Texas for their invaluable assistance and support. 
In 1980, Congress told the states to form compacts to solve their low-level waste disposal problems. Subsequently, Congress authorized a means of establishing these compacts without violating the Interstate Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. 
As you can see from the chart behind me, 41 states have now joined together to form nine different compacts across the country. Forty-one states. The compact before us today will simply add three more states to the nation's compact network, and carry out what these 41 other states have already been allowed to do. 
As the law requires, Texas, Vermont and Maine have negotiated an agreement that was approved by each state: in the Texas Senate by a vote of 28 to zero, and voice voted in the House; in Vermont, the bill was also voice voted by large margins in both bodies. 
In Maine, the Senate voted 26 to 3 to pass the compact; in the House, 131 to 6. In addition, 73 percent of the people in a state-wide referendum approved the Compact. All three Governors signed the bill. And, last October 7th, the House passed the Texas Compact by an overwhelming vote of 309 to 107. Decisive victories on all counts, and by any measure. 
So, we have before us a Compact that has been carefully crafted and thoroughly examined by the state governments and people of all three states involved. Now all that is required is the approval of Congress, so that the State of Texas and the other Texas Compact members will be able to exercise appropriate control over the waste that will come into the Texas facility. 
Let me be clear: the law never intended for Congress to determine who pays what, how the storage is allocated, and where the site is located. To the contrary: the intent of the law is for states to develop and approve these details, and for Congress to ratify the plan. A quick review of history bears this out--for the nine compacts that have been consented to by the United States Congress, not one of them was amended. Not one of them. 
It is very important for my colleagues to know that the language ratified by each state for this Compact is exactly the same language, and if any change is made by Congress, the Compact would have to be once again returned to each state for reratification. 
And let me take this opportunity to clear up some other misconceptions about this compact, which are being used by our opponents to cast discredit on this legislation. 
The Compact before us does not discuss any particular site for the disposal facility. Let me repeat that--this bill has nothing to do with the location of a facility in Texas, as some would have us believe. It only says that Texas must develop a facility in a timely manner, consistent with all applicable state and federal environmental, health, and public safety laws. 
This is being done. The Texas Office State Office of Administrative Hearings is presently conducting several evidentiary hearings at various locations all around the state of Texas to evaluate a proposed site. All voices are being heard, and the state of Texas will decide, as it should. 
Opponents of the Texas Compact would have you believe that should we ratify this Compact it will open the doors for other states to dump nuclear waste at a site, in the desert, located five miles from the town of Sierra Blanca, exposing a predominantly low-income, minority community to health and environmental threats. 
The truth is that Texas has been planning to build a facility for its own waste since 1981, long before Maine first proposed a Compact with Texas. That is because whether or not this Compact passes, Texas still must somehow take care of the waste it produces. 
Further, absent the protection of this Compact, Texas must, I repeat must, open their borders to any other state for waste disposal or they will be in violation of the Interstate Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Compact gives Texas the protection that oversight commissioners, mostly appointed by the elected Governor of Texas but also with a say from Maine and Vermont, will decide what is best for Texas. 
Local support for the Compact was evidenced just last month in state elections held in Texas. The Hudspeth County judge, who is the top elected official who runs county business where the site has been proposed, and who has strongly declared his support for the Compact, won his race for reelection. Two candidates for county commissioner who also support the Compact won their races over two opponents of the Compact. 
The opponents of the Compact would have you believe this issue is about politics. It is not about politics, it is about science: sound science. It is very dry in the Southwest Texas area, where the small amount rainfall it receives mostly evaporates before it hits the ground. The aquifer that supplies water to the area and to nearby Mexico is over 600 feet below the desert floor and is encased in rock. 
The proposed site has been designed to withstand any earthquake equaling the most severe that has ever occurred in Texas history. Strong seismic activity in the area is non-existent. All these factors mean that the siting of this facility is on strong scientific grounds. 
Our opponents say we will be bad neighbors if we pass this Compact because the proposed site is near the Mexican border. In fact, the U.S. and Mexico have an agreement, the Las Paz Agreement, to cooperate in the environmental protection of the border region. The Las Paz Agreement simply encourages cooperative efforts to protect the environment of the region. 
Any proposed facility will be protective of the environment because it will be constructed in accordance with the strictest U.S. environmental safeguards. In addition, both the Mexican National Water Commission and the National Nuclear Security and Safeguards Commission have stated that the proposed site meets the Mexican government's requirements. 
Without question, the far bigger threat to the border environment is the untreated sewage dumped into the Rio Grande River by poor border communities on both sides of the river, and large factories, or maquiladoras on the Mexican side of the river that do not adhere to these stringent U.S. environmental standards. 
Mr. President, when this Compact is adopted--and it is clear that it should be adopted without amendments--the States of Texas, Maine and Vermont will become the forty second, forty third and forty fourth states to be given Congressional approval for forming a compact. And they will meet their responsibilities under federal law for the disposal of their low-level waste from universities, hospitals, medical centers, and power plants and shipyards. 
I, along with my colleagues from the Texas Compact states, urge the Senate to give us this reasoned opportunity, which has widespread public support in Texas, Maine and Vermont. I urge the Senate to adopt S. 270.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the disaster supplemental bill. I want to thank Chairman Stevens, Ranking Member Byrd and the Committee for their efforts to provide funding to fill the gaps in federal disaster assistance that are essential to ensuring that Maine and the other Northeast states fully recover from the January, 1998 Ice Storm. 
Maine is no stranger to the cruelness of winter. But the Ice Storm that swept across the State in early January was like nothing anyone had ever seen before. It left the state covered with three inches of ice, closing schools, businesses and roads and leaving more then 80 percent of the state in darkness. 
For the last two months I have worked with my colleague Senator Collins, my friends from Vermont, Senators Jeffords and Leahy and the two gentlemen from New York, Senators D'Amato and Moynihan, in an effort to ensure that the unmet needs of our states are addressed. 
Working in conjunction with our states, we identified areas where FEMA was unable to provide the assistance needed, and we have worked with the Administration and the Committee to fill those gaps. I am pleased that the bill before us today provides funding to ensure that Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York will have money available to help ensure a full recovery from the devastation of the Great Ice Storm of 1998. 
Our forests were left in shambles as the weight of the ice broke off entire limbs and felled mature trees, leaving the forest floor in a mass of confusion. This bill will provide $48 million to the US Forest Service in order to help the states and private land owners assess the damage and develop plans for clean up and for ensuring a healthy future for the forests. In addition to general clean up, some of the trees which were felled must be harvested as soon as possible in order to retain any value, others may sit on the forest floor for a while. Maine's forest products industry is vital to the economy, and this supplemental funding will help ensure as quick a recovery as possible from the havoc wrecked by the Ice Storm. 
In addition, funding is provided to help Maine's maple syrup producers. Not only did the storm do immense damage to the trees, but it also tore out the tubes which were waiting to catch the flow of sap. There is approximately $4 million, which requires a cost share, to assist this industry in recovery efforts that will be hampered for a number of several years by the severe damage done to the trees. 
The supplemental also provides assistance to Maine's dairy farmers. The ice knocked out power to more than 80 percent of the state and thousands of people were without power for up to two weeks. The lack of electricity made it impossible for many dairy farmers to milk their cows--and for those that could, the lack of electricity meant they had to dump their milk because it could not be stored at the proper temperature. 
Maine's dairy farmers are family farmers. It is as much a way of life as it is a business, and the storm put a big dent in their finances. This bill provides $4 million to help take care of livestock losses. I also supported an amendment offered by my good friends from New York, Senator D'Amato and from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, that added $10 million for milk production loss. Not only were farmers forced to dump milk, but their inability to milk impacts the production level of milk. It will take several months for these cows to return to their full production level. 
I wish to reiterate my appreciation for the support that the Appropriations Committee, lead by Chairman Stevens, has shown for the needs of the northeast states hit by the Ice Storm. His leadership has been instrumental in ensuring that Maine will be able to make a quick and full recovery from the devastation of the Ice Storm of 1998. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.  
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, 1998 will long be remembered in the State of Maine as the year of the Ice Storm. In early January the state was coated with more than three inches of ice--the result of a once in a lifetime storm that left more than 80 percent of the State without power. 
It was an extraordinary event--both for the way the people of Maine pulled together and for the damage it did to the state's utility infrastructure. The reaction of the people of Maine was proof positive that `Maine: the way life should be' is not just a slogan, it is a fact. I was overwhelmed by the resiliency and compassion I witnessed across the state last month, and Senator Collins and I shared our thoughts and our praise for the people of Maine on the Senate floor. 
We have worked, along with our colleagues from Vermont, Senators Jeffords and Leahy and New York, Senators D'Amato and Moynihan, to obtain additional federal assistance, through the Community Development Block Grants Program (CDBG) to help cover damage done in the state that FEMA did not cover. Specifically, the damage done to the state's utility infrastructure. 
I appreciate the assistance provided to us by the Chairman, the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, Chairman Bond of the VA/HUD Subcommittee, and the Ranking Member of that Subcommittee, Senator Mikulski in crafting this amendment. The amendment, which I am cosponsoring, will provide $260 million for the CDBG program. This money will allow states, like mine, that have been declared disaster areas, to obtain CDBG money to address the unmet disaster needs--or fill the gaps--that FEMA has identified. 
In Maine, the biggest cost of the storm was the damage done to the utility infrastructure. Vice President Gore, during a visit to Maine on January 15, summed up the situation succinctly when he said `We've never seen anything like this. This is like a neutron bomb aimed at the power system'. 
The combination of heavy rains and freezing temperatures left the State coated with more than three inches of ice. The weight of this ice downed wires, toppled transformers and snapped utility poles in two. At the peak of the storm 65 percent of the customers--more than 275,000 households served by Central Maine Power (CMP) Company were without electricity. Bangor Hydro Electric Company had 75 percent of its customers--more than 78,000 without power. 
In fact at the height of the storm more than 80 percent of the entire State of Maine was in the dark. 
It took CMP, which supplies power to 77 percent of the State, 23 days to restore power to all its customers. They did it with 1,048 crews working around the clock and running up 177,000 hours of overtime. They had to secure downed wires, replace more than 1 million feet of cable, 3,050 utility poles and 2,000 reformers. They have estimated the cost of this heroic effort to be $74 million. 
Bangor Hydro nearly tripled the number of crews it normally used--going from 40 to 117 and put in an estimated 54,402 hours on storm damage. Their crews worked more overtime in January then they did in all of 1997. And once they completed their restoration efforts, they loaned crews to CMP. They estimate they spent more than $7 million to bring all their customers back on line. 
My colleagues will tell similar stories, Mr. President. The rain and freezing temperatures proved to be a fatal combination for the utility infrastructure. As Maine Governor Angus King said `If you designed a storm to take out the electrical system, this was it'. 
I cannot offer enough praise to the men and women of Maine's utilities and their brethren who came in from all over the East Coast--including several crews from my good friend, Senator Mikulski's home state of Maryland. These crews faced freezing temperatures and hazardous situations as they worked to kill live wires and free remaining wires from the downed trees and poles. They worked round the clock until the light was back on in every house in the State. As we say in Maine, they are the `Finest Kind'. 
And the federal response was just as important and just as swift. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Small Business Administration, the Department of Defense--all answered Maine's call for immediate help. We truly appreciate it, Mr. President, and like many of my colleagues whose states have suffered from mother nature's rage, I have seen first hand how vital the federal response is in the early days of a disaster. 
Once we were assured of federal assistance and the agencies were in the State and working, the Maine Congressional Delegation asked the Governor what else was needed. He told us they needed federal assistance to cover the extraordinary costs associated with the destruction of our utility infrastructure. And he asked the President to include supplemental funding for this purpose, as did the Governors of Vermont and New York. 
The Stafford Act which provides FEMA's guidelines for assistance covers public power. It will reimburse 75 percent of the costs related with a disaster. But because Maine and much of the northeast have investor-owned utilities as opposed to government-owned utilities, we are ineligible to receive assistance from FEMA for this purpose, despite the fact that it is the greatest cost of the storm. When we learned this, we went looking for other sources of federal assistance, but we could find nothing that could address the magnitude of the costs of this storm. 
Without assistance, the utilities in the states of Maine, Vermont and New York will have to pass these costs onto the ratepayers, who already pay some of the highest rates in the country for electricity. Maine's residential rate is 48 percent higher than the country's average and New York pays the highest rates in the country. Vermont pays 28 percent more than the national average. 
Yet these ratepayers--who also happen to be taxpayers--have helped pay the bill for FEMA assistance for utilities in other states, with lower rates, when they were faced with disasters of their own. 
The CDBG funding provided in this amendment will allow Maine and the other northeast states to apply to HUD for funds to reimburse the utilities for the huge cost of repair and recovery. FEMA has identified utility costs as the major unmet need from the Ice Storm of 1998. 
Mr. President, I know that some of my colleagues are wondering the States have asked for assistance for private companies. But a utility is a unique animal. Whether it is a public or private utility is immaterial to the role it plays. It provides a public service and it has an obligation to provide that service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year--rain or shine, tornado or flood, ice storm or earthquake. 
The fact is that these utilities didn't shut down like many private businesses did during the ice storm--because they couldn't. They had to protect the public from the danger of live, downed wires and from freezing to death in their own homes. It was a matter of public safety--not a business decision. They had to right downed poles, replace crumpled transformers and get the power back on. 
They did not have the luxury of sitting down and saying `this is going to cost us a bundle, our stockholders won't like it, we should take a pass'. They couldn't. They provide a public service, and they had an obligation to the people they served to restore power as quickly as possible. 
In a letter to Vice President Gore, Governor King explained:  
It is important to emphasize that this cost . . . was purely a function of protecting the life and safety of our people. . . . the quick restoration of power . . . was not a matter of convenience, but was an unequivocal necessity. 
The amendment we have worked out with the Committee will provide $260 million in supplemental funding to HUD for the CDBG program. This money, which will go to the states, can be used for a number of activities, including reimbursement of costs to privately owned utilities. HUD regulation 24 CFR Section 570.201(l) states: 
CDBG funds may be used to acquire, construct, reconstruct, rehabilitate, or install the distribution lines and facilities of privately owned utilities. . . . 
And HUD Secretary Cuomo has assured Maine that if funds are appropriated, they can be used for this purpose. 
In its Ice Storm `Blueprint for Action' FEMA, which listed utility costs as the top unmet need, noted:

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would be happy to comment on this issue. The Leahy-Abraham amendment makes a clear distinction between the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain. Lake Champlain is not a Great Lake. There are only five Great Lakes--Michigan, Superior, Huron, Ontario, and Erie. The Leahy-Abraham amendment clearly reflects this traditional understanding of the Great Lakes. With passage of the Leahy-Abraham amendment, there should be no doubt that the term `Great Lakes' in the Sea Grant Act means only Michigan, Superior, Huron, Ontario, and Erie.

Ms. SNOWE. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which will authorize breast cancer research funding at a record level. 
Over the past seven years, Congress has demonstrated an increased commitment to the fight against breast cancer. Back in 1991, less than $100 million dollars was spent on breast cancer research. Since then, Congress has steadily increased this allocation. These increases have stimulated new and exciting research that has begun to unravel the mysteries of this devastating disease and is moving us closer to a cure. Today, we must send a message through our authorization level to scientists and research policy makers that we are committed to continued funding for this important research. 
This increase in funding is necessary because breast cancer has reached crisis levels in America. In 1998, it is estimated that 178,700 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in this country, and 43,500 women will die from this disease. Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American women. Today, over 2.6 million American women are living with this disease. In my home state of Maine, it is the most commonly-diagnosed cancer among women, representing more than 30 percent of all new cancers in Maine women. 
In addition to these enormous human costs, breast cancer also exacts a heavy financial toll--over $6 billion of our health care dollars are spent on breast cancer annually. 
Today, however, there is cause for hope. Recent scientific progress made in the fight to conquer breast cancer is encouraging. Researchers have isolated the genes responsible for inherited breast cancer, and are beginning to understand the mechanism of the cancer cell itself. It is imperative that we capitalize upon these advances by continuing to support the scientists investigating this disease and their innovative research. 
For this reason, my bill increases the FY99 funding authorization level for breast cancer research to $650 million. This level represents the funding level scientists believe is necessary to make progress against this disease. It also reflects the 11 percent increase that the Administration requested for NIH funding. This increased funding will contribute substantially toward solving the mysteries surrounding breast cancer. Our continued investment will save countless lives and health care dollars, and prevent undue suffering in millions of American women and families. 
On behalf of the 2.6 million women living with breast cancer, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Commerce Committee Safety amendment, and wish to commend the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, for his efforts to bring this amendment to the floor. In particular, I commend him and the Committee for its incentive approach to the serious problem of drunk driving. The Committee amendment provides four grants that provide additional funding to states that take the zero tolerance approach to drunk driving. States that have already enacted tough laws, like my own State of Maine, are eligible for additional funding, while these grant programs will serve as an incentive for other states to pass the tough laws necessary to keep drunk drivers off the roads. 
I would also like to briefing explain my provision in this amendment that requires Maine and the Department of Transportation to create a performance based system to evaluate a state trucking law to determine if it is a safety concern. 
Maine has lost half of its Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Programs (MCSAP) for the last two years--$145,000 per year--because of a state law providing an exemption from motor carrier safety regulations for trucks traveling within 100 air mile radius of their home base. This loss of funding means that the State cannot hire more state troopers for the Motor Vehicle Enforcement Unit and in fact may have to lay off another trooper if this issue is not resolved soon. 
The Maine law in question is used primarily by construction companies, farmers, loggers, sand and gravel, landscaping and local delivery vehicles. In another words, small businesses who do intrastate delivery work or must travel some distance to a work site. Maine did a study for Federal Highway to show that the exemption was not a safety problem, but Federal Highway would not give the state a waiver. The State's study, done by the Maine State Police found no safety problems. And in 1995, the Governor's Task Force on Motor Vehicle Safety, which reviewed Maine's truck laws, recommended that this exemption be kept because it did not have an impact on safety. 
My language seeks to end this impasse in order to improve safety by first giving the state its full funding so it can hire more troopers and second to evaluate whether or not the exemption is a safety problem. The language requires the State and the Department to work together to establish a review system for the State to carry out to determine, based on empirical evidence, whether or not this exemption has a negative impact on safety. 
The burden will be on Maine to show whether or not there are safety implications to this particular state law. I am confident that this cooperative effort will reassure the Department while at the same time allowing Maine to improve safety on our roadways. 
Thank you.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the community of Eastport, Maine, which this week celebrated the 200th anniversary of its incorporation. 
When the sun rises over the cities of America, it rises first over the City of Eastport. The city, located on Moose Island, epitomizes the rugged beauty of Downeast Maine as well as the hearty and individualistic nature of the region's people. This is a part of Maine and America where hard work is more than a virtue, it's a way of life--and neighbors look out for each other just as they have done for the past two centuries. 
As the deepest natural harbor on the east coast, the lifeblood of Eastport has always been the sea. In its earliest days, the city was a center for trade and ship building. Later, in the 1800's, Eastport became the birthplace of the American sardine industry, which was a major source of economic prosperity for the region for many decades, and the city's sea captains sailed from Eastport to ports from Boston to the West Indies. 
Today, the city is very much a working port, where traditional fishermen and a vibrant and growing shipping industry exist side-by-side. In 1981, the first year of operation for the Eastport Port Authority, the Port logged six vessels and 15,000 tons of cargo at its 420-foot pier. Last year, according to the Authority's director, Eastport shipped out value-added products to the tune of about $60 million, with markets ranging from Northern Europe to Taiwan to Italy and the Middle East. 
Eastport also hosts an annual, week-long celebration of our nation's independence every year during 4th of July week that is renowned across the State of Maine. Steeped in tradition, the festival has included an almost yearly visit from U.S. Navy vessels dating back to the days when Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who summered across Passamaquoddy Bay on Campobello Island, was Secretary of the Navy. In fact, during the 4th of July celebration Eastport's population of about 2,000 swells six or seven times as visitors and former residents as well as the state's elected officials flock to the island city. Eastport also pays homage to its fishing tradition with its Salmon Festival each September, celebrating an aquaculture industry which has become an important part of the local economy. 
As Eastport celebrates its 200th Birthday, her people can be proud of the community which supports a host of cultural and recreational opportunities. And they can be proud of a rich and unique history, which includes the historic site of the War of 1812 era Fort Sullivan--a part of which was relocated and appropriately lives on as a home to Eastport's Border Historical Society. 
I first visited Eastport in 1977, and have returned many times over the years, getting to know many of its residents--in fact, one Eastport native is today my Chief of Staff. I have always been struck not only by the beauty of the area but also the hospitality of Eastport's people. 
Most recently, I was also struck by their strength and compassion in the face of adversity. Last month, in the wake of devastating and unprecedented ice storms which left much of Maine without electricity, I visited the area to see first-hand how local residents were coping. I spent time at the emergency shelter set up at the Eastport Youth Center. While there, I marveled how people in the community, like elsewhere in Maine, pulled together to help each other through a most difficult and trying time. 
I am proud to represent the City of Eastport in the United States Senate, particularly at this special time in the life of this great community. I congratulate Eastport on this wonderful milestone, and wish her people all the best as the city looks ahead toward continued success in the next hundred years.

Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President. I think that the debate on the Snowe-Jeffords amendment has been very important in terms of underscoring the issues that need to be addressed in reforming our campaign finance system. I would like to review for the membership of this body exactly what the Snowe-Jeffords amendment would do, because we have heard so much about the impact of it and the misconceptions about the impact of the provisions included in this amendment. 
The fact is, this amendment will affect several categories with respect to advertising by groups across this country during the course of an election designed to influence the outcome of a Federal election. We are not saying they cannot advertise. We are not saying that they cannot engage in political activity. But what we are asking these groups to do is to disclose their major donors if they advertise on either medium, radio or television, 60 days before a general election, 30 days before a primary, in which they identify or mention a candidate for Federal office. 
They then would be required to disclose their major donors who contribute more than $500. That is more than twice the threshold for disclosure for Federal candidates. 
So, unlike the suggestion of those who are opposed to the campaign finance proposal and the Snowe-Jeffords amendment that this is too invasive, too broad, it is not. In fact, it would meet the Buckley standards handed down in that Supreme Court decision of not being invasive. In that Court decision, they were considering the impact of requiring donors of more than $10 to be disclosed. Obviously, that is broad and invasive. But this would pass constitutional muster. 
We are talking about groups that spend money on television or radio broadcasts in which they identify a Federal candidate 60 days before a general election, because, obviously, when those ads are aired at that point in time, they are intending to influence the outcome of an election. 
The medium is radio and television. The timing is 60 days before a general election, 30 days before a primary. The ad must mention a candidate's name or identify the candidate clearly. 
Targeting: The ad must be targeted at voters in the candidate's State. 
And the threshold: The sponsor of the ad must spend more than $10,000 on such ads in the calendar year. 
It is very narrow, it is very clearly targeted, very specific. And the Supreme Court has said that you can make a distinction of electioneering communications from other forms of speech. That is exactly what the Snowe-Jeffords amendment does. We are replacing the issue advocacy provisions of the McCain-Feingold legislation, section 201, that could raise constitutional questions. The proposals that Senator Jeffords and I are offering today are ones that have been designed by legal and constitutional experts based on court decisions. 
What the Snowe-Jeffords amendment would not do, because, again, we have heard so much about what the impact would be and, in many cases, have been very erroneous in some of the circulations in Congress by various groups, it would not prohibit groups from communicating. If they want to advertise, they have every right to do that. They can communicate with their grassroots membership. 
It does not prohibit them from accepting funds, corporate or labor funds. It would not require groups to create a PAC. They can continue what they are doing. But they are required to disclose if they are going to identify a candidate 60 days before an election in a television advertisement or radio broadcast. 
It would not affect the ability of any organization to urge grassroots contacts with lawmakers in upcoming votes. They can say, `Call your Senator, call your Member of Congress, using the 1-800 number,' which is a popular means today. That is certainly allowed. There is nothing to discourage that. If they identify a candidate in a TV or radio broadcast 60 days before an election, then they have to disclose their donors of more than $500, and that is all we are requiring. So it is not invasive; it would not require them to give an advance of the specifics of their advertisement and the text. 
What we are requiring in all of this is disclosure so that everybody understands who is financing these advertisements when they are designed to influence the outcome of an election. 
It guards against sneak attacks. Doesn't everybody have the right to know? Absolutely. And that is why the Supreme Court made that distinction in Buckley and in other cases, to draw that bright line, which is what the Snowe-Jeffords amendment does. 
The Court has never said that there is one route towards what can be distinguished in terms of electioneering communications. The fact of the matter is, it said you can make that distinction, that the U.S. Congress has the prerogative to make that distinction in a very narrow, very targeted way. 
This amendment would pass constitutional muster. I think that is what causes some anxiety for some people, because they are opposed to this amendment because it will require disclosure of major donors. 
Since when has disclosure been antithetical to good government, to campaign financing? Because that is the thrust of this amendment. It is disclosure. I think we all can concur that secrecy does not invite the kind of campaign that we want to see in America. We are entitled to know who finances these campaigns when it comes to major donors, when they are running ads that influence the outcome of these campaigns. 
The fact is, these groups have spent at least, based on what we know because it is a guesstimate because they did not have to disclose, $150 million--$150 million. The best we can guess, because, again, it does not require disclosure, is a third of all the money that was spent was spent on campaign advertising in the last election cycle, and we do not know where one dime comes from. We don't have the identity of donors, and yet they play a key role in influencing Federal elections. 
We had $150 million spent on issue ads in the 1996 election, and $400 million was spent for all the candidates: for the President, the Senate and the House. And yet, of this $150 million--this is probably a conservative estimate; this is based on the Annenberg Public Policy Center study; probably the most definitive study on issue advertising and issue advocacy. In fact, what they did was they analyzed advertising that was done by 109 organizations--109 TV and radio advertisements from 29 organizations. So we would expect that that estimate is pretty conservative. So what we are saying here is that there should be a means for disclosure. 
The courts have never said that disclosure is not in the public interest. The fact is that the Supreme Court has ruled time and again, and specifically in Buckley, that there is strong governmental interest that justifies disclosure, and that is why we have designed this amendment in the manner that we have. 
We also restrict campaign spending by unions and corporations with their nonvoluntary contributions in television and radio advertising in which they mention a candidate 60 days before a general election and 30 days before a primary because, again, there has been a century-long decision by the Government as well as the Congress in which that distinction can be made. 
The courts have made that distinction that Congress has the right to restrict spending by those entities because of those benefits that have been conferred on unions and corporations by the Congress, so that we are entitled to draw that distinction. And we do in this amendment. 
The courts have ruled that the Congress has the right to enact a statute that defines electioneering as long as it isn't vague or overbroad, that we can develop a more nuanced approach, because I know the Senator from Kentucky has cited cases in which he said that the Court would not support this type of an amendment. 
To the contrary, the fact of the matter is, this amendment is not vague and it is not overbroad. Not only will it pass muster, I think the Court would have the advantage of seeing what has happened over the past 22 years since it ruled in Buckley that has made a mockery of the campaign laws in ways in which the system works today. If they had had the advantage of that back when they made the decision in Buckley, I think there is no question that they would have indicated the approach that we have here today. 
There is something wrong in a system where we have $150 million influencing Federal campaigns and we do not require disclosure, and that is what the Snowe-Jeffords amendment is all about. 
Mr. President, I hope that Members of the Senate will see fit to support this amendment because I think it is in the interest of our campaign system, it is in the interest of good government. We have heard so much about these issues ads and the content of these so-called `issue ads' in the last election. Every group has the right to state their position. They have the right to communicate with their lawmakers. They have the right to even participate in the political process in advertisements and voting for or against. But I think they also should be required to identify their major donors when they are identifying a candidate 60 days before an election. 
Now, there are different kinds of issue ads. The one that I am mentioning here in the content of so-called `issue ads' isn't pure issue advocacy because there is a difference between issue advocacy and candidate advocacy. 
In this case, what we are seeing in what is so-called `issue ads,' 87 percent of what is called `issue ads' actually referred to a candidate or an official--87 percent. 
So rather than just talking about an issue and informing 
the public or running an ad that says, `Call your Senator or call your Congressman,' it was one in which it was designed to influence the outcome of an election, because 87 percent of those ads referred to an official or a candidate. 
In fact, according to the Annenberg study, 41 percent of those ads were `pure attack'--41 percent--and yet not one dime is required when it comes to disclosure. So $150 million of this money was spent on so-called `issue ads,' and some of them were pure issue ads, but many of those ads, in fact 87 percent, referred to an official or to a candidate that, again, had the impact, or certainly had the intent, of affecting the outcome of an election, or otherwise they would not have mentioned the candidate's name.

So that is where you can invite the possibility of concerns when it comes to printed material and to direct mail and to newspapers. We also know that most of the money in campaigns is particularly in television, rather than radio, because it has the greatest impact. It can have the greatest effect. So as a result, we do narrowly target those two mediums.

My concern--and I think shared by others, such as Senator Jeffords, who is a lead sponsor of this amendment as well--we are concerned about the political advertising that is in these campaigns, hundreds of millions of dollars, where there is no disclosure, that influences the campaigns. So we are creating a separate category of advertising called `electioneering communication,' in response to the question.

<TEXT>
Ms. SNOWE. The courts have allowed and made those distinctions in the past where we can draw a line in terms of methods of communicating and have allowed different rules for public airwaves. We are focusing on the most egregious abuses that have been identified in these campaigns in the past. 
If anything, I think the 1996 cycle highlighted the extent of the problem by the amounts of money that were placed in issue advertising that ordinarily would be, I think, a significant component in the campaign. But what has developed in the final analysis, as we all know, is sort of circumventing some of the restrictions that are currently in campaigns by what is masked as issue ads but really are candidate advocacy ads. That is what we are highlighting in this amendment by requiring disclosures by those groups that support these advertisements on behalf of candidates or in opposition to candidates shortly before the election. 
So we create a very narrow timeframe so that we do not engage in any possibilities of interfering with first amendment rights. We limit the medium to television and radio, again, so we do not invite any infringements on freedom of speech. 
Candidates-specific. They have to identify the candidate. Again, if that advertisement is targeted to a candidate's State, or in terms of House of Representatives elections, towards that candidate's district, again it is a threshold so that we don't affect small groups. If the sponsor of the ad spends less than $10,000 in a calendar year, they would not be required to disclose. 
Again, the Senator from Kentucky has mentioned Court cases like the NAACP v. Alabama in 1958, saying that the courts say you should not be required to supply your donor list because such disclosure could cause the fear of reprisal by its membership. Certainly there are exceptions to every rule, but you can have those exceptions without having the Court rule on its constitutionality. So, yes, there are exceptions, and the Court would require groups to obviously demonstrate that they had reasonable feeling that disclosing their donor base would be a reprisal. But there are exceptions, and there can be exceptions, but the law can be allowed to stand without suggesting that it will be ruled unconstitutional because there is an exception to that rule. 
We have drawn this amendment to be as narrow as possible in order to be as protective of the first amendment rights, constitutionally. If even possible we could have gone further but we chose to be narrow so that we don't create any problems with this legislation, because one of the concerns originally with the McCain-Feingold legislation is we would have the ban on soft money, but the issue advocacy provisions very possibly would have been struck down. So we designed this amendment in order to address those concerns. 
Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to Senator Jeffords, the other sponsor of this amendment.

Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Madam President. 
Madam President, in response to what the Senator from Washington mentioned in terms of our amendment and the constitutional questions, it is interesting to note that his arguments suggest that in fact he prefers a broader amendment, which I think is interesting. 
So I would certainly ask the Senator from Washington if he could tell us where in the Constitution it is impermissible to draw these distinctions and to draw these lines? The Constitution doesn't require us to address every problem. It certainly allows us to address some of the problems. And we know where some of the problems develop in campaigns today. The problems develop in the amount of money that is placed in television and radio advertising. That is what we are attempting to address. 
So I think it is interesting that the Senator from Washington is talking about printed materials, newspapers, and direct mail. In fact, we are saying that isn't the source of the problem in 
these campaigns. The source of the problem is where you have $150 million being spent in television advertising by groups that do not have to disclose their donors That is all we are requiring--disclosure. 
That is the thrust of our amendment. We are entitled to draw those distinctions. It would not be unconstitutional. We don't need to find something in the Constitution to justify every policy decision that we make.

Ms. SNOWE. I thank Senator Jeffords for those comments. He is entirely correct on that issue. Obviously, there were legitimate fears of bodily harm and economic retribution in the 1950s in Alabama. That is what that case was all about. The court recognized that concern, and exceptions can be made, and have been made. 
In fact, in response to the issue that was raised by the Senator from Washington and the Senator from Kentucky, several legal experts--Burt Neuborne, from New York University School of Law; Mr. Ornstein, of the American Enterprise Institute; Dan Ortiz, University of Virginia School of Law; and Josh Rosenkranz, from the New York University School of Law and the Brennan Center--wrote a response to these concerns. 
These are legal and constitutional scholars in response to some of the groups suggesting that somehow they would fear the same reprisal. They said: 
These groups, like any other group, may be entitled to an exemption from electioneering disclosure laws if they can demonstrate a reasonable probability that compelling disclosure will subject its members to threats, harassment, or reprisal; but the need for these kinds of limited exceptions certainly do not make general disclosure rules contained in the Snowe-Jeffords amendment unconstitutional. 
So, yes, exceptions can be made without making a broad ruling with respect to the constitutionality of any legislation that we might pass here. 
To further buttress this point in terms of anonymity of donors, the courts have indicated in the past that there is no generalized right to anonymity. The Senator from Vermont mentioned the Buckley case upheld that. 
Another case that has been identified here is McIntyre v. Ohio Elections. Justice Scalia said: 
The question relevant to our decision is whether a right to anonymity is such a prominent value in our constitutional system that even protection of the electoral process cannot be purchased at its expense. 
The answer is clearly no. 
He went on to say: 
Must a parade permit, for example, be issued to a group that refuses to provide its identity, or that agrees to do so only under assurance that the identity will not be made public? Must a government periodical that has a `letters to the editor' column disavow the policy that most newspapers have against the publication of anonymous letters? . . . Must a municipal `public access' cable channel permit anonymous (and masked) performers? The silliness that follows upon a generalized right to anonymous speech has no end. 
Scalia went on to say that not only is it not a right, disclosure can be helpful in curbing `mudslinging' and `character assassination' and improving our elections. 
So the point of it all is that disclosure is in our public interest. It is the public's right to know. 
That is essentially the thrust of the Snowe-Jeffords amendment--to require disclosure of major donors over $500. It is in all of our interest to have such a requirement. 
Now I yield to the Senator from Michigan 20 minutes.

Ms. SNOWE. My friend from Michigan is correct. Stopping issue ad abuse is critical to meaningful campaign finance reform. But distinguishing candidate ads from issue ads based on ad content is the Supreme Court's approach in Buckley versus Valeo; it is an approach that the courts are now examining; and I am willing to defer to the courts at this point.

Ms. SNOWE. That is correct--our amendment is not intended to convey any criticism of the FEC. The Buckley magic words test is a very narrow one, and has proven completely ineffective in stopping phony issue ads that attack candidates. My amendment offers a new approach to this problem, by creating a new category of `electronic ads' that name candidates in broadcasts close in time to an election. But my amendment does not foreclose or criticize other approaches to the problem. The FEC and the courts must continue to wrestle with clarifying when ads advocate the election or defeat of a candidate, and I fully support that effort. In fact, it is because the courts are still wrestling with the constitutional issues that makes me comfortable with waiting awhile longer before we legislate.

Ms. SNOWE. That is correct. The Snowe-Jeffords amendment is fully consistent with the view that the Furgatch decision and the FEC regulation may be a constitutional approach for detecting ads that pretend to discuss issues, but are really attacks on candidates. If that's where the Supreme Court ends up, I will be glad to see it, but it will be a separate approach from the Snowe-Jeffords amendment's treatment of broadcast ads that name candidates just before an election.

Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, before we vote on the motion to table the Snowe-Jeffords amendment I want to thank Senator Jeffords for his tremendous work and leadership on this issue, as well as the cosponsors of the amendment--Senators Levin, Lieberman, McCain, Feingold, Chafee, Collins, and Thompson--for their invaluable comments and support. 
We have had a good debate on this amendment this afternoon, but we have also heard a great many misconceptions. So before we vote, I want to once again speak to the importance of this amendment, what it really does and doesn't do, and why the American people are counting on us to pass it. 
Madam President, the Supreme Court has made clear that, for constitutional purposes, electioneering is different from other speech. And the Supreme Court has also never held that there is only a single, constitutionally permissible route a legislature may take when it defines `electioneering' to be regulated or reported. To the contrary, Congress has the power to enact a statute that defines electioneering in a more nuanced manner, as long as its definition adequately addresses the vagueness and overbreadth concerns expressed by the court. 
This compromise amendment carves out, in a clear and narrow way, a new category of electioneering that meets the Court's criteria. It draws a bright line between issue advocacy--which we don't want to infringe--and electioneering by laying out specific criteria that must be met in order to trigger the requirements of our amendment. 
Medium: The ad must be broadcast on radio or television. 
Timing: The ad must be aired shortly before an election--within 60 days before a general election or 30 days before a primary. 
Candidate Specific: The ad must mention a candidate's name or identify the candidate clearly. 
Targeting: The ad must be targeted at voters in the candidate's state. 
Threshold: The sponsor of the ad must spend more than $10,000 on such electioneering ads in the calendar year. 
If and only if a broadcast communication meets all of these criteria do the following rules apply: 
First, the electioneering ad cannot be paid for directly or indirectly by funds from a business corporation or labor union. Advocacy groups could not use such funds to run electioneering ads. They could however, engage in unlimited electioneering ads using individual, voluntary funds. This provision builds on nearly a century of law and Supreme Court cases that restrict the use of union and corporate treasury money in politics. It is balanced in that it treats corporations and unions equally, and it gets at part of the problem of these entities using member dues and shareholder monies without their consent. 
Second, the sponsor of an electioneering ad must disclose the amount spent and the identity of contributors who donated more than $500 toward the ad. This is entirely in keeping with the Supreme Court's Buckley decision, which stated that `the governmental interests that justify disclosure of election-related spending are considerably broader and more powerful than those justifying prohibitions or restrictions on election-related spending.' Indeed, the Court put forward a threshold of $200 in terms of contributions candidates need to disclose--our amendment's threshold is more than double that. 
We don't prohibit advocacy groups from disseminating electioneering communications. We don't prohibit such groups from accepting union or corporation money. We don't require such groups to create PACs or separate entities. We don't address voter guides, pamphlets, or any other print media. 
We don't affect groups' ability to urge grassroots contacts with lawmakers. We don't have invasive disclosure rules that require the disclosure of entire membership lists. We don't require the disclosure of the text of any ads. We don't even say that corporation or union leaders can't engage in political speech--just that they do it through a voluntarily, individually funded PAC. 
That's it, Madam President--that's our amendment. A simple, straightforward, reasonable, constitutional, brightly drawn line between issue advocacy and electioneering that only applies 30 days before a primary and 60 days before an election, if a candidate is identified, and only if more than $10,000 is spent. 
But you don't have to just take my word for it. The approach was developed by noted experts and reformers including Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, Dan Ortiz at the University of Virginia School of Law, Josh Rosenkranz at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU and others. 
And their approach has also been endorsed by Professor Thomas Baker, Texas Tech University School of Law; Professor Paul Kurtz, University of Georgia Law School; Professor William Cohen, Stanford Law School; Professor Harold Maier, Vanderbilt Law School; Professor Abner Mikva, University of Chicago; Professor Robert Aromson, University of Washington School of Law; Professor Ralph Stein, Pace University School of Law; Professor Robert Benson, Loyola Law School; Professor Elwood Hain, Whittier Law School; Professor Ann Freedman, Rutgers Law School, and Professor William Rich, Washburn University School of Law. 
Why? Why are all of these prominent scholars in agreement with this approach? Because it represents a common sense, middle ground approach around which the Senate can coalesce. That's the heart of compromise--some feel the amendment doesn't go far enough, some wouldn't go as far. But this amendment would take substantial steps toward providing accountability in an exploding and currently unaccountable area of campaigning, and it would take steps toward abating some of the valid concerns raised about the use of union dues and shareholder monies for political purposes. 
Madam President, we've come to the bottom line here. Either we vote to keep the system as it is--either we vote to continue to allow hundreds of millions of dollars to be spent to influence federal elections without one dime having to be disclosed--or we take a tangible, incremental step toward addressing these abuses. 
A vote against this amendment is a vote against disclosure--and a vote for secrecy. A vote against this amendment is a vote against the public's right to know who is pouring millions into influencing our elections, and a vote for keeping America in the dark. A vote against this amendment is a vote against putting electioneering ads back into the hands of individuals and a vote for the involuntary use of union dues and shareholder monies for blatant political ads. 
Madam President, groups spent $150 million or more--we don't know because there is no accountability for these ads--to influence the 1996 elections. That's about one-third of what all federal candidates spent on advertising. This is a massive force invading our system of elections in this country, flying under the radar screen of disclosure or any other accountability. And it's only going to get worse. 
All we are saying is, let's have some disclosure for these ads, let's give the public information they need in order to make informed decisions, and let's fund these ads with voluntary, individual contributions. That's not an infringement on free speech. That is bringing the facts about elections in America out of the shadows and into the light of debate and discourse. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this sensible, incremental approach that will advance the ball for campaign reform. Because frankly, if you can't support this--if you can't support disclosure--I don't know what kind of reform you can support. And the American people will be watching. The American people will be watching, and they will remember who is truly interested in working to restore America's faith in their elections--and they will remember, too, who are the doorkeepers of the status quo. 
I again thank Senators Jeffords, McCain, Feingold, as well as all of my distinguished colleagues who have joined me in this effort. We are in the majority in this body and I hope after the tabling vote we will be able to have a true up-or-down vote on our amendment. 
Madam President, and Members of the Senate, in the final analysis, what the Snowe-Jeffords amendment is all about is disclosure. We have heard a lot of issues here today. We have heard a lot about Supreme Court cases and constitutionality and infringement on the first amendment rights of freedom of speech. 
There is nothing in the Snowe-Jeffords amendment that will restrict freedom of speech. Anybody, anytime, can run any ad. The question is whether or not the public will have the right to know who is sponsoring and financing those ads. Even then the threshold is high for disclosure--$500 or more in donation. 
I suspect that when Congress was debating the sunshine laws and the right-to-know laws and opening up all of the meetings in the U.S. Congress that we had pretty much the very same debate. 
A vote against the Snowe-Jeffords amendment is a vote for secrecy. A vote against the Snowe-Jeffords amendment is a vote for the lack of accountability. We don't want to be the doorkeepers of the status quo for a system that has been shrouded in secrecy by the very fact that we have $150 million spent in elections. In this last election, not one dime has been disclosed. Not one dime. We have heard about editorials and newspaper and the print media being excluded. Does anybody think for one moment that that is where the money is put? Absolutely not. 
We have $550 million total that goes into candidate advertising. And a third of that is not disclosed. That is the issue. 
It is whether or not you are for secrecy, or the public's right to know who is supporting those ads. That is what it is all about. 
We have heard about issue advocacy. I think the body should look at what we are talking about. We are talking about issue advocacy versus stealth advocacy. 
I ask unanimous consent for additional minute.

Ms. SNOWE. An issue ad that talks about the issues doesn't identify a candidate. 
This chart demonstrates the stealth advocacy that we are talking about that is not disclosed--that talks about individual candidates 60 days before election. And this one would run 60 days before the election naming the candidate. It says, he is just another Washington politician. He has taken over $250,000 from corporate special interest groups. He listens to them but he is not listening to us anymore. 
No one knows who sponsored that ad. That is what this is all about--whether or not the public will have the right to know who is financing these ads.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Jeffords, along with a bipartisan group of colleagues--Senator McCain, Senator Feingold, Senator Levin, Senator Lieberman, Senator Chafee, Senator Collins, Senator Thompson, which I believe represents a commonsense middle-ground approach to reforming our campaign financing system in America. 
As I think our colleagues know, I have long been a proponent of fair, meaningful changes in the way campaigns are financed in this country. That is why, when this issue came to the floor last year, I worked with Senators McCain, Jeffords, Feingold, Senator Daschle, and others, to try to forge a compromise that would address the concerns of both sides and move the debate forward. I said then on the Senate floor, and say again today, that we should be putting our heads together, not building walls between us with intractable rhetoric and all-or-nothing propositions. 
While that effort was not successful, I am pleased that we are again having the opportunity to address campaign reform, and I thank the distinguished majority leader for making this possible. I also want to thank the bill's sponsors--Senators McCain and Feingold--for their continued leadership and determination on this issue, and their support of the efforts that are being done here today with Senator Jeffords and myself. 
I want to acknowledge the hard work of my colleagues who are committing themselves to this compromise amendment and have committed themselves to moving campaign finance reform forward: Senators Levin, Chafee, Lieberman, Thompson, Collins, Breaux, and Specter have worked very hard with us on crafting this amendment. They have made clear their support for meaningful reform this year. 
Last year, this body became stuck in the mire of all-or-nothing propositions and intransigence. We missed an opportunity to coalesce around a middle ground--any middle ground--and the result was that the status quo remained alive and well. Despite the efforts of some of us who tried to work to forge a compromise that would have moved the debate forward, campaign finance reform died a quiet and ignoble death here in the U.S. Senate. 
The reasons are many but the central issue then, as now, centered on the objection of Republicans to a package that does not address the issue of protecting union members from having their dues used without their permission for political purposes with which they may disagree, and the objection of Democrats to singling out unions while not providing similar protections for corporation shareholders. 
Let me say that I am among those Republicans who have had a concern about the use of union dues for political purposes and, in fact, the campaign finance reform bill that I introduced last year included language similar to the Paycheck Protection Act. I happen to think it is not a bad idea, and in a perfect world where I could get my way on this and still pass meaningful reform, I would support it. 
But the fact is, I believe we can still have fair and meaningful reform at the same time we take a step back from this incredibly divisive issue. In fact, it is probably the only way we 
can have such reform. The bottom line is, we will never pass campaign finance legislation--at least in the foreseeable future--if we take an all-or-nothing approach on this facet of reform. And I believe that we can and must make significant changes that may not be perfect, that may not make everyone happy, but which will be a great improvement over the current morass we find ourselves in. 
If we do nothing, we will see a repeat--or likely an even worse scenario--of what we saw in 1996, which confirmed all the reasons why it is imperative to be strong proponents of campaign finance reform. We saw over $223.4 million in soft money raised by the two national parties--three times more than in the last Presidential election. We saw more than $150 million--we do not know the precise amount because it is not disclosed--spent on attack ads paid with unlimited funds by third-party groups that made candidates largely incidental to their own campaigns. 
We saw an electorate that was, to put it bluntly, disgusted by the spectacle. And the 1996 elections were barely over when allegations were made of illegal and improper activities, centered around the issues of so-called `soft money' and foreign influence peddling through campaign contributions, all egregious abuses highlighted by the Senate Governmental Affairs hearings. 
All of this has only served to further undermine public confidence and underscore the importance of enacting meaningful and achievable campaign finance reform this year. 
I believe that S. 25 is a good start, and I commend Senators McCain and Feingold for their tenacity in getting this bill to the Senate floor once again. One of the most important aspects of this scaled-back version of the original bill is its ban on soft money. We all know that soft money is becoming a major issue, and for good reason. It is money that circumvents the intent of the law--unaccounted for money which influences Federal campaigns above and beyond the intended limits.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished colleague from Montana, Senator Max Baucus, to introduce the `Economic Development Partnership Act of 1998'--a bill to reauthorize the Economic Development Administration in the Department of Commerce. I would first like to thank the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Senator Baucus, for his ongoing commitment to this vital agency, and would also like to thank the bipartisan group of Senators who have joined us in sponsoring this legislation. 
Mr. President, I have long been a supporter of the EDA because--although it is a small agency--its programs contribute significantly to economic growth and job expansion. With only a modest annual appropriation and a national staff of 258 dedicated public servants, the EDA successfully assists communities across the nation who have experienced economic distress. Economic distress that is not only generated by economic downturns, but also by natural disasters--such as storms and earthquakes--and un-natural disasters, such as military base closings. 
I am also pleased that, at a time when Congress is exercising much needed fiscal discipline and performance-based budgeting is being demanded from all agencies, the EDA has maintained its commitment to providing a good return on the public dollar. Specifically, recent studies of EDA's programs were performed by a consortia of organizations including Rutgers University, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Columbia University, Princeton University, the National Association of Regional Councils, and the University of Cincinnati. The results of these studies were impressive, and clearly showed the value and results of EDA investments in public works and defense conversion activities. Specifically, for every every $1 million that EDA invests in public works projects, 327 jobs are created or retained at a cost of $3,058 per job; 15 construction jobs are created; $10 million in private sector dollars are leveraged; and $10.13 million is added to the local tax base. Based on these statistics, I believe it's safe to say that EDA delivers a substantial `bang for the buck'! 
Even as these statistics speak to the value of EDA programs nationally, I am pleased that the people of Maine don't need to hear what is happening in other states to be convinced of the value of EDA--they already know what this agency has meant to their towns and communities. Over the past 32 years, the EDA has invested more than $198 million in 606 projects across the state. Through public works, technical assistance, planning, community investments, and revolving loan fund programs, the EDA has established local partnerships in Maine that have provided critical infrastructure development and other economic incentives that have stimulated local growth, created jobs, and generated revenue. 
Not only has the EDA invested in many economic development projects in Maine, but I can also personally attest to the value and importance of these projects because I have seen the results that they deliver. For example, as a result of EDA assistance in 1996, dormitories at the Maine School of Science and Mathematics--a magnet school built at former Loring Air Force Base--were built to house the school's students. And in 1995, EDA assistance in Freeport, Maine prevented a major health maintenance organization from relocating to another state. That project alone not only saved 99 jobs, but also created an additional 127 in the community. 
Mr. President, I cite these success stories not only to credit the agency for a job well done in my state, but to demonstrate to my colleagues the types of assistance that have likely been provided to their states as well. If my colleagues would review the cases of economic distress that have occurred in their own states, I believe they will find their own success stories that speak to the value of EDA to their constituents. 
Therefore, I would urge that my colleagues support the bill that Senator Baucus and I are introducing today because it would reauthorize the beneficial and critically-needed programs that have led to these success stories for an additional five years. Perhaps most importantly, it will keep the agency's successful programs intact, while incorporating ideas and concepts for improvement that have received increased attention and support in the Congress. For instance, many of my colleagues would agree that to be truly successful, government programs should proceed in partnership with local governments--and this legislation will do just that by preserving the integrity of the agency's traditional programs, while expanding and modifying them to encompass the partnership concept. 
The bill also contains new language that reflects some of the activities that the agency has become more involved in over the past few years, such as defense conversion and disaster assistance. From Maine's perspective, these programs could not be buttressed soon enough following the closing of Loring Air Force base in 1994, and the ice storms that ravaged the state just weeks ago. 
In addition, there are other provisions in this legislation that will bring meaningful, positive changes to EDA's programs by increasing program flexibility and heightening accountability. Ultimately, it is these types of changes that will not only update an Act that has been in need of reauthorization, but will also prepare this agency for the economic needs and demands of our nation as we approach a new century. 
Mr. President, the Economic Development Administration is a key federal agency that promotes economic growth and development, and the legislation we are offering today will ensure that these improved programs will be available for the next five years. I urge my colleagues to support this critically needed legislation.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, one hundred years ago this Sunday, February 15, a tragic event took place in Havana harbor which claimed the lives of 260 officers and crew and hurtled our nation into war. I rise today to remember the U.S.S. Maine on the 100th anniversary of her destruction, and to honor the memories of those brave men who died in service aboard that mighty ship. 
True to her namesake's motto, `Dirigo', or `I Lead', the Maine was one of the first surface combatants to be designated as a battleship. When she was commissioned in 1895 she was, at 319 feet in length, the largest ship ever built in a U.S. Navy shipyard. A state-of-the-art vessel, the Maine was showcased in many ceremonial events and was the pride of the U.S. Navy. 
Then, on February 15, 1898, destiny called upon the U.S.S. Maine, her officers and her crew. On that night--a quiet and still evening by accounts from survivors--an explosion shattered the tranquility of Havana Harbor and tore through the Maine, blowing apart her berthing deck and hurling much of her starboard side into the water. After several smaller explosions in the ship's magazines, only 88 men remained among the living, and the United States and Spain were one giant step closer to war. 
Soon after the tragedy, eight more men died and in the weeks following six more deaths would be attributed to injuries suffered aboard the Maine. Initial Navy reports suspected a mine sank the Maine, but urged caution until further investigations could be conducted. The outrage surrounding the incident was taking on a life of its own, however, as papers throughout America reported to a stunned and outraged nation that the pride of our Navy had been destroyed by an enemy mine set in Havana Harbor with the sole and deadly purpose of sinking the Maine. 
On March 23, 1898, a Navy board officially concluded that it was, in fact, a mine that put the Maine on the bottom of Havana Harbor. By April, the infamous expression `Remember the Maine' became a rallying cry for a nation and by the end of that month, President McKinley had ordered a naval blockade which precipitated a formal declaration of war by the U.S. Congress against Spain. 
The Captain of the U.S.S. Maine, Captain Charles Sigsbee, who survived the tragedy, put the scope of the U.S.S. Maine disaster in perspective after the Spanish-American War ended. He said: `During the recent war with Spain, about 75 men were killed and wounded in the United States Navy. Only 17 were killed. On board the Maine, 252 men were killed outright and eight died later--nearly fifteen times as many as were killed in the United States Navy by the Spanish land and naval forces during the entire war.' 
We may never know precisely why the Maine met her end that night one hundred years ago. Today, controversy still surrounds the original theory that it was a mine that sank her. Indeed, a 1976 report compiled by the order of Admiral Hyman Rickover concluded that it was an internal fire in a coal bunker next to the Maine's powder magazines that led to the fatal explosion. More recently, tests results reported in National Geographic magazine, based on a careful computer analysis of photographs of the twisted hull, proved inconclusive. 
While the means by which she met her end may always be a mystery, one thing is for certain: there will never be a debate about her place in history. And there will never be a debate about the bravery of those souls lost aboard the Maine in a flash of fire and chaos. 
That is why we remember the Maine. Captain Sigsbee, knowing of the controversy surrounding the cause of the explosion and its consequences, admonished us to recall the most honorable reason to remember her: `In the way that the men of the Maine suffered there was enough of the heroic to provide a sound foundation for the motto, `Remember the Maine'. 
And so we do so today, and always. Remembrance events are scheduled to take place across the country: at Arlington Cemetery, in Bangor, Maine--where the shield and scroll of the ship rest today, in Central Park in New York City, in Key West, Florida, and at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Liz Henning, Midshipman at the Naval Academy, will likely be there: in the recent National Geographic story on the Maine, she was quoted as saying, `We still think about those guys on the Maine * * * Navy people never forget'. 
Nor will Mainers ever forget. In Bangor, an appropriate memorial to the Maine reminds us of that fateful day one hundred years ago. In the Blaine House in Augusta--the Governor's residence--the silver soup tureen and vegetable dish from the original U.S.S. Maine, along with the loving cup, have been displayed for the past 70 years and have become one of our state's most unique treasures. The story of the recovery of these pieces from the bottom of the ocean in Havana Harbor has always brought a look of awe and amazement to the eyes of Maine's children, and it was always clear to me that these pieces are our living link to Maine's maritime heritage. 
And now, I am proud to say that the U.S. Postal Service will help keep the spirit of those lost on the Maine alive. Key West, Florida, one of the last ports of call for the U.S.S. Maine, and the place where many of the brave Americans who died aboard the Maine are buried, is the location for the First Day and City of Issue for the stamp. Key West will host a first-day ceremony and will use a distinctive First Day of Issue cancellation. 
I would like to thank Postmaster General Marvin Runyon for agreeing to my request for a special, limited advance release this weekend of the Postal Service stamp commemorating the centennial of the sinking of the Maine. The stamp will be distributed during the U.S.S. Maine Centennial observance in Bangor. Rather than the First Day of Issue cancellation, the stamps will be canceled with a special pictorial of the U.S.S. Maine designed in Bangor. 
This and other centennial celebrations will ensure that the Maine will indeed not be forgotten--nor will those aboard who made the ultimate sacrifice. They answered the call when their country needed them, and we must honor their memories with our respect and remembrance. As a Mainer and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have nothing but the utmost respect for the men and women who throughout history have risked their lives and invested their careers in our armed forces. 
In that light, let us keep their memory alive, and let us ensure that future generations will understand and appreciate the legacy of the U.S.S. Maine, and the tragic sacrifice of her gallant crew. Let us remember the Maine.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator Collins, to discuss the unprecedented and historic storm in the State of Maine several weeks ago. 
Mr. President, every once in a while--maybe only once every 100 years or more--an event happens that truly tests the strength of a people and the depth of their spirit. It is an event that strips away comforts and security and pretense and reveals for all to see the true nature of those whose lives it has in its grip. In my home State--the State of Maine--that event began on January 5 and is now known as the Great Ice Storm of 1998. 
As shown here in this photograph, you can see the ice that covers the streets with the trees over the car. It wasn't just one area of the State. This really replicated almost the entire State in terms of the devastation of this storm. 
As you would imagine, we are no strangers to a little winter weather. But this storm was like nothing anyone had ever seen before. By the time five days of sleet and freezing rain had worked their misery on the state, Maine was under a sheet of ice more than two inches thick, and Mainers suddenly found themselves without power, without heat, and facing a life more closely resembling one from 1898 than 1998. 
The State was devastated by this unprecedented storm and many areas were described as resembling a `war zone.' At its peak, the storm knocked out electrical power to an estimated 80 percent of Maine's households--and a week later, about 137,000 people were still without power. Schools and local governments ground to a halt. Over the weekend as the storm finally abated, over 3,000 people sought refuge in 197 shelters and two days later there were still over 2,000 Mainers staying in 111 shelters across the State. And in the end, all of Maine's 16 counties were declared federal disaster areas. 
As you can see here, another sign that shows the kind of pleas that were made by residents all across this State, saying, `Power, please. Our transformer was taken away on Thursday.' People lost their power for up to 2 and 3 weeks. 
The Chairman of the historical committee of the American Meteorological Association, who also happens to be an associate professor of science, technology and society at Colby College in Waterville, MA, summed it up best: `So far this century there has been nothing like it . . . It will probably make the meteorological textbooks--as one of the biggest storms ever.'  
I traveled Maine extensively in the wake of the ice storm, and I was overwhelmed by the extent of the destruction, as we see here another photo of all the downed poles. That is exactly what happened all across the State. You can see the condition of the road. But it was a total destruction of the forests, the pole lines, as well as the telephone poles across the State. Three-quarters of the State, as I said, was affected by it. 
Trees and branches felled, power lines snaked across ice-encrusted streets and major utility structures crumpled as if made of tin-foil. In fact about 50 such structures, an eight-mile stretch carrying the major electrical line into Washington County--the easternmost county in Maine and the United States--were destroyed. 
The owner of that line, Bangor Hydro, needed 170 utility poles and 144,000 feet of 115,000 volt transmission line just to repair the eight miles of downed lines that left 10,000 Washington and Hancock County residents without power. Central Maine Power, the other major power company in the state, estimated that 2 to 3 million feet of power lines fell--2,000 utility poles had to be replaced as well as 5,250 transformers. 
Between 1,200 and 2,000 National Guard soldiers were called to active duty, and 200 Army and Air National Guard personnel helped clear the roads. Central Maine Power had crews of more than 2,500 line and tree-trimming workers on the job. And Maine hosted line crews from Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Florida, Pennsylvania; New Jersey; Connecticut; Washington, D.C.; New Hampshire; and New Brunswick, Canada. 
Broken trees and broken power lines littered the Maine landscape as far as the eye could see. But I discovered one thing in my travels that was never broken--one thing that may have been stronger after the storm than before--and that is the spirit of Maine's people. That is why I am speaking here today, Mr. President. Mainers faced the tremendous challenges this storm presented with resolve and a caring spirit which is truly remarkable and which makes me very proud to call Maine home. 
Everywhere I went I heard stories of neighbors helping neighbors: people inviting strangers into their homes so that they might be warm, lending a hand with fallen trees so that they might be cleared and sharing advice so that no one would feel alone. Rising from the devastation left in the storm's wake was a tide of generosity and giving emblematic of Maine people, and it was deeply heartening to know that such compassion is alive and well in America. 
Paul Field Sr. and his son, both of Bridgton, worked tirelessly and virtually without sleep for 10 days cutting branches, clearing roads, fighting fires, draining pipes, helping neighbors and moving generators to where they were most critically needed. 
And Paul was not alone. In the Town of Albion, farmer Peter Door trucked a portable generator from farm to farm and slept in his truck while dairy farmers milked their cows. In Fairfield, Town Manager Terry York was moved to tears when talking to the Bangor Daily News about the volunteers who helped residents through the crisis. 
Out of state crews found Mainers' attitudes remarkable. One member of a Massachusetts crew that put in two weeks of 16 hour days restoring power to the towns of Otis and Mariaville said, `When I left there, I was proud to be a lineman. My hat goes off to the people of Maine. They're really a special breed.' The same lineman said he never heard an angry word, even though many residents had gone over a week without power and heat. In fact, people offered the linemen food and even hosted a public spaghetti dinner for the crews. 
Indeed, throughout the state, people took strangers into their homes, brought food to elderly residents unable to get out, looked after the homes of those who were away, and cooked meals at local shelters. Maine's potato growers gave away truckloads of potatoes to those in need of food, radio stations fielded calls from residents sharing vital information and advice, and television stations banded together to raise over $115,000 for Red Cross relief efforts. 
My deepest gratitude goes to all those who made life a little easier for others during this most trying of times. In particular I want to recognize and extend my profound gratitude to the outstanding Red Cross officials and the over 1,800 volunteers who did an incredible job of organizing shelters and delivering vital emergency services, as well as the dedicated men and women of the National Guard who did not hesitate for a moment to provide assistance. Also the outstanding employees of the Maine Emergency Management Agency who deserve recognition for their timely and professional response to the disaster. 
Again, you see what linemen crews did here in working on these downed power lines, as I said, and which was pervasive all over the State on miles and miles and miles of line. 
I also want to extend my sincere appreciation to the men and women on utility crews from Maine and from throughout the country who toiled day and night to clear roads and rebuild a crippled power grid. These dedicated individuals worked incredible hours and in terrible weather conditions to bring the state back on line. They are truly unsung heroes and I thank them for their tireless work. 
Indeed, to give you some idea of the magnitude of the effort, in one instance Air Force cargo planes made 13 trips between North Carolina and Maine to bring 50 fresh crews and 47 bucket trucks to lend a hand. It took 5,000 people to carry out the logistics at an estimated cost of this single operation of $1 million. 
In Augusta, local Public Works employees logged, on average, an 80 hour week, with some as high as 102 hours. The Maine Department of Transportation spent $600,000 in overtime in one week and in that same time they used 54,000 cubic yards of sand and 5,000 tons of salt to the tune of another $600,000. 
And the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers worked with my office to coordinate their volunteer efforts to help reattach damaged entrance service cables on residences throughout the state so that the power company could re-energize the homes. (In one weekend, Local 567 helped put 75 houses back in shape so the power could come on and families who had done so long without heat could once again be warm.) 
Those dedicated IBEW workers provided help where it was most needed, and I applaud these dedicated teams of electricians who donated their time, supplies, and skills to make vital repairs across the state. Indeed, it was an honor for me to spend time in the field with some of these unsung heroes to let them know how much I appreciate and admire their selfless efforts. 
Finally, I want to thank all the volunteers who--in the face of their own difficulties--took the time to help others affected by this unprecedented storm. (We may never know their names or their faces, but we know what they have done and we are very, very grateful.) 
It is a credit to Maine people that we coped as well as we did and made speedy progress in recovering and rebuilding. Everyone pulled together from Governor King to town officials to the Brotherhood of Electrical workers. But it was clear that we still needed help. We are an independent people and proud to solve our own problems, but this time even we couldn't do it alone. That is why the federal government's response to this disaster was and is so important. 
The Vice President's personal tour of Maine in the wake of the disaster spoke to the magnitude of the challenge we were facing. I appreciate the Vice President's visit and the President's prompt declaration of 16 Maine counties as federal disaster areas. 
This declaration opened the door to a variety of assistance, and it is estimated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency that about 300 Maine towns and non-profit organizations will seek public assistance from the agency. I am pleased that FEMA has established field offices in Maine to assist Mainers who are still trying to put their lives back together and I expect they will remain in the state for some time. 
Because the fact is, the repercussions of this storm will be felt long after the ice melts and the first blossoms of spring make their way north. Dairy farm losses continue to mount and state agricultural officials may not know for months the full impact of the storm on the industry. Utilities are estimating that their costs will top $70 to 80 million. The State of Maine estimates that they need the release of $12 million in LIHEAP funds to help those who normally don't use the funds but will sign up this year, and to defray the costs of buying generators for those eligible. 
Small businesses across the state have been reeling from lost business--as of last week the Small Business Administration has taken 450 applications for low-interest loans from individuals and businesses, and awarded loans of $173,000. And overall, FEMA has considered 20,869 applications for individual and family grants, 10,085 applications for disaster housing, 9,849 applications for SBA home and property loans and 4,410 applications for SBA business loans. 
This tremendous need for assistance must be met, and that is why I will continue my efforts in conjunction with my colleague from Maine, to ensure that Maine people have rapid and efficient access to the assistance that will become available over the days and weeks ahead. 
Mr. President, we are working with the other States who were hit by the storm--Vermont, New Hampshire and New York--on a supplemental funding package to help our states recover from the devastation of the ice storm. The fact remains that we still must obtain an emergency release of LIHEAP funds, we still must acquire supplemental assistance to help prevent Maine's ratepayers from having to foot all of the utility bill, estimated to be $80 million; and the U.S. Forest Service estimates that it will cost $28 million to clean up the more than 7 million acres of working Maine forest which has suffered moderate to severe damage; for making our farmers and our small businesses whole again and for the additional costs our states have identified that they cannot cover. 
My colleagues from the Northeast and I and my Maine congressional delegation have started working with the Appropriations Committee to assure that supplemental funding to meet the needs of our States can be included in the first supplemental funding bill which the committee will begin work on early next month. 
As many of my colleagues know, we have faced the challenges posed by disasters in their own States. They recognize how important this additional assistance is to their States, and I hope that we can get this assistance as quickly as possible in order to ensure a quick and full recovery from the impact of this historic disaster. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.  
Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators Hatch, Cleland, and others in cosponsoring the proposed constitutional amendment to grant the States and Congress the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States. Our flag occupies a truly unique place in the hearts of millions of citizens as a cherished symbol of freedom and democracy. As a national emblem of the world's greatest democracy, the American flag should be treated with respect and care. I have long held that our free speech rights do not entitle us to consider the flag as merely personal property, to be treated any way we see fit, including its desecration for the purpose of political protest. I want to commend Senator Hatch for once again leading us in this very worthwhile cause. 
Mr. President, with the introduction of this resolution, we resume our effort to protect the greatest symbol of the American experience. There is no more powerful symbol of freedom, democracy, and our commitment to those principles that the American flag, and it is altogether just that we try to ensure that it is publicly displayed with pride, dignity, and honor. Make no mistake, Mr. President, the flag is not merely a visual symbol to us, nor should it be. Too many Americans have contributed too much of their labor, their passion, and in some cases their very being for it to be so simply regarded. For the flag permeates our national history and relays the story of America in its simplest terms. Indeed, knowing how the flag has changed--and in what ways it has remained constant--is to know the history and hopes of this country. 
More than 220 years ago, a year after the colonies had made their historic decision to declare independence from Britain, the Second Continental Congress decided that the American flag would consist of 13 red and white alternating stripes and 13 white stars in a field of blue. These stars and blue field were to represent a new constellation in which freedom and government of the people, by the people and for the people would rule. As we all know, the constellation has grown to include 50 stars, but the number of stripes has remained constant. In this way, the flag tells all who view it that no matter how large America may become, it is forever rooted in the bedrock principles of freedom and self-government that led those first 13 colonies to forge a new nation. 
Equally important is the fact that the flag also represents our commitment to these ideals. This commitment has exacted a high human toll, for which many of America's best and brightest have given their last full measure of devotion. It is in their memories and for their commitment to America's ideals that I am proud to support the amendment introduced yesterday. 
The amendment is necessary because the Supreme Court, in its 1990 U.S. verses Eichman ruling, held that burning the flag in political protest was constitutionally protected free speech. No one holds our right to free speech more dearly than I do, Mr. President, but in my view, the Eichman decision unnecessarily rejects the deeply held reverence in which millions of Americans hold our flag. With all the forums for public opinion available to Americans every day, from television and radio, to newspapers and internet chat rooms, Americans are afforded ample opportunity to freely and fully exercise their legitimate, constitutional right to free speech, even if what they have to say is overwhelmingly unpopular with a majority of American citizens. Simply put, protecting the flag from desecration poses no serious threat to the exercise of free speech in America. 
We must also remember that this constitutional amendment is carefully drafted to simply allow the Congress and individual State legislatures to enact laws prohibiting the physical desecration of the flag, if they so choose. It certainly does not stipulate or require that such laws be enacted, although many States and the Federal Government have already demonstrated widespread support for doing so. In fact, prior to the Supreme Court's rulings on this issue, 48 States, including my own State of Maine, and the Federal Government has anti-flag-burning laws on their books for years. So really what we do with this resolution is give the American flag the protection that almost all the States, the Federal Government, and a large majority of the American people have already endorsed. 
Protecting the flag also enjoys widespread support in Congress. During the 104th Congress, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a flag protection resolution, and 63 Senators supported a resolution identical to this one. Just last year, the House or Representatives, to its credit, reaffirmed its commitment to the sanctity of the American flag by once again passing a flag protection resolution with ease. Now it is time for the Senate to show a similar commitment. 
Whether our flag is flying over Fenway Park, a military base, a school, or on a flag pole on Main Street, the stars and stripes have always represented the ideals and values that are the foundation of this great Nation. Our flag has come to not only represent the pride we have for our Nation's past glories, but also to stand for the hope we all harbor for our Nation's future. Mr. President, it is with this pride and hope that I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, Senators Hatch, Roberts, Specter, and Chafee to introduce a bill that I believe is an historic opportunity to help ensure the well-being of our children and by extension the very well-being of our nation: the Caring for Children Act. 
I come before you as a veteran on child care issues who has worked to address child care throughout my political life, and was the lead Republican cosponsor on the Act for Better Child Care in 1989--the bill which set the stage for the bipartisan package that was adopted by the 101st Congress. Since that time we have advanced the ball in profound ways that reflect the changing nature of the American family, but our work must never cease when it comes to our children. We must build on our laurels, not rest on them: and that is precisely what this bill does. 
Consider the challenge: In California alone in 1997, 500,000 children were already on waiting lists for federal child care in--half a million! Now, it is estimated that, as welfare reform proceeds, some 2 million parents across America will join the workforce and their children will require child care. A GAO report from May of last year determined that in Chicago, for example, the known supply of child care would only meet 14 percent of the need for infant child care in the first year of welfare reform implementation. And within three years, 3 out of 4 American women with children under 5 will be working and in need of child care. 
With the perspective of years spent on this issue, I have come to the conclusion that what American parents need most are choices. The decision of how to care for a young child is a deeply personal and difficult one. Many feel handcuffed by economic concerns, others worry about the safety of child care, but all face different circumstances that make the decision making process unique. 
Given the tremendous challenges of raising children today, and the extraordinary range of issues facing families, I believe the federal government should not be in the business of encouraging one choice over another. Instead the government's role must be to ensure that families have viable options and that the basis for decisions is the best interests of the child. If we are to care about children we must care about choices, and not politicize the issue with partisanship or ideology. 
That is the spirit in which we crafted our bill. Because it is not about pitting one group against another. It is not about starting a `mommy war'. It is about helping parents do the best they can for their children--no matter what choice they make. 
The reality is that, despite our best efforts to date to make quality, affordable child care accessible, the myriad pressures facing American families today still imperil their ability to provide the best possible care for their children. In my home state of Maine, one out of every five Mainers are working multiple jobs. Across the country, 63 percent of women with children under age six are in the workforce, and as a result, over 12 million children are cared for by someone other than a parent during working hours. In Maine, there are 42,000 women in the labor force with children under 6, and 64,000 with children between the ages of 6 and 17. 
At the same time, child care costs can range from $4,000 to $9,000 annually--with families earning less than $14,000 per year paying more than one quarter of their income in child support. As a result, families are often forced to make a choice between two unacceptable options: find care for their children that may not be safe or appropriate, or stay home and hope that they can somehow still put food on the table. 
Our bill respects parents' decisions and expands the choices available in a number of innovative ways. By expanding the Dependent Care Tax Credit, we make it more affordable for parents to choose quality child care, but we also leave the door open for a parent to stay at home with their child. And we target our tax benefits to those who need them most: working American families. 
For two-working parent families with child care expenses, we raise the income level at which parents can take the maximum credit from $10,000 to $30,000, allowing more parents to take advantage of the maximum tax credit. In addition, we raise the percentage of child care expenses that parents can put toward their credit to 50% (up from 40% under current law) of expenses up to $2400 for one child, or $4800 for two or more children. The credit will phase down 1% for every $1500 of income above $30,000, phasing out completely for families earning over $105,000 per year. Under this new scheme, the maximum tax credit will be $1200 for one child (up from $720), or $2400 for two or more children (up from $480). 
For the first time, parents who forgo an income to stay at home to take care of a child between the ages of 0-3 will be able to take advantage of the Dependent Care Tax Credit. By attributing child care expenses to stay at home parents of $150 per month, they will be eligible for a maximum tax credit of up to $900 per year, depending on their income. Applying the tax credit to parents who wish to stay home 
for children ages 0-3 acknowledges that parents of infants and toddlers often face the toughest decisions between working or staying at home, particularly in light of recent research in the area of early childhood development which demonstrates that care from one or two consistent, loving and stimulating caregivers during these earliest years is crucial to brain development. 
The Caring for Children Act will also help defray the considerable costs of child care for low-income families by doubling funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, to the time of $5 billion. This will create more child care slots for low-income families and double the amount of money devoted to improving quality, again leaving more options for parents. 
And we also address the issue safety, because parents are still rightfully concerned about safety. According to a US News and World Report article last August, a query of all 50 states and the District of Columbia revealed that 76 children died in day care in 1996. The causes included drownings, falls, and being struck by automobiles. And these numbers are low because, shockingly, some states do not even track day care deaths. In terms of oversight, the US News report revealed that in Virginia, for example, the state had failed to make mandatory twice-a-year inspections of 722 of its 4,200 licensed facilities in 1996; 159 centers were not visited even once. 
No parents should have to fear for their child's safety--no parent should ever get that dreaded call that their child was hurt at day care. Bringing a young child to day care in the morning should not be an act of faith--it should be an act of confidence. While states have the responsibility to set health and safety standards, states need to be held accountable for enforcing these standards by adhering to the inspection-schedule that they establish under state law. Accordingly, our bill provides a 10 percent bonus in CCDBG funding to states that meet targeted inspection rates, while penalizing those by 10 percent that don't meet their existing responsibility to ensure health and safety. This gives our bill `teeth' to ensure that child care is safe and children are protected. 
Finally, we encourage more American businesses to become partners in child care by offering then tax credits for child care operation, construction and renovation expenses up to $500,000. And recognizing that it is not always feasible for small businesses to assist with child care, we offer grants to small employers to provide such care. Businesses already have an incentive to provide child care in that parents who are confident in their child care arrangements are more reliable, productive workers. These initiatives will not only create more slots and make child care more affordable for parents and businesses alike, but it will help literally bring care closer to more parents. 
In closing, let me emphasize that this bill is an investment in our nation's future. It is a statement by the federal government that there can be no greater cause--no more noble a purpose than providing for our children. How a nation raises its youth and the value it places on giving children a chance to grow up safe, happy, and healthy speaks volumes to its greatness. This legislation won't make decisions easier for parents but it will ensure that they have a full range of options available to them as they seek to do the very best they can for their children. That's why I'm proud to be here today and that's why I will work hard to ensure the passage of the Caring for Children Act. Thank you.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am offering a manager's amendment with Senator Hollings and Senator Chafee to S. 1213, the Oceans Act of 1997. The year 1998 has been declared the International Year of the Ocean by the United Nations, and around the world scientists, governments, nongovernmental organizations, and private citizens are preparing activities that recognize the importance of the oceans to all of humanity as well as the planet. Passage of the Oceans Act today would serve as a very fitting contribution to the Year of the Ocean, signifying that the United States is at the forefront of ocean policy, and that we as a nation are continuing to strive for the conservation and sustainable use of our ocean resources.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a matter of utmost importance to our Nation--granting the President fast-track authority for global trade agreements for the next 5 years. 
I have long opposed extending fast-track authority to the executive branch on the grounds that it removes all possibility of perfecting trade agreements which have wide-ranging impacts on many sectors of our economy. And nothing I have seen in recent history has changed my mind. 
We are being asked to rubber stamp not just one agreement, but any trade agreement that may come along, whether in South America, Asia, or anywhere else in the world. We are contemplating letting bureaucrats and other unelected interests negotiate America's future in the new global economy. And if history is any indication, we would be making a grievous mistake. 
Experience is a wonderful teacher--just look at NAFTA. What I have learned is that NAFTA has not been the job boon it was advertised to be; that the trade deficit has continued to explode under NAFTA, that too many good paying jobs have already been sacrificed on the altar of so-called fair trade, and that we have serious difficulties in enforcing the agreements we've already made. 
That is not a particularly encouraging track record--certainly not one that should inspire us to hand over the trade agreement keys to the White House. To the contrary, it raises grave concerns as to where the administration wants to take the country in the new world of globalization. 
That is why I believe the President is obliged to do more than just say that he needs fast-track authority. The gap between what he said would happen under NAFTA and what has actually happened makes it even more essential that he explain to us precisely how he would address the problems that already exist, and what his vision is for the future should he be granted such sweeping authority. Because frankly, the administration has not spelled out why it needs this authority, nor what it will mean for the Nation. 
Unfortunately, I can venture a fairly good guess as to what it will mean, based on history. The chart behind me represents the U.S. international merchandise trade from 1947 until last year. For 25 out of the 27 years preceding fast-track authority in 1974, the United States ran a trade surplus. Then, after 1975, the bottom started falling out. 
This sea of red ink behind me not only represents millions of dollars in deficit--over $190 billion last year ($191.2 billion)--but lost jobs and shattered lives. For each billion dollars in trade deficit, another 20,000 people are displaced from their jobs--according to the Foreign Trade Division of the Census Bureau, that number is approaching 3.8 million. Every $50,000 in trade deficit is one lost job. 
We hear time and time again that enormous opportunities will be created for the American people through trade agreements the President can negotiate if he has fast-track authority. But if the agreements already negotiated are any indication, it's time to put the brakes on, not hit the accelerator. Because working Americans can't afford any more `opportunities' like this. 
Right now, each week, the United States borrows from abroad or sells assets worth $3 billion to pay for our trade losses. All across the country, workers are taking cuts in pay--or worse, taking home pink slips. And we are left to wonder how trade agreements that had promised so much have delivered so little. Just look at the lessons of NAFTA. 
NAFTA, we were told, would improve our trade deficit with Canada and Mexico. So what's the reality? Before NAFTA in 1993, we had a $1.7 billion surplus with Mexico. As of last year, it's now a $16.2 billion deficit. Before NAFTA we had a $10 billion trade deficit with Canada. After only 3 years of NAFTA, we had a $23 billion deficit. And during those 3 years under NAFTA, our combined merchandise trade deficits with Canada and Mexico have grown 433 percent, as indicated by this chart showing the tremendous downward turn taken after NAFTA. 
We all know that, with trade agreements, there are winners and there are losers. But a quick review of the current NAFTA standings shows that, in sports terms, we are well below .500. The White House has claimed credit for 90,000 to 160,000 American jobs from NAFTA. Yet the Economic Policy Institute has issued a report that there are jobs losses in all 50 States because of NAFTA, more than 390,000 jobs eliminated since NAFTA took effect in 1994. 
Considering our experience prior to 1994, we can ill afford these kind of results. An October EPI briefing paper states that in the 15 years preceding NAFTA the U.S. goods and services trade deficit eliminated a total of 2.4 million job opportunities, 2.2 million in the manufacturing sector alone. That means 83 percent of the total job decline was in the manufacturing sector. 
For example, in my home State of Maine, between 1980 and the inception of NAFTA the Maine footwear industry--the largest in the Nation--lost over 9,000 jobs to countries like Mexico because our Government sat on its hands in spite of recommended action by the International Trade Commission. And in the past three years alone, there have been significant losses in the textile and shoe industries--over 8,000 people have lost their jobs. I have already witnessed too many hardworking people lose their livelihood for me to risk more American jobs. 
I am unwilling to trade well-paying jobs with benefits for lower paying ones--but that's precisely what's happened under our ill-conceived trade agreements. As the trade deficit and globalization of U.S. industries have grown, more quality jobs have been lost to imports than have been gained in the lower paying sectors that are experiencing rapid export growth. Increased import shares have displaced almost twice as many high-paying, high-skill jobs than increased exports have created. 
Of course, NAFTA has created some good jobs. But the fact that increased imports have caused a large trade deficit tell us that more high-paying jobs were lost than gained in the push for more trade. 
Those deficits--and the path the United States is going down--are well illustrated by this chart which shows three roads that have diverged under the previous reign of fast-track authority, first instituted in 1974. Up to that point, Japanese, German, and United States merchandise trade was humming along essentially in balance. 
Beginning almost at the start of 1975, however, we clearly see the United States plunging into deficit, while Germany and Japan both enjoy a trade surplus. To paraphrase Robert Frost, the road less traveled certainly has made all the difference--in this case, not for the better. In other words, under NAFTA as well as other previous trade agreements, there have been many more losers than winners. 
So we must ask the President: How do you explain the job losses? How do you explain the trade deficit explosion? And what is it going to mean for the future of the country? The affect of NAFTA on these issues was seriously miscalculated--what assurances do we have that the administration's record will be better in the next 5 years, after multiple agreements? 
We also need assurances that agreements negotiated will be agreements fulfilled. Unfortunately, after we have negotiated past trade agreements, I do not believe that the United States has aggressively pursued enforcement of the elimination of trade barriers with other countries, whether they are tariff or nontariff barriers. Why then would we grant this authority on a broad basis for whatever agreements may be negotiated by the administration? 
The American Chamber of Commerce in Japan summed it up best in a study earlier this year concluding that `it has often been more important for the two governments to reach agreements and declare victory than to undertake the difficult task of monitoring the agreements to ensure their implementation produces results.' 
The bottom line is, long after the signing ceremonies and handshakes are forgotten, these trade agreements continue to affect lives on a daily basis. We must remember that our responsibilities don't end with the ratification of our trade agreements--they are just beginning. 
Unfortunately, I can only assume from my personal experience that this is a lesson not yet learned by the administration. What other conclusion is there when the NAFTA clean-up plan for the United States-Mexico border has generated only 1 percent of the promised funding? What other conclusion is there when other countries continue to violate our laws by dumping goods in the United States below cost and because of extensive subsidies? 
The Atlantic salmon farmers of Maine are a case in point. While we debate giving the President greater authority to close more trade deals, they have a case pending with the Department of Commerce because subsidized, low-priced Atlantic salmon from Chile--which provides at least 25 different subsidies to its producers, I might add--are being dumped in the United States. And while this situation remains unresolved, we have lost more than 50 percent of our salmon aquaculture industry in Maine, while Chile's imports into the United States have risen 75 percent and United States salmon prices have dropped by 30 percent. 
So forgive me if I am at a complete loss as to how bringing Chile into NAFTA will create more and better jobs, and a higher standard of living for the hard working people of Maine. 
And I could not talk about empty trade promises without mentioning Maine's potato industry. For years I have been raising the issue of an unfair trade barrier with Canada on bulk shipments of potatoes exported to Canada, a trade barrier that is in violation of the National Treatment Principle of article III, paragraph 4 of the GATT, to be specific. This provision requires that GATT/WTO member countries treat imported products the same as goods of local origin with respect to all laws, regulations, and requirements that affect the sale, purchase, transportation, distribution, and use of the goods. 
In December of 1994, USTR's then Trade Representative Micky Kantor said he would be filing a trade case with the GATT-WTO to overturn Canada's policy of bulk easements. So what has happened so far? Nothing. 
Almost 2 years later, in September of 1996, I wrote to President Clinton to express my belief that we had waited long enough, to urge him to live up to the USTR commitment, and to proceed with a trade case on bulk easements. One week later, USTR's Charlene Barshefsky called me to let me know that serious bilateral consultations on Canadian trade practices would begin. 
These talks lead nowhere--in fact, the USTR then actually backtracked on filing a trade case. Two months later, the ITC was asked to investigate. They did, and in July of this year, issued a report, which stated, and I quote: `Canadian regulations restrict imports of bulk shipments of fresh potatoes for processing or repacking.' The report also stated, `the United States maintains no such restrictions.' 
So where are we today? Well, this past week, the U.S. Trade Representative once again promised that bilateral talks on bulk easements will begin no later than March 1998. It looks to me, as Yogi Berra once said, like deja vu all over again. Is this how the administration plans to handle enforcement for future trade agreements? Last week, the President asked the American people to give him the benefit of the doubt on fast track. I believe we need the benefit of enforcement of existing agreements first. 
Where are our strict and mandatory enforcement provisions when our trading partners bring injury to our domestic workers? We need to provide the enforcement to ensure full reciprocity in market access and reduction of export subsidies--enforcement and oversight which, up until now, has been lacking. 
Yet, we are told that specific concerns should be weighed against the broader economic, political and social aspects of NAFTA expansion. We are told that, overall, no major negative impact is expected if we expand the trade agreement with Chile--except of course for industries like fish, forestry, and fruit, all of which are important to the economic stability of my home State of Maine. 
That is why I am not prepared to give up the right to seek assurances that these industries won't be decimated by a flawed trade agreement. The stakes are far too high for Congress to abrogate its responsibilities to the bureaucrats and special interests. 
Free trade, as we have seen, doesn't work unless we have agreements that also provide for fair trade, and Congress must have the right to exercise its responsibility to ensure fair trade in each and every agreement that comes down the road. The Senate must be more than just a debating society for global trade issues that affect each and every one of us. 
Our country negotiated trade agreements for nearly 200 years before fast-track authority was first granted in 1974, when trade was carved out for an exception unlike any other kind of treaty. We continue to negotiate treaties and agreements on everything from chemical weapons to extradition to tuna-dolphin without fast-track authority. And I have heard no rational explanation of why trade should be treated differently. 
I certainly do not believe Congress should approve fast-track authority on the basis of fear that the United States will not have a seat at the trade bargaining table. There is no question we are living in an era dominated by global economics and trade, but at the same time we are an economic super power with an 8.3 trillion dollar economy and 203 million willing buyers--an attractive market to say the least. 
I believe it would continue to be in the best interests of nations across the globe to negotiate with the United States--and those of us in Congress are committed to crafting mutually beneficial trade agreements. I think all of us in Congress understand full well the realities of trade as we approach the new millennium. We must also understand, however, that our trade record under fast track mandates that Congress have a strong voice in the process. 
Mr. President, we are elected to deliberate and vote on the major issues of our day. Well, what could be more important than trade agreements that will directly affect hard working Americans and their families? 
It is imperative that we not relinquish our right to have a voice in these agreements. I don't want to see a repeat of what happened during the summer of 1993 during negotiations on NAFTA side agreements, when United States negotiators, clearly under tremendous pressure to reach agreement on the outstanding issues and conclude the pact in time for a January vote, let Canada and Mexico off the hook on a number of different issues. We need better oversight, more discussion and debate, not less, because we stand at a very important juncture. 
A poignant story out of New England illustrates where we are at the end of the 20th century, and points up the failures of past agreements. 
Two years ago, Malden Mills, a textile mill in Massachusetts, burned to the ground, leaving thousands unemployed and putting 300 more jobs in jeopardy at the Bridgton Knitting Mills in Maine. In the wake of the fire, the mill's owner, Aaron Feuerstein, had several attractive choices, including rebuilding in another state or country with lower wages, anywhere from Texas to Thailand. Or he simply could have retired after four decades of running Malden Mills, founded by his grandfather more than 90 years ago. 
Instead, last month, Mr. Feurstein opened a new, state-of-the-art textile mill, and brought 2,630 very grateful Americans back to work. And the rebuilding of the plant has become a symbol of loyalty to employees and to an entire community. Mr. Feuerstein's actions are admirable and all of America rightfully extended their appreciation to a man who chose the difficult path over the easy, and perhaps more profitable. 
But let's step back for a moment and ask ourselves why this story became a national sensation. The sad fact is, it stood out so glaringly because it is the exception to the rule. The idea that American textile jobs would be kept in the United States when they could easily be shipped overseas is news because it hardly ever happens that way anymore. 
Mr. President, I don't want to continue down this path, but I fear we will if we don't retain our congressional right to speak out against trade agreements that aren't in our best interest. 
We have an obligation to all those who have already lost good jobs to bad trade agreements, and to all those who are in danger of becoming displaced in the future, to take the time to do it right. And the President has an obligation to fully explain how the wrongs of the past will be fixed, and why the future will be different. This he simply has not done. 
We stand poised to begin a new era of prosperity in the global marketplace, but I do not believe that fast track is the way to get us there, I do not believe the President has made his case for this broad authority, and I urge my colleagues to defeat this fast-track legislation.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation designed to address a serious national problem affecting our coasts. 
The recent outbreak of Pfiesteria in the Chesapeake Bay has garnered a lot of media attention, and deservedly so. But Pfiesteria is actually just one example of a larger phenomenon--Harmful algal blooms. 
These damaging outbreaks of often toxic algae affect every U.S. coastal State and territory. In my State of Maine, we have outbreaks of paralytic shellfish poisoning every year which require the closure of clam flats along the coast, and the loss of millions of dollars in potential income. 
On Georges Bank off the New England coast, harmful algal blooms cause $3 million to $5 million worth of damage every year. In Washington in 1991, an outbreak resulted in losses of razor clams exceeding $15 million. And off Alaska, which has our Nation's most pristine coastline, an estimated $50 million worth of shellfish remain unexploited each year due to these outbreaks. 
What is frightening is that these blooms have been increasing over the last 30 years with no sign of abatement--and science cannot explain why. Nor do we have any other way of addressing the problem besides closing areas to swimming and fishing. 
My bill is designed to address this problem with focused and appropriate Federal action. NOAA, the lead Federal agency on harmful algal blooms, currently has the major Federal research program to address the problem--the Ecology and Oceanography of Harmful Algal Blooms project, or ECO-HAB. It is part of NOAA's Coastal Ocean Program, but it does not have a specific authorization. My bill would give this program a specific authorization for $10.5 million annually during fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000, providing it with a more certain future as the next century approaches. 
The bill would also authorize the following activities for the next 3 years--$5 million per year for NOAA to upgrade its research lab capabilities to more effectively study the problem; $3 million annually for education and extension services through the Sea Grant colleges; $5.5 million annually to augment Federal and State monitoring programs to help detect harmful algal blooms early; and $8 million annually in grants to the States through the Coastal Zone Management Act [CZMA] programs to help States control blooms in their area.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today the Senate holds the future of Amtrak in its hands. The legislation before us seeks to put Amtrak's financial situation on a track to self-sufficiency. We have delayed action on Amtrak for three years and we cannot afford to delay it any longer. 
As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee for the last 3 years, I have listened to Amtrak and its detractors discuss the problems and the potential for passenger rail service. The committee, first under the leadership of Senator Lott, and now under the leadership of Senator Hutchison, chair of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee, have reported out tough but fair reform bills that put the burden on Amtrak to prove it can survive without a Federal operating subsidy. 
In the last Congress, despite the best efforts of Senator Lott, no agreement could be reached with those who claim they want Amtrak reform but also wouldn't let it come to the floor--even when they were offered the opportunity to offer, debate, and vote on their amendments. Much the same can be said to explain why we are here, in the waning hours of the first session, considering this important bill. 
I want to express my support for the amendment offered by Senator Hutchison and my appreciation for her dedication to moving the reform process forward. She has fought a difficult battle because of her belief in the importance of maintaining a national passenger rail system, and I would like to commend her for her hard work and dedication to reform. 
But, we are not simply debating Amtrak reform, but a more complex question: Do we, as a Nation, believe that we should have a national passenger rail service? If we do, then we will pass this bill with Senator Hutchison's amendment. If we fail to address the financial problems at Amtrak all we are doing is delaying the inevitable. 
We need to make the tough choices--that is what the people of this country have sent us here to do. If we are not willing or able to do that for Amtrak then we might as well shut the system down rather then allow it to slowly bleed to death. That is what is happening now because some in this body have been unwilling to face up to the fact that there is no easy answer to the financial problems facing Amtrak. If there were--we would not find ourselves in this situation. 
Three years ago, Amtrak took the Government's pronouncement that it should operate without Federal operating subsidies to heart. They developed a business plan and told Congress what was needed both in the way of statutory changes and capital funding in order to meet this goal. Earlier this year we created the capital trust fund--an important first step--but in this case money simply isn't enough. Until we address the statutory changes they need, we have left them to sink slowly into bankruptcy. 
Tom Downs has come before the Commerce Committee, the Finance Committee, the Appropriations Committee, and the Environment and Public Works Committee to tell the Senate what changes Amtrak needs in order to turn a public railroad into a business. He has laid out the statutory changes that are necessary in order to allow Amtrak to compete in the next century. He has been very straightforward about the fact that without these changes, Amtrak has no future. 
The Commerce Committee has twice reported out bills that provide these changes. But the committee has also made it clear that the reform bill is a commitment between Congress and Amtrak to achieve the mutual goal of self-sufficiency. We have created the Amtrak Review Council which will consider factors that will help it determine if Amtrak has kept its end of the deal--Amtrak's performance, and the findings of the independent assessment--in order to determine whether or not Amtrak should continue to exist. I included a provision in the bill that will require the ARC to also consider whether Congress has held up its end of the bargain by requiring the council to look at whether sufficient funding was provided for Amtrak to carry out the financial plan it is required to write under the bill. 
In my very first Commerce Committee hearing in January, 1995, Ken Mead, then with GAO told us that `. . . Congress needs to decide what is to be expected from Amtrak and how much it is willing to pay to fulfill those expectations.' I believe the committee has provided the full Senate with a bill that provides Amtrak and its shareholders with a clear outline of those expectations and most importantly, provides Amtrak with all the tools, within its power, to meet those expectations. 
I believe that the committee's reform package--offered today by the distinguished Senator from Texas--is a fair one, but least anyone think that we are simply pouring money into a sinking ship, it is important to remember that this bill also includes a heavy dose of tough love. If the ARC determines that Amtrak cannot become free of Federal operating subsidies, then plans will be made for liquidation or a major restructuring will be undertaken. 
Having worked with Tom Downs, I am a firm believer that he and the men and women who have worked so hard to keep Amtrak moving will meet the goal of self-sufficiency. If they cannot, even after Congress has provided them with the tools they have asked for, then I am ready to close them down. But I want to know that they had the opportunity, the resources and the tools to meet that goal, first. And that is why it is so important that we adopt the amendment offered by Senator Hutchison. 
It is also important to look at what, until today, has prevented us from moving the Amtrak reform legislation--labor and liability. 
According to the General Accounting Office, labor accounts for 52 percent of the costs at Amtrak. You don't need to be an accountant to know that if Amtrak is to succeed it needs to be able to address these costs. Amtrak has asked for the ability to sit down at the bargaining table and negotiate on the issues of contracting out of services and severance pay, which under current law is 6 years. The Committee bill required both sides to negotiate. Under the Hutchison amendment, the issue of contracting out shall itself be negotiated in the next round of contract negotiations. 
A lot has changed since Amtrak was created and we need to allow the system to change with the times if it is to be a competitive force as we enter the next century. The men and women of Amtrak have worked hard to improve the system, make no mistake about it, and they have more at stake then anyone for without Amtrak they have no job. I do not believe that asking them to sit down at the table and negotiate is asking too much. 
The Hutchison amendment also makes changes in the liability issue that has long held up reform. It is a much misunderstood issue and I applaud the Senator from Texas' ability to reach agreement on the issue. 
The Senate will make an important decision today. We can take the responsible approach, pass reform, and help put Amtrak on the road to self-sufficiency. Or we can take the irresponsible approach, kill the bill and shut down passenger rail service. I have the luxury, I suppose, of coming from a State that will not be impacted one way or the other at this time. Maine does not have train service. We would like it, and we are waiting for a decision by the Surface Transportation Board to determine if we will get it, but the people of my State believe that a national passenger rail system is important, and so do I. 
A national passenger rail system is as much a part of our future as it is of our past. The Journal of Commerce noted last year that Amtrak's presence eliminates the need for 20 additional highway lanes in New York City and 10 new tunnels under the Hudson. It also replaces 27,000 cars on the highway between Boston and New York every day. We can only add so many lanes to any given highway. 
We need Amtrak--not as a reminder of our past, but as a vital part of our transportation future, and I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this bill.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998 is being considered by the Senate. This is an important component of the national security legislation that the Congress must pass each year. The national defense authorization conference report is a good, bipartisan bill. The conference between the Senate and the House conferees dealt with many substantial issues. There were tough negotiations on many issues, and this bill provides a balanced approach and fair compromise. There are three areas that I would like to talk about which are very significant. These are in regard to United States policy in Bosnia; the depot maintenance compromise; and some very substantial quality of life issues for our troops--the men and women in uniform who serve our Nation. 
Mr. President, it is important to note that none of these significant national security issues will be addressed in any other forum unless the Senate passes this conference report and it is enacted into law. 
For example, significant progress was made in this legislation with regard to United States policy in Bosnia. The bill states that it is the sense of Congress that United States ground combat forces should not participate in a follow-on force in Bosnia after June 1998. In addition, the bill contains a provision cutting off funds to support United States troops in Bosnia after June 30, 1998, unless the President certifies that their continued presence in Bosnia is required to meet our national security interests, and provided United States policy continues to preclude U.S. forces from being used to perform civil law enforcement functions. 
This is a significant message to the administration and our NATO allies. This provides a workable solution to this complex policy issue, and is certainly more acceptable to the Senate and the administration than some of the alternatives proposed. I believe our language on Bosnia clearly puts the United States appropriately on record and yet preserves the constitutional authority and the necessary flexibility the administration needs to deal with the thorny issue of Bosnia. 
Another significant issue is the area of depot maintenance, and the fair and open competition that was created by the compromise in this legislation. There are strong feelings on both sides of the depot issue--with many jobs at stake. The conferees' objective was to ensure fair competition and a level playing field. This conference report compromise achieves two things: Straightforward criteria for fair and open competition and, provides greater opportunity for DOD outsourcing. 
Mr. President, one of the most significant areas in this legislation that will not be adequately addressed unless this bill is passed are very important provisions that support our military personnel in uniform who serve our nation so proudly--our troops who the President has so readily called upon in times of crisis throughout the world. Men and women who are now serving in dangerous and remote places like Bosnia, along the DMZ in Korea, and sailing in ships like the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Nimitz and its battle group who President Clinton has just recently ordered into the Persian Gulf to send a very clear message to Saddam Hussein. If we do not pass this bill we will be failing those we call on in times of crisis--the men and women in uniform. 
Examples of some of these important provisions are adjustments to troop strength levels, military pay raises, specialty pay and bonuses, major reform to housing allowances that will eliminate Government waste, authorization for new family housing units, and finally an important step forward in establishing accountability in the fair and equal treatment of our troops--both men and women. 
Compared to current law, this bill provides lower end strength levels and increased flexibility for the Pentagon and the individual services to manage military personnel strength. If the bill is not enacted, the military services will be held to the higher fiscal year 1997 end strength levels that were based on the 1993 Bottom Up Review. Levels that are higher than they need to be, levels that require the DOD to spend money that it does not have and does not need to spend. The lower personnel levels authorized are also consistent with the Department of Defense's Quadrennial Defense Review [QDR]. If we do not enact this bill we might as well throw the recommendations of that review right out the window. 
Without these modified troop strength levels, the services will have to recruit and retain personnel that they will have to separate from the service 1 year later. Is this responsible government? This will be disruptive to our military, unfair to its people, and significantly detract from funding needed for modernization. This is just poor stewardship of our Nation's precious resources. 
Without this Defense authorization bill, the military pay raise that we authorize in this bill will be less than our service members deserve. The bill includes a 2.8 percent pay raise for military personnel. If the bill is not enacted, the pay raise for military personnel will be limited to 2.3 percent. 
Mr. President, the bill also includes authority for significant increases in the special pay and bonus structure designed to respond to critical recruiting and retention problems highlighted by the Department of Defense in our Personnel Subcommittee hearings. If the bill is not enacted, these authorities will not be available to the Department of Defense to address these problems. Specific groups that would be affected include military aviators, nuclear-qualified officers, dentists, military members on overseas tours, military members receiving family separation allowances and/or hazardous duty assignment pay, and military members serving in hardship duty locations. 
Reducing military pay raises while failing to increase these bonuses through defeat of the Defense authorization bill will punish those who expect us here in the Congress to look out for them. We will be repudiating the commitments we have made to improving the quality of life for military personnel and their families. 
The conference report also includes a major reform to housing and subsistence allowances. These are significant reforms to the existing structure for housing allowances and subsistence allowances for military members. The reforms are intended to simplify the management of these allowances and to better target the allowances to those individuals and geographic areas where the need is most acute. The reforms will save the Department of Defense money which can be used for other compensation and quality of life projects. If the bill is not enacted, the Department of Defense will be forced to continue to use the existing, out-dated allowance structure with all its demonstrated inefficiencies, inequities, and higher costs. 
I assure my colleagues if we do not support military personnel with pay and compensation levels that are fair and meet the needs of their families, we will see increases in career personnel leaving the military services. They will see our action as a breach of faith and they will be absolutely right in their assessment. 
The bill also provides authority for the Department of Defense to begin construction on the fiscal year 1998 military construction projects which include quality of life and training-related facilities. If the bill is not enacted, construction cannot begin. Some may believe that since the military construction and family housing projects are funded in the Military Construction Appropriations Act, they do not need the authorization in the conference report. Let me assure my colleagues that is not correct. Both an authorization and an appropriation are required for military construction projects. Without this bill we will not build new family housing units. We will not build new barracks and dormitories for our single service members. We will delay construction on child care centers and dining facilities. If we deny these military construction projects, we will be guilty of failing to meet our commitment in support of our troops. 
And finally, another issue of great importance, is creating an opportunity for fair and equal treatment for all our troops. This body has few greater responsibilities than maintaining the effectiveness and accountability of our Nation's Armed Forces. This is one of the reasons that reports of widespread sexual harassment in our Nation's military deeply concerns us all. With Department of Defense statistics showing that sexual harassment is prevalent throughout the Armed Forces--we must do more than pay lip service to the problem. We must act, and this bill does that. 
Today, with a full understanding that the time has come for serious action that is responsible and constructive, a provision that I authored is included in this 1998 Defense authorization bill that places us on the road to solving the crisis of sexual harassment that plagues our military force. This legislation attacks the root of the problem--the lack of accountability when it comes to reporting and investigating incidents of sexual harassment. 
The Department of Defense conducted a survey in 1988 and found that 64 percent of women reported that they had experienced one or more incidents of sexual harassment in the 12 months preceding the survey. The Defense Department conducted another study in 1995 and found that the figure had only improved to 55 percent. This is not progress, these statistics are shocking. 
In its 1995 Defense Department survey, only 24 percent of the victims chose to report their sexual harassment experiences. Is this the kind of environment to which we should subject our volunteer force? These numbers tell me that women essentially stand a 50-50 chance of being harassed. This cannot and should not be tolerated. Add to that the fact that over three fourths of our military personnel do not feel they can report the harassment that occurs and you clearly have a very negative set of circumstances. How can you maintain good order and discipline in such an environment? This situation demands accountability. And it requires action to erase any perception that sexual harassment is tolerated in today's Armed Forces. 
My provisions in this bill require the unit commander to report each and every sexual harassment incident to their next senior officer within 72 hours. Once reported, the unit commander appoints an investigating officer to investigate the complaint of sexual harassment. The unit commander has 14 days to report back to their commander with the results of the investigation. If the unit commander cannot complete the investigation within 14 days, that commander must report the interim results, every 14 days, until the investigation has been completed. 
Today when an incident is reported to a unit commander, the commander is not required to report the incident until a preliminary investigation recommends disciplinary action. This gives the unit commander tremendous latitude as to how the case is handled. In most instances this is a not a problem. But look what we witnessed with the tragedy at Aberdeen. We saw a company commander who was a bad apple and there was no established system to alert his superiors that there was a problem. 
Under the provisions of the national defense authorization bill each incident is immediately brought to the attention of a more senior officer. The most distinct advantage of this provision is that the decibel level of the problem rises by elevating the matter to the highest echelons of the services. Mr. President, this accountability is included in this legislation. 
This provision also requires that the senior officers who receive these reports of sexual harassment forward all the complaints they receive and the results of the investigations of those complaints to their respective service Secretary by January 31 of each year, elevating the problem another notch within the military to the authors of the services' zero-tolerance policies where they can be scrutinized. The service Secretaries are then required to forward this information to the Secretary of Defense who in turn must report the information to Congress. 
Mr. President, this is what is needed to put us on the road to help end sexual harassment in our military. We owe the men and women who serve our Nation an environment that includes accountability, good order, and discipline. But we also owe this to our Nation, which relies on our military to defend our great country and its interests. 
The committee has been working on this bill for the past 10 months, it is an essential piece of legislation that must be passed by the Senate to ensure our national defense. We owe it not only to our people in uniform but to our Nation. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this conference report. Thank you, Mr President, and I yield the floor.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would authorize the U.S. Postal Service to issue a special stamp to raise funds for prostate cancer research. It is time to fortify the battle against prostate cancer by educating the public about this disease, emphasizing the importance of annual screening, and bolstering our research efforts in order to find a cure. 
In the wake of National Prostate Cancer Awareness week, September, 22-29, men and women from my home State of Maine are sharing their stories about this devastating disease and are calling for more prostate cancer research. Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in American men. The American Cancer Society estimates that 334,500 cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in 1997. Tragically, 41,000 of these men will die from the disease--a number fast approaching the annual breast cancer death toll of 44,300. Between 1989 and 1993, the prostate cancer incidence rate increased by 50 percent. Despite this dramatic surge in incidence, prostate cancer receives only a modest fraction, 3.7 percent, of the funding resources allocated to cancer. In fiscal year 1997, prostate cancer research funding was $96.2 million, which is very low considering the number of lives this dreaded disease will rob each year. 
Advances made over the past 10 years to detect and treat prostate cancer have been significant, considering the fact that the digital rectal examination [DRE]--the primary tool for detecting prostate cancer which has been used for over 100 years--cannot detect small tumors or those on the side of the gland where approximately 40 percent of prostate cancers are located. Physicians have increased their use of the prostate-specific antigen, P.A. blood test which detects both aggressive and latent prostate cancers. The National Cancer Institute is conducting a multicenter trial to test whether or not early detection of prostate cancer by the DRE and P.A. will reduce prostate cancer mortality. Moreover, NCI's Prostate, Lung, Colon and Ovary Cancer Screening Trial [PLCO], which began in 1993, will eventually enroll 74,000 men over its 16 year duration. The trial will determine the relationships between P.A. levels, risk for prostate cancer, and the actual presence and size of prostate cancer in individual men. These advances will help lay a solid foundation for prostate cancer research into the 21st century. 
These developments are pivotal steps in the right direction. However, if we are going to eradicate this disease, much work needs to be done. We must continue the search for new techniques and methods of treatment. We must be relentless in emphasizing the importance of education and awareness. But most of all, we must find a cure. The lives of our fathers, sons, brothers, and friends depend on this effort. 
The Prostate Cancer Research Stamp Act would authorize a special first class stamp to be priced at up to 8 cents above the cost of normal first class postage. The stamp would be voluntarily purchased by postal patrons and the additional money raised by the sale of the stamp would be earmarked for prostate cancer research at the National Cancer Institutes. Perhaps most importantly, this special stamp would help bring the disease out into the open. By raising awareness, men of all ages will be reminded to educate themselves about early detection, screening, prevention and treatment of prostate cancer simply by visiting the post office. 
The ravages of prostate cancer--like all other cancers--are devastating to the lives of all family members. A stamp designed to garner additional research funds would not only help the hundreds of thousands of men who suffer from prostate cancer, but would also remind men to seek regular screening. It is going to take a collective effort to find a cure. But if we all play a small role, the investment in this valuable research will pay off and we will be one step closer to winning the battle against prostate cancer.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I, along with my distinguished colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, am submitting this concurrent resolution which calls for a United States effort to end the restrictions on the freedoms and violations of the human rights of the enclaved people in the occupied portion of Cyprus. A little over 2 years ago, Senator Mikulski and I had introduced a bill to address these very same concerns which, unfortunately, are still with us. 
Mr. President, I am aware that developments on Cyprus are not known to most Americans. Yet if I were to tell them that a small nation has had part of its land illegally occupied by a neighboring state for over 23 years, I know they would be both shocked and outraged. The 23 years since the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus have seen the end of the cold war, the collapse of the USSR, free elections in South Africa and a reunited Germany, yet while the line through the heart of Berlin is gone, the line through the heart of Cyprus remains. 
Over two decades ago, Turkey's brutal invasion drove more than 200,000 Cypriots from their homes. Turkey still controls about one-third of the island of Cyprus and maintains about 30,000 troops there. However, there remains, in northern Cyprus, a small remnant of 497 enclaved Greek-Cypriots. The reason they are referred to as the enclaved of Cyprus is that during the fighting in 1974 they mostly resided in remote enclaves and therefore were not able to flee the fighting and thus were not immediately expelled. Nevertheless the enclaved people of Cyprus have still seen their numbers reduced from 11,300 in 1974 to the 497 there are today. 
Mr. President, I am hopeful that with the appointment of Ambassador Richard Holbrooke as the Special Presidential Envoy for Cyprus that a long-overdue settlement will finally be reached. However, I believe that this resolution is nevertheless important in serving to bring to the attention of the American people and the world community, the hardships and restrictions endured by these enclaved individuals. 
In 1975, representatives of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities agreed that the Greek-Cypriots in the northern part of the island were to be given every help to lead a normal life. Twenty-two years later this is still not the case. 
The presence of the Turkish-Cypriot police in the lives of the enclaved Greek-Cypriots is constant, and there are restrictions on land travel. Other human rights restrictions and deprivations include: 
Restrictions on private telephones; 
Restrictions on hand-carried mail and newspapers; 
Difficulties in receiving full educational opportunities; 
Restricted access to and religious use of the monastery at Apostolos Andreas; 
A requirement that enclaved males aged 18-50 must report once a week to those in control; and 
A lack of investigation with regard to harassment, beating, rape and murder. 
Mr. President, this situation calls out for justice. By bringing these human rights violations to the attention of the American people, it is my hope and that of Senator Mikulski, that we can bring the plight of these people to the World's attention. Our resolution urges the President to undertake efforts to end the restrictions on the freedoms and human rights of the enclaved people. I will remain actively involved in this issue until their rights and freedoms are restored. 
This is the least we can do for these people. That is why I wish Ambassador Holbrooke the best of success in his efforts to achieve a settlement. While this resolution addresses the plight of the enclaved people of Cyprus, work must not cease on efforts to bring about a withdrawal of Turkish forces and a restorations of Cyprus' sovereignty over the entire island with the full respect of the rights of all Cypriots.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague and friend, the Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, in introducing legislation to correct an inequity that exists in our Social Security system. 
Currently, when a Social Security beneficiary dies, his or her last monthly benefit check must be returned to the Social Security Administration. This provision often causes problems for the surviving family members because they are unable to financially subsidize the expenses accrued by the late beneficiary in their last month of life. The bill we are introducing today is based on legislation I have introduced during the last four Congresses. My original legislation prorated the Social Security benefit based on the date of death. If the beneficiary died before the 15th, the surviving spouse received 50 percent of the benefit, if the beneficiary died after the 15th, the surviving spouse received the entire check. The bill Senator Mikulski and I are introducing today expands on this bill by making other family members eligible to receive the check if there is not a surviving spouse. 
Current law makes an inappropriate assumption that a beneficiary has not incurred expenses during his or her last month of life. I know that my colleagues have heard, as have Senator Mikulski and I, from constituents who have lost a husband or wife, father or mother, toward the end of the month, received the Social Security check and spent all or part of it to pay the bills, only to receive a notice from Social Security that the check must be returned. For many of these people, that check was the only income they had and they are left struggling to find the money to pay back the Social Security Administration and pay the rest of the expense their family member incurred in their last month. 
I would like to read a part of a letter I received from a constituent about the experience of his family when his brother-in-law died. This letter, along with Senator Mikulski's own experience when she lost a loved one, serves to highlight why this bill is necessary.  
On February 29, 1996, at 9:20 p.m. he passed away. . . . he was alive for 99.99617% of the month missing a full month by 0.0038314%. With this evidence in hand, the SSA then decided that his check for the month of Feburary had to be returned to them. Unfortunately, his debts for the month didn't disappear just because he failed to live the extra 0.0038315% of the month. . . . it would be nice to see some kind of pro-rating system put into place for the rest of the people who are going to encounter this ghoulish practice. 
I know that my colleagues have all received letters like this. For many of these people, that Social Security check is the only financial resource available to deal with the costs incurred during their loved one's last day of life. Without it, they are left struggling to find the money to pay back the Social Security Administration. 
I believe that this legislation provides a fair solution to an unfair situation and I hope my colleagues will join un in supporting this bill.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation designated to standardize coverage for bone mass measurement for people at risk for osteoporosis under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. This legislation is similar to my bill which was enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act to standardize coverage of bone mass measurement under Medicare. The bill I introduce today guarantees the same uniformity of coverage to Federal employees and retirees as Congress provided to Medicare beneficiaries only a few months ago. 
Osteoporosis is a major public health problem affecting 28 million Americans, who either have the disease or are at risk due to low bone mass; 80 percent of its victims are women. The disease causes 1.5 million fractures annually at a cost of $13.8 billion--$38 million per day--in direct medical expenses. In their lifetime, one in two women and one in eight men over the age of 50 will fracture a bone due to osteoporosis. A woman's risk of a hip fracture is equal to her combined risk of contracting breast, uterine, and ovarian cancer. 
Osteoporosis is largely preventable and thousands of fractures could be avoided if low bone mass were detected early and treated. We now have drugs that promise to reduce fractures by 50 percent. However, identification of risk factors alone cannot predict how much bone a person has and how strong bone is. Experts estimate that without bone density tests, up to 40 percent of women with low bone mass could be missed. 
Unfortunately, Federal Employee Health Benefits Program [FEHBP] coverage of bone density tests is inconsistent. Instead of a comprehensive national coverage policy, FEHBP leaves it to each of the over 400 participating plans to decide who is eligible to receive a bone mass measurement and what constitutes medical necessity. A survey of the 19 top plans participating in FEHBP indicated that many plans have no specific rules to guide reimbursement and cover the tests on a case-by-case basis. Several plans refuse to provide consumers with information indicating when the plan covers the test and when it does not. Some plans cover the test only for people who already have osteoporosis. 
Mr. President, we owe the people who serve our Government more than that. That is why my legislation standardizes coverage for bone mass measurement under the FEHBP. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, in order to help prevent the 1.5 million fractures caused annually by osteoporosis.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague from Vermont to express my disappointment and regret that the Senate has missed an opportunity today to coalesce around a middle ground that would allow campaign finance reform to advance. 
Together with Senator McCain, who deserves our gratitude for his courage and tenacity in bringing this issue to the fore, along with Senator Jeffords and Senator Specter, I have worked over the past week to forge a compromise that would address the two concerns that have emerged as the chief stumbling blocks to Senate passage of campaign fiance reform. Namely, the objection of Republicans to a package that does not address the issue of protecting union members from having their dues used without their permission for political purposes with which they may disagree. And the objection of Democrats to singling out unions while not providing similar protections for members of other organizations, or for shareholders in corporations. 
Last week, in response to concerns which had been raised by the minority leader, we proposed an alternative that would provide the same protections to members of organizations across the board, and to shareholders of corporations. Together with Senator Jeffords, Senator Specter and Senator McCain, we fine-tuned the proposal into a balanced approach with the potential to move this debate forward. It appeared our plan was the best hope of preventing a filibuster and advancing campaign finance reform. 
Unfortunately, our efforts to make the process work in this instance will not succeed today. Despite our willingness to forge a compromise which would address the concerns of both sides--we have not been able to secure an agreement to ensure passage of the compromise. 
The criticisms of our proposal from both sides are typical of the concerns when a proposal strikes a balance between two dies. Nobody really likes it. One side feels we go too far. The other side feels we don't go far enough. 
But in the legislative arena, when both sides are committed to moving forward and finding a solution, that is how we do it. Both sides give. While we have not been able to reach a conclusion today, given the artificially short time limits imposed by the nature of the parliamentary procedure under which we are forced to consider this issue, I believe if Senators are truly committed to campaign finance reform, then it is definitely dead in this session of Congress. 
I am saddened, because we have not only an obligation to provide legislative solutions, but to restore the public's faith in the integrity of the process. If we ultimately fail to coalesce around a middle ground, it would serve only to confirm the public's belief that we lack the will to address this issue in a fair and bipartisan manner. And it will certainly point to the consequences of a shrinking middle in American public life. 
Mr. President, I have worked hard over the last week with my colleagues on this compromise because I earnestly believe that's what people expect of us. They expect that the U.S. Senate will conduct itself as the deliberative body it was designed to be, and they have a right to that expectation. 
We should be putting our heads together, not building walls between us with intractable rhetoric and all-or-nothing propositions. 
I have been part of the legislative process in Congress for over 18 years. I am here because I believe in finding solutions. That is our job, Mr. President: finding solutions. Now, I've been here long enough to know that that is not always possible. And I've been here long enough to know that it is always difficult. But then we were sent here to do a difficult job. So I say let's have the difficult conversations and really give thoughtful consideration to how we can hurdle our most challenging obstacles. That's the way it should be--that's how we end up with better legislation. 
The fact is, this issue will not go away. The public disillusionment with our campaign finance system will not disappear absent meaningful reform. It will come back again and again and again. 
I believe each and every time it will come down to the basic issue of enacting reform that does not unfairly disadvantage either party. As long as we have two-party government, no reform will ever pass unless it truly levels the playing field. 
This is an issue that need not be intractable, as we demonstrated with the proposal we put forward in this debate. It is my belief that eventually the basis for evenhanded reform is embodied in the middle ground approach we proposed. Unfortunately, that day will not be today. 
Finally, I want to issue a challenge to the majority leader and the minority leader. It is the duty of leaders to lead. I urge them to do just that by appointing a bipartisan working group of Senators who want to make the system work. 
I entered public service to help make Government work. It is a task made more daunting by the mounting chorus of partisanship that has engulfed our Nation's politics. 
The status quo, Mr. President, is unacceptable to virtually everyone except apparently to many Members of this body. There are, however, those of us on both sides who want to resolve this problem. What we need is the leadership to bring this spirit to life. 
We need to devote less energy to criticizing and judging each other and more to forging consensus and understanding. Only then can we come together and enact legislation that the majority of Americans feel is sensible and long overdue. 
Let's make, then, a historic statement that the old ways of doing business must be relegated to the annals of history. Let's return elections to the American people and restore confidence in our Government. 
Mr. President, I would like to yield to my colleague and friend, the Senator from Vermont, who has worked so hard on the compromise that we try to put forward today.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to join my colleague, Senator Rockefeller, in introducing the Child Support Performance Improvement Act of 1997. This bill establishes a new formula for State child support incentive payments, in order to reward those States which truly excel at collecting child support. Over the years, Senator Rockefeller has shown an extraordinary commitment to children and families across America, and his leadership on this bill represents more of the same. 
Mr. President, States need to crack down on deadbeat parents who renege on their financial responsibilities to their children. While noncustodial parents owed $47 billion in child support in 1995, States collected only $14 billion. Collections increased to approximately $16 billion in 1996, and are likely to further increase as the result of tough new child support reforms which I authored and which were contained in the Welfare Reform Act. 
States performance in collecting child support varies tremendously. For example, Maine has worked very hard to successfully improve its child support collections. While Maine has collected over $580 million since 1975, half of that amount--$286 million--was collected within the past 5 years. Last year alone, Maine collected almost $72 million, representing a 10-percent increase over the previous year. This considerable improvement is due to comprehensive State reforms pioneered under Governor John McKernan in 1993, and Federal child support reforms contained in the Welfare Act. But not all States share this heightened commitment to collecting support. That is why my child support provisions in the Welfare Reform Act required the Secretary of HHS, in consultation with the States, to develop a new formula for State incentive payments that is based on performance, in order to further improve State collections, and to report back to Congress on the subject. The bill that Senator Rockefeller and I introduce today is based on that report. 
Under current law, the Federal Government provides States with an extra incentive payment in order to increase child support collections. The current formula for incentive payments is based on the cost-effectiveness of a State's child support collection program--the collection-to-cost ratio--meaning that States are rewarded for bringing in more dollars for each dollar they invest in the program. Incentive payments start at 6 percent of collections, and rise as high as 10 percent for the most cost-effective States. In fiscal year 1995, Federal incentive payments to States were $400 million, nearly 33 percent of the gross Federal share of child support collections. 
Mr. President, the current system does not make sense in that every State, no matter how dismal its record in collecting child support, receives a minimum incentive payment. This perpetuates mediocrity and does not serve children. Instead, States should be rewarded on the basis of performance outcomes that will help children, such as establishing paternity and support orders quickly, obtaining medical support, and collecting support on a regular basis so families can rely on it. 
The Child Support Performance Improvement Act establishes a formula which takes into account performance-based measures and standards in five areas: establishing of paternity; establishing child support orders; collecting currently-owed support; cost-effectiveness; and collection of past-due support. The first three measures receive the most weight in the formula because they translate most directly into support that helps keep families financially self-sufficient. Giving them more weight will help concentrate State efforts where they matter most. 
Under our bill, States would only qualify for incentive payments if they meet threshold performance requirements in these five areas. States that perform below the threshold level can qualify for minimum incentive payments only if they significantly improve their performance compared to performance in a prior year. The bill also requires the Secretary of HHS to establish standards for collecting medical support to be implemented later, to ensure that children of divorced parents have health insurance. Finally, the bill requires States, for the first time, to reinvest their incentive payments back into the child support system, so they can further improve collections and better serve children. 
Mr. President, this bill will significantly help families to obtain the child support owed to them so they can remain financially self-sufficient. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Coast Guard Authorization Act for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. 
The Coast Guard is one of our Nation's truly essential agencies. It aids people in distress on our bays, oceans, and waterways, preventing injuries and loss of life on these waters. 
It enforces all Federal laws and treaties related to the high seas and U.S. waters. It is the lead Federal agency for preventing and responding to major pollution incidents in the coastal zone. It makes our ports and shipping lanes safe for efficient marine transportation and commerce. And, as one of the five armed forces, it provides a critical component of the Nation's defense strategy. 
A few statistics graphically illustrate the Coast Guard's importance to the Nation. Last year, it saved 4,750 lives, assisted more than 90,000 individuals in distress, and saved or protected nearly $6 billion in property. 
As part of its law enforcement mission in 1996, the Coast Guard confiscated 29 tons of cocaine and marijuana that was destined for the United States. It intercepted over 9000 immigrants headed to our shores. 
During the same year, the Coast Guard responded to more than 17,000 pollution incidents. And the maritime cargo activities that the Coast Guard monitors and protects are estimated to contribute $74 billion annually to our GDP. 
Fortunately for the American people, the Coast Guard performs these and other essential missions with a high degree of professionalism. 
Last year, Congress enacted the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996, which authorized the Coast Guard through fiscal year 1997. The bill we are introducing today reauthorizes the Coast Guard for the next 2 years--fiscal years 1998 and 1999. 
It authorizes both appropriations and personnel levels for these 2 years. And it also contains various provisions that are designed to, among other things, provide greater flexibility to the Coast Guard on personnel administration, streamline the inventory management process, eliminate an unnecessary reporting requirement, and 
enhance the effectiveness of the Coast Guard Investigative Service. The bill also provides authority to transfer excess property to the Coast Guard Auxiliary, protects personal information from release to the public during marine casualty investigations, conforms the U.S. territorial sea definition in certain laws to the 1988 Presidential Proclamation extending it from 3 to 12 miles, provides for some noncontroversial property conveyances, and contains other provisions. 
One provision that deserves particular mention relates to marine safety. Needless to say, we must have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to the use of alcohol and illegal drugs by anyone involved with the operation of a vessel. Unfortunately, some problems have arisen in recent years with the implementation of the Coast Guard's chemical testing requirements that apply in the aftermath of serious marine incidents like oil spills. 
Last year, after the oil tanker Julie N hit a bridge in Portland, ME, and spilled 170,000 gallons of oil, it was revealed that the pilot of the vessel failed to complete a test for alcohol, as required by regulation. Consequently, we will never know whether he was under the influence of alcohol when he hit the bridge. And this is not the only case of such a lapse. The National Transportation Safety Board, with whom I consulted on this language, has identified approximately 20 cases in recent years in which chemical testing procedures have not been properly complied with after serious marine incidents. 
This bill contains a provision designed to address the problem. Whereas current regulations only require the marine employer to ensure that alcohol tests are promptly conducted, the bill adds a provision that will require the Coast Guard to ensure that these tests are conducted, one way or another, within 2 hours of the accident being stabilized. The provision also increases the civil penalty for failure to comply with Coast Guard chemical testing procedures from $1,000 to $5,000. With these two changes, we will now have a clear chain of accountability in the testing process and a powerful incentive that should prevent testing lapses--and hopefully accidents related to intoxication--from occurring the in the future. 
Mr. President, this is a good bill that enjoys bipartisan support on the Commerce Committee. I look forward to moving this bill to the Senate floor at the earliest opportunity.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, in the introduction of the Oceans Act of 1997. This bill will establish a commission like the Stratton Commission of 1966 to review the many ocean and coastal issues facing the United States, and to develop a comprehensive, coordinated, national ocean and coastal policy. 
Prior to introduction, I raised a few concerns with Senator Hollings on some provisions of the draft bill. Basically, I had recommended some language that made it clear that as we develop a new ocean and coastal policy for the Nation, we keep in mind the facts that our fiscal resources are limited, and that our Federal investments in ocean and coastal resources must be spent efficiently and wisely. I also raised some concerns about the fact that the original draft had the President appointing all of the members of this important commission. 
Mr. President, Senator Hollings has graciously agreed to make some changes to the bill pursuant to my recommendations. For instance, the bill now authorizes the Congress to appoint more than half of the commission members, and the commission is directed to identify opportunities to reform Federal ocean programs to improve efficiency and effectiveness. I commend Senator Hollings for his willingness to work with me and other Republican Senators before introduction of the bill. After introduction, I look forward to working with the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, a Senator who worked on the original Stratton Commission bill 30 years ago and who is a true champion of ocean protection, in the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee on any further refinements along these lines that might be constructive. 
Again, I thank Senator Hollings and commend him upon introduction of this bill.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to highlight the millions of family caregivers across this country, by calling on the Census Bureau to count family caregivers in the Census 2000. This bill is a companion to House legislation introduced by Representative Canady. I would like to thank Senators Jeffords, Mikulski, Allard, Harkin, and Grassley for joining me in support of family caregivers by cosponsoring this bill. 
As the population of this country ages, more and more Americans have and will assume the role of family caregivers--people who provide noncompensated care for an elderly or disabled family member in their own home. Today, nearly 80 percent of elderly people needing long-term care services are estimated to reside outside the nursing home setting, and many nonelderly people are cared for by a family member as well. In fact, family caregivers provide two-thirds of all home care services in this country. 
The decision to care for a loved one who is ill or incapacitated on a full-time basis requires significant personal sacrifice on the caregiver's part. Yet the compassionate services provided by family caregivers to those who are unable to care for themselves is invaluable. Without the contributions of caregivers, immense pressure would be brought to bear on our nursing home and health care systems. Unfortunately, caregivers and their contributions to the Nation's public health system have historically gone unrecognized. 
While the issue of family caregivers has obvious policy implications, adequate statistical and survey information is not available to help policymakers address issues concerning these individuals. That is why I am introducing legislation to request that family caregivers be counted by the Census Bureau in the Census 2000. By counting caregivers in the census, we will be able to collect more information about this rapidly-growing group and form policy solutions that will take into account their special needs. 
In her book, `Helping Yourself Help Others,' former First Lady Rosalynn Carter reminds us that there are only four kinds of people in the world: those who have been caregivers, those who are caregivers, those who will be caregivers, and those who will need caregivers. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and to draw attention to the needs of family caregivers.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in keeping with the old adage that those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it, I am introducing a bill today with Senator Kerry which is designed to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past in fisheries management. 
Most of the major commercial fisheries in both the United States and the world are either fully exploited or overexploited. In many instances, these fisheries have approached or reached an overfished condition because the fishing fleets which targeted them became overcapitalized before the management system in place could respond effectively to this excess fishing capacity. As a result, we find ourselves today faced with case after case of having to make wrenching management decisions to reduce fishing effort that have substantial socioeconomic impacts on coastal communities that depend on fishing for their livelihoods. 
In the cases of Atlantic herring and Atlantic mackerel, however, we still have time. Through torturous but ultimately fortunate historical circumstances, the offshore stocks of these fisheries remain, at least according to the best information presently available, fairly abundant. And because of their relative abundance, these fisheries have attracted increasing attention from fishermen in the Northeast and the mid-Atlantic, many of whom have been displaced from the now-depleted New England groundfish fishery. 
Earlier this year, however, a dramatic new proposal came to light which could alter the planned course of sustainable development for these fisheries. A United States-Dutch group intends to bring a 369 foot factory trawler into the Atlantic herring and mackerel fisheries by the spring of 1998. This vessel is more than twice the size of any other vessel currently fishing in New England, and it intends to harvest 50,000 tons of fish annually. Many concerns have been raised from Maine to New Jersey about the potential impacts that this enormous vessel will have on the herring and mackerel stocks, and on the composition of the fisheries that have been developing in recent years through the hard work of many people in the region. To take one example of these concerns, while the National Marine Fisheries Service indicates that herring is, according to the best information, fairly abundant off Georges Bank and southern New England, there are legitimate concerns about the health of the Gulf of Maine stocks which form the major source of supply for the sardine and lobster bait industries, and which do appear to interact and aggregate with the offshore stocks at certain times of the year. Unfortunately, today's science cannot tell us with a high degree of precision what impacts the increased fishing of offshore stocks would have on all of the key Gulf of Maine stocks. 
The uncertainties surrounding the Atlantic Star proposal are the kinds of things that must be carefully reviewed, and the most appropriate forums for reviewing these questions are the regional fishery management councils established to manage our fisheries under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Unfortunately, neither of the councils with jurisdiction over herring and mackerel had addressed the issues raised by the Atlantic Star before the vessel's owners were able to get it permitted. The Atlantic herring fishery does not have a federal fishery management plan, meaning that it is largely unregulated. And the existing management plan for mackerel was developed before it was known that the Atlantic Star would seek to operate in that fishery. 
To ensure that the Atlantic Star and other vessels of its class receive the thorough consideration intended in the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the bill introduced by Senator Kerry and I calls a temporary timeout on the entry of very large vessels into the herring and mackerel fisheries until the councils have time to act. Our bill states that no vessel over 165 feet or with greater than 3,000 horsepower can harvest these species unless the appropriate council specifically authorizes it in a fishery management plan or plan amendment. But unlike other bills that have been introduced on this issue, our bill ensures that this matter is addressed in a reasonable timeframe. It establishes deadlines for action on the Atlantic Star by the councils and the Commerce Department of September 30, 1998, whether the decision is favorable or unfavorable. 
Mr. President, this bill simply ensures that the analytical and deliberative process outlined in the Magnuson-Stevens Act has a chance to work as it was intended. And when the issue is the introduction of a dramatically different new fishing technology into two relatively healthy fisheries of substantial importance to many people who live in the region, the integrity of this process could not be more important. It is unfortunate that this issue was not resolved by the councils and the Commerce Department sooner, but the fact is that it was not, and Congress, if it is to ensure that our fisheries are managed responsibly, must intervene in a responsible manner. The remedy that we have proposed is responsible, temporary, and reasonable.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will end a common abuse of the budget process in the Congress: the attachment of nonemergency provisions to emergency spending bills. Senator Abraham and Senator Gramm are also original sponsors of this legislation. 
At a time when Congress and the President have come together and agreed on a plan to balance the budget by the year 2002, I believe it is appropriate that we now seek to ensure that all future spending decisions be fully weighed and considered before the tax dollars of hard-working Americans are spent. We must ensure that the costs and benefits of a proposal are thoroughly reviewed through our carefully structured budget process--not allowed to be pushed through the Congress with minimal debate and consideration. The legislation I am introducing today would address one of the ways in which spending programs are pushed through Congress with minimal budget scrutiny: the attachment of nonemergency provisions to emergency spending bills. 
Mr. President, as my colleagues know, emergency spending bills have been afforded special treatment because of the unique problems they address. While the annual budget and appropriations process typically takes months to complete, emergency spending legislation often receives special, accelerated consideration that can lead to its adoption in days or weeks. This expedited treatment is understandable: When a flood, earthquake, or other natural disaster imperils the lives and safety of the American people, Congress and the President should be ready and able to respond quickly. 
We have even made special exceptions for emergency spending bills within our budgetary rules to ensure that disasters and other emergencies are quickly addressed. While we generally require that new spending be offset to ensure the deficit is not increased, we allow this requirement to be waived if the moneys are being spent on an emergency item. In addition, we waive our annual budgetary spending caps if the moneys are being spent to address an emergency or disaster. 
Because of their expedited treatment and budgetary exceptions, emergency spending bills have become a magnet for nonemergency items. Rather than subject a proposal to the regular budget and appropriations process, provisions are often attached to emergency spending bills that are moving through Congress on a virtual fast track. 
Although nonemergency items in an emergency spending bill are still subject to the annual spending caps, no offset is required if such spending would be below the annual limit. Furthermore, even if a nonemergency item is offset in an emergency spending bill, the expedited consideration of that legislation often does not allow for a thorough analysis in the broader context of the budget. Rather than subjecting the nonemergency spending provision to the same scrutiny as other programs in the budget and weighing its merits accordingly, Congress is forced to make a rapid decision. Delaying the process and carefully weighing these nonemergency items would also mean risking the timely delivery of assistance to those who have been affected by an emergency or disaster. Such a delay is simply not acceptable. 
Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today would eliminate this problem and this practice by ensuring that all nonemergency spending items are subject to the same budget scrutiny and same budgetary rules. If my legislation is adopted, emergency spending bills would no longer be a convenient vehicle for spending money on nonemergency items. Rather, emergency spending bills would be just that: emergency spending bills--not Christmas trees with other goodies and presents tucked beneath them. 
Under my bill, nonemergency provisions in an emergency or disaster spending bill would be subject to a new three-fifths majority point of order. If a nonemergency item is included in an emergency spending bill or related conference report--or is contained in an amendment that is being offered to such a bill--this new point of order could be raised by any Member, and a three-fifths majority vote would be required to waive it. 
I believe the Members of this body are familiar with the Byrd rule and its impact on the reconciliation process, and my new provision would be administered in much the same way. The only difference would be that while the Byrd rule applies to budget reconciliation bills, this rule would apply to emergency spending bills. 
Mr. President, we must no longer allow nonemergency items to be attached to emergency spending bills. We have created an expedited process for considering emergency spending bills for very sound reasons--but providing a vehicle for nonemergency items to be rushed through Congress was not one of them. 
As we work toward a balanced budget in the year 2002, I would urge that Congress and the President carefully weigh the merits of every spending program and make priorities accordingly. My legislation would help us achieve this objective by ensuring that nonemergency items are not rushed through Congress while riding on the back of emergency spending bills. I urge that my colleagues join me in this effort and support this legislation.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce legislation that will address a serious need of America's workers: The need to receive training that will prepare individuals for the workplace of the 21st century. My legislation, entitled the `Working American Training Voucher Act,' would provide $1,000 training vouchers to 1 million working men and women who typically have little or no access to employer-provided training. 
Mr. President, many Federal programs focus on the needs of those whose challenges and difficulties are most easily recognized and tangible. When we see a hungry child, an unemployed adult, or an impoverished senior citizen, we justifiably want to reach out and do what we can to help. Indeed, I am proud to be an active voice for those whose challenges and pains we can sometimes only imagine. However, it is oftentimes difficult to recognize the needs of those whose challenges are less tangible, whose concerns are less evident, or whose sense of insecurity about the future is known only by the individual and their family. 
It is this difficulty that confronts many American workers today. In the face of increasing global competition, many workers wonder if the job they have today will be there for them tomorrow. They are concerned that the advent of new technologies is making their skills and talents less useful for their current employers which, in turn, makes them feel more vulnerable and expendable. And they wonder if the skills they posses today are even marketable if they are downsized or otherwise put out of work. 
Unfortunately, these types of concerns and anxieties oftentimes do not show on the surface, so it can be difficult for others to recognize or address them. It is too easy for many to assume that because a man or woman is already holding down a job, all is well and his or her future is secure. After all, how bad can it be if you're punching a time clock and getting a paycheck? Unfortunately, such a view is not only shortsighted, it is also misguided and could prove disastrous. 
We should not wait until a worker has been laid off from their job, or a company shuts its doors and shutters its windows, to take steps to help the American worker. Rather, we should take steps to ensure that our Nation's work force is confident of their future and feels prepared to address the changes that tomorrow will bring. Not only does this help the individual, but I think we would all agree that the best way to reduce the impact and cost of unemployment is to take steps to keep those who are already employed on the job. 
Admittedly, many policies and decisions play an integral role in creating a vibrant job market. The tax burden we place on businesses, the trade agreements we sign with foreign governments, and the regulatory load we place on employers all have a significant impact on our economy's ability to produce and sustain good jobs. However, for the individual, many of these polices seem too macro to have an impact on their own employment prospects. In fact, an individual may not even recognized the direct impact these broader policies have on their job from day to day. 
There is, however, one issue that truly strikes at the heart of how an individual feels about the future: The degree to which he or she knows that their skills match the needs of their current employer or other prospective employers in the marketplace. Without this knowledge, it does not matter to an individual if the unemployment rate is as low as economists consider the natural rate of unemployment or if the newspapers tell him or her that the economy couldn't be better. The simple fact is that unless an individual personally feels that their skills are up-to-date and marketable, there will never be a complete sense of security on the job from one day to the next. 
And that's what the legislation I am introducing today is all about. The Working American Training Voucher Act addresses the needs of the average American worker--the individual who has a job today, but doesn't know if he or she has the skills needed for the jobs of tomorrow. The person who's collecting a paycheck now, but is concerned that the rapidly changing work environment may put an end to that soon. 
Mr. President, we all know new technologies and new products are entering the workplace at an unprecedented rate and the changes these technologies bring are substantial. Few professions and few jobs have gone 
untouched by these changes--and even fewer will be immune from change in the future. Indeed, just as computers have changed the face of manufacturing, they have also changed the world of art and design. Even labor intensive tasks at assembly shops have taken on a high-tech flair thanks to new technologies. 
For an individual who understands these technologies or received training in their use, these changes present exciting new opportunities that improve performance and ultimately give one a sense of assurance that their skills are in demand. But for those who do not understand these technologies or do not receive training in their use, these technologies are nothing more than a threat and cause for anxiety. 
Regrettably, even as the demand for training at all levels in the workplace continues to grow because of these changing technologies, the United States has historically lagged far behind our global competitors in training workers. In fact, a study by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment concluded: `When measured by international standards, most American workers are not well trained.' 
While some U.S. companies devote a substantial amount of money to training, many of our global competitors spend considerably more. A study by the American Society for Training and Development highlighted this point when it found that U.S. companies spend--in the aggregate--approximately 1.4 percent of their payroll on training, while a number of our competitor nations actually require companies to spend 2 to 4 percent. While I would not espouse a mandatory training budget for any business, I believe we can and should seek to improve the availability of training for our Nation's workers--and especially for those who need it most but are least likely to receive it. And that's precisely who the working American training voucher is designed to reach. 
 Mr. President, the working American training voucher would provide access to critically needed training for workers at businesses with 200 or fewer employees. Why is it targeted to workers in small businesses? Quite simply, because these are the individuals who are the least likely to receive--or be offered--employer-provided training. The same report by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment summarized the plight of employees at small businesses quite succinctly: `Many (employees) in smaller firms receive no formal training.' 
A recent report--completed by Prof. Craig Olson at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and presented to the Senate Manufacturing Task Force this past September--looked at the difference between the likelihood an individual would receive training and the level of educational achievement he or she attained, or the field he or she chose to enter. Dr. Olson's study found that individuals with a bachelor's or master's degree had a 50 percent chance of receiving training in the past year, while individuals with a high school diploma had only a 17 percent chance. Those who dropped out of high school fared even worse; their odds of receiving training were only 5 percent. 
When viewed by occupation, individuals who worked in production- or service-related jobs had only a 16 percent and 18 percent chance of receiving training respectively, while those in management had a 50 percent chance. When considering that only one in four American workers received training in the past 12 months, these odds don't bode well for many employees at small businesses whose educational attainment and occupations fall in the categories that are the least likely to receive training. 
One might understandably ask: Why is it that small businesses often provide so little training? The answer: cost. Small businesses are quite often unable to afford the cost of sending an employee to a training program. When your business is just trying to make ends meet, it's impossible to send an employee to a training class that costs the business both money and time away from work. 
 Mr. President, the working American training voucher is designed to address this problem in a straightforward and efficient way. These vouchers--valued at up to $1,000 each--would be made available to employees at small businesses through the existing job training system that is already in place as a result of the Job Training Partnership Act, or JTPA. As my colleagues in the Senate know, State and local governments--joined by the private sector--have primary responsibility for the development, management, and administration of job training programs in the JTPA, so no new distribution network would be necessary to conduct this voucher program. 
The only major requirement for receiving a voucher would be that the employee and employer must agree on the specific training that will be purchased with the voucher. This will ensure that the training will be targeted specifically to the needs of the individual and the business--money would not be spent on generic training programs that teach skills that are of little, if any, use in a particular field or job. Furthermore, such an agreement will ensure that workers are actively engaged in pursuing training that will help their careers, even as employers will be urging employees to undertake training that will help the business. 
The Senate Labor Committee will soon be preparing legislation to recraft and consolidate many of our federally-run job training programs in the JTPA. I am greatly concerned that none of our current 128 job training programs is specifically targeted to training for currently employed individuals--and I believe that the working American training voucher would fill this void for those who need access to this training the most. Therefore, I am hopeful that my legislation and this concept will be incorporated in the job training reform bill when it is reported from the Senate Labor Committee and is considered on the floor of the Senate. 
Mr. President, I believe that as we prepare our work force for the next century, we should be encouraging workers to develop new skills that will improve their longevity in their current jobs even as they gain confidence that their skills will be needed in the future. Not only will these new skills increase the confidence and performance of the individual worker, but they will also improve the productivity of the business who employs them. And we all know that if we improve a business' productivity and output, that business is more likely to survive and thrive--which means that this voucher may ultimately assist in preserving businesses and jobs in the long run. 
Furthermore, better skills and training will ensure that individuals are able to rapidly transition to new jobs in the unfortunate event their current job is lost for reasons beyond their control. Regardless of how favorable the Tax Code is made or how many burdensome regulations we remove, we will never be able to guarantee an individual that his or her job will be around forever. But we can provide a worker with access to training that will keep his or her skills up to date and marketable no matter what the future holds. 
Mr. President, the working American training voucher would be a tangible, concrete, and definable program that would address a core issue facing American workers. It will ensure that those who typically have the least access to training will be able to acquire the skills needed for their current jobs, while improving their jobs in the future. It is targeted to those who are most in need of assistance, and will ensure that we no longer wait until an individual is out of work to provide help. 
The Federal Government often promises the American people many things, but we can never offer peace of mind to a worker who doesn't know if his or her skills are adequate to keep them employed. Let's take a step in the right direction and at least ensure that those who have a job will not lose it due to a lack of access to training and new skills. Let's pass the Working American Training Voucher Act.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the American people watched with horror and disgust as the incidents of sexual misconduct at Aberdeen Proving Ground unfolded last fall. As details emerged at Aberdeen and other Army training facilities, the extent and seriousness of this problem became increasingly and terribly evident. 
As a result of these events, the Secretary of the Army, Togo West, commissioned his senior review panel and tasked the Army Inspector General to conduct two separate widescale investigations of sexual harassment within the Army. Today, the Secretary released the results of these two studies. 
Both reports delivered a scathing indictment of the climate and lack of leadership that permits sexual harassment to permeate all levels of the Army. 
Mr. President, in each case involving leaders and trainees, the sexual misconduct which occurred at Aberdeen and elsewhere within the Army was a result of abuse of authority. The key to solving this problem is to eliminate the systemic conditions which created the atmosphere which allowed these outrageous and egregious instances of abuse to occur. The Army's equal opportunity system, which is supposed to provide a safety valve when all else fails, is itself a complete and utter failure--devoid of support by the chain of command and lacking credibility by those it seeks to protect. 
The stark reality is that only 5 percent of the 9,000 people surveyed, as part of the Army's own review, said they would use the formal complaint mechanism provided by the equal opportunity system. 
Mr. President, what kind of program engenders confidence in only 5 percent of the population? The answer is simple. One that is badly broken, and in desperate need of repair. 
The reports released today found that sexual harassment exists throughout the Army, crossing gender, rank, and racial lines. They also found that the Army leadership is the critical factor in creating, maintaining, and enforcing an environment of respect and dignity, yet too many leaders have failed to gain the trust of their soldiers. 
As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have taken a long hard look at sexual harassment throughout the military. I have made visits to Fort Jackson, SC, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, and Camp Lejeune, NC. As part of these visits, I asked the Army about the quality of its sexual harassment training designed to sensitize both instructors and trainees to the problems of sexual harassment. Army officials assured me that the training was adequate, but today's shocking report reveals otherwise. 
The Inspector General's survey reported that professionals and leaders who are expected to deal with soldiers reporting incidents of inappropriate sexual behavior need to be trained and qualified, indicating that is obviously not the case today. 
Army officials must act swiftly and aggressively to change the climate that has allowed sexual harassment to permeate the Army. These same officials must also vastly improve the education provided to both instructors and trainees to ensure beyond the shadow of a doubt that all parties understand their responsibilities with regard to sexual harassment. The equal opportunity system has clearly failed and must be repaired so that victims of sexual harassment will have confidence that Army leadership will act on valid complaints and actively seek to eliminate sexual harassment. 
Today's acknowledgment by the Army is a first step that identifies the alarming scope of this problem. Now, it is incumbent upon the military and on our civilian leaders to put an end to sexual harassment once and for all. 
I will again meet with Army officials tomorrow and will continue to aggressively pursue changes to eliminate the poisonous environment that allows such pervasive levels of sexual harassment to undermine the good order and discipline of the United States Army, so crucial to our national security.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to support a critically important piece of legislation affecting small businesses across our Nation--S. 1139, the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. I would like to begin by thanking Chairman Bond and ranking member Kerry for their leadership and perseverance on this bill. We would not be here today considering S. 1139 if it were not for their dedication to the small business community. 
As a Senator from Maine, a State whose future economic well-being is dependent on small business enterprise, I am extremely supportive of the role the Small Business Administration [SBA] plays in promoting small business development and growth. The Small Business Committee, of which I am a member, held five hearings this past year on SBA's finance, noncredit, and Microloan programs. As a direct result of testimony given during those hearings by small businesses, the SBA and various industry organizations, the committee drafted a comprehensive bill that reauthorizes and improves upon even the most successful of SBA's programs. 
I am particularly pleased that the committee accepted an amendment that I offered regarding the Small Business Development Center [SBDC] Program. The SBDC Program is a public-private partnership that leverages Federal dollars with State, local, university, and private resources to provide one-stop management and technical assistance to small businesses. 
My amendment increases the SBDC minimum Federal contribution so that no State will receive less than $500,000. This will ensure that small State SBDC's will continue to be able to provide quality business management assistance, which is essential to the future successes of America's small businesses. If entrepreneurs are not sufficiently prepared with the financial, managerial, and technical knowledge needed to own and operate a business, then our Nation's future businesses have failed before 
they have been given the opportunity to succeed. 
One of the many reasons I support the SBDC program is because it serves as a successful example of what can be achieved when the private sector, the educational community and Federal, State and local governments work together. In fact, the SBDC program generates more in tax revenues that it costs to run the program itself. For example, in my home State of Maine, $6.15 in new Federal, State and local tax revenues is generated for every $1.00 invested in our state's SBDC. Nationally, the return is $4.53. 
While my amendment provides only a modest funding increase at the Federal level, the additional resources provided to a small State like Maine will have a disproportionately large and positive impact on Maine's economy. And I thank Chairman Bond for including my amendment in the Small Business Reauthorization Act. 
I would also like to thank Chairman Bond for his leadership on S. 208, the HUBZone Act of 1997, because the revitalization and community development of economically distressed regions with significant unemployment is a critical challenge confronting this Congress. It is essential that we discover ways to stimulate business and residential activity within these economically and socially distressed communities, which is why I believe that it is so important that the HUBZone Act was incorporated into the Small Business Reauthorization Act. 
The HUBZone Act will provide Federal contracting opportunities to small businesses located in historically impoverished urban and rural areas known as HUBZones. This bill will create a new class of small businesses that employ at least 35 percent of its workforce from a HUBZone eligible for Federal Government contract preferences. The purpose of the bill is to create incentives for small businesses to locate and operate in our country's most economically disadvantaged inner-cities and rural counties. At the same time, these businesses will foster job creation and community development in these economically underutilized areas. 
In Maine, Washington County with an extremely high unemployment rate of 12.5 percent--7.6 percent above the national average--will qualify as a HUBZone. Qualified small businesses located in this county will not only receive Federal contracting set-asides but also will play a vital role in revitalizing this distressed area by encouraging job creation. 
Additionally, because of an amendment Senator Enzi and I offered, both Aroostook and Somerset Counties with a 10.4 percent and 9 percent unemployment, respectively, will qualify as rural HUBZones. The Enzi-Snowe amendment establishes that economically distressed regions with extremely high unemployment rates will quality as HUBZones and receive much-needed relief. We must take action to stimulate business activity within these areas that face high unemployment rates and I believe that the HUBZone Act of 1997 does just this. 
The Small Business Reauthorization Act also includes another important piece of legislation, the Welfare-to-Work Microloan Pilot Program Act of 1997, of which I am an original cosponsor. This innovative pilot program will provide grants to community-based organizations, known as Microloan intermediaries, to help welfare recipients start their own small businesses. These intermediaries will provide technical assistance to potential small entrepreneurs who are on public assistance. 
This program is unique because it will provide up-front business assistance before a participant receives a loan. The future entrepreneur will learn basic business skills--how to develop a business plan, start a business and apply for small loans. 
In addition to this technical assistance, program participants will receive assistance with the high cost of child care and transportation, both of which are directly related to program participation. If a mother is unable to afford to put her child in day care or if she does not have the money to get to the training sessions, she simply will not go. 
The combination of business training and child care and transportation assistance will assure greater success for the participants receiving public assistance. This approach has been successfully piloted in several state programs. Iowa, for example, has a success rate of 70 percent in contrast to a national small business failure rate average of 80 percent. I believe that these programs are successful because they target the true cause of the high failure rate of small businesses--lack of business education. 
Small businesses are playing an increasingly important role in America's future prosperity, and they should play a vital role in any effort to revitalize our urban and rural communities and to solve the long-term problem of getting individuals off, and keeping them off, public assistance. This is exactly why I am a cosponsor of the HUBZone Act and an original cosponsor of the Welfare-to-Work Microloan Pilot Program. And, that is why I strongly support the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 and encourage my distinguished colleagues to join me in supporting this critically important bill.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by the junior Senator from Illinois. This amendment would repeal a provision that was inserted in the recently enacted Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 at the last minute that could potentially reduce the cost to tobacco companies of the proposed global settlement of tobacco litigation. 
Mr. President, as my colleagues are aware, a global settlement on tobacco litigation was announced on June 20. This settlement would resolve lawsuits brought by 40 States against the tobacco industry that sought to recoup State Medicaid spending for smoking related illnesses. 
Under the terms of the settlement, the industry would pay an estimated $386 billion over the next 25 years to compensate State and individuals for tobacco-related health costs and to finance nationwide antismoking programs. The settlement would further restrict the advertising of tobacco products and impose new labeling requirements on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. At the same time, the tobacco industry would gain closure to the State lawsuits, and protect the industry from all but individual lawsuits in the future. 
Mr. President, in light of this proposed agreement, I was very disappointed that a provision was included in the recently enacted tax cut package that would potentially reduce the cost to the tobacco industry of their proposed settlement. Specifically, the provision--which was agreed to by the administration and congressional negotiators at the last minute--would allow the tobacco industry to treat the excise tax on tobacco products as a credit against their proposed $368 billion payment, assuming that the settlement is codified. Although the enactment of that settlement is far from certain, the value of this potential credit is estimated to be $50 billion over 25 years. 
Mr. President, regardless of whether or not Congress and the President ultimately enact, modify, or reject the proposed tobacco settlement, I do not believe that the already-enacted Federal excise tax on tobacco products--which is paid by consumers and is intended to help provide health insurance for uninsured children--should potentially become a downpayment by the industry on their proposed settlement. The fact that the Clinton administration and congressional negotiators agreed to include this provision at the last minute does not mean it should remain in law indefinitely--so I have cosponsored the Durbin amendment to repeal this provision. 
Mr. President, I regret that this provision was inserted in the tax agreement without providing the House and Senate with an opportunity for consideration. As my colleagues will remember all too well, the negotiated tax package was a take-it-or-leave-it proposition: Members were unable to remove this or any other specific provision without taking the risk that the entire agreement would unravel and be killed. 
Fortunately, we now have the opportunity to consider this provision independent of the broader tax agreement, and I would urge that my colleagues vote to repeal this settlement-reducing provision by supporting the Durbin amendment.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to join my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, to introduce the Child Care Access Means Parents in School Act [CAMPUS Act]. Senator Dodd and I have worked together to ensure access to quality child care, and this bill represents the next step in our shared commitment to this important issue. I am also pleased Senator Kennedy  has joined us as a cosponsor of this legislation, which provides grants to colleges in order to provide child care for low-income students. 
Mr. President, this is the time of year when countless American students return to college. At this time, we should remind ourselves that many Americans face obstacles that prevent them from participating in higher education. The absence of affordable and accessible child care is, unfortunately, one such obstacle. 
For many parents with young children, the availability of oncampus child care services is central to their ability to attend college. Campus-based child care is conveniently located, available at the hours that fit students' schedules and often available at a lower cost than community-based child care centers. Student parents rate access to campus-based child care as an important factor affecting their college enrollment. Unfortunately, such services are often in very short supply, particularly for low-income parents who may find the cost of existing services prohibitive. 
Moreover, in order to meet the high demand for child care created by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, States may divert funds away from programs currently providing campus-based child care services for low-income students and use the funds to provide child care to welfare recipients, because educational activities do not count as work under the act. This may leave students with less access to child care services. If we want to fulfill the goals of the welfare reform act and ensure that families are able to remain financially self-sufficient, we need to ensure that low-income parents have access to higher education and affordable and convenient child care. This is crucial given that people who receive public assistance and then complete college are far more likely to leave welfare permanently than those who do not. 
There is no question that a person's earning potential increases dramatically with a college degree. According to the Census Bureau, in 1990 the average income for high school graduates was almost $18,000. Those who had 1 to 3 years of college education, however, earned an average of $24,000. And those who graduated from college received an average salary of $31,000. 
Higher education is crucial to getting a job in today's global job market. More than half of the new jobs that have been and will be created between 1995 and 2000 will require education beyond high school. While nearly 40 percent of American jobs are currently in low-skill occupations, only 27 percent will fall in that category by the year 2000. Over the same period, high-skill occupations will grow from 24 to 41 percent of the work force. Getting the skills necessary to meet these market demands simply requires higher and higher levels of educational achievement. 
For many low-income students who are parents, the availability of campus-based child care is key to their ability to receive a higher education and thus achieve the American dream. Student parents are more likely to remain in school, and to graduate sooner and at a higher rate if they have campus-based child care. Child care services are particularly critical for older students who choose to go back to school to get their degree or to improve their skills through advanced education. This is especially important in today's economy where people need to continuously train and retrain in order to meet the demands of high-technology jobs. 
Children placed in campus-based child care also reap numerous benefits, given its very high quality. In fact, children in high-quality child care exhibit higher earnings as adults, higher rates of secondary school graduation, lower rates of teen pregnancy, and a reduced need for special education or costly social services. We also know that quality child care is cost efficient--the public saves $7 for every $1 invested in child care. 
The bill we are introducing today will help bring the American dream within the reach of numerous American parents who need child care in order to attend college. The CAMPUS Act will amend title IV of the Higher Education Act to help provide campus-based child care to low-income parents seeking a college degree. Under the bill, the Secretary of Education will award 3-year grants to institutions of higher education to support or help establish a campus-based child care program serving the needs of low-income student parents. The Secretary will award $60 million in grants--equal to 1 percent of total Pell grant funding--based on an application submitted by the institution, and the grant amount will be linked to the institution's Pell grant funding level. 
Under the bill, Pell grant recipients will be eligible for child care, to ensure that services target low-income students. In 1995-96, there were approximately 3.6 million Pell grant recipients, and almost 17,000 Maine residents received Pell grants. Students typically qualify for Pell grants if their income is under $30,000 per year. This bill will make a true difference in the lives of many low-income students who need child care to attend school. 
I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation which will truly make a difference in the lives of numerous American parents who wish to attend college.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Kyl amendment to the fiscal 1998 Labor, Health and Education appropriations bill, which would devastate an already underfunded Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Although I am a strong supporter of the Pell Grant Program, which provides critical assistance and access for needy students, I cannot support the Kyl amendment, knowing that it will reduce the low-income fuel assistance limited funding. 
I regret the Senator from Arizona has offered this amendment to reduce the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program in order to provide an increase to the Pell Grant Program. I hope we can follow the House lead in this regard, by providing an increase in the Pell Grant Program but without affecting the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. The bottom line is LIHEAP provides invaluable assistance to low-income and elderly households in America that must not be sacrificed. Make no mistake about it, this means-tested program is specifically targeted to those who already are in desperate need of financial assistance. To be precise, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, more than two-thirds of the households receiving Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program assistance have annual incomes of less than $8,000 a year, and more than half have incomes below $6,000 a year. 
While I believe that all programs must be asked to contribute their fair share in our efforts to balance the budget, it is worth noting that the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program has already taken more than its fair share of budget cuts in recent years. Overall, the funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program has fallen consistently and dramatically since 1985. In fiscal year 1985, the program received $2.1 billion. This year, it will receive $1 billion. In real terms, this represents a cut of more than 65 percent. Yet, despite this dramatic cut, the Senator from Arizona is proposing we further reduce this critically important but limited low-income assistance funding by an additional $528 million, or 53 percent of its already paltry budget. 
Furthermore, we should not be proposing a cut to a program that is already woefully underfunded and serves only a minority of its eligible recipients. Because of past spending cuts, LIHEAP now provides benefits to only 20 percent of all eligible households. This means that 80 percent of America's households meet the income qualifications to receive benefits, but there is simply not enough money to provide assistance to them all. Needless to say, this proposed $528 million reduction represents a very real risk of keeping many low-income families from being able to heat their homes in the winters ahead, even as it eviscerates a program that has already contributed more than its fair share to deficit reduction. 
It is also worth noting that even for those families that do receive Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program benefits, it is not a very high sum. In my home State of Maine, the average benefit last year was $308. In the midst of a severely cold winter, that $308 was the only way that 33,000 low-income and elderly Mainers were able to heat their homes. So, although a $528 million reduction may seem small in the overall budget of the U.S. Government, and $308 may not sound like much to many people, it means a great deal to the residents of my State who do not want to be forced this winter into the position of choosing between heat and food. 
The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program has already taken more than its fair share of reductions since its inception back in 1981, and simply cannot afford any further reductions in this very critical program. Any additional cut in this already underfunded program represents a very serious risk to low-income and elderly households in my State of Maine and all the cold weather regions of this country that rely on this very important, essential program. 
Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the Kyl amendment and adopting the approach that has been taken by the House that provides for increased support for the Pell Grant Program but without reducing LIHEAP that is so critical to many people in my State and so many other States who are located in cold weather areas of our country. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, in the introduction of the Oceans Act of 1997. This bill will establish a commission like the Stratton Commission of 1966 to review the many ocean and coastal issues facing the United States, and to develop a comprehensive, coordinated, national ocean, and coastal policy. 
Prior to introduction, I raised a few concerns with Senator Hollings on some provisions of the draft bill. Basically, I had recommended some language that made it clear that as we develop a new ocean and coastal policy for the Nation, we keep in mind the facts that our fiscal resources are limited, and that our Federal investments in ocean and coastal resources must be spent efficiently and wisely. I also raised some concerns about the fact that the original draft had the President appointing all of the members of this important commission. 
Mr. President, Senator Hollings has graciously agreed to make some changes to the bill pursuant to my recommendations. For instance, the bill now authorizes the Congress to appoint more than half of the Commission members, and the Commission is directed to identify opportunities to reform Federal ocean programs to improve efficiency and effectiveness. I commend Senator Hollings for his willingness to work with me and other Republican Senators before introduction of the bill. After introduction, I look forward to working with the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, a Senator who worked on the original Stratton Commission bill 30 years ago and who is a true champion of ocean protection, in the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee on any further refinements along these lines that might be constructive. 
Again, I thank Senator Hollings and commend him upon introduction of this bill.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the American people are suffering a crisis of confidence when it comes to the way in which campaigns for Federal office are financed. They no longer feel that they are in control of who gets elected, or that those who do get elected are fully accountable. Today, I am introducing a bill that will restore Americans' confidence in their elected officials, and put elections back into the hands of average citizens. 
Last year, for the first time since coming to Congress, I had the opportunity to watch Federal elections not as a candidate, but as a citizen and a voter. And what I saw confirmed all the reasons I have been a longtime proponent of campaign finance reform. What I saw was vast sums of money and very little accountability. I saw attack ads paid for with unlimited funds by out-of-State groups. And I saw contributions from PAC's to Federal candidates climb 12 percent higher than the record levels reached in the 1993-1994 election cycle. 
And the 1996 elections were barely over when allegations of illegal and improper activities began flying, centered around the issues of so-called soft money and foreign influence peddling through campaign contributions. Subpoenas are being issued at a faster pace than Ken Griffey, Jr., hits home runs, and while it remains to be seen what the results of congressional investigations will yield, it is clear that these latest scandals only serve to further undermine public confidence and underscore the importance of enacting meaningful and achievable campaign finance reform this year. 
It has often been said that perception is nine-tenths of reality, and I believe this is the case with campaign financing. I happen to believe that most elected officials are good people trying to do the people's business with America's interests at heart. At the same time, as in any walk of life, there are some people who abuse the system. And if there is even the perception that elections are being bought and sold, then the problem is serious and real--and the solution must be likewise. 
And make no mistake, there is a pervasive perception that the system is out of hand and in need of fixing. A poll taken last year by a major newspaper in my home State, the Maine Sunday Telegram, showed that over 70 percent of respondents believe politicians listen more to special interests than to individual voters. Findings like this are endemic of a deep systemic problem, one that we cannot afford to ignore any longer. 
I have voted for major changes in the campaign finance system throughout my career and introduced measures that I felt would make real and positive changes. Today, I am introducing the Restoration of America's Confidence in Elections Act, a comprehensive but realistic approach to fixing our broken system. 
One of the chief aims of my bill is to increase the impact of the small, individual contributor in election campaigns so that we place the campaign process in the hands of average Americans--rather than in the hands of special interests. My bill will lower the amount of money a PAC could contribute from $5,000 to the limit for individual contributors, $1,000--a change which 70 percent of respondents to a recent New York Times poll say they support. It will also encourage small, individual contributors from a candidate's home State to participate by providing the incentive of a tax credit in the amount of the contribution, up to $100 for an individual or $200 in the case of a joint return. 
Soft money has also become a major issue, and for good reason. It is money that skirts the intent of the law, and unaccounted for money which influences Federal campaigns above and beyond legal limits. My bill will close the soft money loophole by prohibiting national parties from raising or spending any soft money on behalf of any Federal candidates--and State parties could only spend hard money on behalf of Federal candidates. In order to keep parties healthy, individuals could contribute up to an aggregate amount of $20,000 to State party grassroots funds, and the existing limits on aggregate contributions to national parties by individuals and PAC's would be raised by $5,000 each. In that way, money is accounted for, parties can remain viable, and the soft money chase is ended. 
My bill also addresses the issue of candidates facing independently wealthy opponents. As we all know, the amount of personal funds a candidate spends on his or her campaign cannot be constitutionally limited, but the playing field can and should be leveled. The perception that an individual of means can buy their way to the top of the American political arena certainly does nothing to inspire confidence in our Government. 
My bill would make it easier for a candidate facing a wealthy opponent to compete by allowing that candidate to raise the necessary funding through increased contribution limits, depending on the amount the wealthy candidate spends of his or her own money. It would also require candidates to declare the amount of personal money they intend to spend, and encourage them to stick to their pledge by requiring disclosure should they violate that pledge. 
Any successful campaign finance reform bill must address the realities of elections as we approach the new millennium. One of those realities is the so-called issue advocacy or voter education ads. We have all seen these ads: threatening music over provocative images blatantly designed to influence voters to vote against a candidate. But because these ads don't specifically say `vote against candidate X' there is currently no limit on how much can be spent on them, and no accountability. 
It is obvious to anyone the purpose of these ads: to skirt current campaign finance laws that require that ads designed to influence Federal elections be paid for with hard money, and disclosed to, and regulated by, the Federal Election Commission. Under my bill, the law would be changed in such a way to include these types of ads under hard money limits and disclosure requirements. This would help limit the attack ads and give the public the information they need about who is paying for these ads and how much they are spending. An informed electorate is the key to any democratic system of government, and my bill will give people the information they need to make up their own minds. 
My bill also includes provisions to protect individuals from having their money involuntarily collected and used for politics by a corporation or labor organization. These provisions mirror those of Senator Nickles' Paycheck Protection Act. This measure will require prior authorization from workers before a corporation, national bank, or labor union finances political activities with any money from dues or from payments made as a condition of employment. 
The legislation I am introducing will also close a conduit for campaign money that should have been closed a long time ago. It will ban contributions from all individuals not eligible to vote in U.S. elections. After all, if a person cannot legally participate in a Federal election by voting, why should they be able to participate with their wallet? 
And finally, my bill will close the loopholes and ambiguities that exist about soliciting Federal soft money from Federal buildings or with Federal equipment. Because I think everyone agrees that it is not appropriate to raise political funds with taxpayer-financed equipment, or from the very office that might have influence over the interests of the potential donor. 
These are all commonsense approaches to the problem--measures which I believe the majority of Americans feel are sensible and long overdue. The Restoration of Americans' Confidence in Elections Act addresses a range of issues and does so in a way that does not single out any one group, or any particular political affiliation. Because if we are to pass meaningful reform, it will require that we all take our hits. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this bill, and making a historic statement that the old ways of doing business must be relegated to the annals of history. Let's return elections to the American people--and let's restore confidence in our Government.

Ms. SNOWE. Mahi-mahi, for instance, a fish popular in white tablecloth restaurants in the United States, suffers far higher bycatch rates in log and school sets than in dolphin sets. Looking at blacktip sharks, we see a similar problem. The same is true for every other nondolphin species in the ETP. If you look at Mahi-mahi, you are talking about losing 30,000 Mahi-mahi fish for every 1,000 pounds of tuna caught in the eastern tropical pacific. 
Mr. President, the basic intent of the Panama Declaration and S. 39 is to lock the nations that fish in the ETP into a very strict conservation regime that will require them to continue the progress made to date and eventually reduce dolphin mortality to a level near zero. And it is also to recognize a fishing method that causes very little harm to dolphins, but which is also the safest possible fishing method for all of the other species that live in the ETP. 
Mr. President, as we know, some Senators have been concerned that dolphin setting may be causing unseen harm to dolphins, and they objected to the immediate change in the dolphin safe label contained in S. 39 as reported by the committee. The latest compromise that we all reached last week, and that is contained in the manager's amendment that was offered by Senator McCain. 
It requires the expeditious commencement of research to further study the effect of dolphin setting on dolphins. Tuna caught by dolphin sets may not be labeled dolphin safe until at least March 1999, at which time the Secretary of Commerce must review the preliminary results of the study, and make a determination as to whether or not dolphin setting is causing significant adverse impacts to depleted dolphin stocks in the ETP. If the Secretary finds no significant impact, then the label changes to permit tuna caught with dolphin sets to be labeled dolphin safe, as long as no dolphins were killed or seriously injured during harvest. 
Between July 1, 2001, and December 31, 2002, the Secretary will review the completed results of the study, and make another determination. If significant adverse impacts to dolphins are found at that time, he must prohibit the labeling of tuna caught with dolphin sets as dolphin safe. 
Mr. President, I think this compromise reasonably addresses the concerns on both sides, and it resolves what has been a very contentious issue. I urge my colleagues to support the manager's amendment to S. 39, and the bill as amended. 
I reserve the remainder of my time, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, may I ask how much time I have remaining?

Ms. SNOWE. Yes, the Senator is correct on that point. The Secretarial determinations to which you refer are included in S. 39 as an amendment to the Dolphin Consumer Protection Information Act. That act does not specify any alternative standard of review, and therefore the standard under the Administrative Procedures Act would apply. Furthermore, the bill managers intend that such standard will apply to the Secretarial findings in section 5 of S. 39. this standard involves a review of the administrative record, and a determination of whether the Secretary acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague and good friend, Senator Jeffords of Vermont, to introduce the Older Industrial Region Rail/Port Access and Modernization Act. 
There is an old Yankee saying `you can't get there from here'. If we do not take steps to upgrade our aging transportation infrastructure in order to allow us to be a vigorous competitor for the movement of goods, that saying may become a sad reality. That is why the bill we introduce today is so important to northern New England's future, because its purpose is to revitalize our aging rail infrastructure. As much as rail is a part of our Nation's history, it is also the pathway to a bright economic future. 
The bill, which covers Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, will provide funding for improving and modernizing our freight rail system--removing obstacles like low bridges that constrict the use of double-stack trains, and intermodal facilities construction and maintenance. It would also provide funding to assist Maine's ports in updating and modernizing their facilities and rail transport access. This upgrading is particularly important as studies have shown that Maine's ports are losing business to southern ports because of inadequate rail transport and access. 
Under the bill, an 80/20 Federal/State share grant program would be created. The States could use this money for first, connecting all railroads to ports; second, removing, repairing or replacing bridges or other obstructions that inhibit the use of double-stack rail cars; third, repairing, upgrading and purchasing railbeds and tracks and fourth, constructing, operating and maintaining intermodal truck-train transfer facilities and train maintenance facilities. 
Intermodalism is the future, as we have seen from the success of ISTEA. I have seen it at the intermodal facility in my hometown of Auburn, ME. Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater visited the facility earlier this year with me and other members of the Maine delegation. After the visit, he told me that Auburn was a model facility that he would use in his travels as an example of how well the concept works when done correctly. Our bill will provide States with the flexibility to encourage new facilities and to upgrade current ones. It will provide our businesses with better, faster, more cost effective access to out of State markets and it will increase the viability of our three ports--Portland, Eastport, and Mack Point--by making them more attractive options for shipping and receiving goods. 
More important is the basic fact that a modern transportation system is vital to any economic development. Our bill will allow the northern New England States to upgrade their aging infrastructure to ensure that we do not allow future economic development and growth to slip away because we cannot meet the transportation needs of business and industry in the coming years.

Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair. I rise to express my support for the agreement that ultimately was reached on this very important issue. I remind my colleagues that this was an issue that had been introduced in the last Congress by the Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and unfortunately, we weren't able to get it through in the last Congress, for a lot of political reasons. I hope now that people recognize that this represents a very strong step toward preservation and conservation of the species and, at the same time, an important agreement with 11 other nations on this issue, which I think ultimately will resolve the problems that we are facing with respect to tuna, as well as with dolphins. 
So I hope that our colleagues will ultimately support this agreement. I want to commend Senator McCain, who certainly forged an effort to try to create this, as well as Senator Boxer and Senator Kerry. Truly, the leadership was exemplified by Senator Stevens and Senator Breaux, who originally introduced this legislation in the last Congress. So I hope that we will take the steps necessary to implement this legislation and, ultimately, will ratify the agreement that was reached by this administration with respect to this issue.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, and the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Gregg, today to discuss an issue of utmost importance to Aroostook County, the Caribou Weather Service Office. 
The bill before us requires the National Weather Service [NWS] to consult with the subcommittee before making any reprogramming requests in relation to the top-to-bottom review that is currently underway. As part of their review, NWS will consider whether the Caribou Weather Service Office should be upgraded to a weather forecasting office. 
Under the National Weather Service's modernization plan, a weather forecasting office will have Doppler radar. The Doppler radar would give Caribou the ability to forecast warnings for sudden and severe changing weather patterns so that the communities the weather station serves will be able to respond quickly. At the present time, the nearest Doppler radar is in Gray, ME, more than 200 miles away. This is too far away to be of immediate help to Aroostook County. 
Aroostook County is one of the largest counties in the United States--the size of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined--and its economy is dominated by agriculture, trucking, and forest products industries, all of which rely heavily on timely and accurate weather information. The Caribou station provides vital information on a daily basis to northern Maine communities that must deal with a wide range of weather patterns from bitter cold and snow to severe thunderstorms and flooding. An upgrade from a weather service office to a weather forecasting office would improve the weather forecasting abilities of the Caribou station, thereby improving the ability of the affected towns to react to sudden and severe weather changes. 
Once the NWS has completed its review, I look forward to working with Chairman Gregg and the subcommittee to ensure that the recommended changes are funded in an expeditious manner.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, on Monday, July 14, 1997, I offered an amendment to the fiscal year 1998 Department of Defense appropriations bill which specifically appropriated funds for a program of basic research in the area of chemical and biological defenses. I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, and the ranking minority member, Senator Inouye, for accepting this very important amendment. 
This chemical and biological sensor research program was specifically authorized in the Defense authorization bill which was overwhelmingly passed by the Senate last week. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended, and the Senate approved, an increase of $2 million in research and development funding for a joint service program to develop a prototype hybrid integrated sensor array for chemical and biological point detection. 
The Senate Armed Services Committee's intent was to accelerate the development of small sensors which would detect, in real time, the presence of chemical or biological agents. These sensors would be based on metal oxide and biochemical film technologies. In its report, the Senate Armed Services Committee emphasized its support for this program and for expanding the knowledge in military relevant fields of chemical and biological research. Our soldiers in the field need this technology to protect them from the possible threat presented by chemical and biological agents. 
Mr. President, I have reviewed the fiscal year 1998 Department of Defense appropriations bill which we are considering here in the Senate, and it is unclear as to whether the funding for this program, which was included in the Defense authorization bill, has sufficient appropriations. My intent, with this amendment, is to make clear that this bill appropriates funds for this very important program. 
Mr. President, the threat from chemical and biological weapons that faces our Nation's troops is very real and very dangerous. During the Persian Gulf war, we witnessed just how dangerous the threat of chemical and biological weapons was during that crisis and how this threat continues today. 
We must also consider the fact that chemical and biological weapons may also be a potential weapon of choice for use by terrorists. Continued research and development in the area of sensor development must continue in this field to counter these very real threats. 
There is an urgent need to have effective chemical and biological weapon sensors that can detect the presence of these weapons in real-time or near-real-time. The Department of Defense needs to rapidly develop these kinds of sensors, and that is the intent of this amendment. 
This amendment does not seek to go beyond the authorized funding amount. It seeks merely to insure that the program which the Senate has voted to authorize is fully funded in this bill. I thank my colleagues for their support of this amendment.

Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the leader. 
I would like to comment on this issue because I think it is critically important, as chair of the Ocean and Fisheries Subcommittee. The fact is, the administration has requested that this issue be addressed expeditiously because of the agreement that we have entered into with 11 other countries. 
Second, we attempted to work with Senator Kerry and others on the committee for a compromise on this issue. To no avail, I 
might add. But irrespective of that, we incorporated a number of changes in the legislation that were recommended by Senator Kerry and others that I think makes substantial progress on the issues that have been raised by the Senator from California and others. But there is a point at which it contravenes the agreement that had been reached between the United States and these other countries. 
I hope we will have a chance to resolve these issues and to work on it, but we have to have good-faith efforts on the other side in order to resolve these issues without compromising the agreement. 
I should also mention there are a number of environmental conservation groups that are endorsing this agreement because they think this is the best way to protect not only dolphin and tuna but other species that have been affected because of the status quo and because of the current law. 
I should add other methods have affected the byproduct of other species to the detriment of a significant number of different fish that otherwise will continue to go on in this effort if we do not change it with this agreement. 
So I hope that the Senator from California will work in a good-faith effort to reach an agreement on this issue. Otherwise, it will be lost. 
I would also ask the President to work very vigorously. If he wants this legislation to come through, I think he certainly has to work to make sure that it does.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this amendment will address concerns that we have discussed here on the floor regarding the Base Realignment and Closure [BRAC] process. 
Before the Congress ever considers to authorize future BRAC commissions--a process which I strongly oppose, we should take a more detailed look at whether those elusive savings from infrastructure reductions will ever be achieved. That is what I accomplish by the amendment which I offer today. 
Mr. President, I have consistently asked what has happened to savings from the past four BRAC actions. The Pentagon estimated savings from the four previous base closing rounds to reach $57 billion over a 20-year period with annualized savings of $5.6 billion per year starting in 2001. In its April 1995 report, the GAO estimate for such savings projects the savings at less than half these numbers. GAO estimates that the 20-year savings may be $17.3 billion, with annual recurring savings possibly reaching $1.8 billion. 
Mr. President, GAO conducted further analysis and issued a following report in a April 1996. In this report, GAO found that the total amount of actual savings that may be estimated from BRAC actions is uncertain for several reasons. One of which is that DOD accounting systems do not provide adequate information or isolate their impact from that of other DOD initiatives. 
Despite the fact that DOD has complied with legislative requirements for submitting annual cost and savings estimates, the GAO further states that the estimates' usefulness is limited because the estimates are not budget quality, and that the inclusion of the estimates of reduced personnel costs by all the services are not uniform and further, the GAO determined that certain community assistance costs were excluded. 
In one example, GAO identified the fact that DOD BRAC cost estimates excluded more than $781 million in economic assistance to local communities as well as other costs. 
Mr. President, in its December 1996 report, CBO stated that it was unable to confirm or assess DOD's estimates of cost savings because the DOD is unable to report actual spending and savings from BRAC actions. 
So now Mr. President, we have the Pentagon, the GAO, and CBO with differing estimates on what has actually happened and what is supposed to happen as a result of the four previous BRAC rounds. There is no consensus on the numbers--and that is a significant problem. It seems everybody has a different number on the issue, and there are numerous inconsistencies on the estimates of what the savings are supposed to be. And the Congress has been assured that starting in the year 2001, the savings may in fact be realized. I question that assurance Mr. President, because I do not think we know what they will be. But what we do know now, is that any savings from the past four base closure rounds have yet to be realized. 
Mr. President, the intent of DOD to streamline its infrastructure cost is not lost on us. We must recognize that the need to fill the projected $17 billion gap between projected procurement funding and the procurement 
funding objective of $60 billion. Mr. President, throughout this year's DOD authorization process, the Congress has heard testimony from the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the respective service chiefs and service secretaries, and to a person, each has testified on the importance of modernizing our military forces for the 21st century. But Mr. President, that just is not happening. 
Mr. President, the projections for national defense outlays decrease 34.4 percent over the period from 1990 to 2002. We have all seen the downward pressure on defense spending. Yet the future years defense plan [FYDP] calls for a 40-percent increase in the military's modernization budget within the confines of an overall defense budget that will more likely be flat at best. We have seen procurement funding plummet from $54 billion in 1990 to today's level of just over $42 billion.

Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I want to thank the Senator from Washington for taking the initiative and leadership in offering this amendment to the DOD authorization bill because it is a very important issue. I remind this body that we voted to repeal this ban on abortions in military hospitals overseas last year, and I hope my colleagues would do the same again this year. 
Mr. President, year after year, debate after debate, Congress revisits the issues concerning women's reproductive freedoms by seeking to restrict, limit, and eliminate a woman's right to choose. This ban on abortions in overseas military hospitals, reinstated last year, represents just more of the same. 
I point out that these efforts to turn back the clock on women's reproductive rights will never erase the fact that the highest Court in the land reaffirmed, time after time, in decision after decision, a woman's fundamental right to a safe and legal abortion. 
This whole issue of banning abortions in overseas military hospitals represents another frontal assault on a woman's right to choose. It also represents a frontal assault on a woman's dignity. This ban denies a woman's right to choose for female military personnel and their dependents. It denies those women, who have voluntarily decided to serve their country in the Armed Forces, a safe and legal medical procedure. Because they were assigned to duty in other countries, it denies them equal protection under the law. What kind of reward is that for a woman who has made a decision to serve her country but denying her the rights that are guaranteed to her under the Constitution? 
It certainly didn't occur to me that women's constitutional rights were territorial. It certainly didn't occur to me that American women, when they go abroad serving our country, are leaving their constitutional rights behind. Between 1979 and 1988, women could use their own personal funds to pay for the medical care that they needed. And in 1988, we know that the Reagan administration announced a new policy prohibiting the performance of any abortions at military hospitals--even if that procedure was paid for by a woman's personal funds. 
In January 1993, President Clinton issued an Executive order removing that prohibition. But the point is that that Executive order did not change existing law in prohibiting the use of Federal funds to pay for that procedure. That is the issue here today. The issue isn't whether or not we are going to use Federal funds for abortions in overseas military hospitals; it is a question of whether or not a woman is entitled to have access to a safe, legal, and constitutional medical procedure with the use of her own personal funds. 
Removing this ban doesn't require medical providers to perform abortions. All three branches of Government have a conscience clause. It would not require medical personnel to perform that procedure if they have moral, religious, or ethical objections to doing so, and that is reasonable. But the ban prohibiting women from having access to the right to choose with her own personal funds is creating a level of substandard care. 
What kind of choice does a woman have who is serving her country overseas? What are her choices? To fly back to the United States? Well, we know the cost involved, let alone whether or not she would have the time in order to do so. She could possibly endanger her own health by seeking care in some of the foreign hospitals, whose quality of care cannot compare to ours. That is why we have our own separate medical facilities on military installations abroad. That is the whole point: to ensure that our military personnel have the best quality care available that they are entitled to and indeed that they deserve. Or we could require a woman to fly to another country to receive care. But the bottom line is that what we are imposing on a woman who serves in the military are some very dangerous and stark choices. 
Mr. President, the Supreme Court, in 1992, in a case called Planned Parenthood versus Casey, said that the Government regulation of abortion may not constitute an undue burden on the right to choose. An undue burden is defined as having the `purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion.' When you consider the hurdles that a military woman seeking abortion faces--lengthy travel, serious delay, high cost to fly home, or elsewhere, substandard medical care and options--there is no doubt that this ban unconstitutionally places an undue burden on a woman's right to choose; but, most important, prohibiting women from using their own funds to obtain abortion services at overseas military hospitals endangers their health. That is the jeopardy in which we are placing women, because in being stationed overseas there are often areas where local facilities are inadequate or provide substandard care and just do not meet the standards that our medical facilities do. That is the purpose of having them there. 
So this isn't a question of funding, it's a question of fairness, it's a question of whether or not the Government is going to dictate the kind of care a woman and her family will have access to if they are serving abroad in the military. It is not an issue of pro-life versus pro-choice; it's a question of whether or not we are going to create a disparate and discriminatory policy when it comes to a woman using her own personal funds. That is what this debate is all about. 
It is an unprecedented intrusion on the part of Government to say how an individual can spend their private funds when it comes to a legal, constitutional medical procedure. 
The amendment that is offered by the Senator from Washington will ensure and, indeed, safeguard us from creating a two-tiered system in this country--one for a woman who reside in the United States and serves in the military and another for those women who choose to serve their country in the Armed Forces overseas. I hope that this body will reject the ban that is included in the DOD authorization and accept the amendment that has been offered here today by Senator Murray, because failure to do otherwise is punitive for American women and for their families. I hope that we will follow the example that we established in the last Congress by voting to repeal the ban. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the United States Air Force Reentry Vehicle Applications Program has been providing critical technologies required for the manufacture of reentry vehicles and components. Of special note is the meaningful program with both the prime and the sub-tier suppliers for the Mark 21 reentry vehicle. Funding for this program has advanced reentry vehicle technologies while sustaining the critical industrial base required to develop such technologies.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I fully agree with my colleague, Senator Smith, and most strongly agree with his view on the Reentry Vehicle Application Program. Unfortunately, quantitative data to support such cost and performance tradeoffs are not always readily available. This information is especially important as the Congress considers funding for this and other programs. I am concerned that sufficient emphasis is not being placed on this critical program to sustain the technology base to conduct advance material studies which will sustain key technical staff, as well as fabrication capabilities and technologies.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this body has few greater responsibilities than maintaining the effectiveness and accountability of our Nation's Armed Forces. This is one of the reasons that reports of widespread sexual harassment in our Nation's military deeply concerns us all. With Department of Defense statistics showing that sexual harassment is prevalent throughout the Armed Forces--we must do more than pay lip service to the problem. Mr. President, we must act. 
Today, with a full understanding that the time has come for serious action that is responsible and constructive, a provision that I authored was added to the 1998 defense authorization bill that will place us on the road to solving the crisis of sexual harassment. The legislation attacks the root of the problem--the lack of accountability when it comes to reporting and investigating incidents of sexual harassment. 
The Department of Defense conducted a survey in 1988 and found that 64 percent of women reported that they had experienced one or more incidents of sexual harassment in the 12 months preceding the survey. The Defense Department conducted another study in 1995 and found that the figure had only improved to 55 percent. I feel very strongly, Mr. President, that this is not progress. When I look at those statistics, I am shocked. 
On top of this, I have read in DOD statements that many cases of sexual harassment go unreported. In the 1995 Defense Department survey, only 24 percent of the victims chose to report their sexual harassment experiences. Is this the kind of environment to which we should subject our people? These numbers tell me that women essentially stand a 50-50 chance of being harassed. This cannot and should not be tolerated. Add to that the fact that over three-fourths of our people do not feel they can report the harassment that occurs and you have a very negative set of circumstances. How can you maintain good order and discipline in such an environment? This situation demands accountability. And it requires action to erase any perception that sexual harassment is tolerated in today's Armed Forces. Today, military members do not believe they can report sexual harassment and have their claims taken seriously. 
During Armed Services Committee markup of the defense authorization bill, I offered an amendment that requires the unit commander to report each and every sexual harassment incident to their next senior officer within 72 hours. Once reported, the unit commander appoints an investigating officer to investigate the complaint of sexual harassment. The unit commander has 14 days to report back to their commander with the results of the investigation. If the unit commander cannot complete the investigation within 14 days, that commander must report the interim results, every 14 days, until the investigation has been completed. 
Today when an incident is reported to a unit commander, the commander is not required to report the incident until a preliminary investigation recommends disciplinary action. This gives the unit commander tremendous latitude as to how the case is handled. In most instances this is a not a problem. But look what we saw at Aberdeen. We saw a company commander who was a bad apple and no bells or whistles to alert his superiors that there was a problem. Under the provisions of the national defense authorization bill each incident is immediately brought to the attention of a more senior officer. The most distinct advantage of this provision is that the decibel level of the problem rises by elevating the matter to the highest echelons of the services. 
The provision also requires that the senior officers who receive these reports of sexual harassment forward all the complaints they receive and the results of the investigations of those complaints to their respective Service Secretary by January 31 of each year, elevating the problem another notch within the military to the authors of the services' zero tolerance policies where they can be scrutinized. The Service Secretaries are then required to forward this information to the Secretary of Defense who in turn must report the information to Congress. 
Mr. President, this provision was unanimously approved by the Armed Services Committee and will put us on the road to help end sexual harassment in our military. We owe the men and women who serve our Nation an environment that includes accountability, good order, and discipline. But we also owe this to our Nation, which relies on our military to defend our great country and its interests.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, thank you. 
First of all, I would like to commend the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, and the ranking member, Senator Levin, for their tremendous efforts in bringing the Defense Department authorization bill to the floor. I certainly think they have taken a great deal of initiative and leadership in putting this legislation together. I appreciate their efforts in that regard. 
I certainly want to associate myself with the remarks made by the Senator from Kansas, Senator Roberts, on the amendment that has been offered by our colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain. It is an amendment that I certainly will oppose in proposing more rounds of military base closures and realignment. 
I am certain the committee rejected the call for new base closings, and the Senate should follow suit. 
As we all know, the administration has asked for two more rounds of base closings with the intent of realizing $2.8 billion per year in savings from these new BRAC rounds. The administration further stated that these estimated savings are to be used to meet the well-established requirements for $60 billion in procurement funding which is necessary to modernize our forces to meet the challenges of the 21st century. 
I have consistently asked the question as to exactly what has happened to the savings in the past four BRAC rounds that started in 1988. The Pentagon estimated the savings to occur from those four rounds to be in the area of $57 billion over the next 20 years with the annualized savings of upwards of $5.6 billion per year starting in the year 2001. In its April 1995 report, the GAO estimated that such savings projects their estimates at less than $17 billion over the next 20 years, past the number that had been projected by the Department of Defense, 
with annual recurring savings possibly being in the area of $1.8 billion in the year 2001. 
Mr. President, GAO conducted a further analysis and issued a following report in April 1996. In this report GAO found that the total amount of actual savings that may be estimated from the four previous BRAC rounds is uncertain, for a number of reasons, the primary of which, according to the GAO, is that the DOD accounting systems do not provide adequate information or isolate their impact from that of other DOD initiatives. 
Despite the fact that the DOD has complied with legislative requirements for submitting annual costs and savings estimates, the GAO further stated that the estimates' usefulness is limited because the estimates are not budget quality and that the inclusion of these estimates of reduced personnel costs by all of the services are not uniform and, further, the GAO determined that certain community assistance costs were excluded. In fact, in one example, GAO identified the fact that DOD BRAC cost estimates included more than $781 million in economic assistance to local communities as well as other costs. 
In December 1996, the Congressional Budget Office, in its report, stated that it was unable to confirm or accept DOD's estimates of cost savings because the DOD is unable to report actual spending and savings from BRAC action. 
So now we have the Pentagon, the GAO, and the Congressional Budget Office with differing estimates on what has actually been saved and what is supposed to happen as a result of these four BRAC rounds since 1988. There is no consensus on the numbers. That, indeed, in my opinion, is a significant problem, if we are to predicate future closings on these savings and estimated savings for the future. 
The fact is we are chasing an elusive infrastructure savings because there is no straight-line corollary between the size of our forces and the infrastructure required to meet two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts. The Department of Defense has even admitted to the GAO investigators that they do not have accounting systems in place to isolate the impact of specific initiatives such as BRAC. 
So, in fact, we have no comprehensive adjustment of the reduction of the infrastructure that has occurred as a result of the four previous rounds of base closings and the impact on munitions as well as our forces. In fact, when these base closing rounds were first initiated, one of the greatest concerns that I had was that they would underestimate the cost of savings and overestimate the savings to accomplish the base closings. 
Mr. President, the projections for national defense outlays decrease 34 percent over the period from 1990 to the year 2002. We have all seen the downward pressure in defense spending. In fact, we have seen a reduction of more than 40-percent in the defense budget since 1985. Future years' defense plans call for a 40 percent increase in the defense modernization budget within the confines of an overall defense budget that essentially will remain flat over the next few years. But yet, we have seen a procurement budget that has plummeted from $54 billion in 1990 to today's level of just over $42 billion. 
It is interesting, because in the same time that we are seeing a reduction in procurement, we have had four previous rounds of base closings. You might have thought that money would have been invested in the procurement budget, but, in fact, the contrary has happened because again the Department of Defense underestimated the cost that is required to close these bases and overestimated the savings. 
As of May 1997, the DOD has invested $14 billion in base closings. The total implementation costs of the four previous BRAC actions through 2001 are estimated at $23 billion. Through fiscal year 1996, the DOD estimates that it may have saved through cost avoidance approximately $10 billion. 
So, in simple terms, to date we have spent $14 billion to avoid costs of $10 billion. Yet, we are promised by the DOD that the savings is in the outyear savings--savings that even DOD's own budget analysts say they are not equipped to track. 
The promise for the outyears has been a recurring theme for the Pentagon over the last 4 years. How many times have each of us heard that the fix for the procurement account is in the outyears? And each year we see the administration's request for procurement steadily decline. In fact, in each of these 4 years since the Pentagon completed the Bottom-Up Review an investment in the procurement accounts has actually been postponed. 
The procurement request for 1998 is $42 billion, whereas the fiscal year 1995 program had projected reaching $54 billion by now. So we have not seen the funding promised, and the DOD cannot show it to us in its own budgets, and the reasons are obvious. The funding has migrated elsewhere. 
In its own Quadrennial Defense Review, the DOD said the $18 billion meant for procurement under the 1995 plan has disappeared. The QDR report tells us that the funding migrated to three places. First, it went to unprogrammed operating expenses such as contingency operations like Bosnia. The second place was unrealized savings from initiatives like outsourcing or business process reengineering which failed to achieve the objectives and expectations, similar to the failure to achieve the levels of savings expected in the previous four BRAC rounds. And the third, of course, was new program demands. 
The QDR stated national defense policy of shape-respond-prepare reinforces the fact that U.S. forces will conduct smaller scale contingency operations for peacetime engagement. These operations include, according to the report, intervention, limited strike, no-fly zone enforcement, peace enforcement, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief. The QDR further projects that U.S. involvement in the smaller scale contingency operations will increase over the next 20 years. 
So we can expect more and more peacekeeping operations, far beyond the traditional missions of peacekeeping operations, that are going to require more robust military requirements. The QDR cites the obvious problem that DOD has had with the constant migration of funds which were planned for procurement ending up in operation and support activities. This certainly has been the case in the last few years to pay for operations like Bosnia and other areas where we have developed peacekeeping operations. 
Since 1991, in over 39 separate contingency operations in Southwest Asia, Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda, et cetera, it is estimated that the taxpayers will pay over $17 billion for these operations. And as I illustrate in this chart here today, I think we can get an example of the multiple operations that the United States has been engaged in just in the decade of the 1990's. We know that in 1989 we spent less than $100 million in peacekeeping operations. In the decade of the 1990's alone we have spent the grand total of $17.2 billion and counting. 
We all know the administration has underestimated the costs of our participation in the forces in Bosnia, not to mention the length of time. It is estimated that we will spend upward of $6.8 to $7 billion until June 1998. My expectation is that we will have underestimated those costs as well. But we have spent a total of $17.2 billion in peacekeeping operations. That is an exorbitant price that we are now paying for unbudgeted, for the most part, operations and missions elsewhere--unanticipated and in most cases unbudgeted. The cost for Bosnia, as I said, has been over $7.2 billion, assuming we withdraw in June 1998. The cost for these operations have quadrupled--quadrupled--since 1991. The fact is the Department of Defense has been heavily taxed to meet these deployments. 
We know that of the $17.2 billion that will have been spent in contingency operations through June 1998, about $8 billion of this amount was reimbursed to the Department of Defense by Congress through supplementals. The Department of Defense, however, has also told us that $2.3 of the $17.2 billion total were service absorbed costs, funding that was taken directly out of procurement and other accounts to pay for these operations. 
Mr. President, I suspect that the remaining difference of almost $7 billion was siphoned from procurement accounts as well as the operations and readiness accounts to pay for these contingency operations. We have asked the Department of Defense for these figures and they cannot provide them. As of 1997, we readily know that we were facing over 2.5 billion dollars' worth of unfunded contingency operations and that required, as we know, a supplemental appropriation which we passed a couple of weeks ago. But we must ask the question, because it has been asked but it has not been answered, how many modernization programs got impacted as procurement dollars were siphoned from the modernization programs by the DOD comptroller to pay for these unprogrammed operations? It is obvious that this is a persistent problem. We know that we can expect more of the same. In fact, the QDR report that was issued by the administration, as I said previously, expects that small scale contingency operations will be high over the next 20 years, so that we literally cannot anticipate the numerous unbudgeted operations in which the United States will participate. 
The State Department did a compilation in 1995 of the voluntary contributions of the United States in 13 other countries to support U.N. peacekeeping operations. The United States provided for 54 percent of those costs--54 percent--11 other countries, NATO countries and Australia, 45 percent, and Japan less than 1 percent. 
So it is obvious and clearly apparent that the United States is assuming an enormous cost and burden for these 
peacekeeping operations. And as I also said earlier, these peacekeeping operations are not within the traditional operations as we have known them in the past where we are upholding and enforcing a cease-fire agreement that has been reached by two or more parties. These operations have gone beyond that to peace enforcement where we are imposing a peace on recalcitrant parties. That requires more military expertise, weaponry, and requirements on the part of our own military as we have seen not only in Somalia but, of course, as we have seen in Bosnia. 
The point of all of this is that what we are seeing happening in the Defense Department's budget is that more and more of the funds are being drawn from operations and the readiness account, indeed, from modernization, because even the administration has not been able to meet its own procurements modernization goal of $60 billion. The fact is a $17 billion gap in the modernization goal because that money is being drawn away into these operations. 
I believe that the pressure to come up with more base closing rounds is premised on the need to finance these operations; that we will see whatever savings we can achieve from base closings will not be realized in the modernization accounts. The fact is we have no guidance from the administration in terms of what the administration is apt to spend on base closings because we know there are enormous up-front costs just in the environmental cleanup arena alone, not to mention all the other costs associated with base closings that require up-front expenditures. So we do not have the costs nor the real savings realized in the future. And yet at the same time we are spending more and more of the Defense Department's immediate funds on these peacekeeping operations for which we have not been able to precisely project what the costs will be in the future. 
These missions have quadrupled since 1991. We can expect more of the same. And yet we do not have a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the four previous rounds. They have not been completed. They have not come through yet. And so the administration is now asking for two more rounds without even knowing what the previous rounds have exacted in terms of the impact on our forces, our mission, as well as our infrastructure. 
We know that once a base is closed, it is lost forever; it is irreplaceable, and yet we have had no thorough analysis done on what the impact will be for the future. I believe that the pressure for more base closing rounds from the administration is due to the fact that more of these dollars are being siphoned away from modernization and into peacekeeping operations. So we could have two more rounds, but we do not know what the savings will be, we do not know whether or not it is going to go into modernization, and we do not know what the impact will be on our forces as well as our mission. 
I believe we are relying on a flawed approach to achieve the savings from infrastructure reductions that have yet to be realized, and we are finding that the Defense Department is spending billions of dollars on contingency operations which have little or no relevance to our vital national interests, and yet we are willing to cut the heart out of our military infrastructure within our sovereign borders without fully evaluating the impact to our national defense. 
The fact is I believe that we are on a collision course with less than expected savings from base closings and an increased number of contingency operations that will result in a further degradation of our force readiness and it will delay much needed procurement. 
I realize that we are facing limited resources within the Defense Department's budget and within our own overall Federal budget, but we must also be concerned for our troops and our resources, that they are not overtaxed in support of these numerous contingency operations over which we obviously have had little control. We have to take a more judicious approach to the deployment of our forces in view of our constrained resources as well as protecting our vital national interests, not only for today but also for tomorrow. 
So I ask the Senate to reject the amendment that has been offered by the Senator from Arizona because I believe clearly that we have to begin a thorough examination of what has already transpired before we take any future actions that we will regret, and at the same time I hope that it will put some pressure on this administration to begin a thorough reexamination of the necessity of constantly deploying troops in areas that perhaps they should not be engaged. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to recognize a distinguished civil servant and new resident of the State of Maine. 
My colleagues know the value of having experienced, wise, and seasoned legislators in our midst to work through many of the difficult and complex issues we face on a daily basis. We can all appreciate the tremendous loss, therefore, at the Department of Agriculture when Associate Chief Dave Unger retires from his post at the Forest Service at the end of this month. 
Mr. Unger has 40 years of experience working with natural resource issues in the public arena. Most recently he has been second in command at the Forest Service, engaged in the management of the National Forest System, the Forest Service research priorities, State and private forestry programs, international forestry issues, and administrative responsibilities. As one of the most heavily forested States in the country, Maine has benefitted from his leadership through technical assistance to landowners, advanced wood products manufacturing technology from the research program, and recreational opportunities in our own corner of the White Mountain National Forest. 
In addition to serving as Associate Chief for the Forest Service, Mr. Unger was Deputy Assistant Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, Associate Chief for the Soil Conservation Service, executive vice president of the National Association of Conservation Districts, Director of the Pennsylvania State Soil and Water Commission, among other leadership posts in the natural resources and conservation arena. 
Recently, Mr. Unger was honored by the President of the United States with a Distinguished Executive Rank Award. In 1991, President Bush awarded him the Presidential Meritorious Executive Rank Award. He is a fellow of the Soil and Water Conservation Society and has been recognized by many other organizations for his contributions over a long and productive career helping farmers, conserving forests and protecting wildlife. 
I am also pleased to say that Mr. Unger has chosen one of the most beautiful places in the world to retire with his wife, Carolyn. He will become a permanent resident of Maine where I am sure our communities, farmers, foresters, and others will continue to reap the benefits of his illustrious career. I want to welcome the Ungers Downeast, congratulate Mr. Unger on a full and productive career, and wish them both the best in their retirement in Maine.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to note that this week we celebrate the 25th anniversary of title IX, landmark legislation that has played an enormous role in leveling the playing field--literally--for women in sports. I was also pleased last week to join my colleagues, Senator Moseley-Braun, Kennedy, and Mikulski, to mark this anniversary by introducing the Fair Play Act, legislation which will take the next important step in increasing educational and athletic opportunities for young women. 
There is no question that sports are just as important an activity for girls and women as they are for boys and men. Through sports, girls and women can get a feel for the positive competitive spirit which was, until recently, the almost exclusive property of boys and men. Women and girls who participate in sports develop self-confidence, dedication, a sense of team spirit, and an ability to work under pressure--traits which enhance all aspects of their lives. In fact, 80 percent of women identified as key leaders in Fortune 500 companies have sports backgrounds. 
When I was a young girl growing up, girls and women did not have much opportunity to participate in competitive athletics. But the enactment of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 changed all that, by requiring that women be afforded equitable opportunities to participate in high school and college athletics. Since title IX's enactment, women and girls across the Nation have met the challenge of participating in competitive sports in record numbers. Since 1972, the number of college women participating in competitive athletics has gone from fewer than 32,000 to over 110,000 in 1994-95. Before title IX, fewer than 300,000 high school girls played competitive sports. By 1996, that number had climbed to almost 2.4 million. 
Today, women across America are taking bats, lacrosse sticks, and javelins to the glass ceiling--shattering the myth that there are `men's' sports and there are `women's' sports. But a quarter-century after title IX's enactment, there is still much more to be done. According to a recent NCAA study, only 23 percent of all current college athletic budgets are allocated to women, and women receive only 38 percent of athletic scholarship dollars. Only 27 percent of funding spent to recruit new athletes target women. In high-school athletic competitions, there are two boys to every one girl participating. 
The Fair Play Act, which we introduced to mark the 25th anniversary of Title IX, is designed to strengthen this important legislation and therefore enhance women's athletic and educational opportunities. Under current law, colleges and universities are required to compile information about their men's and women's athletic programs, including participation rates, operating and recruitment budgets, the availability of scholarships, revenues generated from athletic programs, and coaches' salaries. They are required to update this information annually and make it available to prospective students and others upon request. Because there is no central repository for this information, however, it is difficult for students to obtain and evaluate it or put it into context. 
The Fair Play Act is designed to correct this by directing colleges and universities to send information they already collect on their men's and women's athletic programs to the Department of Education, and directs the department to publish an annual report and make this information widely available by distributing the annual report to high schools, and establishing a toll free number and a web site. This bill will give students and families access to the kind of information they need to make informed decisions about where to go to school, and will help the Department of Education enforce title IX compliance in the area of athletics. 
The first 25 years of title IX have been an enormous success. Now, it's time for us to help millions of other girls and women get off the bleachers, the sidelines, and the viewing stands and onto the fields, the pitchers' mounds, and the courts. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and look forward to seeing what the next 25 years hold for women's accomplishments in sports.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to reauthorize the National Sea Grant College Program. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Hollings, the ranking member on the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and by Senators Gregg, Kerry, Reed, Glenn, and Breaux. 
Since its establishment in 1966, the National Sea Grant College Program has provided an invaluable service to the citizens of our Nation, and particularly to those who depend on our Nation's coastal and marine resources. Sea Grant operates programs in concert with 29 academic institutions covering the entire marine coastline of the United States, the Great Lakes region, and Puerto Rico. It serves as a kind of cooperative research and extension program for States and localities with a direct interest in ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources. Sea Grant is unique in the breadth of its programs, bringing together the natural and social sciences as well as educational institutions, the private sector, and State and local governments. By facilitating these interactions across institutional boundaries, Sea Grant makes important contributions to the development of management programs that effectively address both resource conservation and the needs of communities who use these resources. 
In my home State of Maine, the decline in groundfish populations has had a devastating impact on the fishing community. The joint Maine/New Hampshire Sea Grant Program has supported research looking at the economic and social impacts of this decline, as well as biological investigations into the ecology of the fisheries. With the results of these studies, Maine has been able to mitigate some of the losses these citizens have suffered. Management programs have been adapted to better account for the needs of local residents and the vagaries of an ever-changing ocean. In all of their programs, Maine Sea Grant has consistently reinvested in local communities, providing knowledge and tools for working with the sea. 
I know from my colleagues that the work I have witnessed in Maine is representative of the quality work Sea Grant programs are doing across the country. The wealth of benefits Sea Grant provides comes from a small Federal investment. By requiring matching grants, State Sea Grant Programs use their partnerships with industry and academia to generate a high return on every Federal dollar expended. This investment, in turn, helps to stimulate industry productivity and increase the efficiency of coastal management programs. In these cost-conscious times, Sea Grant is a model of being able to do more with less. 
This legislation will allow Sea Grant to continue its work by reauthorizing the program for 3 years. It caps the national administrative costs of the program at 5 percent of the total budget, and it repeals an international program and a postdoctoral fellowship program which have never been funded. The bill also responds to a National Research Council Report by clarifying the responsibilities of the Sea Grant director and streamlining the process for reviewing State program proposals.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of the extraordinary public figures of our time: Senator Strom Thurmond. 
As we know, Senator Thurmond recently became the longest serving Senator in the history of this august institution. His record of service--over 41 years and counting--is unparalleled, and his devotion to South Carolina and the United States is unquestioned. His has been a life committed to this Nation, and a life as rich and varied as the years that have passed since his birth in the fledgling days of this century. 
Indeed, the breadth and scope of Senator Thurmond's life is truly remarkable. Born just before the dawn of flight, Senator Thurmond is now chairman of a committee that oversees the world's most sophisticated air force. He has borne witness to an explosion of scientific knowledge, fundamental changes in economics and labor, and tremendous sociological transformations. Most remarkable of all, Senator Thurmond can even remember the last time the Boston Red Sox won the World Series in 1918. 
Senator Thurmond has been a full participant in this century of monumental events, and in no way is this more profoundly demonstrated than with his service in World War II. As a member of the 82d Airborne Division, Strom Thurmond was part of the invasion force that stormed the beach at Normandy, France on D-day, and he will forever be a heroic part of these events that changed the course of history. For his courage and valor, he was awarded 18 decorations, medals, and awards--as well as the undying gratitude of America and free nations everywhere. 
Before World War II broke out, as a State senator, Strom Thurmond had already begun what would become a lifelong dedication to public service. That commitment came to the national stage for the first time with his run for the Presidency in 1948--almost 50 years ago--when as an independent candidate he garnered the third largest independent electoral vote in U.S. history. Six years later, he became the first person ever elected as a write-in candidate for the U.S. Senate. 
The rest, as they say, is history--history that is still being written every day by this remarkable and enduring man. The true iron man of the U.S. Senate, his energy, enthusiasm, and love for this institution is as inspirational to me as I know it has been for countless Members of this body--past and present. Here is a legislator whose labor of love is performed against a backdrop of institutional knowledge and historical perspectives unequaled among his 534 colleagues in Congress. One cannot place a value on such service. One can only express their respect and profound appreciation. 
That is why I feel privileged to be able to join with my colleagues in recognizing the extraordinary story that continues to unfold. And why I am especially honored to serve with Senator Thurmond on the Armed Services Committee. As a new member of the committee, Senator Thurmond has made me feel most welcomed and valued, and for his wise guidance I am most grateful. After all, he has been an integral part of the committee through change and crisis, cold war and detente, conflict and peace. 
The defense of this Nation and our responsibility in the world have always been of paramount importance to Senator Thurmond. He understands that we must remain vigilant even as the demise of the Soviet Union has left America as the world's last remaining superpower. Senator Thurmond has seen enough of the world to know that it remains, in many ways, a dangerous place--and that we are uniquely capable and indeed obligated to stand guard against the potential threats which still exist. And most of all, he knows first hand the importance of providing to our service men and women--people willing to put their lives at risk for this Nation--the best possible personnel, equipment, and resources so that their risk is as low as we can humanly make it. 
As a member of the Judiciary Committee, he has brought his breadth of experience and his reasoned voice to bear on such issues as immigration and crime. And when it comes to the matter of ethics, Senator Thurmond has always stood strong and tall for the forces of integrity, supporting limits on how much Senators can earn outside the Senate, and bans on lobbying for foreign countries by former Federal officials to name but a few of his initiatives in this regard. His commitment to the honor of the Senate and the confidence of the American people has been unflagging for over four decades, and that is a record of which he can be proudest of all. 
It is no wonder then that his Republican colleagues would elect him to be President pro tempore of the Senate. As one of only three constitutionally established officers in Congress, it is a position of tremendous respect and trust accorded only to those who have demonstrated an unwavering adherence to the finest ideals of public service and the U.S. Senate. I can think of no finer or more appropriate choice than Senator Strom Thurmond, and I am proud that he has come to embody this institution. 
Throughout this storied career--whether as a superintendent of education, circuit judge, State senator, Governor, or U.S. Senator--Senator Thurmond has never forgotten the people of South Carolina. It is where his heart is, the place from which he draws his strength. And he is in turn beloved by South Carolinians--just ask the folks at the Strom Thurmond Soldier Service Center in Fort Jackson; the Strom Thurmond Educational Center in Union; the Strom Thurmond Federal Building in Columbia; or, most telling, the Strom Thurmond Center for Excellence in Government and Public Service at Clemson University. They know that the senior Senator from South Carolina has been a strong, steady, consistent voice for them. And they know he will always be so. 
Senator Strom Thurmond exemplifies a life worth living: courage, enthusiasm, service to others, a willingness to learn and grow, and a deep appreciation of the opportunities this life--this country--offers. The mark that he is leaving on the U.S. Senate is a positive and enduring one, and I am proud to serve with Senator Thurmond as he continues to make history.

Ms. SNOWE. I thank Senator Domenici. 
I understand the intent of the amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota in terms of expanding the Pell Grant Program, and I am pleased the budget agreement includes increasing the maximum grant by $300. 
Unfortunately, the Senator's amendment is in violation of the budget agreement, so I am offering an amendment that says we shall include two types of tax cut proposals in the $35 billion postsecondary educational tax cut package in this budget agreement. One proposal would provide incentives for parents and students to save for a postsecondary education. The other proposal would be to try to offset the debt that is incurred by students as a result of borrowing to attend college. 
My amendment is consistent with the objectives that were put forward in the budget agreement, as agreed to by President Clinton and the negotiators, and I urge its adoption. 
Mr. President, as we all know, the budget resolution provides for $85 billion in net tax relief over the coming 5 years. In a May 15, 1997, letter to President Clinton, the Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader agreed that the tax package `must include tax relief of roughly $35 billion over 5 years for postsecondary education, including a deduction and a tax credit.' The letter further stipulated that this package of postsecondary education tax cuts `should be consistent with the objectives put forward in the HOPE scholarship and tuition tax proposals contained in the administration's fiscal year 1998 budget.' 
Now, even before that letter was crafted, there had been concerns about the inclusion of any type of education tax cuts in the balanced budget plan. For some, the inclusion of such targeted tax cuts would undermine the overall effort to provide broad-based tax relief for as many Americans as possible. For others, the postsecondary tax cut proposals put forward by President Clinton were viewed as potentially counter-productive because they might actually encourage tuition increases or grade inflation. 
Regardless of how one feels about educational tax cuts in general--or President Clinton's postsecondary education tax cut proposals specifically--I think we can all agree that the objective of the $35 billion education tax cut package in this resolution, and President Clinton's fiscal year 1998 educational tax cut proposals, are clear: Postsecondary educational tax cuts must promote access to a higher education while addressing the needs of parents and students. 
And the amendment I am offering today would encourage that we do both. It is an amendment stating that our $35 billion postsecondary tax cut package shall provide tax incentives that encourage students and parents to save for a postsecondary education, and provide relief from the debt burden associated with borrowing to pay for a postsecondary education. These two proposals--and my amendment--are not only consistent with the objectives laid out by President Clinton in his own budget proposal, but also with the objectives outlined in the May 15 letter from the Speaker of the House and our majority leader. 
Mr. President, a strong commitment to education is included in this budget agreement because of a recognition that education is the great equalizer in our society that can give every citizen of our Nation--regardless of race, income, or geographic background--the same opportunity to succeed in the global economy of the 21st century. It's the same reason I decided to make education a priority during the 1995 and 1996 balanced budget debate, and fought to preserve funding for the Student Loan Program--a program that ensures access to higher education for lower-income students. A bipartisan majority of the Senate shared that commitment, and we now have the opportunity to further strengthen access to higher education through the crafting of sound tax proposals within this balanced budget package. 
As we seek to identify proposals that would improve access to a higher education, it is critical that we first recognize the 
primary barrier that stands between a student and a post-secondary education: rising costs. According to the Institute of Higher Education Policy, students at the undergraduate level have seen tuition increases outpace inflation for more than a decade. As a result of these increasing costs, an estimated 7.6 million students will require and receive aid in 1997--and this number is expected to increase to 8.1 million in 1998. Similarly, due to the significant costs of graduate and professional school training, borrowing by these students is increasing even faster than the record rate of increase in total student loan borrowing overall. 
How much money is borrowed by students to meet these rising costs? According to a 1996 analysis by USA Group Loan Services, the typical student loan borrower--including undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students--now accumulates more than $10,000 in educational debt. By the same token, the interest paid on this borrowing is enormous. In Maine alone, students pay $25 million in interest on their student loan debts every year. Clearly, these rising costs and accumulating debts place the future of our children and our Nation at stake. Many students may wonder if they will ever be able to pay off the debt burden they will absorb if they go to college--and others will simply drop the idea of pursuing a higher education altogether in light of these numbers. 
Mr. President, Congress must remain committed to ensuring that every individual has the opportunity to pursue a higher education while adopting policies that ensure students are not dissuaded from attending a post-secondary institution for financial reasons. While no tax cut can completely remove financial barriers to a higher education, we can certainly endorse sound policies as part of this resolution that adhere to the agreement reached with the White House and move us in the right direction. I believe that providing incentives for parents and students to save for a higher education, and providing tax relief for the debt accumulated by those who need to borrow, is among the policies we should adopt to move us in that direction. 
While the amendment I am offering today does not endorse any specific bill or plan, I would like to note that I offered legislation on May 1 that would accomplish both of these goals. S. 680, the `Go to College!' Tax Incentives Act, would promote savings by young Americans and their parents to prepare for the rising cost of a higher education, and ensure that students are not discouraged from applying for students loans simply because of the debt burden they would incur in seeking a higher education. 
First, the legislation provides an incentive for parents and children to put aside as much as $1,000 per child annually in an education savings account that would be allowed to grow tax free. Planning for the future is critical when one considers the rising cost of tuition, and my incentive to save would make such planning less difficult. Second, the legislation provides a tax credit of $1,500 for the interest paid on student loans, thereby encouraging students to borrow as necessary to go to college--not balk at the cost of a higher education and the related debt they need to incur. 
Many Members of this body have supported restoring the deduction for interest paid on student loans--as evidenced in both of the Republican and Democratic leader bills, S. 1 and S. 12 respectively. While I, too, have long supported the restoration of this deduction, the credit I am proposing in S. 680 would be even more beneficial. Simply put, a tax deduction lowers a student's gross income on the Federal income tax form--but a tax credit actually reduces the tax liability of a student. Although this provision would not benefit students immediately, they would be assured of substantial tax relief once they begin to pay off the student loan debt they accumulated when they chose `go to college' in the first place. 
Again, the amendment I am offering today does not call for the adoption of the `Go to College!' Tax Incentives Act--rather, I mention my bill only to show that there are proposals on the table that would achieve the objectives sought by President Clinton, and that can be further reviewed during budget reconciliation. Ultimately, any number of these proposals could effectively meet the objectives set forth by President Clinton and the majority leader, and I am hopeful that we will adopt the best such approaches during the reconciliation process. Therefore, although the amendment I am offering today does not endorse a specific bill, it ensures that we at least adopt two types of proposals that will move us in the right direction. 
Mr. President, we must ensure that our nation's students do not turn away from pursuing a higher education due to rising costs and increasing debt burdens. This amendment would ensure that we address these issues during the ongoing reconciliation process, while remaining consistent with the objectives laid out in this balanced budget agreement, and I urge its adoption. Thank you, Mr. President.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, when it comes to our budget deliberations, the temptation of politics has often made our search for a balanced budget a difficult one. For a long time, I think all Members of this body would agree that too much time was spent aggressively defending narrow or partisan interests. Personal political interests were sometimes placed above pressing national interests. And common, bipartisan objectives were too seldom charted or pursued. The result for our Nation is now as widely known as it was troublesome: Spending kept expanding. Deficits kept rising. And confidence in Government kept diminishing. 
But here today, Mr. President, with a balanced budget plan before us for the first time in 28 years, it's encouraging to think that we may be reaching a new beginning. Much of the credit for bringing us to this point belongs to the chairman of the Budget Committee, Pete Domenici. The chairman has demonstrated his unwavering commitment to a balanced budget during his years of service on the Budget Committee, and, ultimately, it was his leadership that brought both sides to the table and made this day possible. For his ongoing efforts, I believe that the chairman is deserving of our thanks--and the thanks of generations of Americans to come. 
Let me also thank our majority leader, Trent Lott, for his effort and commitment to making this agreement possible, and the President of the United States for his willingness to negotiate and compromise. I know that it is the hope and expectation of most Americans that President Clinton will continue to stay focused on the balanced budget goal and see this plan through to fruition. 
And, finally, we should also recognize the other leaders of the House and the Senate who were engaged in this process. They, too, pursued this resolution with determination and vigor--and forged consensus on some very divisive issues. We would not be here today without their leadership. 
But Mr. President, we have also reached this encouraging point in our budget deliberations because--at last--there is a widespread recognition that deficits threaten this Nation in unacceptable ways--and that decisive action is needed now to ward off economic crisis. The numbers speak for themselves. According to estimates from the President's own Office of Management and Budget, if we do nothing, the deficit will double in 15 years, then double again every 5 years thereafter. Left unchecked, according to OMB, the deficit would reach $2 trillion by 2025. 
We also know that such a scenario would prove intolerably costly to this Nation. OMB forecasts that if we fail to reign in the deficit now, future generations will suffer an 82-percent tax rate and a 50-percent reduction in benefits in order to pay the bills we are leaving them today. And the Congressional Budget Office has issued a similarly grave warning, arguing a year ago that: `* * * current U.S. budget policies cannot be sustained without risking substantial economic damage.' 
Eighty-two-percent tax rates. Fifty-percent reductions in benefits. Substantial economic damage. This is not some futuristic nightmare, Mr. President. This is the economy that lies ahead for America unless we act now, unless we lay the groundwork for long-term deficit elimination by adopting this resolution. 
Mr. President, this agreement provides us with an historic opportunity to place our country back on the right fiscal path. But it also provides the American people some assurance that our political process can work. After more than 2 years of competing proposals, acrimonious debates, and fruitless negotiations, many Americans have become understandably cynical of our ability and even willingness to ever agree on a plan to balance the budget. But this agreement should give us some hope. It proves that we can compromise on specifics without compromising on principle--that when an agreement indisputably benefits the American people, we can set aside partisanship and get the job done. 
Of course, while the resolution before us today is an encouraging one and should be celebrated, we should also recognize what it is not. This is only a first step, Mr. President, and no Member of this body can say with certainty that this resolution signals a conclusive end to the failed budget politics of old. Indeed, I believe that only a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution can ensure that fiscal prudence and responsibility will be exercised indefinitely into the future. 
And let me be clear about another matter. The budget resolution before us is not perfect. Are there flaws in it? Yes, Mr. President, I think there are. In fact, I suspect that every Member of this body could find aspects that trouble them in this resolution--aspects that they may have written in a slightly or even greatly different manner. 
For instance, some may criticize this resolution because it expands new entitlements or does too little to reform existing entitlements before the baby boom generation begins to retire. In fact, it is with the latter concern in mind that I am particularly troubled by the assumption of home health care being shifted from part A to part B of Medicare. I fear that this shift may actually imperil this vital program even as it masks the true problems of the Medicare trust fund, which must be addressed if we are to preserve and protect the Medicare Program for senior citizens in the future. Still others may criticize this plan as being insufficient in terms of deficit reduction because it would cut the deficit by only 1 percent of today's GDP over the next 5 years, or because it provides what they consider to be too much of an increase in discretionary spending. To put these types of concerns in the words of one analyst from the CATO Institute: `On balance, this is a bad deal. Republicans should just say no.' 
Conversely, there are those who may see the cuts quite differently and argue that this agreement goes too far in cutting certain programs and does too little to fund new initiatives. Still others do not support the tax relief included in this resolution, or argue that the package of tax cuts being discussed would disproportionately benefit higher income individuals or families. 
But Mr. President, after 28 years of deficit spending, we can no 
longer let the perfect be the enemy of the good. We can no longer let politics drive our budget decisions because for 2 years--2 years, Mr. President--Republicans and Democrats have squared-off over a variety of issues, while offering competing plans. And the result has been wholly unimpressive. There has been no agreement. No plan for a balanced budget. And I think it's worth noting that the only reason that we have this resolution before us today is that competing budget plans were unsuccessful. It is compromise that offers us this chance to reach agreement and lay the groundwork for long-term balance. But if each Member of this body rejects such compromise and demands instead that the plan do exactly what he or she would want in the ideal world, then only one thing is for sure: This plan will be derailed--and our historic opportunity will be lost. 
And lest we focus only on those parts of the budget that are less than perfect, let's not overlook the incredibly positive aspects of this plan. For instance, not only will this plan balance the budget in the year 2002, if its policies are continued, OMB tells us that it will lead to a surplus of $34 billion in the year 2007. And while many have cited the fact that the total deficit reduction in this plan will be only $204 billion over the next 5 years, they fail to mention that there will be more than $700 billion in additional savings during the 5 years thereafter. Consider for a moment the two dramatically different futures that potentially lie ahead for this Nation: If we reject this plan and continue with the status quo, we will add another $1.1 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years. On the other hand, if we use the 2002 to 2007 surpluses to buy-down the debt, this plan will ensure that more than $800 billion would be available for useful investments, and not eaten up by the national debt. 
Perhaps most importantly, by putting us on a course to balance the budget in 5 short years, this plan will also allow us to address the significant long-term threats described by OMB and CBO because we will have laid the groundwork for even larger reforms in the coming years. And it will also hold future Congresses accountable to maintain this same level of fiscal responsibility. 
And let's not forget the important impact that a balanced budget will have on economic growth. I know that there are those who say that our economy is doing well. They point to the growth rate for the last economic quarter and the fact that we now have had continuous growth for 6 straight years, and they say things could not be rosier. And it's at least partly true, Mr. President. We are now approaching the post-World War II record for the longest period of growth without a recession. But no one is projecting that the economy will maintain this pace, and the average annual rate of growth during the current 6-year streak has been an unimpressive 2.5 percent--the lowest level of growth during a recovery in this century. 
But, tragically, even this lethargic annual rate of growth is not predicted to last--and cannot last--unless we tackle the deficit now. Look out to future years and we see that the economy is anticipated to grow at even more anemic rates; 2.0 percent in 1998; 2.1 in 2000. The numbers are not impressive. However, with the enactment of a balanced budget plan, CBO tells us that potential growth will be enhanced because resources now devoted to consumption can instead be used for investment. So, Mr. President, this resolution presents us 
with our most direct and tangible means of stimulating economic growth in the short-term, even as we seek to extend our current economic expansion for another 5 years. 
And, finally, to those concerned with various details of the plan, let's remember this: Within the framework of this resolution, there are specific levels of savings in various programs, specific levels of tax cuts and the resolution even includes some of the policies that should be used to achieve these targets. But, appropriately, this resolution does not spell out all of the details, and it leaves opportunities for the authorizing and appropriating Committees to fulfill the parameters and benchmarks that have been set. So let's remember that the goal of this resolution--a balanced budget in 2002--is in ink, but some of the details are still in pencil. And that's OK. The administration will continue to have the opportunity to encourage specific spending priorities, and Members of this body will also have their opportunity to influence and mold these decisions. 
Now, Mr. President, let me address one final question. Whenever there is a political initiative as significant as the one before us, pundits begin to ask: `Who is the political winner in this agreement? Is it Republicans? Or is it Democrats?' Well, let me suggest an answer: The winner in this resolution is our Nation and its people. Deficits have damaged this Nation and its citizens for 28 years and set us on an inevitable economic crash course. But today, with this resolution, we have an opportunity to avert this crash by ending these deficits in the short-term, which lays the groundwork for eliminating them completely in the long-term. What lies before us is a framework for achieving a balanced budget by 2002 and holding off the pending disaster that inaction invites. 
So I think our goal could not be more clear: We cannot let this opportunity slip through our hands. We must begin anew--never again permitting our Nation to be recklessly endangered by deficits and deficit spending. We must move forward with a recognition that our budget belongs to the people--and, as such, it must always be handled carefully and responsibly. These are our challenges--and, together, we can and must meet them. 
Mr. President, `a journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.' I am reminded of this Chinese proverb today because this resolution represents such a monumental first step in our journey to a balanced budget. To be sure, our journey is not complete. And it will not be complete unless Members of this body, the House of Representatives, and the President maintain a strong commitment in the coming years to follow through and make this balanced budget goal a reality. We cannot falter in these coming challenges. But, in the meantime, we should celebrate today for all that it represents. Mr. President, this resolution places our Nation on the right path and, against a future of uncontrolled deficits and all that the dangers and problems that these deficits entail, this resolution gives us hope for a new beginning of fiscal sanity, economic growth, and prosperity. 
So I think our choice should be clear. We need to take this path--and we need to adopt this resolution. The benefit of doing so, Mr. President, is too great. The cost of failing to do so, conversely, is simply too severe.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to join with the majority leader in paying tribute to an extraordinary woman, J.L. Cullen. 
It would be accurate to say that J.L. worked for the House Rules Committee, but that wouldn't begin to capture the spirit of this wonderful person. Yes, she was an outstanding and dedicated staffer, but for those of us who have served in the House--especially women--she was so much more. She was our friend. 
From my first days in the House I was privileged to know J.L. and our relationship grew from there. Her wonderful sense of humor, her warmth and her intellect made an impression on all of us, as our distinguished majority leader can attest from his days in the House. 
As an unofficial morale officer, J.L. brought together women of the House of Representatives, on a number of occasions hosting my female colleagues and me for dinner at her home. I will always fondly remember dinners with J.L., Nancy Johnson, and Lynn Martin--for both the company and the cooking! J.L. knew her way around a kitchen as well as she knew her way around House procedure, and in fact ultimately opened up her own business selling pesto. 
No matter what she did, J.L. was always gracious, always hospitable. And in the House, she quietly but effectively fostered unity and camaraderie among Members. She was there through dark days as well as the bright ones, and she was a tremendous resource for us. 
When I last had the pleasure of seeing J.L. at a reception recently, despite her illness, she greeted me with her usual good cheer and humor. She is truly a remarkable person and the way in which she has handled her illness with strength and dignity is inspirational to me. J.L. is one of those rare people who lends perspective to what we do here in Washington and brings into sharp focus the things that are truly important in life. 
I hope J.L. is watching us today, to see and hear our comments, Mr. President. Because I want her to know how deeply she has touched the lives of those with whom she worked. J.L. may not be a Member of Congress, but she is as much a credit to this institution as any of its finest elected officials. And she is as much a part of this Congress as any one of us who are Members. 
So often, one hears of the unelected staff. For so many, they are the nameless faceless people who work in the shadow of the dome--out of the glare of public attention usually reserved for those elected to the House or Senate. J.L. Cullen is among the finest of those people. Uninterested in the spotlight, she measures her contributions solely by the lives she touches or the results she achieves. 
But today, I want the public to know her name. I want them to know that she is a person without whom the people's business--the work of this institution, indeed the work of this Nation--would not have been done. And I want America to know that she has been a public servant in the very finest sense of the word. 
J.L., if you're watching, please know that you are in my heart and in my prayers. You helped make this native-born Mainer feel at home in Washington, you helped me to do my job better, and you helped me to laugh along the way, too. I will forever cherish your caring and friendship, and remember your exemplary service to Congress and the Nation.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to have supported the amendment offered by my colleague from Florida, Senator Mack, which expresses the sense of the Senate that Federal funding for biomedical research should be doubled over the next 5 years. This amendment is based on a resolution which I cosponsored, Senate Joint Resolution 15--one of the first bills the Republican leadership introduced in the 105th Congress. That resolution, and the amendment we adopted last night, sends a message to the American people, as well as to scientists and policy makers, that Congress is committed to enhanced funding for this crucial research. 
Americans consistently identify increased funding for medical research as something they believe should be a national priority. They want researchers to unravel the mysteries of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, cystic fibrosis, heart disease, HIV, multiple sclerosis, and countless other diseases which plague Americans today. And they do not want their national leaders or scientists to rest until there is a cure. 
We must bring the full force of our country's tremendous resources to bear on these diseases in the same way we rallied to be the first to set foot on the Moon. We are a nation that has split atoms, sent probes to the far reaches of the solar system, and eradicated polio from the face of the Earth. We ought to be able to conquer these diseases. 
Over the years, we have increased our Federal commitment to medical research. For example, 25 years ago, Congress allocated just $400 million to the National Cancer Institute. Today, total funding for cancer research at the National Institutes of Health for this fiscal year is $2.7 billion. This represents an increase of close to 700 percent. And this infusion of Federal funding is working. For the very first time since cancer mortality statistics were first collected in 1930, mortality rates from cancer are actually decreasing. 
Researchers are beginning to isolate the genes responsible for various diseases at a seemingly breathtaking speed, and gene therapy may someday offer exciting new treatments--or even a cure--for these diseases. Scientists are beginning to understand the very workings of cancer cells, and immunotherapy may offer cancer sufferers new hope. But how this knowledge may someday be translated into benefits for everyday Americans is yet unknown. We need to increase Federal funding so that we can capitalize on these important breakthroughs. 
Throughout my tenure in both the House and Senate, I have worked hard to increase funding for medical research. In fact, on the first legislative day of this session, I introduced a bill which would raise the reauthorization level for breast cancer funding to a record $590 million. The Mack resolution demonstrates the very same commitment to ensuring that Americans no longer suffer from diseases that cut their lives short and cause undue suffering. Our enhanced investment in medical research will save countless lives and health care dollars, and alleviate suffering in millions of Americans.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to report that we have made progress in our efforts to protect Atlantic large whales. As you may recall, on May 8th of this year, several of my colleagues joined with me in introducing the `Good Samaritan Exemption' to the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The Good Samaritan Exemption provides that the disentanglement of a marine mammal from fishing gear does not violate the `take' provisions of the MMPA. We were able to have the exemption accepted as an amendment to S. 672, and, due to the broad support for this noncontroversial amendment, I am hopeful that it will be included in the conference report.

Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senate minority leader for yielding me this time, but, more importantly, I secondly want to commend him for his refreshing approach in trying to craft a consensus on what is obviously a very difficult issue when it comes to the problem of late-term abortion. He has shown determination and persistence and dedication in arriving at this compromise. I think that if more people in this body took that approach on the most contentious issues, we would not be standing here today even debating this one. 
This is a very difficult issue. But the compromise that the Senate minority leader has worked out clearly represents a serious attempt in bridging the differences on this issue, but also an attempt to address a very divisive issue. 
I had to reread the legislation after I heard several interpretations of it today. The Senate minority leader's legislation will ban all postviability abortions. There is one area upon which we all agree, that no viable fetus should be aborted by any method unless it is necessary to protect the life and the health of the mother. 
The difference here today is one issue: It is whether or not we are prepared to provide a health exception. I am very grateful to my colleague from South Dakota for trying to find common ground on this issue. All Members, pro-choice and pro-life, ought to be able to come together and agree. 
Mr. President, 41 States, including my own State of Maine, already ban postviability abortions. We all agree that we need to ensure that healthy pregnancies are never terminated after a fetus is viable regardless of which procedure is used. That is why the Daschle approach is so important. 
Furthermore, the Daschle substitute will lower, actually lower the number of abortions in this country as opposed to the legislation offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania. 
The legislation of the Senator from Pennsylvania, S. 6, would not prevent a single abortion. Ironically, what it would do is force a woman to choose another potentially life-threatening procedure when it comes to her health. 
It clearly does not make any sense to me that we here in the U.S. Senate are prepared to place a woman's health in jeopardy, place a woman in an unacceptable risk, while doing nothing to lower the number of abortions that occur in this country. 
The Daschle amendment will decrease the number of abortions and will do so without putting a woman's life and health on the line. To critics who say the Daschle language contains a loophole because it leaves it to the doctor to determine when the fetus is viable, I ask, who is in a better position than doctors to determine this? Certainly not the Federal Government. Certainly not the U.S. Senate. I know some would think they are omnipotent, but certainly not the U.S. House of Representatives. Certainly not politicians making this determination. This is a determination that should be made by the physician and the physician alone. 
In fact, the report that has been touted here by the American Medical Association, which I find quite interesting, is a 35-page report. I know that proponents of S. 6 and the legislation supported by the Senator from Pennsylvania touts this report, but this report did not even come down in support of the Senator's legislation after 35 pages. But in this report that was released on Tuesday by the American Medical Association, it states, `It is the physician who should determine the viability.' Exactly. 
But it is not only the American Medical Association who says the viability of determination should be left to the doctor. It is also the Supreme Court. In Planned Parenthood versus Danforth, the Supreme Court said,  
The time viability is achieved may vary with each pregnancy, and the determination of whether a particular fetus is viable is, and must be, a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending physician. 
Only doctors are equipped to make this determination. It is not those of us here in the U.S. Senate. It is not a bureaucracy. It is not the Government. We want our physicians to make that determination. 
Now, critics say protecting a woman from a grievous injury to her physical health does not justify terminating a later stage pregnancy. 
I ask again. Who are these politicians to make this heart-wrenching decisions for a family when a woman's life is in jeopardy? To the critics who say the Daschle language contains a loophole because doctors can interpret the health exception any way they want, as I say, read legislative language. 
`Grievous physical injury' is defined as a `severely debilitating disease or impairment caused by the pregnancy,' or `an inability to provide necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition.' 
That is very clear. It is very plain. It is very strict. It is a very narrow definition. And, as the Senator from South Dakota indicated, the penalties are extremely harsh, if the doctor didn't make that determination according to this definition. 
If I were a doctor and I read the penalties in this legislation that became law, I can guarantee you the doctor would make that determination and that definition in terms of what was grievous, what was a severely debilitating disease or impairment caused by the pregnancy or an inability to provide necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition. Their definition is protecting women from the most serious and life-threatening health risk. 
This narrow definition comports with again the American Medical Association's position that postviability abortion should only be used under those extraordinary circumstances when it absolutely is necessary to preserve the life and health of the mother. The Daschle substitute is narrowly tailored to allow postviability abortions only under these extraordinary circumstances. 
This language could not be more clear. How can you second-guess what is grievous? How could you second-guess the penalties that are included in this legislation? How could you second-guess the notion of going to jail? 
There is no question that any abortion is an emotional and difficult decision for a woman. When a woman must confront this decision during the later stages of her pregnancy because she knows that the pregnancy jeopardizes her very life and health, such a decision becomes a nightmare. And we have heard example after example. These aren't faceless individuals. These are human beings. These are women--women we know who have faced these circumstances who do not want the U.S. Senate or the U.S. Congress making that decision for them in these very limiting exceptional health circumstances. We have no right to be making that decision. 
The Roe versus Wade decision was carefully crafted by the Supreme Court 24 years ago. It was designed to balance the rights of women in America with reproductive decisions that have to be made. And they said that the rights of women are paramount in those decisions. This decision held that women have a constitutional right to an abortion, but after viability States could ban abortions as long as they allow exceptions for cases in which a woman's life or health is in danger. Let me repeat that: Allow exceptions for cases in which a woman's life or health is endangered. 
The Supreme Court has reaffirmed that decision time and time again. Forty-one States have passed legislation upholding that banning of abortions in the later stages of pregnancy, except when it comes to a woman's life or a woman's health. 
The legislation offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania does not allow the exception for health. It does not allow it. In the last year, we heard, `Oh, it provides a health exception.' But it is so broad. It just says health. It is so broad you could drive a truck through it. 
The Senate minority leader made a good-faith effort to come up with a very narrow definition of grievous injury. You couldn't get much stricter in its interpretation. 
So that in certain situations, where a woman's life and health is in severe jeopardy, an exception can be made. The health exception for grievous physical injury can only be invoked under two circumstances. 
The first involves those heart-wrenching cases where a wanted pregnancy seriously threatens the health of the mother. The Daschle language would allow a doctor in these tragic cases to perform an abortion because he believes it is critical to preserving the health of a woman facing cardiac failure: 
Peripartal cardiomyopathy, a form of cardiac failure which is often caused by the pregnancy which can result in death or untreatable heart disease; pre-eclampsia, or high blood pressure, which is caused by a pregnancy which can result in kidney failure, stroke, or death; uterine ruptures, which could result in infertility. 
Is anyone suggesting here that we should not allow exceptions in these very serious health circumstances--circumstances that are not excepted in the language that has been proposed by the Senator from Pennsylvania? Imagine: A form of cardiac failure that causes death would not be excepted. High blood pressure that can result in kidney failure, stroke, or death would not be excepted, or exempted; or infertility. Or the second circumstance that would be provided for as an exception under the Daschle language: When a woman has a 
life-threatening condition that requires lifesaving treatment. 
It applies to tragic cases, for example, when a woman needs chemotherapy when pregnant. So the family faces a terrible choice of confronting the pregnancy, or providing lifesaving treatment. 
These conditions include breast cancer, lymphoma, which has a 50-percent mortality rate, if untreated; primary pulmonary hypertension, which has a 50-percent maternal mortality rate. 
Are we saying here that the U.S. Senate is saying, `No, we will not provide any exception.' I hope not. I hope that would not be the case. And the Daschle substitute allows for those very limiting but very serious instances of health circumstances that could jeopardize permanently a woman's life, if not resulting in death. 
If this Chamber passes this bill without the Daschle amendment, it will represent a direct frontal assault on the health of American women. Make no mistake. Innocent women will suffer. We must not overlook that women's lives and health are at stake. They hang in balance. Women who undergo these procedures face a terrible tragedy of later-stage pregnancy that has through no fault of their own gone terribly, tragically wrong. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Daschle language. It will ensure that no abortions will take place after viability unless it is absolutely necessary to avoid grievous physical injury to a woman while protecting the woman's life and health. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, nowhere is the middle ground in American politics harder to find than in the debate over abortion. It is clear that the apparent inability of pro-choice and pro-life members to find common ground is one of the most divisive issues we face today. In debate after debate, it often appears that there is no middle ground. Well, I am extremely pleased that my colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, is joining me today to introduce legislation that will prove this statement untrue. 
Too often, pro-choice leaders do too little to convey that they are not pro-abortion. Likewise, abortion opponents too often fail to work constructively toward reducing the need for abortion. The failure of pro-choice and pro-life members to stake out common ground weakens our Nation immeasurably. 
Today that's going to change. The cosponsors of this bill come from different parties, and have very different views on abortion. Our voting records are clear: I am firmly pro-choice; Senators Reid is firmly pro-life. Yet, despite these fundamental differences, we agree that something can and must be done to reduce the rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion in this country. That is why we are joining forces and introducing bipartisan, landmark legislation to make contraceptives more affordable for Americans. And I am pleased that a number of my colleagues, including Senators Warner, Mikulski, Chafee, Durbin, Collins, Murray, and Jeffords are joining us as original cosponsors. 
The need is clear. This year, there will be 3.6 million unintended pregnancies--over 56 percent of all pregnancies in America--and half will end in abortion. These are staggering statistics. But what's even more staggering is that it doesn't have to be this way. If prescription contraceptives were covered like other prescription drugs, a lot more Americans could afford to use safe, effective means to prevent unintended pregnancies. 
The fact is, under many of today's health insurance plans, a woman can afford a prescription to alleviate allergy symptoms but not a prescription to prevent an unintended and life-altering pregnancy. It is simply not right that while the vast majority of insurers cover prescription drugs, half of large group plans exclude coverage of prescription contraceptives. And only one-third cover oral contraceptives--the most popular form of birth control. 
Is it any wonder that women spend 68 percent more than men in out-of-pocket health care costs--68 percent. It does not make sense that, at a time when we want to reduce unintended pregnancies, so many otherwise insured woman can't afford access to the most effective contraceptives because of the disparity in coverage. 
The lack of contraceptive coverage in health insurance is not news to most women. Countless American women have been shocked to learn that their insurance does not cover contraceptives, one of their most basic health care needs, even though other prescriptions drugs which are equally valuable to their lives are routinely covered. But until today, women could do little more than feel silent outrage at a practice that disadvantages both their health and their pocketbook. 
Now, the Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act gives voice to that outrage. EPICC sends a message that we can no longer tolerate policies that disadvantage women and disadvantage our nation. When our bill is passed, women will finally be assured of equity in prescription drug coverage and health care services. And America's unacceptably high rates of unintended pregnancies and abortions will be reduced in the process. 
This EPICC approach is simple. It says that if insurers already cover prescription drugs and devices, they must also cover FDA-approved prescription contraceptives. And it takes the commonsense approach of requiring health plans which already cover basic health care services to also cover medical and counseling services to promote the effective use of those contraceptives. The bill does not require insurance companies to cover prescription drugs--it simply says that if insurers cover prescription drugs, they cannot treat prescription contraceptives any differently. Similarly, it says that insurers which cover outpatient health care services cannot limit or exclude coverage of the medical and counseling services necessary for effective contraceptive use in order to prevent unintended pregnancies. 
This bill is not only good policy, it also makes good economic sense. We know that contraceptives are cost-effective: in the public sector, for every dollar invested in family planning, $4 to $14 is saved in health care and related costs. And we also know that by helping families to adequately space their pregnancies, contraceptives contribute to healthy pregnancies and healthy births, reducing rates of maternal complications, and low-birth weight. 
Time and time again Americans have expressed the desire for their leaders to come together to work on the problems that face us. This bill exemplifies that spirit of cooperation. It crosses some very wide gulfs and makes some very meaningful changes in policy that will benefit countless Americans. 
As someone who is pro-choice, I firmly believe that abortions should be safe, legal, and rare. Through this bill, I invite both my pro-choice and pro-life colleagues to join with me in emphasizing the rare. And I invite all who believe in sound public policy to join our alliance. Because we as a nation must be truly committed to reducing rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion. We must come together despite our differences. We must pass this EPICC bill into law.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the amendment that I am introducing today provides that the disentanglement of a marine mammal from fishing gear or debris does not violate the Marine Mammal Protection Act. This amendment is co-sponsored by Senators Kerry, Gregg, Collins, Kennedy, Smith, and Breaux. 
I would also like to thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, for his efforts in helping us craft this amendment. Senator Stevens has been a leader on marine mammal issues since the act was first enacted in 1972, and we value his expertise. 
As a nation, we have taken great steps toward protecting marine mammals. The Marine Mammal Protection Act is an international model for minimizing adverse human impacts on marine mammal populations. Under the Act, the term `take' means `to harass, hunt, capture, or kill, or attempt to harass, hunt, capture, or kill any marine mammal'. Takings are expressly prohibited without an exemption approved by the National Marine Fisheries Service, consistent with the MMPA. The takings language is clear. It is meant to prevent unnecessary injury to marine mammal populations. But unfortunately, as the law currently stands, the takings provision could be used to hold liable a person involved in attempting to rescue a marine mammal from entanglement. 
Perhaps nowhere else is this problem more critical than in my own State of Maine, where NMFS has recently proposed a rule to reduce the takings of large Atlantic whales. Many of the stakeholders who have been involved in the debate over this rule believe that improved disentanglement of whales is a crucial part of any take reduction plan. In fact, while the NMFS's rule, which is badly flawed, relies heavily on untested and unproven fishing gear modifications, many knowledgeable people believe that enhanced disentanglement is the most effective known method of reducing serious injury or mortality. 
However, fishermen and others will be very reluctant to participate in disentanglement efforts unless they have an ironclad guarantee that they would not be held liable for a taking. Thus, without a change in the law, the success of disentanglement programs would be severely limited. 
The Snowe-Kerry amendment provides that change, encouraging fishermen and others to help rescue a marine mammal by removing the threat of prosecution. And we need the help of our fishermen. The fishing community provides our eyes and ears on the sea, working across areas far larger than any single agency could hope to monitor. With the participation and support of fishermen, we can add to our understanding of marine mammal populations and reduce the incidence of serious injury. 
Mr. President, this amendment enjoys bipartisan support and is not controversial. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

Ms. SNOWE. 
Mr. President, today I am introducing a package of three bills which address the most critical issues affecting our relations with the United Nations. These are the U.S. arrearage in financial contributions to the United Nations, the sharing of U.S. intelligence with the United Nations, and U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping activities. 
The United Nations Reform Act of 1997 is a bill that I have been working on for over a year in my former capacity as chair of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on International Operations. With the United Nations now entering its second half-century, the question being raised is not whether the United Nations can continue its growth for another 50 years, but whether it can survive as an important international institution for the next 5. 
With a new Secretary of State who formerly served as U.N. Ambassador, with a new U.N. Ambassador who formerly served as a respected Member of Congress, and with a new U.N. Secretary General, I believe that we have a unique opportunity over the next 2 years to genuinely restore a bipartisan consensus on the United Nations within Congress and among the American people. That is the intent of this legislation, which sets reasonable and achievable reform criteria for the United Nations, linked to a 5-year repayment plan for the nearly $1 billion in arrearages that have built up in the U.N. system over the past few years. 
The plan would set up a five-step annual process under which the President would each year have to certify that specific reform guideposts have been met at the United Nations, permitting the payment each year of one-fifth of outstanding U.S. arrearages. 
In the first year, the President would have to certify that a hard freeze zero nominal growth budget at the United Nations had been maintained and that budgetary transparency at the world body had been enhanced through opening up the United Nations to member State auditing and fully funding the new U.N. inspector general office. 
In the second year, the President would have to certify that U.S. representation had been restored to a key U.N. budgetary oversight body, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions [ACABQ]. 
In the third year, the President would have to certify that a long-standing U.N. peacekeeping reform goal had been achieved. This reform would ensure that the United States receives full credit or reimbursement for the very substantial logistical and in-kind support our military provides to assessed U.N. peacekeeping missions. 
In the fourth year, the President would have to certify that a significant reform in the United Nations' budget process had been achieved. This reform would be to divide the U.N. regular budget into an assessed core budget and a voluntary program budget. The source of much of the United Nations' problems stems from the fact that the United Nations' assessed budget is increasingly used for development programs and other activities that should not be included in our mandatory dues for membership. This reform can be achieved without a revision in the U.N. Charter. 
Finally, in the fifth year the President would have to certify that a major U.N. consolidation plan has been approved and implemented. This plan must entail a significant reduction in staff and an elimination of the rampant duplication, overlap, and lack of coordination that exists throughout the U.N. system. 
Clearly, there is an urgent need to turn around the United Nations' dangerous slide into constant crisis, which could ultimately threaten the organization's usefulness as an important tool for addressing world problems. I am convinced that this can only be achieved through the kind of bold reform agenda that is set forth in this legislation. 
Mr. President, I believe it is useful for us to look back on the original purpose of the United Nations, as it was envisioned 51 years ago. The United Nations was created from the ashes of World War II, with the hope of avoiding future world-wide conflagrations through international cooperation. The main focus for this mission was the Security Council, the only entity empowered under the U.N. Charter to act on the great questions of world peace. The General Assembly was intended to be a forum for debate on any issue that any nation wanted to bring before the assembled nations of the world. The U.N. Secretariat was to be a small professional staff needed to support the activities of the Security Council and General Assembly.

 Ms. SNOWE. 
Mr. President, today I introduce a package of three bills which will have a significant impact on the lives of American families. 
The first bill I am reintroducing today provides a tax credit for families caring for a relative who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Today, `Alzheimer's' is a household term. But it was not always so. For many years, victims of Alzheimer's disease and their families struggled in isolation against this illness. However, President Reagan's poignant disclosure in 1994 that Alzheimer's disease was attacking him as he entered the `twilight years' of his life captured the collective heart of our Nation, and brought new attention to this devastating disease. We have come a long way from when I first came to Congress over 18 years ago, when there was not a single piece of legislation devoted to Alzheimer's disease. Thankfully, that has changed. 
Alzheimer's disease is now the most expensive uninsured illness in America. The financial costs are staggering. Alzheimer's will consume more of our national wealth--approximately $1.75 trillion--than all other illnesses except cancer and heart disease. The number of Americans affected by Alzheimer's is rising and will continue to rise dramatically, from 4 million today to over 14 million by the middle of the 21st century. 
In addition to the significant financial costs related to caring for a family member with Alzheimer's disease, there is also a tremendous emotional cost as well. It is a cost born by the millions of spouses, children, relatives, and friends of Alzheimer's victims who see their loved ones slowly overwhelmed by the disease. 
We can, however, lessen both the emotional and financial costs of this disease by passing the bill I am reintroducing today which will provide some relief to Alzheimer's patients and their families. My bill would allow families to deduct the cost of home care and adult day and respite care provided to a dependent suffering from Alzheimer's disease. 
The second bill I am reintroducing today will strengthen the dependent care tax credit and restore Congress' original intent to provide the greatest benefit of tax credit to low-income taxpayers. My legislation expands the dependent care tax credit, makes it applicable for respite care expenses, and makes it refundable. 
The increase in women entering the work force and the aging population have brought a corresponding increase in the need for both child and elder care. Expenses incurred for such care can significantly strain a family's budget. In 1993, full-time child care costs averaged approximately $4,000. Managing these costs is difficult for many families, but is exceptionally burdensome for those in lower income brackets. 
In 1976, Congress enacted the dependent care tax credit to help low- and moderate-income families alleviate the burden of employment-related dependent care. Over the years, the DCTC has provided significant Federal assistance to millions of families with child and adult dependent care expenses. 
Under current law, parents can deduct up to $2,400 annually for employment-related child care expenses for one children, and up to $4,800 for two or more children. Parents can deduct an amount equal to 30 percent of their child care expenditures if they have earnings below $10,000, with the percentage decreasing on a sliding scale to 20 percent if their income is above $28,000. The credit is nonrefundable, meaning that an individual can only receive the credit if he or she pays taxes. 
Unfortunately, the value of the dependent care tax credit for low- and moderate-income families has eroded in recent years. This is largely due to the lack of inflationary indexing and refundability. 
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 provided for inflationary indexing of all the basic provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that determine tax liability except for DCTC. As a result, fewer and fewer families with incomes low enough to take advantage of the maximum credit amount, 30 percent, have any tax liability. 
The result is a shift in DCTC benefits away from low-income families and toward moderate-income families. Fewer and fewer low-income family's annual income reach the tax threshold necessary to receive the tax credit; and those low-income individuals who do reach the threshold lose out on the maximum credit available. Therefore, rather than helping low-income families with dependent care expenses, which was Congress' original intent, the DCTC is evolving into assistance for less needy middle-income families. 
I believe it is critical to get the DCTC back on track helping those families most in need in our country. If we do not address these issues now, each year increasing tax thresholds will prevent more and more low-income individuals from benefiting from the DCTC. 
The legislation I am reintroducing would make the adjustments necessary to restore this important benefit to low-income individuals and families. It indexes the DCTC to inflation, and makes it refundable so that those who do not reach the tax 
thresholds still receive Federal assistance for their dependent care expenses. 
My legislation, however, goes even further to help families struggling with dependent care expenses. Recognizing the realistic costs of dependent care, my bill raises the DCTC sliding scale from 30 to 50 percent of work-related dependent care expenditures for families earning $15,000 or less. The scale would then be reduced by 1 percentage point for each additional $1,000 more of income, down to a credit of 20 percent for persons earning $45,000 or more. 
Finally, this legislation expands the definition of dependent care to include respite care, thereby offering relief from this additional expense. A respite care credit would be allowed for up to $1,200 for one qualifying dependent care and $2,400 for two qualifying dependents. The credit for respite care expenses would be available regardless of the caregiver's employment status. 
Congress intended the dependent care tax credit to help low- and moderate-income families manage the costs of dependent care assistance which is vital to so many families' economic livelihood. However, each year that we do not address the issues of inflationary indexing and refundability, we deny those very families assistance, and, instead, help families with greater financial means. 
The third bill I am reintroducing today is the Guardianship Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1997, which establishes a bill of rights for adults who, because of physical or mental incapacity, become wards of the courts. 
Wards are individuals whose legal rights, decisionmaking authority, and possessions have been transferred to the control of a guardian or conservator based on a judgment that the person is no longer capable of handling these affairs. This legal system severely limits an individual's personal autonomy and has considerable problems and widespread abuses. Horror stories abound about guardians who force unnecessary nursing home care, embezzle assets or otherwise abuse their wards. 
The Guardianship Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1997 would require States to adopt and enforce laws to provide basic protection and rights to wards as a condition of receiving Federal Medicaid funds. It would assure due process protections such as counsel, the right to be present at their proceedings, and to appeal decisions. Also required would be: Clear and convincing evidence to determine the need for a guardianship; adequate court monitoring; and standards, training, and oversight for guardians. 
This legislation will help to protect the most vulnerable elderly and disabled from exploitation, and will help to assure them the highest possible autonomy. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting these important bills.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in my view there is no greater threat to our nation's security than the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Among these is the scourge of chemical weapons which have been unleashed in this century with such horrifying effect in the trenches of the First World War, in the villages of Iraq a decade ago, and more recently in the Tokyo subway. 
In 1985 the United States took a bold unilateral decision to destroy our chemical weapons stockpiles because they serve no military purpose. And in 1990 the United States negotiated a bilateral chemical weapons destruction agreement with the Soviet Union in an effort to begin the process of reducing that country's stockpiles, the largest in the world. The leadership of the United States through the years has been crucial in forging the broad international consensus which produced the Chemical Weapons Convention. The whole world is watching us closely today to see whether or not the United States is going to continue its leadership role on this critical issue. 
The United States must not retreat from more than a decade of leadership on controlling chemical weapons. We must ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention before it comes into force on April 29--not just to maintain our leadership on this issue, but because it is in our best interests to do so. 
The issue is not whether the Convention will completely eliminate the threat of chemical weapons. There is no magic wand to do that. However, what the Chemical Weapons Convention will do is nevertheless substantial. It will establish--for the first time--an international standard against the production and use of chemical weapons. It will provide us with significant additional monitoring and inspection tools to detect chemical weapons activities. And it will impose trade restrictions that will make it more difficult for `rogue' states and terrorist organizations to start or continue chemical weapons programs. 
Opponents of the Convention argue that it is not adequately verifiable, although many of those same critics argue at the same time that the treaty is too intrusive. The fact is that the Convention includes the most extensive monitoring and inspection regime of any arms control treaty to date. The U.S. chemical industry--which will be the target of most of the monitoring and inspection under the Convention-- helped write these provisions and is comfortable with them.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Bone Mass Measurement Standardization Act of 1997. 
Millions of women in their post-menopausal years face a silent killer, a stalker disease we know as osteoporosis. This unforgiving bone disease afflicts 28 million Americans; causes 50,000 deaths each year; 1.5 million bone fractures annually; and the direct medical costs of osteoporosis fracture patients are $13.8 billion each year, or $38 million every single day. This cost is projected to reach $60 billion by the year 2020 and $240 billion by the year 2040 if medical research has not discovered an effective treatment. 
The facts also show that one out of every two women have a lifetime risk of bone fractures due to osteoporosis, and that it affects half of all women over the age of 50 and an astounding 90% of all women over 75. Perhaps the most tragic consequences of osteoporosis occur with the 300,000 individuals annually who suffer a hip fracture. Twelve to thirteen percent of these persons will die within six months following a hip fracture, and of those who survive, 20% will never walk again, and 20% will require nursing home care--often for the rest of their lives. 
We all know that osteoporosis cannot be cured, although with a continued commitment to research in this area I remain hopeful that we will find one. We also know that once bone mass is lost, it cannot be replaced. Therefore, early detection is our best weapon because it is only through early detection that we can thwart the progress of the disease and initiate preventive efforts to stop further loss of bone mass. 
Bone mass measurement can be used to determine the status of a person's bone health and to predict the risk of future fractures. These tests are safe, painless, accurate and quick. Our expanding technology is adding new methods to determine bone mass and we need to keep up with this technology. The most commonly used test currently is DXA (Dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry). 
In order to ensure that we detect bone loss early, we need to ensure that older women have coverage for bone mass tests. Unfortunately, Medicare coverage is inconsistent in its coverage depending on where an individual resides. Instead of national coverage of the DXA test, Medicare leaves coverage decisions to local Medicare insurance carriers. The definition of who is qualified to receive a bone mass measurement varies from carrier to carrier. Some carriers require beneficiaries to have suffered substantial bone loss before allowing coverage for a bone density test. For example, in about 20 States, the carriers require x-ray proof of low bone mass or 
other abnormalities. Unfortunately, standard x-rays do not reveal osteoporosis until 25 to 40 percent of bone mass has been lost. 
One carrier allows pre-menopausal women to have a DXA test to determine whether hormone replacement therapy is indicated. However, it does not allow the test to determine treatment for the post-menopausal women--the majority of Medicare beneficiaries. Other carriers have no specific rules to guide reimbursement and cover the tests on a haphazard case-by-case basis. 
Frequency of testing also varies from carrier to carrier. Re-testing is important to monitor treatment, yet only eight states specifically allow coverage for people who are under treatment for osteoporosis. 
This patchwork coverage is confusing to beneficiaries, and means that an older woman who lives in one State will be covered, but if she moves to another state, she may not be. A woman may also lose coverage if she moves to another city within a given State. 
Mr. President, a woman shouldn't have to change zip codes to obtain coverage for a preventive test, especially when early intervention is the only action we can take right now to slow the loss of bone mass. Once it is lost, it cannot be replaced. 
The Medicare Bone Mass Measurement Standardization Act will clarify the Medicare coverage policy for DXA testing to make it uniform in all states. We all know that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. This bill will ensure that older women, regardless of where they live, will have access to bone mass measurement technology that will help detect bone loss and allow preventive steps to be taken. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today on Take Our Daughters to Work Day, to encourage young women and girls across America to set their sights high, and to reach for their dreams. 
Since my childhood, the composition of the work force has changed dramatically, and job opportunities have significantly increased for young women and girls. Today, women comprise 46 percent of the paid labor force, and according to Bureau of Labor and Statistics, by the year 2000, roughly half of new entrants into the labor force will be women. 
Despite these gains, studies show that during adolescence, girls often receive less attention in school and suffer from lower expectations than do boys. They also set their future sights lower than their male counterparts. This is reflected in a New York Times/CBS poll, which found that over one third of girls surveyed believed that there are more advantages to being a man than a women. For many girls, low self-esteem can lead them to lose confidence in their abilities, which may prevent them from achieving their fullest potential later in life. 
In this day and age, we cannot accept reduced opportunities for girls and women from either an equity standpoint or an economic one. Today, women are equally responsible for the well-being of their families. So it is not just their own futures that are at stake, but the future of their children and their children's children. It is our responsibility to set high standards and provide them with the experiences and role models that will inspire them to be extraordinary leaders of the future. 
We need to do far more to challenge our daughters' notions of women's work. While most school-age girls plan to work, they do not plan for careers that could sustain themselves and their families. In 1992, 53.8 million women were employed and only 3.5 million were employed in nontraditional occupations. Further, women working in nontraditional jobs earn 20 to 30 percent more than women in traditionally female jobs. Women remain significantly under-represented in careers requiring math and science skills--women comprise only 11 percent of today's technical work force, and only 17 percent of all doctors are women. Nearly 75 percent of tomorrow's jobs will require the use of computers, but girls comprise less than one-third of students enrolled in computer courses. And a study by the Glass Ceiling Commission found that women occupy only 5 percent of senior-level management of the top Fortune 1000 industrial and 500 service companies. As leaders and as parents, we must do our best to ensure that American girls are prepared to step into those high-wage jobs and management positions that command higher salaries in the work force. 
I was honored to endorse again, this year, Take Our Daughters to Work Day, organized by the Maine's Women's Development Institute, in my home State. Girls in Maine and across the Nation will have another opportunity to see first-hand that they have a range of life options. In the past, Take Our Daughters to Work Day has encouraged young girls to reach out and use their creative spirit and I am confident that this special day will prove again to be a rich and rewarding experience for all parents and daughters alike. 
Today, millions of parents across the Nation will take their daughters to work. In 1996, in Maine alone, 10,000 Maine girls and 5,000 Maine businesses participated in Take Our Daughters To Work Day. These parents perform a great service by exposing their daughters to new and exciting experiences. They are not only expanding their horizons and helping them to explore opportunities, but teaching them important lessons about goal-setting as well. Take Our Daughters to Work Day has encouraged a new generation of young girls to envision a world where no goal is impossible.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill designed to rectify an inequity in child support law which will enable families to keep more of past-due support owed to them. I am extremely pleased that my colleague from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, has joined me today in offering this bill, and that Representative Nancy Johnson is offering a companion bill in the House. 
Last year, my bill, the Child Support Improvement Act of 1996, was enacted into law as part of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (Welfare Reform Act). This bill contained comprehensive reforms to ensure that deadbeat parents could no longer renege on their responsibilities as parents to care for and support their children. It included provisions to dramatically improve States' ability to collect child support, particularly across State lines, and to take maximum advantage of computer technology in order to track down missing parents and ensure that child support gets paid promptly. It also will help increase the rate of paternity establishment, require the provision if health insurance coverage in child support orders, and improve the process for modifying support orders. In short, it promises to bring hope and financial stability to the millions of children and their single parents who depend on support from absent parents. 
I am introducing a bill today which will close one small loophole that remains outstanding. Prior to the enactment of the Welfare Reform Act last year, a State that collected child support arrearages for a family that had left welfare could choose to reimburse itself for welfare expenditures with the arrears that accrued before the during AFDC receipt, before it paid the family arrears that accrued after the family left AFDC. Two-thirds of States chose to pay themselves back for AFDC outlays before paying the family, leaving the family with little, if any, of the money that accrued after they left the rolls. The Welfare Act rightfully changes this to require States to first pay the family the arrears collected when the family was not on welfare, before it can reimburse itself for assistance outlays. This provision increases the likelihood of a family's success in leaving welfare by ensuring that the family receives more of the child support collected on its behalf. 
Unfortunately, a small provision inserted in conference creates an inequity for families, whereby arrears collected via a tax intercept (instead of wages garnished by the State) will not be affected by this change. It does not make sense that whether or not a family receives the funds depends on the method by which it is collected. This provision also rewards those States which do little to collect child support but rely instead on the Federal tax system to intercept the funds. My bill corrects this inequity by imposing the same distribution scheme on arrears collected through the tax intercept as it does on arrears collected by the States directly. This will ensure that families receive more of the past-due support that is owed to them, helping them to remain economically independent and to stay off welfare. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, which not only promises to help families, but will further our goals of keeping families off of public assistance.

Ms. SNOWE. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills intended to protect innocent Americans from the violent will of criminals and fugitives. One need take only a quick review of recent statistics to realize the chilling scope of our nation's crime problems. For instance, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that 11 million Americans were the victims of violent crime in 1994 alone. The Bureau of Justice Statistics also reports that approximately 3.5 million Americans were accosted at gunpoint during that same year. These statistics should galvanize us all into taking concrete steps to protect innocent Americans against senseless victimization and turn the tide against criminals once and for all. My bills will help to do just that. 
The first bill I introduce today, the Crime Control Act of 1997, will ensure that an individual convicted of committing a violent crime or engaging in drug trafficking activities while in possession of a gun, will go to jail for 10 years, and not a day less. If an offender fires a gun while committing those crimes, that offender will go to jail for 20 years. And should that criminal make the mistake of using a machinegun or a gun with a silencer to commit those crimes, that criminal will be incarcerated for 30 years. Once imprisoned, the Crime Control Act provides hardened criminals with no option for parole or reduced sentences that would allow them another chance to harm innocent citizens. 
Simply put, the passage of my Crime Control Act ensures that if you do the crime, you will most certainly do the time. And under my bill, that time won't be easy. A key initiative of the Crime Control Act is the creation of work programs for all able bodied prisoners by the Attorney General. In addition, my bill prohibits the government from providing any entertainment devices, like televisions, radios, or stereos, for use in individual prisoner cells. Federal prisons are not the place for entertainment. They are not intended to be fun. They are the places where individuals repay their debt to society and in the case of violent criminals, it is a very large debt indeed. My Crime Control Act makes sure that violent criminals pay that debt, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important and effective crime control measure. 
The second bill I introduce today applies directly to actions taken by fugitives who resist arrest. Over the past few years, America has witnessed an unfortunate trend involving standoffs between the U.S. Government and parties who reject its authority to enforce the laws of this land--specifically, the incidents in Waco, TX; Ruby Ridge, ID; and Garfield County, MT. Thankfully, the episode involving the Freemen did not escalate to violence or bloodshed. Regrettably, this does not hold true for Waco or Ruby Ridge, where there was a tragic loss of life to civilians and Government agents alike. 
Each of these situations jeopardized children's lives--innocent children who had no choice in the role they played in these standoffs. In Waco, 25 young children under the age of 15 died in the blaze that spread throughout the compound. These deaths occurred despite the repeated efforts by Federal agents to encourage Branch Davidians leaders to allow children to leave the compound. 
At Ruby Ridge, a 14-year-old died after being caught in gunfire. And during the Freeman standoff, Americans across the Nation held their breath--praying that violence would not erupt. Once again, the lives of children were placed in jeopardy. But thankfully, this time, the children--and adults--emerged unharmed. 
As we have seen, tragedy can occur in these very tense situations. Above all else, we need to ensure that children are kept out of these situations in the future. People who arm themselves after failing to comply with warrants or because they seek to avoid arrest must realize that, whether or not it is intended, children are implicated in these standoffs. We cannot allow this to continue any longer. We cannot allow another child's life to be endangered in this manner. 
This bill seeks to protect children from harm in these standoff situations. My bill would make it a crime to detain a child when two conditions are met: if a person is trying to evade arrest or avoid complying with a warrant, and that person uses force, or threatens to use force, against a Federal agent. Any person convicted of violating this act would be imprisoned for 10-25 years. If a child is injured, the penalty would be increased to 20-35 years. If a child is killed, the penalty would be life imprisonment. 
No law can ever assure that children will be kept free from harm. But this legislation will help assure that children do not become inadvertent, innocent pawns when violent situations arise. It will provide a deterrent to involving a child in any standoff--and severe penalties for those who ignore the law. 
Both of the bills I introduce today are aimed at protecting the innocents in our society, and I urge my colleagues to support them. America needs to be a place where innocent citizens do not have to fear for their life because gun-toting criminals and drug pushers linger on the streets. It needs to be a place where children are not the captives of adults intent upon resisting arrest. Freedom from violence and captivity are basic tenets of our society, which most Americans enjoy and respect. Those among us who don't share our respect for the laws of our society must realize that their actions are criminal, and that in America, criminal actions have repercussions. The passage of these bills will make sure that they do.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, March 25, 1997, marks a special day for the Greek people and for all the friends of Greece around the world. It is the 176th anniversary of the day in 1821 when the people of Greece declared their independence from centuries of political, religious and cultural repression under the Ottoman Empire. Greek independence was recognized 8 years later only after a long, hard-fought struggle during which the people of Greece made countless sacrifices for their freedom. 
Contemporary American leaders, such as James Monroe and Daniel Webster, recognized that the ideals of the American Revolution--individual liberty, representative democracy, and personal dignity--were also the foundation for Greece's declaration of independence. Americans in the 1820's quickly identified with the struggle of the Greek patriots because they knew in their hearts that it was a continuation of their own struggle for political and religious freedom. The same spirit of democracy that was born and flourished in Greece a thousand years ago, and which fanned the flames of the American revolution, inspired the Greek patriots to persevere in their struggle against their Turkish oppressors. 
The United States and Greece are now old friends and trusted allies. Our two nations and people are bound by unbreakable bonds which link us through common interests, values, and political heritage. It is clear that our cherished ideals of democracy and freedom are as strong as ever and continue to inspire other countries to follow our example. One need look no further than to the fledgling democracies of Eastern Europe and the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union to see the huge impact these ideals are still having on our world as we enter the 21st century. 
Independence, of course, must be guarded vigilantly, and in the past 176 years Greece's independence has been challenged by forces both external and internal. Therefore, even as we recognize and celebrate Greece's long independence today, we must also be mindful of the threats which Greece faces in today's world. The ongoing dispute with Turkey over the islet of Imia and the Albanian Government's recent military action near the Greek border serve as troubling reminders of Greece's vulnerability and the instability of the Balkan region. 
On this, the 176th anniversary of Greek independence, let us extend our warmest congratulations to the people of Greece. And let us also rededicate America's commitment to Greece and to strengthening the solidarity that exists between our two great nations.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of Charlene Barshefsky's nomination as the United States Trade Representative. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-snowe-me-2-19970305</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Ms. SNOWE. My reason for investigating this nomination was simple: to make certain that this nominee could be counted on to defend United States. interests in the trade arena, and to ensure that her past legal work for Canadian entities would not in any way influence the exercise of her duties as United States Trade Representative. 
Ms. Barshefsky's written responses to my questions, and on her responses to the questions of other senators and the Finance Committee, indicate that her nomination does not pose any such problems. 
As has been widely reported, Ms. Barshefsky worked, while an attorney for a Washington, DC, law firm, for several Canadian entities. But as her responses to the Senate detail, this work amounted to a tiny fraction of the total over the course of her 18-year career as a trade attorney in private practice. In fact, Ms. Barshefsky has certified to me and to the Finance Committee that her work for all Canadian Government entities represents less than 1 percent of the total hours that she spent working while in private practice. Furthermore, Ms. Barshefsky states in her responses to me that she never lobbied the U.S. Government on behalf of any foreign government or political party. 
I also questioned Ms. Barshefsky closely regarding her commitment to defend American interests in the arena of international trade. Ms. Barshefsky's responses are unequivocal. She states that she will forcefully defend and advocate American business interests in all international trade disputes, negotiations, and discussions involving the United States. She states that she will aggressively pursue all effective remedies to unfair trade practices committed by other countries against American businesses. And she states that she will pursue the strict adherence to, and vigorous enforcement of, all United States trade laws. 
Ms. Barshefsky also specifically says that, if confirmed, she will ensure that the USTR's office raises the issues of concern to the U.S. potato industry during our bilateral meetings with Canada. 
In addition to her words on paper, we also have Ms. Barshefsky's 
track record. She served as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative from 1993 to 1996, and as Acting U.S. Trade Representative for the past year. Her experience in these positions has given us a body of work to evaluate, and a record upon which to judge whether Ms. Barshefsky means what she says. And from what I have seen in her performance of her duties in these positions, through my own dealings with her, and from what other Senators have said, I believe that her deeds will be consistent with her words after she is confirmed. 
I have spoken with and sought the assistance of Ms. Barshefsky on several occasions over the past year. In each instance, I have found Ms. Barshefsky to be responsive and cooperative. She displayed a genuine interest in the problems facing my constituents, and offered a number of options through which the administration could be of assistance. 
I think it is also instructive to look at the Canadian softwood lumber issue. Although Ms. Barshefsky had, while in private practice, represented Canadian interests on the countervailing duty case that the United States filed against Canada in 1991, she later served as the second-highest ranking trade negotiator in the United States Government and participated in the negotiation of a bilateral agreement approved in 1996 that curtails subsidized Canadian softwood imports into the United States. That agreement has restored a measure of fairness to the lumber trade between the United States and Canada. And we would not have successfully concluded the agreement without the strong support of our senior trade officials like Ms. Barshefsky because the Canadians were under no legal obligations to sign an agreement with us. The United States had lost a succession of binational dispute resolution panel decisions on the issue up to that point, and had no way to legally require Canada to negotiate. 
Mr. President, I was concerned when I first learned about some of Ms. Barshefsky's past work, but upon investigating this matter and questioning Ms. Barshefsky, I accept her assurances that this work will not influence her decisions and actions as the U.S. Trade Representative. And I am confident that she will defend and advocate American interests in the international trade arena, consistent with the policies of the Clinton administration. I cannot find anything in the record that compels opposition to Ms. Barshefsky's nomination, and I believe that she has earned the support of the Senate.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding and compliment him on his leadership on this very important issue. 
Here we are having the same debate on the same issue and the same reversal of positions by Senators who have previously supported this amendment--the same excuses and the same problems. We don't have a balanced budget amendment. Two years ago the opponents of the balanced budget amendment said a constitutional amendment isn't necessary in order to achieve a balanced budget; that, in fact, the constitutional amendment is only an enforcement mechanism, but it isn't the balanced budget plan itself. They admonished Republicans by saying, `Show us your plan. Show us your plan.' The President, in the State of the Union Address in February, expressed the same sentiment. He said, `Rewriting the Constitution isn't necessary to balance the budget. All we need is your vote and my signature.' Exactly, Mr. President. Republicans delivered a balanced budget plan last year statutorily. We delivered a plan. We delivered it to the President of the United States. The President demonstrated with the swift stroke of the pen the need for a balanced budget amendment because he vetoed that legislation. 
History has proven that a force greater than politics is necessary in this institution in order to achieve a balanced budget. History has proven the repeated failures of statutory attempts to balance the budget. The last time we had a balanced budget was in 1969. We have only had a balanced budget five times since 1950. In fact, we have debated this amendment, in the last two decades, in 1982, 1986, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, and now here in 1997. And guess what? We don't have a statutory balanced budget. The fact is the opponents of the balanced budget amendment understand that you can't have a constitutional amendment without achieving a balanced budget.

Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President and Members of the Senate, I certainly compliment the Senator from Utah for his very compelling statement on the necessity of having a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. He rightfully points out the fact that if we fail to place this amendment in the Constitution, then there is no guarantee of providing fiscal stability for this country in the future. 
As we have made the case time and time again in this body, there is no issue more central to competitiveness, to security, to stability of America's future than the issue of a balanced budget. It means more jobs; it means increased wages; it means a better standard of living; it means less taxes; it means lower interest rates, all of which will benefit the American people and future generations. 
The overwhelming majority of people in America today are pessimistic about the future when it comes to their children and what kind of life they will enjoy. That is the essence of this 
issue. This issue points to the fact that we need to do all we can to reduce the Federal deficit, to reach a balanced budget, and begin to grapple with the burgeoning debt that we have compiled for generations. The fact is the next generation will be required to pay an 82-percent tax rate and a 50-percent reduction in benefits to manage and to finance the debt that we leave behind. 
I do not think that is the kind of legacy we want to bequeath the next generation. 
We have had this debate in this body in 1995 and on many previous occasions, and in fact when I served in the House of Representatives I can remember we had this debate in 1982, and we had it many times thereafter. We heard the same rationale each and every time, that we should be able to have a balanced budget without a constitutional amendment. In fact, the President himself said it in the State of the Union. He said we do not need to rewrite the Constitution; all we need is your vote and my signature. 
We as Republicans worked very hard in the last Congress to design a balanced budget plan with specifics and in great detail, without gimmicks. We presented it to the President of the United States, so he got our vote, but, unfortunately, we did not get his signature. 
I think the reason is that without a constitutional amendment, it does not force consensus on all sides and between both branches of Government. So ultimately there is no will and there is no self-discipline to reach a consensus on balancing the budget without a constitutional mandate. 
We have heard many reasons today as to why Senators cannot support this particular amendment. We have had many amendments that proposed exemptions to this amendment, all of which were designed and disguised as a rationale for avoiding supporting a constitutional amendment. 
Nothing could be further from the truth than suggesting that exempting the Social Security Program from this balanced budget amendment would protect the benefits of Social Security retirees. There is nothing in that amendment that would suggest that. In fact, quite the contrary. The Social Security trust fund, since its inception, has been on budget. We have always addressed the shortfalls. We have prepared for the future by redesigning the program, as was the case in 1983, with a bipartisan commission that was chaired by the head of the Federal Reserve Board, Chairman Greenspan, to address those concerns. 
We have no idea, we have no track record to know what would happen to the Social Security trust fund off budget. No one has presented us a plan for how the surpluses would be used. The surpluses on budget are invested in Government-backed bonds. But no one has told us, those who presented amendments exempting the Social Security trust fund, how these surpluses would be invested off budget. Would they be used and invested in private securities with a privatized Social Security? That is a major issue, and certainly I think it represents a consequence of placing the Social Security trust fund off budget. Would the Social Security trust fund off budget be diverted for other purposes? That is a real possibility, that those funds could be used for programs other than Social Security. So, if I were a retiree--and I will be one long after the turn of the century--I would be very much concerned about how those trust funds would be used. 
We have also heard and we know that, by exempting the Social Security trust fund from this amendment, we will have to further reduce Federal expenditures by $295 billion over the next 5 years, between now and the year 2002, in addition to the more than $250 billion that is required to reach a balanced budget in the year 2002. In addition to that, we would also be required to reduce the budget another $709 billion between the year 2002 and the year 2007. That represents $1 trillion in additional cuts above and beyond what will be required to reach a balanced budget. Again, I think we have a right to know, from those who propose this exemption, as to how they would reach that target, with an additional $1 trillion in cuts? In fact, if you carry it further, to the year 2019, it would be $1.9 trillion--$1.9 trillion in additional cuts. 
Mr. President, 2 years ago when we were having this debate, an amendment was offered by the minority leader that was called the right to know amendment. It says if you are going to propose a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, then, indeed, Members of this body have the right to know and are entitled to know as to exactly how we would accomplish balancing the budget. The same is true here today. We have a right to know exactly how these additional cuts will be accomplished over and above the cuts that already will be required in achieving a balanced budget between now and the year 2002 and then, of course, beyond. I repeat, it would require $1 trillion more in additional reductions in order to accomplish that. Yet, again, we do not have a plan as to how, exactly, that would be achieved. 
In the final analysis, it gets back to the central issue, the central question in this constitutional amendment. That is whether or not we are truly committed to engaging in fiscal responsibility so future generations can have a secure future. We have an obligation, as one generation to the next, to provide a better standard of living. I think it is regrettable that we in this Congress decide to pursue a direction that accepts budgets that suggest, somehow, that higher taxes, a lower standard of living, sub par growth and anemic recovery are acceptable in a global economy as we approach the 21st century. It is certainly not what I want for future generations. 
So, I hope we would consider this amendment for what it is. In reality, it is a way of avoiding the passage of this constitutional amendment because, in the final analysis, it does nothing to guarantee the benefits for Social Security retirees. In fact, I would say, quite the contrary, it raises a great deal of concern as to exactly what will happen to this trust fund, what will happen to the benefits for retirees, because we have no plan from the proponents of this amendment as to exactly how the off-budget program would work for Social Security and exactly how the surpluses would be used and whether or not this program, the trust fund, would be used for other purposes other than for Social Security benefits. 
So, I hope this body will reject this amendment. I yield the floor.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I think that it is interesting to hear the debate that has been underway this morning with respect to the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Frankly, this is probably--and is in many instances--the same debate we have had over and over and over again on this issue. I served 16 years in the House of Representatives, and we debated this issue. We debated this issue 2 years ago here in the U.S. Senate and lost by one vote, regrettably. But we hear the same arguments over and over again. I have been in Congress now for a total of 19 years, in both the House and Senate. We have debated this issue approximately eight times. What we have heard time and time again is, if we only had the will, or the courage, we would not need a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, that we should, as an institution, collectively be able to balance the budget without a constitutional requirement. Even the President stated that fact in his State of the Union Address to the Congress on 
February 4. He said, `Rewriting the Constitution isn't necessary to balance the budget. All we need is your vote and my signature.' 
Well, the fact of the matter is, he got our vote in the bill, which was a balanced budget submitted to the President, but we didn't get the President's signature. That's the problem. We don't have a constitutional requirement because there will always be a reason or an excuse as to why we can't balance the budget. Governors can't evade that constitutional requirement. Most Governors in this country today are required by their own constitutions, and they don't avoid that responsibility. The problem here is, there is a significant amount of avoidance because there is not an institutional will, or discipline, to balance the budget because it's difficult to make choices. 
So no one is willing to set any priorities. If we don't have a constitutional amendment, we are not required to establish these priorities and we are not willing to exhibit leadership on our own initiative. So Congress has had decades and decades of good intentions. History is replete with good intentions on imposing fiscal discipline. But we have failed in achieving a balanced budget. 
Now, we have heard a lot of discussion today about the past. We heard about the last 15 years. They talked about the Reagan Presidency and the Bush Presidency. But what was omitted from that discussion was the fact that we also had a Congress, and it happened to be a Democratic Congress. Now, does anyone happen to believe that these budgets that are down here, which are unbalanced, didn't have the support of the Democratic Congress? I think we all know the answer to that question. Congress played a very significant role in the adoption of the budget. There is blame to go around on both sides. I think we all recognize that. But to sit here and say that blame for the last 15 years of budget deficits can be placed on the Reagan and Bush Presidencies clearly is ignoring reality, because that is not what happened. 
In fact, I can recall back in the early eighties--in fact, I think it was 1983--there was an agreement between President Reagan and the Congress that for every dollar increase in taxes, there would be a $3 reduction in spending. Guess what? We got the dollar increase in taxes, but we didn't get the $3 reduction in spending. 
I should also say that there was a budget agreement in 1990 that certainly contributed to the declining deficits that we are experiencing right now, and everybody is referring to the Clinton administration and declining deficits. But what's ironic about those declining deficits--and we know there are serious problems beyond the turn of the century, but for now the deficits are declining compared to previous years--in talking about those declining deficits, the other side fails to mention that they also include the Social Security trust fund surpluses. So they want to sort of have it both ways. Look, the deficits are coming down. Yet, they do include the Social Security trust fund. If we are going to talk about honesty in budgeting, they ought to exclude them to show what the real deficit is. 
Every President has used the Social Security trust fund surpluses. There is no question that we have a serious problem beyond the turn of the century when we have the beginning of the baby boomers retiring. We have had an obligation, as we have always shown, since the inception of the Social Security trust funds, to pay those benefits to beneficiaries. That has been and will always be a sacred trust between the Government and the American people. 
We want to preserve and protect the Social Security trust fund. What is the best way to do it? It is to balance the budget so that we can rein in spending, so that we will be in a position to pay out the baby boomers' retirement. And that is the issue that is confronting us. If we rein in the debt, we have a better ability to preserve and protect the Social Security trust fund. 
I find it interesting that the debate today has centered around the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, not passing the straight face test, because it includes the trust funds of Social Security. What I find interesting about the amendment that has been offered by the Senator from Nevada is that it doesn't take off budget all the other trust funds--the highway trust fund, the aviation trust fund, and the numerous other trust funds that represent billions of dollars. If we are going to talk about honesty in budgeting, they don't include that. In fact, here we have an enormous list of trust funds. If we are talking about truth in budgeting, then we are talking about many other trust funds as well. 
The point is that the best way to preserve the Social Security trust fund is to balance the budget. The best way to protect the Social Security beneficiary payment checks is to keep it on budget, because that is the system that we have known. We have known how that system has worked. We have paid the benefits, and when there has been a problem with Social Security, we have addressed it, as was the case in 1983 with the bipartisan commission. But no one has told us on the other side exactly how this trust fund off budget is going to work. We have had no indication of what exactly is going to happen with those surpluses. Will they continue to be invested in Government bonds as they are today to pay off the debt and to write off the deficit, or are they going to be invested in private securities? Because that is also an issue. 
It raises a concern for me because I am now asking the question: If you place the Social Security trust fund off budget, what exactly is going to happen to those surpluses? In what way are they going to be used? Are they going to be privatized? I think that is an issue and a consequence that should be addressed, because that does raise some significant concerns. Will they be placed in noninterest-bearing accounts because we cannot buy Government bonds? If the other side says, `Yes, we are going to buy Government bonds with it,' that is exactly what we are doing right now. That is precisely the point. 
So, then, the amendment really isn't changing what we are doing right now. So essentially the amendment places us full circle in terms of what we are doing with the Social Security trust fund surplus. Because I have not heard how the surpluses are going to be used off budget. How are they going to be invested? That is a significant question. 
Two years ago when we had this debate on the constitutional amendment, there was a right-to-know amendment that was offered by the Democratic leader that would have required that Congress provide a detailed budget plan with binding reconciliation instructions before the amendment could even be sent to the States for ratification. And the intent of that amendment was essentially to say that Congress has a right to know how the budget is going to be balanced if this constitutional amendment were to pass and were to be ratified by the States. I think it is an interesting concept. 
We did present a balanced budget to the President, as I mentioned earlier. But it was vetoed. The fact is, we have a right to know, as was mentioned earlier by the Senator from Michigan, about exactly how we would accommodate the $295 billion in cuts that would be required in addition to the cuts that would be required in the balanced budget amendment. But $295 billion would have to be cut if we didn't take into account the surpluses in the Social Security trust fund just between now and the year 2002. But no one on the other side has identified exactly how we achieve that goal. That is double the amount of cuts that President Clinton submitted in his plan to the Congress that he declared to be balanced. So there would be $295 billion in cuts over and above the cuts that will be required as well to balance the budget if we could not use the surpluses. 
Then the period between the year 2002 and 2007 would require the Congress to come up with an additional $706 billion. And, again, we have not heard from the other side exactly how that would be achieved because that would be over and above what we would be required to do in order to balance the budget without the surpluses. 
So we are talking close to $1 trillion--more than $1 trillion--in additional cuts that will be required by Congress over and above what we have presented. These are difficult choices and difficult times. So we have to account for $1 trillion more. And we have yet to hear how that will be accomplished. We have not seen a detailed plan, and we have a right to know, as the other side declared 2 years ago in suggesting that they had the right to know what would be the detailed balanced budget plan to balance the budget if we were 
to pass a constitutional amendment. They demanded a right to know. We demand a right to know because many have said on the other side that if we pass the Reid amendment, we can vote for the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. But we need to know. What is their plan for coming up with $1 trillion in additional cuts? One trillion dollars is a significant amount over and above what we have already proposed to do. But we have yet to hear the details. 
I think, frankly, since they insisted 2 years ago that we apply the standard of right to know, that we should apply the same standard to the Reid amendment today that we have a right to know, because to do otherwise, I think, is failing to meet their responsibility in meeting the standard of honesty in budgeting. The American people have a right to know exactly how that will be accommodated. 
We have known that when the Social Security trust fund has been on budget that we have met our obligations, and we will continue to meet our obligations. We also know that by balancing the budget, it will constantly make us aware of our obligation to the Social Security trust fund in what we can anticipate beyond the turn of the century in more people beginning to retire and with the onset of the baby-boomer retirements. We think that it is important to stay with the system that has worked since the inception of the Social Security system. But with the Reid amendment, we are being asked to act in blind faith. 
The Social Security trust fund, as we know it, has had proven success. But they have failed to answer the question of what occurs when this trust fund is off budget. What happens to the trust fund? What happens to the surpluses? 
We have not heard those questions answered. And how will those trust funds be used? 
So I think that these are some serious questions that need to be addressed and have certainly broad implications because we certainly should worry that these questions remain unanswered. We understand the trust fund within the context of the budget that we know. We have always met our obligations under the trust fund, and we will continue to meet our obligations under the trust fund. But we need to hear from the proponents of the Reid amendment exactly what is going to happen with this trust fund off budget. Will the surpluses be diverted for other purposes? That is a possibility. The amendment is poorly drafted. Will the surpluses be invested in private securities? It is a major problem. It may have major consequences. That has yet to be thoroughly explored. Will they be invested in Government bonds? That is exactly what is happening here today. 
So then I think one could conclude that really this is not necessarily changing what we do today but just making a political point because, unfortunately, there are those who are not committed to a constitutional amendment and do not want to see the reality of such an amendment because of what it would require of this Congress and a President to make certain decisions in reaching a balanced budget. 
So I hope that in the course of this debate we will hear some of the answers to these questions because I certainly am troubled by the prospects of some of the issues that this amendment raises. 
I am a strong supporter of the Social Security system. I want a strong system. We have known how it has worked on budget, but we have not heard the questions answered about how it is going to work off budget, and I repeat that because that in the final analysis I think underscores the issues before us today. I think it unfortunate that the Social Security issue has been used so many times in the past as a political issue. And from this debate at times we would know there are strong supporters of the Social Security trust fund on this side. I have been a very strong supporter over the years, and I just want to assure senior citizens in America that we will continue to preserve and protect them, and the best way to do it is to contain Federal spending and reduce the interest rates in America so that we can prepare ourselves for the commitments we must make in the 21st century to the younger generations as well as to retirees. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, and Members of the Senate, I rise in strong support of this resolution to expedite the release of already appropriated funds for international family planning. This resolution essentially reaffirms the President's certification that the delaying of these funds which were appropriated last year will cause serious and irreparable harm to family planning programs 
around the world. 
The life and health of women and children should transcend politics and party lines. The United States has traditionally been a leader in family planning assistance around the world for more than 30 years. It has enjoyed strong bipartisan support for such leadership. It has had unrivaled influence worldwide in setting standards for these programs. 
These family planning assistance programs fund voluntary family planning services, contraceptive research, maternal health programs and child health programs. An estimated 50 million families in over 60 developing countries, with a combined population of 2.7 billion people across the world, use family planning as a direct result of U.S. population assistance programs. 
There is no question that our support and our assistance over the last 30 years in developing countries has been enormously successful. The average family size in countries that receive our assistance has decreased from six children to three children. The Agency for International Development has increased the use of contraceptives in developing countries from 10 percent of married couples in the 1970's to 50 to 60 percent today. 
Yet, there is still a great need for additional family planning assistance. In developing countries, maternal mortality is the single leading killer of women in their reproductive years, with 600,000 women dying annually from pregnancy-related complications. Family planning could reduce the deaths by one-fifth. It is estimated one out of five infant deaths could be averted if all children were spaced at an interval of at least 2 years. 
Unfortunately, the passage of the omnibus appropriations bill last year came at a heavy price for U.S. family planning assistance programs. As we all know, fiscal year 1997 funds cannot be spent until July 1, and at only 70 percent of the 1995 level, and on a monthly basis of 8 percent over the next 12 1/2 months. 
As a result, family planning assistance by our Government will be reduced from $547 million in 1995 to only $385 million during 1997. This translates into a 30 to 35 percent cut of $162 million. If we delay the funding for these programs until July 1, we are talking about delay in funding of another $123 million. 
We agreed to these cuts and restrictions only because we wanted to avoid a Government shutdown given that there was a difference between the House and the Senate on this issue. The Senate rightfully took the position that we should fund these programs without the Mexico City language. But in order to protect these programs, we inserted language requiring a vote on the President's certification that is before us today. 
I can assure Members that the failure to release these funds now will have a devastating impact on women, children, and families all over the globe, and particularly in developing countries. Countless programs have already been suspended or halted, as mentioned by the Senator from Wisconsin, and if the funds are released in July rather than now, dozens of programs may be forced to permanently close their doors, including programs in Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, the Philippines, and elsewhere. These programs are critical in preventing unplanned pregnancies, reducing infant mortality, reducing rates of HIV infection, and promoting maternal and child health. 
So there is no question, as the President has indicated, there will be irreparable harm to these programs. More than that, the Alan Guttmacher Institute and other research institutions predict as a result of just the funding cuts alone, not even the delay in funding, but just in the funding cuts alone, 7 million couples in developing countries who would have used modern contraceptives will be left without access to family planning. Four million more women will experience unintended pregnancies. 
Now, according to the World Health Organization, 40 percent of unintended pregnancies result in abortions. So we can expect 1.6 million more abortions and countless miscarriages; 1.9 million more unplanned births, often to families, as we know, living in terrible poverty conditions and who cannot afford another child; 
8,000 more women dying in pregnancy and childbirth, and 134,000 infant deaths. These figures relate to the funding cuts alone. They do not even take into account the effect of the metering out, on a monthly basis for 12 1/2 months, of this funding, or, most importantly, the significant delay in funding. 
Make no mistake about it, a vote against this resolution is a vote for more abortions, more women dying, more children dying. That is what I think is inconceivable in this debate--that those individuals who are against abortion are also against family planning. That is the bottom line in this debate. I have been debating this issue since 1985. Time and time again there hasn't been one single shred of evidence to suggest that U.S. population assistance funding is going for abortions or abortion-related activities in other countries. 
Senator Leahy was absolutely correct when he discussed the implications of the fungibility argument if applied to our assistance to foreign governments. We give assistance to foreign governments who allow abortions in their countries, according to their laws. We don't impose the requirement that if they use their money for abortion-related activities, we will not provide them foreign assistance. But this is a standard we are using for private organizations who have been instrumental in reducing the incidence of abortion worldwide. That should be of interest to all of us, given the enormous implications of population growth in the future. 
So I suggest that some are trying to bury their heads in the sand, taking an ostrich-like approach to this entire issue, to suggest that somehow if we don't provide family planning assistance, we will have fewer abortions in the world. The statistics do not bear that out. 
I hope that the Senate will overwhelmingly support this resolution, because I think that there is no question that it is in America's interest and it is in the world's interest. The United States has traditionally taken a leadership role for more than 30 years on international family planning. In fact, the first Presidential message was issued by a Republican President, President Nixon, back in 1969, saying that population growth was a world problem. America has always shown an inclination for humanitarianism through population assistance funding. We should be predisposed to doing the same thing in this body here today. To do less will impose serious hardship on women and children in developing countries. We know the strain it is going to impose. We know there will be millions fewer couples who have access to family planning assistance because we are undercutting our support. If we undercut our support, I can assure you that other countries will follow suit and it will affect an already fragile international family planning system program worldwide. 
When you think about the future, we should be concerned because it will provide an enormous strain on economic and social stability all around the world. In the next decade, the number of women of reproductive age will increase from 185 million to 900 million women. That is 10 times the size of Mexico. So I know there will be grave consequences of this incremental decrease in U.S. support for international family planning year after year. How can we incrementally undercut our family planning assistance to those organizations who have been the most effective, the most instrumental in preventing unplanned pregnancies and improving maternal and child health? 
I can assure you of one other point: Not one dime has been spent--and it bears repeating here today, and let there be no misunderstanding--there has not been one U.S. dollar that supports abortion or abortion-related activities in other countries. We have had that prohibition in law since 1973. The fact of the matter is, those funds are maintained separately, and there is monitoring and independent reviews on an annual basis. That is why I believe that former Senator Mark Hatfield, who was a pro-life Senator for many years in the U.S. Senate, wrote a letter to a colleague in the House of Representatives, saying that there 
is no evidence to suggest that our funding has ever gone for abortion or abortion-related activities in other countries through our family planning assistance programs. In fact, he goes on to say that we are contributing to the increase in abortions worldwide by our failure to provide this assistance. 
So I hope, Mr. President, for these and many other reasons I have highlighted, that my colleagues will support this resolution. It is in our interest and in the world's interest. As the Senate votes tomorrow on this resolution, I hope that these facts will not be forgotten. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I think it is important for the American people to know how significant and important this debate is on the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I served 16 years in the House of Representatives and am now in my third year in the U.S. Senate. Some have argued that when we debate this amendment, we are hearing the same old argument over and over again. That is true, because we have the same problem year in and year out. That is why those of us who support a constitutional amendment feel so strongly about the necessity to have this amendment in the Constitution of the United States because it will ensure stability and security for the future of this country and for our children and our grandchildren. 
Having served in this overall institution for 19 years now, we have heard the debate on the constitutional amendment. This is about our eighth time in either the House or the Senate, or both, that we have been debating this issue. Guess what? Each and every time we have heard the same arguments over and over again as to why we don't need a constitutional amendment, that it is not necessary, that we can do it on our own, that if only we had the will or the discipline, we could enact a balanced budget, that it is simply not necessary. Well, if that was the case, why then don't we have a balanced budget? Why is it that we are still trying to enact a balanced budget? Why is it that we are still trying to reach an agreement with the President of the United States on a balanced budget? 
The President said the other day in his State of the Union Address, `We don't need to rewrite the Constitution of the United States. All we need is your vote and my signature.' Well, we gave him our vote on a balanced budget. It was submitted to the President of the United States last year. Guess what? We didn't get his signature. 
That is the problem. We can all have our disagreements about the particulars. But in the final analysis what is required in a balanced budget amendment is that you have to agree to the bottom line. There is a bottom line. What this amendment says is that total outlays will not exceed total receipts in any fiscal year. I know that is a concept that is difficult to understand in this institution because it is nothing that we have ever been required to do. What we feel is important to the security interests of this country is to ensure that we have balanced budgets in perpetuity. 
Almost every State in the country is required to have a balanced budget. Yes. Most of them are required to balance their budgets because of a constitutional amendment in their State constitution, like my State of Maine. My husband served for 8 years as Governor. Believe me, they didn't argue with particulars of the constitutional amendment. They understood what they had to do because they took an oath of office as each and every one of us does in the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives. We are required to uphold the Constitution of the United States as each and every Governor is required to uphold their State constitution. 
So what they did in good faith is reach an agreement on a budget, and in their case a biennial budget. Yes, if their estimates were wrong, they made adjustments. Their constitutions are not prescriptions for perfection. It is an 
attempt to comply with the constitution. That is what the Governors and the State legislatures do all across the country. If their estimates are wrong, if their projections for interest rates, unemployment rates, or inflation rates are wrong, they make adjustments throughout the year or at the end of the year, because they understand they are required to balance the budget. 
So, I find it sort of nothing short of extraordinary that we sit here and argue, `Well, this amendment is providing too much flexibility because we are relying on estimates.' Yet, on the other hand we are facing numerous challenges and propositions to a constitutional amendment to balance the budget that would enhance our flexibility because there are those who argue, from across the aisle and other opponents, who say, `Well, a constitutional amendment is too restrictive, we can't respond to circumstances such as recessions or downturns of the economy, a national economic emergency of some kind.' So we are getting it from both sides--from those who say it is too restrictive and other opponents who argue saying it isn't restrictive enough. That is the problem here. Because in the final analysis, if we are truly interested in ensuring that we balance our budget, I suggest that we could overcome our institutional opposition by passing a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. 
As I have said in the past to those who argue that, `Well, it is just really a gimmick,' if there was a gimmick, Congress would have passed it long ago because Congress loves gimmicks. But this constitutional amendment isn't a gimmick. It is an attempt to put our fiscal house in order. 
It is interesting. We get this coming and going, if you listen to the debate. We have charts that show declining deficits. But what about the charts that show the deficits moving up beyond the turn of the century and even before that time? We will be required in the year 2002 alone to reduce the deficit to balance the budget by $188 billion. But the opponents will not tell you about the deficits in future years that will double and triple--double and triple. In the year 2025 alone, the deficit will be in that one year alone $2 trillion. You know 2025 isn't that far away, if you think about your children and your grandchildren and the staggering debt that they will be required to assume because we are just passing it on. 
In fact, if we do not manage this debt, the next generation will be required to pay an 82-percent tax rate and see a 50-percent reduction in their benefits. And that is a fact. 
Are we not required or obligated to address that question? An 82-percent tax rate and a 50-percent reduction in benefits. That is what we are leaving to the next generation. I know I and others as strong proponents of this amendment share a true responsibility to begin to address this question. I would like to think that we have faith in this institution sufficient enough to know that this can happen. But it will not and it has not. 
The last time we balanced the budget in the U.S. Congress was the same year that Neil Armstrong landed on the Moon. That is what these 28 unbalanced budgets on this desk represent. That is the point. Since 1950, we have only had five surpluses--five. In a century, practically speaking, 27 times. That is the track record. That is the historical track record. 
Is that the gamble we want to take for the next generation? I say not. And that is why I am prepared to take the risk in terms of the interpretation of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, because it is that important to our future. And so each and every time we hear everybody saying: `We can do it; it is important, I agree; we should have a balanced budget; we can do it on our own,' just think for a moment. We have not had one since 1969. 
The fact is we cannot even agree statutorily. We had that debate last year for a long time. In fact, a group of us on a bipartisan basis offered our own plan to try to serve as a catalyst for this debate. In fact, we received 46 votes. And I did not like everything in that budget, I have to tell you. But I was willing to agree to it because I thought the bottom line was that important. I do not doubt for a moment that it is difficult to reach an agreement among 100 Senators or 435 Members of the House, so a total of 535, plus the President of the United States. But there has to be some give-and-take in this process, some flexibility in order to reach the bottom line. Unfortunately, we have too much flexibility because we are not required to balance the budget. Oh, sure, we have some statutes, but Congress has long ignored those statutory requirements to balance the budget--long ignored them. That is why a constitutional amendment is so important. 
I frankly think there is no greater issue, no issue more central to the economic future of our country as well as to our children and to our grandchildren than balancing the budget. I know the administration is touting an economic recovery, but I have to tell you there are not a lot of people in my State participating in a full economic recovery. Many people are feeling very anxious about the future, about their children's future. The overwhelming majority of Americans--in fact, some polls say as high as 88 percent--have said that they do not believe the next generation will achieve the American dream. 
I say that is disheartening, and yet I can understand why people would feel pessimistic, because they know they are working hard to try to make ends meet, and they know their children will be working hard to make ends meet in order to maintain a decent standard of living. 
We have heard, well, household income is up. But the real household income in America today is down below the levels of 1990 when we were facing a recession. And certainly my State and New England, California were the hardest hit regions in this country. But that is because there are more people working in the family today; they are having more jobs in order to make 
ends meet. 
There was a cartoon last year showing the President touting the millions of jobs that had been created, and the waiter serving him lunch said, `Yeah, and I have four of them.' That is the point. People are having to work longer and harder than ever before to make ends meet. 
So then you look at the tax burden. We have heard a lot of discussion about taxes. The tax burden is high. It now represents 38 percent of a family's income--more than food, shelter, and clothing combined. So not only are people working longer and harder in more jobs, but also they are facing a rising tax burden. 
Then we hear about economic growth, and we have seen the projections for the future--2.3, 2.1, 2.5, but the average projected growth for America in the next 5 years is about 2.3 percent. If we had had that growth rate for the last 30 years, we would not have achieved today's economy until the year 2003. We would have had 13 million fewer jobs in America. 
The point is that this balanced budget is crucial to American families because it means more income in their pockets. That is the bottom line. That is the mathematics of it all, because the less the Government spends, the less it borrows, the more money American families will have in their pockets. That means savings to them. It means their car loans, their student loans, their mortgages will be less costly. That is a fact. In fact, all combined, they could realize a savings of $1,500 a year because interest rates will be less. 
That is real money to the average American family. It is less money they have to give to their Government. It is more money that they have to spend. Frankly, that is what this debate is all about, how we can improve the standard of living for American families and begin to think about our priorities here in the Congress and the priorities for our Nation. But when you do not have to meet a bottom line like every family does in America, every business, every State, you do not have to think about what is a priority anymore. You do not have to think how well or efficiently or effectively we will spend the hard-earned taxpayers' dollars. We just do not have to think about it because we can just incur deficits year in and year out. Even the President's budget that he submitted to the Congress last week adds another $1 trillion over the next 5 years. And that is supposed to be a balanced budget. 
That is what we are talking about. So that is why I happen to think a constitutional amendment to balance the budget is the only course of action that we can take to ensure prosperity for the future. 
I know we can have our differences, but in the final analysis we ought to agree that this is the one step we can take. A balanced budget will be great for American families. It will be great for America because it will expand economic growth, and economic growth is the engine that drives a healthy economy. It will help to increase wages, create more jobs, unleash millions, billions of dollars in capital to allow this country to expand and to grow. I do not think we ought to accept budgets that compromise our economic standards, our economic opportunities, because that is what unbalanced budgets do. 
We are facing a very competitive future in this global economy. The American people understand that. They understand that, and they are worried because they are not certain how their children will be able to prepare for that competitive economy. 
That is why education has become a central issue and a central part, I know, of our agenda here in the Senate, and a central part of the President's agenda--because we are going to have to prepare to make investments in education, not only for the basic education needs of Americans but also in continuing education so they are constantly prepared for the changes in skills and technology. But, in order to make those investments, we have to set priorities in our budgets. We have to have more money to spend. That is why I think balancing the budget and investing in education are not mutually exclusive goals; that you can be fiscally responsible but at the same time be visionary, be compassionate about the investments that we need to make as priorities for America. That is what a constitutional amendment to balance the budget will do, because it will require us to do it each and every year, to examine and reexamine our priorities and how well these programs are functioning. 
We have an obligation to make sure that every dollar that is spent is spent wisely and efficiently. Under the current budget process, there is no such requirement. 
John F. Kennedy once said, `The task of every generation is to build a road for the next generation.' I cannot think of a more important road than the one that leads to fiscal security for future Americans. We have no less an obligation to ensure that, because never before has one generation delivered to the next generation a lower standard of living. But we are in danger of doing that now, and that is why I think it is so important that we grapple with reality and reach the conclusion that the only way we can ensure that prosperity and security for Americans is by enacting a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. 
I yield floor.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I think we all accept the fact that this body faces so many great decisions on such a regular basis that it is sometimes difficult to focus on one vote or one debate that stands apart as a truly monumental decision, a truly monumental vote. 
But, let me be clear. I think the Senate is now entering such a debate, and later this month, this body will face such a vote. The stakes could not be higher. With a balanced budget constitutional amendment, this Senate will face perhaps its defining moment as we lay the foundation for our fiscal agenda of our Nation's coming century--as we decide how this Nation will conduct its affairs. Who can doubt that future generations will look upon this debate and this vote with great historical interest as a crossroads in our country's national affairs. Who can doubt, with this vote, these future generations will praise us for bringing America's economic house in order, or they will blame us for simply passing the buck when we could have stopped a mounting national crisis. 
Mr. President, as an idea, the concept of a balanced budget is hardly new. Many in this body have rightly championed it for many, many years. Leading economists across our Nation have spoken and written of its value, and many of the Nation's brightest business minds from Wall Street to Main Street have urged its passage. There is no politics in any of these voices. They simply speak the truth: A balanced budget is the first step on the road to long-term prosperity for America. 
But perhaps most convincingly, Mr. President, the balanced budget constitutional amendment is not just supported by these impressive voices. It is also championed by a nation of citizens who, for months and years, have been urging this body to take action, to pass the balanced budget constitutional amendment for the sake of our Nation and our children. According to a CBS-New York Times poll conducted January 30 and February 1, an astounding 76 percent of our citizens favor this amendment. From parents who care about the economic future of their children to teenagers who are worried about their future, the call for a balanced budget has been loud. Some would say it has been deafening. 
Yet, the regrettable reality still exists. Unable to pass the balanced budget amendment, our Nation has run staggering deficits year after year that stifle our Nation's economic growth and prosperity, suffocate our future generations, and ultimately eradicate public confidence in our Nation's fiscal management to the point where only 12 percent of the American people, according to a CBS-New York Times poll, think we will balance the budget by the year 2002. Unfortunately, Mr. President, the American people are losing confidence in our willingness and ability to act. They have lost confidence in our ability as a nation to face the challenges as we approach the 21st century. 
So let us in this debate consider some of the facts, because facts, as has often been said, are stubborn things. And the facts, when properly considered, point us unequivocally toward the merit of a balanced budget amendment. 
First, I want this body to listen carefully to an assessment issued just last May by the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO, as my colleagues well know, is not a partisan voice; it has no real stake in this debate, except to ensure the facts are properly considered. But its assessment of deficit spending could not be more troubling. 
According to the CBO report: `The budget deficits projected for future years are so large that they could put an end to the upward trend in living standards that the Nation has long enjoyed. Thus, current U.S. budget policies cannot be sustained without risking substantial economic damage.' 
Substantial economic damage, that's right, Mr. President, is what we run the risk of bringing to this Nation if we do not act now. The CBO report goes further. Should we fail to bring our deficits to a halt, our economy will enter what CBO calls a period of `accelerating decline.' 
`Accelerating decline,' `substantial economic damage'--in my 18 years in Congress, I have read a lot of CBO reports, a lot of analyses of our Nation's economy, and I can tell you, the warnings and the wordings do not get more dire than these. 
I know there are some who may say, `Yes, I, too, support balanced budgets, and I, too, oppose deficits, but a balanced budget amendment, well, that goes too far, that binds us unnecessarily.' 
Mr. President, let us be clear about two further facts. First, these past three decades have shown that our political culture, the ways of our democratic governance, great as they are, do not always lend themselves well to fiscal prudence. My colleagues will recall that we tried before to reduce our deficits through statutory means. You can see right here that these number of budgets for the last 28 years have shown that we have failed. Let's look at the history of our efforts. 
Next to me, I have two charts. The first documents 33 years of good intentions--5 more years than these unbalanced budgets--statutory efforts that required or promised to balance the budget of our Nation. All the greatest hits from the past are here from the Revenue Act of 1964 through Gramm-Rudman-Hollings of 1987, and more recently was the infamous Budget Act. 
But as we can see on this chart, the statutes don't work. Gramm-Rudman-Hollings II; Gramm-Rudman-Hollings I; Recodification of title 31, 1982; Bretton Woods agreement, 1980; debt limit increase, 1979; Byrd amendment; Humphrey-Hawkins Act; Revenue Act of 1978; and Revenue Act of 1964. These are just some of the examples of our statutory efforts in the past. 
I might also add, over the years, we have had a number of balanced budget amendments in both the House and the Senate, and I point back to October 1, 1982. The House failed to pass a resolution getting two-thirds, and the Senate adopted a balanced budget constitutional amendment, August 4, 1982. Unfortunately, we didn't pass it in Congress, but as far back as 1982, we debated a balanced budget amendment. Each and every time, when we have had those debates on the amendments, everybody said, `We can do it on our own if we only have the will. We really don't need a constitutional amendment.' 
Yet, Mr. President, this graph speaks for itself. Statute after statute has been passed by this body, but this deficit has kept right on marching. The lesson, I think, is clear--fail to pass this amendment and we reject perhaps the greatest fiscal lesson of modern times. 
This deficit is not going to be halted through statutes. I think this is a good indication with these 28 years of unbalanced budgets. The last time we had a balanced budget is when Neil Armstrong landed on the Moon. The only way we are going to stop deficit spending and reach a balanced budget is through an amendment. 
The second chart I have behind me reveals some other important aspects to this entire debate. First, a close examination of our budget history dating back, I might add, to 1905, reveals that deficits have been the norm, not the exception, as we can see. The deficits are in the red bars below the line. And the green--you can barely see it--is above the line, which would represent the years in which we have had surpluses between 1905 and 2005. Some of those are estimates for the projections by CBO for future years. That is last year's estimate. They may be a little bit better than that with this year's estimate. But, nevertheless, it gives a broad indication of the fact that we are going to continue to have major deficits in the future. It also has shown that we have had generally a century of deficits with very few exceptions. 
These deficits go back decades. Very rarely we found efforts in which we have been able to have a surplus. So I think that this chart reveals that we have had a century of failure of statutory efforts to balance the budget. 
Now, some have said, well, a balanced budget amendment is just a gimmick. As I have said before on the floor, and I will say it again, if this amendment was really a gimmick, we would have passed it long ago because Congress loves gimmicks. 
Mr. President, this is no gimmick. This is the first necessary step--a brave, bold and thoughtful step--on the road to fiscal sanity. 
The second point, in response to these critics, is that the balanced budget amendment does allow us in the event of some national crisis, disaster or massive economic downturn to run a deficit. With a three-fifths majority we can take the steps necessary to address any existing crisis that threatens our Nation and requires a commitment of our national financial resources above and beyond a balanced budget. 
When Members of this body vote yes for a balanced budget amendment, they are not prohibiting our country from ever running a deficit. We are simply making it the rare exception. So, Mr. President, I view this as a most responsible approach to the problem. 
I know some may be thinking that certainly we can escape this debate one more time, we can duck the big question one more time, we can conveniently leave this decision to others one more time. Well, again, Mr. President, facts are stubborn things, and they suggest a very different reality. 
The deficit of this Nation was $107 billion last year. Left unchecked, according to CBO, it will double by the year 2004. And by the year 2007, if we fail to act, it is expected to reach a staggering $278 billion. Put another way, the deficit comprised 2 percent of the GDP in 1995. Should we stand aside and do nothing? According again to statistics from CBO, this deficit will rise to 5 percent of the GDP by the year 2010 and 37 percent by the year 2030. The message of those statistics could not be more blunt: Time is ticking. 
In fact, in the year 2025 alone--in that year alone--the deficit will be $2 trillion. So the deficit, obviously, in future years is going to double and triple. 
Lest there be any doubt about the ramifications of all this, consider this. If we can prevent these staggering deficits and bring the budget into balance permanently through this constitutional amendment, our Nation will be the big winner. We 
will experience a 25 percent growth in the GNP per capita by the year 2030, according to CBO--a 25 percent growth per person, Mr. President. That means growth for our Nation's economy. It means jobs. It means higher standards of living. It means a positive difference in people's lives and their futures and their children's futures. These are the things that this Senate must take very, very seriously. 
So to those who say, well, the balanced budget amendment is just a product of deficit hawks, I say, take a close look at these CBO numbers. This is an economic growth initiative. This is about the future. This is about our children and our grandchildren. This is about economic security. It is about providing for a stronger standard of living, not a lower standard of living, because we are incurring debts and deficits to bequeath to the next generation. 
What about interest rates? I know this body knows well that growth is intimately linked to the rates of borrowing. That is no secret. Pay higher interest rates for a car, higher interest rates for a house, and you soon find less and less people able or willing to make that purchase. Production goes down, jobs get fewer. That, too, is no secret. 
But consider for a moment, Mr. President, the actual impact the amendment can have on our citizens. Look at the projections for lower interest rates if we pass a constitutional amendment to ensure the continuity of balanced budgets into the future, year after year after year, not just the year 2002. 
We have had estimates by the Joint Economic Committee that says that we could have a 2 percentage point decline in interest rates by the year 2002 if we have a balanced budget. The DRI-McGraw-Hill projection says that interest rates could drop even further, could drop more than 2.5 percent if we pass this amendment. 
That means lower cost to people in terms of their mortgages and car loans and student loans, whatever the case may be in terms of borrowing. And that is real money to the average American family. 
It means that Americans who now pay $570 a month on an $80,000 mortgage, when that mortgage is paid at an interest rate of 7.7 percent, if we pass the constitutional amendment, this rate would fall to an estimated 5.7 percent, bringing that mortgage payment down to $464 a month according to the Joint Economic Committee. The result is a $1,272 mortgage savings per year for this family, all because we have taken the right steps through an amendment. 
That again is real money to the average American family who works hard and sees more of their hard-earned dollars being taken in terms of taxes. We have seen the tax burden escalate in this country. It is the highest historically because taxes consume more now than food, shelter and clothing combined. 
But also look at what a balanced budget amendment would mean in savings--in excess of $1,500 to the typical middle-income family, counting their interest savings on all of these loans, on mortgage loans and car loans and student loans, according to the Joint Economic Committee. 
Now, Mr. President, President Clinton is talking about building a bridge to the 21st century. That is fine. But, with this vote, we will go far in defining what kind of bridge this will be. This bridge to the 21st century can be solid, constructed on strong beams, capable of moving the American people safely and securely, or it can be a hazardous and rickety bamboo bridge suspended by worn ropes over the chasm of our national deficit. 
Pass the balanced budget amendment and we lay the ground for a solid foundation for this bridge into the next century. Pass the buck on the balanced budget amendment and we cross this bamboo bridge literally on borrowed time. 
So the decision will be ours. I think we know the right thing to do. We know the danger, indeed, the very threat, to our Nation of ongoing deficits and deficits. We know that we need stronger steps of fiscal self-discipline. I doubt that any Member of this great body, knowing what they know about the dangers of deficits and our historical inability to end them without this amendment and the many benefits of this amendment, can rise in good conscience to defend the status quo. 
Now only one question remains, and it is this: Will we have the strength and the courage and the wisdom to implement it? Mr. President, let this Senate answer this vital question without hesitation. For the sake of our Nation and its future, let this answer be yes. Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to create additional office closure certification criteria for National Weather Service offices located in geographical areas of concern designated by the National Research Council. The amendment is designed to guarantee that weather services will be fully maintained in these areas after the National Weather Service completes its modernization plan. 
My bill adds a new paragraph to section 706(e) of the Weather Service Modernization Act of 1992. This section deals with `special circumstances' under which the Secretary may not close or relocate a NWS field office unless he meets certain specified certification criteria in addition to the standard certification criteria that apply to all field offices. 
This legislation would create another special circumstance category for offices that serve parts of the country identified as `areas of geographic concern' in the National Research Council's June 1995, report on the modernization program. The NRC identified 32 such areas of concern across the country, including Caribou, ME, Williston, ND, Baton Rouge, LA, and Kalispell, MT, in which a National Weather Service field office has been proposed for closure under the modernization plan and the people who live in the area have expressed serious concerns about the impacts of it. 
My bill would prohibit the Secretary from closing or relocating these offices unless he first evaluates the effect of a closing or relocation on all weather information and services provided to local users; and, second, he includes in the standard certification required under section 706(b), a determination that at least an equivalent level of weather services will be provided in the future. 
This amendment provides an additional but very important layer of scrutiny to NWS plans to close field offices in areas of the country--a number of which are sparsely populated and rural--specified in the NRC report. It provides an extra safeguard for these communities to ensure that they will continue to receive at least the same level of weather information and services that they currently receive. Without adequate safeguards, the rural communities described in the amendment will face greater threats to public safety, infrastructure, private property, agricultural production, and the economy generally when a local weather office closes. 
As experience shows, the rural field offices, in particular, play a special role in gathering weather information from diverse and disparate locales across a large region, and in disseminating this information, along with standard NWS forecasts and flood warnings, to all citizens of the region. Field offices located outside these service areas may not be able to devote the same level of comprehensive, real-time attention to weather events affecting these areas. Given the importance of accurate and timely weather information to rural areas subject to severe weather conditions, we cannot let the quality of weather services for these areas diminish. My legislation will help to prevent that from happening. 
Mr. President, this is good-government legislation. It helps to ensure that an essential Federal agency makes very well-informed and prudent decisions, and it enhances the protection of our citizens' lives and property. 
I introduced this legislation as an amendment to the NOAA reauthorization bill in the Commerce Committee last year. The amendment was adopted unanimously, but unfortunately the full Senate did not have an opportunity to consider the bill before adjournment. I intend to resume my efforts on this issue at the earliest opportunity in the new Congress. I hope other Senators will join me in cosponsoring this bill and in working toward its enactment.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am introducing two bills today to assist workers who have lost their jobs as a result of closure or cutbacks at defense installations or the loss of defense contracts by private industry. The first bill extends the existing targeted jobs tax credit to employers who hire individuals who have lost their jobs at a Federal military installation through a closing, realignment or reduction in force. The credit equals 40 percent of the first $6,000 in wages paid to each newly hired worker. The second bill I am introducing provides defense contractors with an income tax credit for 20 percent of costs incurred in retraining employees for nondefense-related jobs. 
Since 1988, the Department of Defense has undertaken four base realignment and closure [BRAC] rounds--in 1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995. In total the BRAC process has authorized the closing of 261 military facilities, including 98 major defense installations where 300 or more civilian and/or military jobs were eliminated. Many base closings and realignments under the BRAC process are still in progress and their full impact has not yet been felt. In addition, reductions in force continue to be the order of the day at the Pentagon. In December, the Navy announced plans to reduce civilian employment by 11,000 positions at 240 facilities. 
The economic impact of defense downsizing on the affected individuals and surrounding communities can be devastating. In my own State of Maine, the closure of Loring Air Force Base in 1994 resulted in the loss of nearly 20 percent of the jobs in Aroostook County, affecting 3,000 military personnel, 900 civilians and an additional 6,000 private sector jobs which were dependent on the air base. The annual loss of income to Maine's economy from the Loring closure totaled more than $370 million. 
At the other end of the State, Kittery-Portsmouth Naval Shipyard has seen its workforce cut from 8,600 employees in 1989, when the Berlin wall fell, to 3,600 today with another reduction of 454 Navy civilian jobs planned for 1997. And Bath Iron Works, Maine's largest defense contractor, has seen its employment level drop from a high of 12,000 in 1990 to 7,500 today. Smaller defense contractors in Maine have experienced similar job losses. 
Mr. President, defense downsizing and economic conversion can be an excruciatingly slow and painful process for those households and communities in Maine and across the country who are going through it. I feel strongly that our obligation to the military and civilian workers who, after all, helped win the cold war, does not end with adoption of the BRAC recommendations. Successful defense conversion is a long-term process requiring a multi-pronged strategy that must include coordinated Government assistance to affected communities, workers, and businesses. 
The two tax credit proposals I am introducing today form an essential part of that strategy. They will encourage the private sector to hire workers whose jobs have been lost from Federal defense facilities and will encourage defense contractors to retrain workers for employment in nondefense areas. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting these important legislative initiatives.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would establish a Northern Border States Council on United States-Canada Trade. 
The purpose of this Council is to oversee cross-border trade with our Nation's largest trading partner--an action that I believe is long overdue. The Council will serve as an early warning system to alert State and Federal trade officials to problems in cross-border traffic and trade. The Council will enable the United States to more effectively administer trade policy with Canada by applying the wealth of insight, knowledge and expertise that resides in our northern border States on this critical policy issue. 
Within the U.S. Government we already have the Department of Commerce and a U.S. Trade Representative. But the fact is that both are Federal entities, responsible for our larger, national U.S. trade interests. Too often, such entities fail to give full consideration to the interests of the 12 northern States that share a border with Canada, the longest demilitarized border between 2 nations anywhere in the world. The Northern Border States Council will provide State trade officials a mechanism to share information about cross-border traffic and trade. The Council will then advise the Congress, the President, the U.S. Trade Representative, the Secretary of Commerce, and other Federal and State trade officials on United States.-Canada trade policies, practices, and problems. 
Canada is America's largest and most important trading partner. Canada is by far the top purchaser of U.S. export goods and services, as it is the largest source of U.S. imports. With an economy one-tenth the size of our own, Canada's economic health depends on maintaining close trade ties with the United States. While Canada accounts for about one-fifth of U.S. exports and imports, the United States is the source of two-thirds of Canada's imports and provides the market for fully three-quarters of all of Canada's exports. 
The United States and Canada have the largest bilateral trade relationship in the world, a relationship that is remarkable not only for its strength and general health, but also for the intensity of the trade and border problems that do frequently develop. Over the last decade, Canada and the United States have signed two major trade agreements--the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement in 1989, and the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993. Notwithstanding these trade accords, numerous disagreements have caused trade negotiators to shuttle back and forth between Washington and Ottawa. Most of the more well-known trade disputes with Canada have involved agricultural commodities such as durum wheat, peanut butter, dairy products, and poultry products, and these disputes have impacted more than just the 12 northern border States. 
Each and every day, however, an enormous quantity of trade and traffic crosses the United States-Canada border. There are literally thousands of businesses, large and small, that rely on this cross-border traffic and trade for their livelihood. 
My own State of Maine has had a long-running dispute with Canada over that nation's unfair policies in support of its potato industry. Specifically, Canada protects its domestic potato growers from United States competition through a system of nontariff trade barriers, such as setting container size limitations and a prohibition on bulk imports from the United States. This bulk import prohibition effectively blocks United States potato imports into Canada. At the same time, Canada artificially enhances the competitiveness of its product through domestic subsidies for potato growers. 
Another trade dispute with Canada, specifically with the province of New Brunswick, served as the inspiration for this legislation. In July 1993, Canadian federal customs officials began stopping Canadians returning from Maine and collecting from them the 11-percent New Brunswick Provincial Sales Tax [PST] on goods purchased in Maine. Canadian Customs Officers had already been collecting the Canadian federal sales tax all across the United States-Canada border. The collection of the New Brunswick PST was specifically targeted against goods purchased in Maine--not on goods purchased in any of the other provinces bordering New Brunswick. 
After months of imploring the U.S. Trade Representative to do something about the imposition of the unfairly administered tax, Ambassador Kantor agreed that the New Brunswick PST was a violation of NAFTA, and that the United States would include the PST issue in the NAFTA dispute settlement process. But despite this explicit assurance, the issue was not, in fact, brought before NAFTA's dispute settlement process, prompting Congress last year to include an amendment I offered to immigration reform legislation calling for the U.S. Trade Representative to take this action without further delay. 
Throughout the early months of the PST dispute, we in the State of Maine had enormous difficulty convincing our Federal trade officials that the PST was in fact an international trade dispute that warranted their attention and action. We had no way of knowing whether problems similar to the PST dispute existed elsewhere along the United States-Canada border, or whether it was a more localized problem. If a body like the Northern Border State Trade Council had existed when the collection of the PST began, it could have immediately started investigating the issue to determine its impact and make recommendations on how to deal with it. 
In short, the Northern Border States Council will serve as the eyes and ears of our States that share a border with Canada, and are most vulnerable to fluctuations in cross-border trade and traffic. The Council will be a tool for Federal and State trade officials to use in monitoring their cross-border trade. It will help ensure that national trade policy regarding America's largest trading partner will be developed and implemented with an eye towards the unique opportunities and burdens present to the northern border States. 
The Northern Border States Council will be an advisory body, not a regulatory one. Its fundamental purpose will be to determine the nature and cause of cross-border trade issues or disputes, and to recommend how to resolve them. 
The duties and responsibilities of the Council will include, but not be limited to, providing advice and policy recommendations on such matters as taxation and the regulation of cross-border wholesale and retail trade in goods and services; taxation, regulation and subsidization of food, agricultural, energy, and forest-products commodities; and the potential for Federal and State/provincial laws and regulations, including customs and immigration regulations, to act as nontariff barriers to trade. 
As an advisory body, the Council will review and comment on all Federal and/or State reports, studies, and practices concerning United States-Canada trade, with particular emphasis on all reports from the dispute settlement panels established under NAFTA. These Council reviews will be conducted upon the request of the United States Trade Representative, the Secretary of Commerce, a Member of Congress from any Council State, or the Governor of a Council State. 
If the Council determines that the origin of a cross-border trade dispute resides with Canada, the Council would determine, to the best of its ability, if the source of the dispute is the Canadian Federal Government or a Canadian provincial government. 
The goal of this legislation is not to create another Federal trade bureaucracy. The Council will be made up of individuals nominated by the Governors and approved by the Secretary of Commerce. Each northern border State will have two members on the Council. The Council members will be unpaid, and serve a 2-year term. 
The Northern Border States Council on United States-Canada Trade will not solve all of our trade problems with Canada. But it will ensure that the voices and views of our northern border States are heard in Washington by our Federal trade officials. For too long their voices were ignored, and the northern border States have had to suffer severe economic consequences at times because of it. This legislation will bring our States into their rightful position as full partners in issues that affect cross-border trade and traffic with our country's largest trading partner.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the John Bapst Memorial High School Band which honored Maine and America with its outstanding performance during 1997's Presidential Inauguration. 
Personally selected by President Clinton to attend the festivities, the John Bapst band had audiences on their feet with rousing renditions of `The Maine Stein Song,' `Camino Real,' and `Acclamations,' to name a few. The band performed on the National Mall, along with bands such as the Count Basie Orchestra, and also at the prestigious Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. 
This is not the first time that Maine has been made proud by the John Bapst band. In 1991, the band was on hand to welcome troops returning home after the Gulf war. For many, their stop in Bangor was the first time on American soil since their deployment. I am certain they will never forget the warm greetings they received in Bangor--which garnered national attention--and John Bapst band played a special part in honoring our servicemen and women. The tradition continued when John Bapst played for President Clinton last November. The President was so impressed with the group that he pledged to invite them to inaugural festivities should he be reelected. 
Mr. President, this band represents the very best characteristics of America's young people. Band members set a goal of excellence and worked hard to achieve it, and I believe their efforts should be highlighted. In an era of conflicting and often dubious influences for young men and women, and in a time when negative stories abound in the media, our children should have positive examples to follow. That is why we should shine a spotlight on groups like the John Bapst band, which represent the finest qualities and aspirations of America's youth. I applaud the band members and their director, Julie Ewing, for showing our youth what can be accomplished through commitment and hard work. 
In closing, I would once again like to thank the John Bapst Memorial High School Band for their tremendous contribution to the 1997 inaugural festivities, and for making the State of Maine very proud.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Old Town Marching Band of Old Town, ME. 
The band made the entire State of Maine proud with its extraordinary performance in the 1997 Inaugural Parade. Countless hours of practice and preparation go into such an effort, and the students' dedication to excellence was obvious and stood as a wonderful tribute to the late Old Town Superintendent of Schools, Dr. John Grady. 
I was approached early last year by Dr. Grady, who shared with me his dream of having the Old Town Marching Band represent Maine at this year's inaugural parade. Sadly, Dr. Grady passed away, but his dream lived on in the hearts of bandmembers and the Old Town community. Old Town was one of more than 400 groups seeking to perform in the parade--only 23 were selected, and of those only 9 were high school bands. 
Old Town's participation in the 1997 Inaugural Parade is the latest of a long list of accomplishments. The band is nationally recognized, having won numerous awards including first place at the 1994 Saint Anselm College New England Jazz Festival, the Jazz Ensemble Grand Champions at the 1996 Orlando Musicfest, and an award-winning appearance at the 1995 Cherry Blossom parade in Washington, DC. 
Mr. President, this band represents the very best characteristics of America's young people. Band members set a goal of excellence and worked hard to achieve it, and I believe their efforts should be highlighted. In an era of conflicting and often dubious influences for young men and women, and in a time when negative stories abound in the media, our children should have positive examples to follow. That is why we should shine a spotlight on groups like the Old Town Marching Band, which represent the finest qualities and aspirations of America's youth. I salute the band as well as its director, Jeffrey Priest, for showing young people what can be accomplished through hard work and commitment. 
In closing, I would once again like to thank the Old Town Marching Band for their tremendous contribution to the 1997 inaugural parade, and for making Old Town and the State of Maine very proud.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in conjunction with my colleague, the Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, who has been a longtime advocate, proponent of advancing women's health in America. We responded to the January 23 decision that was made by the advisory panel to the National Cancer Institute that recommended that women should refrain from having mammograms in their forties. 
I want to thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, the assistant majority leader, Senator Nickles, and Senator Jeffords, chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee for their assistance in getting this resolution to the floor so quickly. I would also want to thank the Democratic leader and my friends on both sides of the aisle for allowing us to consider this resolution under a unanimous-consent agreement. Breast cancer is an issue that transcends party and politics. 
My resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that NCI should conduct studies to determine, once and for all, the true benefit of mammograms for women in their forties. It also urges the Advisory Board to NCI, which will meet later this month, to consider reissuing the mammography guideline it rescinded in 1993 recommending that women in their forties seek routine mammograms. NCI must put an end to the unfortunate confusion that may cost some women their very lives. 
Breast cancer is one of the most pressing public health crises facing American women today, striking one in every eight women during their lifetime. It will strike 180,000 American women this year, and kill 44,000 women--more than 10,000 of whom will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their forties. For women in this age group, it is the leading killer, and more women this year will be diagnosed with cancer in their forties than in their fifties. 
Mammograms are the most powerful weapon we have in the fight against breast cancer. They enable us to detect and treat breast cancer at its earliest stages when the tumors are too tiny to be detected by a woman or her doctor, providing a better prognosis for treatment. An estimated 23.5 million mammograms were performed in 1992 at a cost of approximately $2.5 billion--a valuable downpayment in our fight against an unmerciful killer. 
The question about whether women in their forties should seek regular mammograms has been an open question for years. On January 23, an NCI consensus panel decided not to recommend that women in their forties seek routine mammograms. To justify their position, they argued that the costs associated with routine mammograms for women in this age group potentially exceed the benefits. In making its decision, the panel gave undue weight to hypothetical risks, such as false-negative results that potentially provide women with a false sense of security, false-positive results that produce unnecessary anxiety, the potential for overtreatment, and radiation exposure. 
If we ever hope to improve survival rates for breast cancer, women of all ages must receive accurate and consistent information regarding the importance of mammograms. Women and their doctors look to the Nation's preeminent cancer research institution--the National Cancer Institute--for clear guidance and advice on this issue. 
Confusion on this issue is not new. In 1989, NCI, along with the American Cancer Society and the American Medical Association, issued breast cancer screening guidelines which advised women to begin having mammograms at age 40. In 1993, NCI rescinded these guidelines, stating that their review of clinical trials produced no evidence that mammograms significantly reduced breast cancer deaths for women in their forties. At the time, Congress and many experts questioned the appropriateness of this conclusion, based on the available scientific evidence. This is when I first introduced legislation urging NCI to reexamine this issue. 
By rescinding its guideline, NCI produced widespread confusion and concern among women and physicians regarding the appropriate age at which to seek mammograms. This confusion eroded public confidence in mammography. It also reinforced the information barrier which discourages women from seeking care. Four years later, we are still mired in this controversy. 
Yet new studies strongly suggest that routine mammograms for women in their forties can save lives. For example, investigators found a 24-percent lower death rate among women who received mammograms in their forties when the world's population-based trials 
were combined; and Swedish researchers in 1996 in two studies found a 44- and 36-percent lower death rate among women who received mammograms in their forties. And several studies have concluded that breast tumors in women under 50 grow far more rapidly than breast cancer in older women, suggesting that annual mammograms are of value to women in their forties. 
In studying the research and scrutinizing the statistics, the panel appears to have lost sight of the human dimension of this question, and gave undue weight to the costs of screening, rather than the benefits. The panel emphasized that 2,500 women would have to be screened to save one life. But this 1 life represents someone's mother, wife, sister, or daughter. 
The panel also emphasized that up to one-fourth of all invasive breast cancers are not detected by mammography in women in their forties. Yet, the flip side of this statistic is that three-fourths of all cancers in this age group are detected through mammography. While it may not be perfect, that clearly amounts to saved lives. 
Finally, the NCI Panel also overemphasizes the risks of false-positives, suggesting that many women would undergo unnecessary surgical procedures. Yet, most women with positive findings subsequently undergo more refined diagnostic tests, including diagnostic mammograms, ultrasounds, and needle biopsies to confirm the presence of cancer, before any treatment decisions are made. 
Appropriately, the Director of NCI, Dr. Richard Klausner, expressed his surprise and disappointment over the decision of the consensus panel, and has asked the NCI Advisory Board to convene next month to revisit this issue. Former NIH Director, Dr. Bernadine Healy, affirmed his views. 
I am asking the Senate to consider my resolution today because women and physicians deserve to have guidance on this issue. My resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that NCI should conduct studies to determine, once and for all, the true benefit of mammograms for women in their forties. It also urges NCI's Advisory Board, which will meet later this month, to consider reissuing the mammography guidelines it rescinded in 1993 which recommended that women in their forties seek routine mammograms. Alternatively, NCI should direct women to other organizations which have issued clear guidelines on the issue, such as the American Cancer Society. This resolution does not dictate science--it simply helps to provide women with clearer guidance as they look to answer a potentially life or death question--should they get mammograms in their forties?

Ms. SNOWE. I just respond to the Senator from Maryland by commending her for her very strong statement, her commitment, and a resoluteness to this issue in the hope that women get the best health care in America. She has shown strong leadership on this issue throughout the years. As she mentioned, we worked on women's health issues beginning in the House of Representatives in making some extraordinary changes within the National Institutes of Health to create an Office of Women's Health, which was absolutely vital because women were excluded--as well as minorities, I might add--from clinical studies. 
I thank the Senator and commend her for all she has done on behalf of women. 
I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in conclusion I would like to make several final points. 
First of all, I would like to commend Senator Specter for his commitment and devotion for years on this issue, and in particular tomorrow for holding a hearing as the chairman of the Labor-HHS Committee on Appropriations which I think will be very significant in highlighting and profiling the importance of this issue. 
Finally, I also would like to say that I think it is critical that he send a very strong message to the Cancer Institute advisory panel that will be meeting later this month to revisit this issue, and, if they see that we have a very strong vote here in the U.S. Senate from all Senators across the political aisle, clearly I think they will rescind the statement that they made last month in not making any recommendation for women in their forties. I think it is an abdication of their responsibility, and an abdication of their knowledge of medical science in terms of what is best for women. 
I am very pleased as well that all nine women here in the U.S. Senate--all Republican and all Democratic women--are cosponsors of this resolution. 
I do hope that we can get unanimous support of this issue so that we can correct what I think has been a wrong decision on the behalf of women in America and does nothing to advance women's health. 
That is why this resolution becomes a critically important statement to the lives, health, and safety of women in America. 
I yield the remainder of my time. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I introduce legislation designed to help America's small business. This legislation will assist small businesses by increasing the tax deduction for health care coverage, requiring an estimate of the cost of a bill on small businesses before Congress enacts the legislation, and creating an assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Small Business. 
Small business is the driving force behind our economy, and in order to create jobs--both in my home State of Maine and across the Nation--we must encourage small businesses expansion. Businesses with fewer than 10 employees make up 77 percent of Maine's jobs, and nationally, small businesses employ 53 percent of the private work force. In 1995, small businesses created an estimated 75 percent of the 2.5 million new jobs. Small businesses truly are the backbone of our economy. 
Small businesses are the most successful tool we have for job creation. They provide about 67 percent of the initial job opportunities in this country, and are the original--and finest--job training program. Unfortunately, as much as small businesses help our own economy--and the Federal Government--by creating jobs and building economic growth, government often gets in the way. Instead of assisting small business, government too often frustrates small business efforts. 
Federal regulations create more than 1 billion hours of paperwork for small businesses each year, according to the Small Business Administration. Moreover, because of the size of some of the largest American corporations, U.S. commerce officials too often devote a disproportionate amount of time to the needs and jobs in corporate America rather than in small businesses. 
My legislation will address three problems facing our Nation's small businesses, and I hope it will both encourage small business expansion and fuel job creation. 
First, this legislation will allow self-employed small business men and women to fully deduct their health care costs for income tax purposes. This provision builds on legislation enacted during the 104th Congress, the Health Insurance Reform Act, which increased the health insurance deduction for the self-employed from 30 to 35 percent this year and will gradually increase it to 80 percent by the year 2006. 
My bill will allow the self-employed to deduct 100 percent of their insurance today. It will place small entrepreneurs on equal footing with larger companies by immediately increasing a provision in current law that limits deductions to 35 percent of the overall cost. At a time when America is facing challenges to its health care system, and the Federal Government is seeking remedies to the problem of uninsured citizens, this provision will help self-employed business people to afford health insurance without imposing a costly and unnecessary mandate. 
From inventors to startup businesses, self-employed workers make up an important and vibrant part of the small business sector--and too often they are forgotten in providing benefits and assistance. Indeed, 9 percent of uninsured workers in America are self-employed. By extending tax credits for health insurance to these small businesses, we will help to provide health care coverage to millions of Americans. 
My bill will also require a cost analysis of legislative proposals before new requirements are passed on to small businesses. Too often, Congress approves well-intended legislation that shift the costs of programs to small businesses. This proposal will ensure that these unintended consequences are not passed along to small businesses. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, small business owners spend at least 1 billion hours a year filling out government paperwork, at an annual cost that exceeds $100 billion. Before we place yet another obstacle in the path of small business job creation, we should understand the costs our proposals will impose on small businesses. 
This bill will require the Director of the Congressional Budget Office to prepare for each committee an analysis of the costs to small businesses that would be incurred in carrying out provisions contained in new legislation. This cost analysis will include an estimate of costs incurred in carrying out the bill or resolution for a 4-year period, as well as an estimate of the portion of these costs that would be borne by small businesses. This provision will allow us to fully consider the impact of our actions on small businesses--and through careful planning, we will succeed in avoiding unintended costs. 
Finally, this legislation will direct the U.S. Trade Representative to establish a position of Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Small Business. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is overburdened, and too often overlooks the needs of small business. The new Assistant U.S. Trade Representative will promote exports by small businesses and work to remove foreign impediments to these exports. 
Mr. President, I am convinced that this legislation will truly assist small businesses, resulting not only in additional entrepreneurial opportunities but also in new jobs. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

 Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from New York, Senator D'Amato, along with Senators Feinstein and Hollings, in introducing the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1997. This bill provides key protections to women facing breast cancer, and to all Americans confronting a possible diagnosis of cancer. 
Breast cancer is currently one of the major public health crises facing this Nation. In 1997, 180,000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in this country, and more than 44,000 women will die from the disease. Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American women. In my home State of Maine, 900 to 1,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year. 
Consider for a moment what it must be like to face a cancer diagnosis. Then imagine what a woman with breast cancer goes through when she loses a breast to this disease. A mastectomy patient may endure great pain resulting from the surgery, and has a large wound with drainage tubes which must be properly cared for. She must also face the emotional pain of losing part or all of a breast, and may struggle with her fear of cancer and what lies ahead. Then try to imagine if she is released from the hospital within hours of surgery. 
That is what some health plans are doing today. Yes--some health care plans have issued guidelines requiring mastectomies to be performed on an outpatient basis. The New York Times recently reported that approximately 7 to 8 percent of all mastectomies are performed on an outpatient basis. Doctors may feel pressured by their health care plan to release patients before it is medically appropriate, as health care plans push doctors harder and harder to cut costs. Women who are released from the hospital too early following a mastectomy, lumpectomy, or lymph node dissection do not have time to recover from the surgery in a supervised setting, or have an adequate opportunity to learn how to properly care for their wound, much less begin to deal with their emotional and physical pain. And some problems or complications from the surgery may not arise within the first hours following the surgery. 
The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1997 will help ensure that women with breast cancer obtain medically appropriate care. This bill says that women who undergo a mastectomy, lumpectomy, or lymph node dissection can stay in the hospital as long as a doctor deems medically appropriate, in consultation with the patient. The bill does not mandate how long a patient should stay in the hospital, or prescribe an arbitrary 
time period. Instead, it encourages the highest standard of medical care by allowing a doctor to exercise his best medical judgment in determining how long a patient should remain in the hospital. The bill contains strong protections for doctors to ensure that they are not penalized by insurance companies for prescribing a given length of stay. The procedures could still be performed on an outpatient basis if deemed medically appropriate by the doctor, and agreed to by the patient. 
Second, the bill requires insurance companies to cover breast reconstruction following cancer surgery, as well as reconstructive surgery to make breasts symmetrical following cancer surgery. I am extremely pleased that this provision is based on the law in my own State of Maine. Currently, insurance companies treat reconstructive surgery following breast cancer differently than other types of reconstructive surgery. In fact, a recent survey found that 43 percent of the respondents had been denied coverage for follow-up reconstructive symmetry procedures. The availability of reconstructive surgery is important not only for those women who believe it is necessary to return their lives to normal following cancer surgery, but because studies show that the fear of losing a breast is a leading reason why women do not participate in early breast cancer detection programs. If women understand that breast reconstruction is widely available, more might participate in detection programs. 
Finally, this bill requires insurance companies to pay full coverage for secondary consultations whenever any cancer has been diagnosed by the patient's primary physician. It also requires a health plan to cover a second opinion even when the specialist finds the patient does not have cancer, and allows the patient to go outside an HMO for consultation by a specialist. This is designed to prevent all Americans from making inappropriate and uninformed decisions regarding medical treatment due to either a false-negative or a false-positive result. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting and securing swift passage of the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1997.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to submit a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the U.S. Postal Service should issue a series of postage stamps honoring young Americans for their extraordinary achievements. 
It is an unfortunate reality today that America's young people face more difficult challenges than ever before. The lure of gangs, drugs, alcohol, and sex increases the potential for irresponsible behavior and violence at ever earlier ages. On a daily basis, young people are exposed to a confusing array of messages and sometimes dubious role models. And even the best-intentioned working parents find it hard to spend the kind of quality time with their children that would help them sort through these pervasive influences. All too often, the media focuses on negative stories about America's young people. 
Yet, there are many examples of exceptional young Americans who have risen above these challenges to accomplish extraordinary things for their community and for their country. Samantha Smith, who lived in Manchester, ME, is a prime example. In 1982, at the age of 10, Samantha wrote a letter to Chairman Yuri Andropov of the Soviet Union urging peace at the height of the cold war. As a result, she was invited by the Soviet leader to visit his country the following year. Samantha's trip received worldwide attention, and the schoolgirl became widely recognized as a spokesperson for peace and international understanding. Tragically, Samantha's life was cut short in 1985 in a fatal plane crash when she was only 13. 
Other young Americans have demonstrated the same kind of initiative and vision which Samantha embodied. The youth of our country need to be aware of these positive role models from among their own age group. I am, therefore, introducing a sense-of-the-Senate resolution today calling upon the U.S. Postal Service to issue a series of stamps recognizing young Americans, starting with Samantha Smith, for the extraordinary contributions they have made.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee for yielding me this time this afternoon. 
Mr. President, today the Senate will have the opportunity to vote on the confirmation of America's next Secretary of Defense. 
This is, of course, a position of tremendous importance and responsibility--particularly as we look toward a new millennium and the national security challenges that it will present. These challenges will be many: restructuring our forces, modernizing our defense, reconciling our defense needs with the realities of our budget, our ongoing interests in the Mideast and Bosnia, and the potential for other conflicts yet unknown. And as always, the world will be looking to us--the greatest democracy on Earth--for strong and just leadership. 
So the individual who will hold this office must be of the highest moral and intellectual fiber. This is why I am pleased and honored to rise today in strong support of the nomination of William S. Cohen to be our next Secretary of Defense. 
While there are now Senators in this Chamber who have never served with Bill, I feel confident in saying that every one of them is nonetheless familiar with his contributions to this institution. 
And yet, as we approach the time when we will confirm Bill Cohen as Secretary of Defense, I feel compelled to share with you my thoughts about Bill as a person, as a Senator, and as a leader. 
It seemed just yesterday that I stood on this very floor to pay tribute and respect to a friend and colleague who was bidding farewell to the institution he had served so well for 18 years. I talked about Bill Cohen the man, and how he helped perpetuate the Senate's claim as the greatest deliberative body on Earth. And I talked about how he made Maine and the Nation proud. Little did I know--but little am I surprised--that I would soon stand before you speaking of how the country has lost a Senator but soon will gain an outstanding Secretary of Defense. 
It has been said that the world is divided into those who want to become someone, and those who want to accomplish something. The irony is that in setting out to accomplish something, Bill Cohen has also become someone--someone we admire, someone we respect, and someone who can be entrusted with one of the toughest and most demanding jobs in the world. 
Like the historic Maine lighthouses that dot Maine's coastline, Bill's record has been a beacon of light. His vision and resolve stood fast against the buffeting winds of political change. In a volatile and stormy climate, Bill Cohen and his rich experience in public service helped guide us to calmer waters. But while skillful in getting things done, politics is not what moves Bill. Principles and ideas are what Bill Cohen is really about. 
That's why Bill became the standard-bearer for modern Maine politics from his first days in public service. 
Born and raised in Bangor, where his parents ran a bakery, he graduated from Bowdoin College and from Boston University Law School 3 years later. After practicing law in Bangor for several years, Bill was elected to the Bangor City Council in 1969 and then served as mayor of Bangor. It was clear early on that he would have a distinguished career in public service. 
In 1972, he was elected to the House from Maine's Second Congressional District and faced the toughest challenge of his fledgling tenure in Congress. 
In the stormy sea of the Watergate scandal, while America was suffering a crisis of confidence, Bill Cohen charted a course straight through the heart of the storm as a member of the House Judiciary Committee, which was considering Articles of Impeachment against a President of the United States. A freshman, Bill was already a man of conscience and courage--someone who was willing to make the tough calls and risk his political future for the sake of truth and America's honor. And these values ultimately launched him here--to the U.S. Senate. 
Back in our home State of Maine, people believe the ultimate measure of a person is how close they remain to their principles precisely when it is most difficult to do so. 
It is a tradition that Margaret Chase Smith and Edmund Muskie followed in their personal and political lives and consistent with the ideals of Maine. Bill Cohen followed in their footsteps. 
Throughout Bill's career, Maine and America have come to know that they can count on Bill to approach issues with thoughtfulness and reason. And Senators on both sides of the aisle developed a tremendous respect for the virtues Bill brought to this body because, above all, Bill Cohen voted his mind and his conscience. And that is what Americans want in their leaders. He has the intellect, the integrity, and the strength to know the right thing to do and the right way to do it. And he is a leader who believes in his solemn responsibility not simply to echo conventional wisdom but to seriously deliberate on the issues of the day. 
This is the kind of person we need at the helm of the most powerful defense force in world history. We need someone with a firm grasp of history and a solid vision for the future, someone with both experience and a track record that engenders unflagging trust. Mr. President, Bill Cohen is such a person. 
The defense of our Nation is one of the most sacred responsibilities of the Federal Government. `Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness' is a meaningless concept unless we have the desire and the ability to defend those rights against those who would subvert them. We entrust the person who oversees our Armed Forces with nothing less than the defense of the Constitution and the greatest democracy the world has ever known. That is a tall order, but it is without reservation that I will put my full faith and trust in Bill Cohen to be that person. 
As we all know, Bill is a respected and expert voice on intelligence and national security issues. As chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, he played a leadership role in defense policy at a critical time in our Nation's history, through some of the most trying days of the cold war and the challenging moments thereafter. Bill authored the nuclear arms build-down proposal which became the United States position in negotiations with the Soviet Union. He forged a bipartisan compromise on an antiballistic-missile policy, and his unwavering commitment to a strong national defense helped lay the groundwork for the fall of the Soviet empire and the end to the cold war. 
Closer to home, Bill was instrumental in bringing about significant reforms of the Defense Department, including reorganizing the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to be more effective and prepared for combat situations and streamlining acquisition policies to ensure cost efficiency. His legislation also created a special operations antiterrorism unit designed to counter this growing scourge. 
While serving on the Armed Services Committee, Bill was visionary in reshaping our military forces to be responsive to the post-cold-war threats that we face globally as well as sizing and equipping forces to carry out our national security policy. Bill has also been a leader in shaping our policy and forces to meet the future challenges we will face in the 21st century. 
Bill Cohen also put forward a detailed proposal for reorienting our defense structure in the nineties in a way that would reduce the burden on the Federal budget and recognize changes in the threats facing the United States. It called for sacrificing conventional forces and programs primarily designed to defeat Soviet aggression in Europe in favor of those, such as power projection forces and sealift, that will be needed to meet the variety of challenges the United States is likely to face in our changed global arena. 
It is precisely this kind of responsible, visionary leadership that will be required for the next Secretary of Defense, so I can think of no finer nominee than Bill Cohen to lead and prepare the Department of Defense for this coming century. I commend President Clinton for his bold and wise and thoughtful selection of Bill Cohen to be our next Secretary of Defense, and I am thankful that Bill Cohen has decided to continue his commitment to public service. 
Bill Cohen brings to the Pentagon not just a sense of bipartisanship. He also brings to the Cabinet expertise in working with Congress. And I expect we are going to be hearing a lot from Bill because he is familiar with this end of Pennsylvania Avenue. He knows that to be an effective Secretary of Defense one must have a strong and trustworthy relationship with the U.S. Congress. 
Mr. President, my fellow colleagues, the world today is much different than the world of even 10 years ago. The Berlin wall has now been relegated to its rightful place--our museums. The Soviet Union is no more. And young Americans no longer go to sleep fearing that morning may never come. But let us make no mistake. The world is still a volatile and dangerous place, and that is why we need a person of Bill Cohen's caliber standing watch, willing to fight, willing to stand up for his principles, willing to take the time to do what he believes is right. 
These are some of the qualities that Bill Cohen will bring to the Pentagon, and so I urge you to join with me in proudly casting your vote to confirm President Clinton's nomination of William S. Cohen to be the next Secretary of Defense for the United States of America. 
Thank you. I yield the floor.

Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in supporting the confirmation of Ambassador Madeleine Albright to be our Nation's 63d Secretary of State. 
Many have commented on the historic nature of Ambassador Albright's nomination to be the first woman Secretary of State, the highest ranking of all Cabinet officers. But this would be just one more of a long history of ground-breaking roles in Madeleine Albright's distinguished career. 
For instance, over the past 4 years, she has been the only woman serving as a U.N. Ambassador on the Security Council. In the first Clinton administration, she was the only woman to serve in a national security capacity on the President's Cabinet. She was also the first woman to serve as the top foreign policy advisor to a Presidential candidate, a role she served in 1988 to Gov. Michael Dukakis. 
Ambassador Albright will bring a superb background to the job of Secretary of State. I would note that she began her rise in the foreign policy field as the top foreign affairs advisor to our former colleague, Senator Edmund Muskie when he was a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee. Then after serving on the staff of the National Security Council in the Carter administration, she worked for over a decade as professor at Georgetown University and in various centers for public policy research. 
Since 1992, Madeleine Albright has served ably as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and has been a formal member of the President's Cabinet. This is a rare recognition granted to a U.N. Ambassador, and she was the first U.N. Ambassador to serve in this role since Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick in the first Reagan administration. 
At the United Nations, Ambassador Albright became known and respected as a fierce defender of American interests and values. She took the administration's lead role 1 year ago in denouncing Cuba's unprovoked murder of two American pilots who were flying unarmed civilian aircraft over international waters near Cuba. She emphasized the importance of this outrageous act of cowardice by Fidel Castro's totalitarian government with characteristically direct language that helped focus the attention of the world. 
She also worked diligently--and successfully--in maintaining comprehensive economic sanctions on the repressive regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Despite the call by some nations of the world to lift those sanctions, she has succeeded in keeping them in place until the Government of Iraq ends its threats to its neighbors, shows greater respect for the human rights of its own people, and totally dismantles all weapons of mass production programs. These actions are called for not only in a series of Security Council resolutions enacted at the end of the 1991 gulf war, but also in obligations Iraq itself accepted in the cease fire agreement that ended that war. 
Most recently, Ambassador Albright insisted on the replacement of U.N. Secretary Gen. Boutros Boutros-Ghali because of his inadequate attention to necessary reform of the U.N. system. She refused to bow to pressure from other countries--on the first Security Council vote on this issue the United States was opposed 14 to 1--and insisted on the election of a new reform-minded Secretary General as a matter of principle. With the recent successful election of the new U.N. Secretary Gen. Kofi Annan, there now is an opportunity for revitalizing this important international institution and 
restoring a bipartisan consensus on the United Nations in the Congress and among the American people. 
As shown in just these few examples, Madeleine Albright is a strong advocate for U.S. foreign policy and is more than willing to take the tough and principled stands. It is my hope that she will help to restore American leadership and assertiveness in the international community. 
In addition to her strong qualifications for the job, Madeleine Albright also brings a compelling personal experience and family background to this job. The daughter of a Czech diplomat, her family came to the United States as refugees after World War II. In fact, in the preceding years, her family had twice fled the forces of totalitarianism: first escaping the advancing armies of Nazi Germany, and again the Iron Curtain's descent on her homeland of Czechoslovakia, a country that had previously had the most vibrant economy and democratic system in central Europe. 
During her confirmation hearing, Ambassador Albright discussed how her parents instilled in her a deep love for the United States and the ideals upon which our Nation was founded. Others have noted Ambassador Albright's strong views on such questions as human rights, democracy, and individual liberty. I have no doubt that her family's experiences have contributed to her evident devotion to these very American ideals. 
If confirmed by the Senate, Ambassador Albright will become Secretary Albright and will move to a larger stage for the conduct of American foreign policy. Under the Clinton administration, the United States has been searching for a more unified vision and greater consistency in our Nation's foreign policy with the end of the cold war. A number of challenges will immediately confront her, and I hope and expect that she will be able to rise to these challenges. 
For example, the international community is watching the rising world power of China, but for 4 years the Clinton administration has had difficulty maintaining a consistent foreign policy in relation to this increasingly important country. Tension between the important bilateral interests of human rights, trade, national security, and nonproliferation has too often led to confusion and vacillation in our Nation's policies. It is my hope that Madeleine Albright will rectify this weakness by bringing her temperament of toughness and consistency, combined with her strong grounding in long-term strategic thinking. 
Another challenge awaits U.S. policy in the critically important region of the Middle East. There is no doubt that recent negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority have been difficult, though thankfully last week's agreement over the redeployment of Israeli forces in Hebron shows that the peace process remains intact. 
But over the next 2 years, the negotiations will become even more important and vastly more challenging. It is in this period that negotiations over a final status for the Palestinian entity are supposed to be reached, and the Palestinians' challenge against Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem must be resolved. Ambassador Albright has long been acknowledged as a very strong friend of Israel. But she also has developed a very constructive working relationship with the Palestinian authority. In the world of international diplomacy, it is worth noting that two of the earliest congratulations she received for her nomination came from Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Palestinian Liberation Organization Chairman Yassir Arafat. 
Mr. President, I have had the honor and the privilege to become personally acquainted with Ambassador Albright over the past 4 years from my position on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during the 104th Congress, and as a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee during the 103d Congress. While we have occasionally disagreed on policy issues, I have always found Ambassador Albright to be a forceful, effective, and persuasive advocate of administration policies. She has a true skill for explaining the purpose behind American foreign policy, and I am certain that she will use that skill to advance U.S. interests throughout the world. 
I would like to again express my support for confirming Ambassador Madeleine Albright to be the 63d Secretary of State. I urge my colleagues to join with me in approving her nomination for this highest of all confirmable executive branch posts.

Ms. SNOWE. Those amendments were approved by an overwhelming majority in the House who felt that, without the changes, the OECD Agreement failed to provide an effective mechanism for disciplining foreign shipbuilding subsidy practices. I should add that a number of Members in this body who have examined the agreement also share this view. The base agreement, coupled with the many loopholes and special concessions granted to foreign governments, would continue to place U.S. shipbuilders at a tremendous competitive disadvantage. For this reason, the largest U.S. shipbuilders, representing over 90 percent of all workers in the Nation's major shipbuilding base, opposed implementation of the agreement even though they were the primary advocates of an effective discipline on foreign government subsidy and dumping practices in the first place.

Ms. SNOWE. In 1993, 4 years after international negotiations had failed to produce an agreement to end foreign subsidies, Congress and President Clinton revived and amended a modest ship loan guarantee program called Title XI. The purpose of this program was to help U.S. shipbuilders recapture commercial market share in the face of dramatic cuts in the Navy's shipbuilding plan and continued foreign government subsidies in the commercial market.

Ms. SNOWE. In 1996, when the administration sought congressional approval of the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement, the Department of Defense submitted a Navy shipbuilding budget request for the fewest numbers of ships in more than 60 years. While the Navy's Fiscal Year 1997 Future Years Defense Plan called for an average of only 5 ships per year, the Navy anticipates that it will need to procure 10 to 12 ships per year beginning in the year 2002, if it is to maintain a 346-ship fleet. The challenge for our Nation and the Navy is to sustain the critical core shipbuilding industrial base during this alltime low in Navy shipbuilding and still have the capability to meet future Navy building needs. 
Facing these circumstances, in 1989 the U.S. shipbuilding industry sought an international agreement to end foreign government shipbuilding subsidies. The industry believed then, as it does now, that it was essential to end foreign government participation in the commercial shipbuilding market if it was to have a fighting chance to make the transition to building both commercial and Navy ships, and thus survive this historic low in Navy shipbuilding.

Ms. SNOWE. During the negotiations, Germany granted $4 billion in shipyard modernization subsidies to the former East German shipyards.

Ms. SNOWE. These concerns and the agreement's negative implications for the U.S. Navy shipbuilding industrial base were ignored by the negotiators of this agreement. U.S. shipbuilders were also dismayed that they were granted no transition period in contrast to what was granted to the foreign governments. The successful, but modest, Title XI loan guarantee program would be rendered ineffective immediately upon the agreement's entry into force and the domestic trade of the United States, as governed by the Jones Act, was placed in severe jeopardy by our negotiators. In an effort to correct these weaknesses and flaws, the House of Representatives amended the implementing legislation (H.R. 2754) to address the major national security concerns of the agreement.

Ms. SNOWE. U.S. ownership, manning, and construction of vessels serving the Jones Act trade has provided the Department of Defense with a pool of trained mariners, vessels, and the industrial capability to respond in time to national defense emergencies. For example, the very shipyards that build and repair Jones Act vessels were called upon to activate military reserve ships during Operation Desert Storm/Desert Shield, and it was the trained mariners who operate Jones Act vessels in peacetime who were called upon to crew these military ships once activated. The Jones Act contributes to the maintenance of this skilled work force and defense industrial capability. 
Because of the importance of the Jones Act to our national security, the House adopted an amendment specifically prohibiting the imposition of trade countermeasures against U.S. shipbuilders and other exporters for Jones Act ship construction. This amendment is essential to our Nation's defense readiness.

Ms. SNOWE. Many of DOD's reserve and auxiliary ships are commercially built, owned, and operated, and they are chartered to DOD under long-term lease agreements. The U.S. Navy intends to continue this approach to acquiring these needed assets in the future. Furthermore, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to completely separate a ship's defense features from its commercial features. Therefore, the implementing legislation needs to contain the definition and exemption for these types of ships or the United States will be subjected to an international trade panel's interpretation of what is, or is not, a military vessel or a defense feature.

Ms. SNOWE. Title XI provides for a government guarantee of commercial loans for the construction of ships in the United States for U.S. and export customers. Up to 87.5 percent of the 25-year loan is guaranteed under the program. Upon entry into force of the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement, however, the terms of title XI would be immediately changed to guarantee only up to 80 percent of a commercial loan over a 12-year period. According to U.S. shipbuilders, the current orders for construction of large oceangoing commercial ships would not have been consummated under these terms and conditions.

Ms. SNOWE. The House bill would place the U.S. on an equal par with foreign signatories time-wise. It would allow title XI to continue at its present terms and conditions during the 3-year transition period in which foreign signatories were granted very generous subsidy concessions. Furthermore, major U.S. shipbuilders desperately need this extension to the program if they are to complete their transition back to building commercial ships. If this transition is unsuccessful, the Navy's core shipbuilding base will not be sustained to meet its future requirements.

Ms. SNOWE. 
Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that one of the first resolutions introduced in the 105th Congress by the Republican leadership will significantly increase biomedical research funding at NIH. I truly believe that this is a momentous occasion which will reap enormous benefits for all Americans. Building on this, I rise to introduce legislation which authorizes increased funding for breast cancer research. 
Over the past six years, Congress has demonstrated an increased commitment to the fight against breast cancer. Back in 1991, less than $100 million dollars was spent on breast cancer research. Since then, Congress has steadily increased this allocation. These increases have stimulated new and exciting research that has begun to unravel the mysteries of this devastating disease and is moving us closer to a cure. Today, we must send a message through our authorization level to scientists and research policy makers that we are committed to continued funding for this important research. 
This increase in funding is necessary because breast cancer has reached crisis levels in America. In 1997, it is estimated that 180,200 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in this country, and 43,900 women will die from this disease. Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American women. Today, over 2.6 million American women are living with this disease. In my home state of Maine, it is the most commonly-diagnosed cancer among women, representing more than 30 percent of all new cancers in Maine women. 
In addition to these enormous human costs, breast cancer also exacts a heavy financial toll--over $6 billion of our health care dollars are spent on breast cancer annually. 
Today, however, there is cause for hope. Recent scientific progress made in the fight to conquer breast cancer is encouraging. Researchers have isolated the genes responsible for inherited breast cancer, and are beginning to understand the mechanism of the cancer cell itself. It is imperative that we capitalize upon these advances by continuing to support the scientists investigating this disease and their innovative research. 
For this reason, my bill increases the FY98 funding authorization level for breast cancer research to $590 million. This level represents the funding level scientists believe is necessary to make progress against this disease. This increased funding will contribute substantially toward solving the mysteries surrounding breast cancer. Our continued investment will save countless lives and health care dollars, and prevent undue suffering in millions of American women and families. 
On behalf of the 2.6 million women living with breast cancer, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.

Ms. SNOWE. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a package of six bills designed to improve the health of countless women across America. By introducing these bills during the opening days of the 105th Congress, I hope to convey that women's health is one of my top legislative priorities for this Congress, and that I will do everything I can to ensure that it is a priority for the 105th Congress as well. 
For too many years, women's health care needs were ignored or poorly understood, and women were systematically excluded from important health research. One famous medical study on breast cancer examined hundreds of men. Another federally-funded study examined the ability of aspirin to prevent heart attacks in 20,000 medical doctors, all of whom were men, despite the fact that heart disease is the leading cause of death among women. 
Today, members of Congress and the American public understand the importance of ensuring that both genders benefit equally from medical research and health care services. Unfortunately, equity does not yet exist in health care, and we have a long way to go. Knowledge about appropriate courses of treatment for women lags far behind that for men for many diseases. For years, research into diseases that predominantly affect women, such as breast cancer, went grossly underfunded. And many women do not have access to reproductive and other vital health services. 
Throughout my tenure in the House and Senate, I have worked hard to expose and eliminate this health care gender gap and improve women's access to affordable, quality health services. As co-chairs of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues (CCWI), Representative Pat Schroeder and I, along with Representative Henry Waxman, called for a GAO investigation into the inclusion of women and minorities in medical research at the National Institutes of Health. This study documented the widespread exclusion of women from medical research, and spurred the Caucus to introduce the first Women's Health Equity Act (WHEA) in 1990. This comprehensive legislation provided Congress with its first broad, forward looking health agenda designed to redress the historical inequities that face women in medical research, prevention and services. 
Since the initial introduction of WHEA, we have made important strides on behalf of women's health. Legislation from that first package became law in June 1993, mandating the inclusion of women and minorities in clinical trials at NIH. We secured dramatic funding increases for research into breast cancer, osteoporosis, and cervical cancer, and my legislation established the Office of Research on Women's Health at NIH. And last year the Mothers' and Newborns' Health Protection Act, which I cosponsored, became law. This Act will end the practice of `drive-thru deliveries', where hospitals discharge mothers and their newborns too soon after delivery. 
Despite these achievements, women remain at a stark and singular disadvantage in our health care system and in health research. Equality in women's health remains a goal, not a completed task. Legislators must build on the gains that we have made on behalf of women's health to take the next crucial steps toward achieving equity. I believe that the package of bills which I am introducing today provides this framework for progress. 
Several of the bills I am introducing today target one of the major public health crises facing this nation--breast cancer. This year alone, 180,000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in this country, and more than 44,000 women will die from the disease. Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American women. 
Our first priority in the fight against breast cancer must be to maintain and strengthen our commitment to discovering new treatments for this deadly disease. As the Federal Government continues to fund breast cancer research, we also must ensure that funding goes to those projects which victims of breast cancer believe are important and meaningful to them in their fight against this disease. 
Over the past three years, the Department of Defense has included lay breast cancer advocates in breast cancer research decision making. The involvement of these breast cancer advocates has helped foster new and innovative breast cancer research funding designs and research projects. While maintaining the highest level of quality assurance through peer review, breast cancer advocates have helped to ensure that all breast cancer research reflects the experiences and wisdom of the individuals who have lived with the disease. In addition, breast cancer advocates provide a vital educational link between the scientific and lay communities. 
The first bill I am introducing today, which I am introducing with my colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, urges the National Institutes of Health to follow the DOD's lead. This bill, the Consumer Involvement in Breast Cancer Research Act, urges NIH to include breast cancer advocates in breast cancer research decision making, and to report on progress that the Institute is making next year. 
But funding new research alone is not enough--we must ensure that people who are suffering from deadly diseases such as breast cancer have access to information about the latest, most-innovative therapies which are frequently available only through experimental drug trials. At a breast cancer hearing which I sponsored last year with my colleagues, Senators Connie Mack and Dianne Feinstein, we heard testimony from breast cancer advocates on the difficulty patients and physicians face in learning about ongoing clinical trials. The second bill I introduce today addresses this knowledge gap, by establishing a data bank of information on clinical trials and experimental treatments for all serious or life-threatening illnesses. 
This `one-stop shopping information service' will include a registry of all privately and publicly funded clinical trials, and will contain information describing the 
purpose of the trial, eligibility criteria for participating in the trial, as well as the location of the trial. The database will also contain information on the results of completed clinical trials, enabling patients to make fully informed decisions about medical treatments. The bill would allow people with a serious or life-threatening illness, or the doctor of a family member, to call a toll-free number to access this critical information so they could locate a clinical trial near them that may offer hope by extending their lives or alleviating their suffering. I am pleased that my colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, is joining me in introducing this important bill. 
Providing people with information about clinical trials is only the first step in increasing access to experimental treatments--we must also ensure that they have adequate insurance coverage to cover costs associated with clinical trials. While pharmaceutical companies typically cover the costs of the experimental treatment, insurance companies are expected to cover the costs of non-experimental services. Yet many insurance companies deny coverage for these non-experimental services when a patient is enrolled in an experimental trial. 
As a result, many patients who could benefit from these potentially life-saving investigational treatments do not have access to them because their insurance will not cover these associated costs. Denying reimbursement for these services also impedes the ability of scientists to conduct important research, by reducing the number of patients who are eligible to participate in clinical trials. 
The third bill I am introducing today, the Improved Patient Access to Clinical Studies Act of 1997, addresses this problem. This bill would prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage for services provided to individuals participating in clinical trials, if those services would otherwise be covered by the plan. This bill would also prevent health plans from discriminating against enrollees who choose to participate in clinical trials. 
Another form of discrimination in health insurance we see today is based on genetic information. This is a particular concern to women who inherit or may have inherited a mutated form of the breast cancer gene [BRCA1 or BRCA2]. Women who inherit either of these mutated genes have an 85 percent risk of developing breast cancer in their lifetime, and a 50 percent chance of developing ovarian cancer. Although there is no known treatment to ensure that women who carry the mutated gene do not develop breast cancer, genetic testing makes it possible for carriers of these mutated genes to take extra precautions in order to detect cancer at its earliest stages--precautions such as mammograms and self-examinations. 
The tremendous promise of genetic testing, however, is significantly threatened when insurance companies use the results of genetic testing to deny or limit coverage to consumers on the basis of genetic information. Yet this practice is relatively common today. In fact, a recent survey of individuals with a known genetic condition in the family revealed that 22 percent had been denied health insurance coverage because of genetic information. 
In addition to the potentially devastating consequences of being denied health insurance on the basis of genetic information, the fear of discrimination has equally harmful consequences for consumers and for scientific research. For example, many women who might take extra precautions if they knew they had the breast cancer gene may not seek testing because they fear losing their health insurance. Patients may be unwilling to disclose information about their genetic status to their physicians out of fear, hindering treatment or preventive efforts. And people may be unwilling to participate in potentially ground breaking research because they do not want to reveal information about their genetic status. 
The Kassebaum/Kennedy Health Care Reform Act took the first step in protecting Americans in group health plans from genetic discrimination by preventing discrimination in health insurance based on a pre-exiting genetic condition. My bill, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act of 1997, takes the next crucial steps to prohibit genetic discrimination. My bill prevents insurers from charging higher premiums based on genetic information, prohibits insurers from requiring or requesting a genetic test as a condition of coverage, requires informed written consent before an insurance company can disclose genetic information to a third party, and extends these important protections to Medigap. 
While there is much that we still do not know in the fight against breast cancer, we do know that mammograms are currently the most effective weapon we have in the fight against breast cancer. Yet experts still disagree about the effectiveness of mammograms for women in their forties. In fact, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 1993 reversed its position on the effectiveness of mammograms for women in their forties, producing widespread confusion in women and their doctors. To assure that American women have clear guidance from their government on when to have a mammogram, I am reintroducing my bill, the Breast Cancer Screening Act of 1997, directing NCI to reissue its guidelines recommending mammograms for women in this age group. This legislation is particularly crucial in light of recent studies that show a reduced death rate for women in their forties who seek mammograms. In fact, one Swedish study of 150,000 women conducted in 1996 showed a 25 percent lower death rate for women who obtained mammograms beginning in their forties. 
Finally, the sixth bill I am introducing is the Women's Health Office Act of 1997. This bill creates or codifies offices of women's health at various federal agencies, including the Office of the Assistant Secretary at HHS, the Centers for Disease Control, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, the Health Resources and Services Administration and the Food and Drug Administration. This bill provides for short and long-range goals and coordination of all activities that related to disease prevention, health promotion, delivery of health services and scientific research concerning women. The bill also creates a clearinghouse for information on women's health. 
By statutorily creating Offices of Women's Health, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Women's Health will be able to better monitor various Public Health Service agencies and advise them on scientific, legal, ethical and policy issues. Agencies would establish a Coordinating Committee on Women's Health to identify and prioritize which women's health projects should be conducted. This will also provide a mechanism for coordination within and across these agencies, and with the private sector. But most importantly, this bill will ensure the presence of enduring offices dedicated to addressing the ongoing needs and gaps in research policy, programs, and education and training in women'shealth. 
Improving the health of American women requires a far greater understanding of women's health needs and conditions, and ongoing evaluation in the areas of research, education, prevention, treatment and the delivery of services. I believe that passage of these important bills will help ensure that women's health will never again be a missing page in America's medical textbook.
