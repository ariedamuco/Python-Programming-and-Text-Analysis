   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns about the lack of commitment for forward funding for the Low Income Heating Energy Assistance Program for fiscal year 2002. Mr. President, as you know, LIHEAP is a block grant program to  the states to assist needy households with energy assistance. Since FY1999, the program has been funded at $1.1 billion, plus $300 million for weather emergencies. I am pleased to note that, through our efforts, the Labor-HHS Conference Report provides $1.4 billion for FY2001, with a contingency fund of $300 million for emergencies. To my great dismay, however, the $1.4 million provided to help the States budget for next winter--the winter of 2001-2002--was cut from the final package. 
   We need to face the fact that our nation is budgeting by emergency when it comes to making sure that our low-income citizens, particularly the elderly, can keep warm in the winter. This past year, there were four different releases of the FY2000 emergency funds, most of which were released by mid-February, 2000. Currently, there is only $155,650,000 remaining in the FY2000 emergency funds and I am aware that the White House is coming to a decision soon as to how to dispense these much-needed funds. I have joined many of my colleagues at different times over the past year urging these releases along with the currently needed release. 
   I have also urged an increase in the regular funding for the States programs, along with forward funding for the next fiscal year so that the States can appropriately budget for each successive year so as to extend the benefits to as many eligible people in need as possible. 
   Currently, Mr. President, Maine's LIHEAP program has borrowed from the State's ``rainy day fund'' in the hopes that the State would ultimately get paid back. Today is December 15--two and a half months into the fiscal year--and they are still waiting. Because the Legislature had the foresight to lend out this money, the Community Action Agencies were able to get funding to LIHEAP beneficiaries last July so they could buy home heating oil when it was cheaper. 
   Like last winter, Maine's LIHEAP program is currently receiving an extraordinary amount of applications for help. Anticipating a colder winter and higher prices this winter, the State has budgeted to accommodate more applications--they have already processed over 26,000--but to do this, they have had to reduce the benefit from $488 last year down to $350 currently. They are hearing that, because of the high prices--as high as $1.63 per gallon--the $350 does not allow LIHEAP recipients to fill their oil tank even once as we move into the colder New England winter months ahead. 
   We have a critical problem facing the country in the upcoming winter months, Mr. President. It is said that misery loves company, and it is my sense that, given the skyrocketing natural gas prices being experienced by all parts of the country, the Northeast will have lots of company this winter as more and more constituents with low incomes, particularly the fixed-income elderly, worry about where the money will come from to pay their heating bills to keep warm. This is a very unhealthy situation. 
   I have spent this entire year appealing for more LIHEAP funding to protect the most vulnerable members of our society so they will have energy assistance when they need it most. I will continue to do so in the next Congress in the hopes that we will all step up to the plate and not only increase the overall LIHEAP funding but to forward fund the program so the states an be fiscally responsible and accommodate as many people as possible with this vital benefit. 
   The ongoing problem continues to be one of supply and demand as natural gas and heating oil inventories remain historically low, and the increased costs caused by this imbalance will not right itself in time for the cold winter weather when demand will rise sharply. This situation prices the low-income households right out of the market and they find themselves making ``Solomon choices'' for heating or eating, or by cutting down on necessary and costly prescription drugs. 
   It is logical that when costs are doubled, those served by the LIHEAP program are decreased by the same amount. And, we should keep in mind that only around 13 percent of households that are eligible for the LIHEAP program actually even receive Federal assistance. Colder weather, higher costs and tighter budgets could have the effect of raising this percentage upward. 
   Because Maine received over $5.3 million in emergency LIHEAP funds this past winter, my State was able to increase the income limits to serve more eligible residents with their high energy costs. Maine was able to increase the income guidelines to 170 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines and assist over 50,400 households with a fuel assistance benefit averaging $488, almost twice last year's $261. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to working with you on increased long-range funding that will allow the Community Action Agencies in Maine and other States' LIHEAP programs to plan and budget in advance, so that as many energy needs are addressed as possible. I hope my colleagues will join me next year in efforts for increasing funds so that our States can budget for a safety net that can be extended to as many low-income citizens as possible--and to make sure they do not find themselves literally out in the cold.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the passage of H.R. 1653, which includes the Pribilof Islands Transition Act and the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000. This bill contains a number of ocean, coastal, and fisheries related titles that will result in major conservation gains for our nation's marine resources at a time when we are placing enormous demands on them. The bill not only attempts to provide additional environmental protections through a number of state and local programs, but also tools for better management. 
   Title I of this bill is the Pribilof Islands Transition Act. The Alaskan Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea were a former reserve for harvesting fur seals. The Commerce Department, acting through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has been involved in municipal and social services on the islands since 1910. In 1983, NOAA tried to remove themselves from administering these programs. However, despite the $20 million in funds the Pribilof Islands received to replace future annual Federal appropriations, the Pribilof Islanders claim that the terms of the transition process were not met and the withdrawal failed. 
   This title authorizes $28 million over five years to again attempt to achieve the orderly withdrawal of NOAA from the civil administration of the Pribilof Islands. Additionally, it authorizes $10 million a year for five years for NOAA to complete its environmental cleanup and landfill closure obligations prior to the final transfer of federal property to the six local entities. The Pribilof Islands have historically been a very expensive program to the American taxpayers. Congress expects that this title will provide a final termination of NOAA's municipal and social service responsibilities on the islands and a distinct end to federal taxpayer funding of those services. 
   Title II of this bill is the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000. It is based on legislation that I first introduced over three years ago and S. 725, a bill that I introduced earlier in the 106th Congress along with Senator MCCAIN, the Chairman of the Commerce Committee. 
   Over the last decade, the United States had been leading a focused effort to conserve and manage coral reef ecosystems. The plight of coral reefs, both in the United States and internationally, gained much attention in 1997, the International Year of the Reef. One very successful program undertaken during the year-long event involved grants to local groups to build grassroots support for coral reef conservation, management, and educational programs. Since that time, NOAA has steadily improved coral reef management programs utilizing the full range of existing statutory authorities including the Coastal Zone Management Act, the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the Endangered Species Act. These complementary authorities provide the framework for comprehensive coral reef conservation and management. Working in partnership with the States and other agencies, NOAA has demonstrated its unique ability among the federal agencies to effectively manage these valuable resources. 
   This title will augment the tools already available and provides an outline to assist NOAA as it moves forward with coral reef ecosystem management plans. It requires the creation of a national coral reef action strategy. Of particular note is the use of marine protected areas to serve as replenishment zones. The U.S. Coral Reef Task Force has called for setting aside 20 percent of coral reefs in each region of the United States that contains reefs as no-take areas. However, many of the U.S. islands that have coral reefs have significant cultural ties to these reefs. It is imperative that any new marine protected areas are developed in close cooperation with the people of these islands and account for traditional and cultural uses of these resources. Without such cooperation, there will not be public support. The national strategy will address how such traditional uses will be incorporated into these replenishment zones. 
   The national program will also incorporate such important topics as mapping; research, monitoring, and assessment; international and regional management; outreach and education; and restoration. According to NOAA, the majority of our nation's coral reefs are within federal waters, therefore it is expected that NOAA will continue to work cooperatively with the states, territories, and commonwealths in the development and implementation of coral reef management plans and not shift the burden of responsibility onto these states, territories, and commonwealths. It is particularly important that NOAA not let recent activities in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands consume too much of the agency's personnel and financial resources at the expense of the rest of the nation's reefs. While the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Reserve will provide protection for the majority of reefs within our borders, it will not provide protection for our most heavily degraded reefs. NOAA must work collaboratively with our island partners to implement meaningful coral reef management strategies that target the full range of problems. 
   The title also creates a new coral reef conservation program, which will provide grants to states, governmental authorities, educational institutions, and non-governmental organizations. This is intended to foster locally based coral reef conservation and management. Creation of a coral reef conservation fund is also authorized. This fund would allow the Administration to enter into agreements with nonprofit organizations to support partnerships between the public and private sectors to further the conservation of coral reefs and help raise the matching funds required as part of the new grants program. 
   The title authorizes a total of $16 million a year for fiscal years 2001 through 2004 to be spilt equally between the local coral reef conservation program and national coral reef activities. It is our expectation that this money will be utilized in such a way that builds upon partnerships with the U.S. islands. 
   Title III of the bill makes a number of minor technical changes to fisheries  laws. The fourth title of the bill authorizes the study of biological and environmental factors that are responsible for an increase in deaths in the eastern gray whale population. Two-hundred ninety thousand dollars is authorized for fiscal year 2001, and $500,000 is authorized for each of fiscal years 2002 through 2004. 
   Title V of the bill makes a technical correction to the American Fisheries Act (AFA) with regard to two fishing vessels, the Providian (United States Official Number 1062183) and the Hazel Lorraine (United States Official Number 592211). The 1998 AFA authorized the participation of certain US-owned fishing vessels in the Bering Sea pollock fishery. The AFA was designed to work in conjunction with the license limitation provisions of the fishery management plan developed by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. Certain ``qualifying years'' were established in order to determine which vessels had earned a ``fishing history'' to allow them future access to pollock-fishing quotas. During the consideration of the AFA, the special circumstances of many vessels were taken into account. At that time, the fishing vessel Providian was being built in a U.S. shipyard as a replacement vessel for the pollock-fishing vessel Ocean Spray. 
   In 1994, the Ocean Spray was lost at sea--fortunately without the loss of a single life. Had the Ocean Spray not been lost, the vessel would have continued to fish for Bering Sea pollock during the years leading up to the development of the AFA. After the loss of the Ocean Spray, the owner-operator followed the replacement guidelines in order to secure his federal fishing permits and endorsement for his new vessel, the Providian. According to landing records, it appears that the average pollock harvest of the Ocean Spray during the years 1992 through 1994, exceeded 2000 metric tons. 
   Since the construction on the Providian was completed, the owner decided to bring his vessel to Bath, Maine to work in the Maine herring fishery. The current location of this vessel does not eliminate the need to establish fairness and restore the vessel owner's pollock-fishing rights earned with the Ocean Spray during 1992-1994. This amendment to the AFA is intended to provide the North Pacific Fishery Management Council and the National Marine Fisheries Service with the authority to qualify the Providian under the AFA with directed onshore pollock-fishing rights equivalent to those earned by the Ocean Spray during the years 1992-1994. 
   Mr. President, the authors of the AFA certainly took into account the particular circumstances of other vessel owners and companies. This technical amendment simply qualifies two vessels, the Providian and the Hazel Lorraine under the AFA for fishing rights that they otherwise should have received allow for the participation of two additional catcher vessels in the Alaskan pollock fishery. These vessels were able to demonstrate that they should have been included in the Act when it passed in 1998. 
   I would like to thank Senator KERRY, the ranking member of the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee for his hard work and support of this bill. I would also like to thank Senator INOUYE for his support, particularly for his contributions to the coral reef conservation section of the bill. In addition, I would like to thank Senator MCCAIN, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Senator HOLLINGS, the ranking member of the Committee, for their bipartisan support of this measure. We have before us an opportunity to significantly improve our nation's ability to conserve and manage our marine resources and I urge the Senate to pass H.R. 1653, as amended.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a beloved adopted son of Maine, James Russell Wiggins, whose life brought tremendous pride to our State, credit to the profession of journalism, and joy to all those fortunate to have known him. 
   For all of us, a great many people pass through our lives. Few clearly and  completely present us with the qualities to which we instinctively know we should aspire. Few truly define and embody the standards to which all of us should hold ourselves, and it is a blessing when we find them. 
   James Russell Wiggins was instantly recognizable as such a person, and I was blessed to have found him nearly 23 years ago. While his heart has ceased to beat after nearly 97 extraordinary years, his spirit continues to enkindle the hearts of all those whose lives he touched with his warmth, his enthusiasm, and his generosity. 
   Russ Wiggins cast his light most broadly and brightly through the medium of the printed word, and perhaps most prominently in his 20-year career with The Washington Post. Difficult as it may be to believe today, there was a time when the Post was not widely held in high regard, even in its own hometown. That the Post is internationally recognized today is a testament to the vision of a man for whom the public's right to the best possible information was paramount and integral to the health of our democracy. 
   Eventually reaching the position of editor, Russ Wiggins' stamp remains on every new edition of the Post. As Stephen Rosenfield, former editorial page editor of The Washington Post, wrote after Russ Wiggins' passing, he ``brought to the Washington Post a passion for newspapering and an unrelenting dedication to the public good ..... (he) set for his staff an unmatched standard of personal decency and integrity.'' 
   Just a few weeks shy of his 65th birthday, and his planned retirement from the Post, Russ Wiggins was tapped by President Johnson to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. What would normally be a fitting and distinguished finale to a long and productive working life would become only a prelude to his passion for the years that remained--a weekly newspaper called The Ellsworth American in Ellsworth, Maine. 
   Russ moved to the state in 1969, and became publisher and editor of The Ellsworth American shortly thereafter, building it into one of the most respected weekly newspapers in Maine and the Nation, and a great treasure for both the community and our state. As if that were not enough for a man ``in retirement'', he also became an active and integral member of his new community of Brooklin, lending his boundless energy and enthusiasm to a variety of civic causes. 
   I first met Russ Wiggins during my first campaign for Congress in 1977 at an editorial board meeting at the paper. He put me immediately at ease with his remarkable personality and wit, and I was immensely impressed with his extraordinary depth of knowledge. 
   As I would come to discover, Russ Wiggins had an appetite for learning for which the term ``voracious'' may well be an inadequate description. He loved ideas, and loved 
   testing his ideas against the opinion of others. He exemplified the concept of disagreeing without being disagreeable--he was the definition of a gentleman, and a practitioner of the kind of civility that all-too-often seems an old fashioned notion these days but, in reality, is needed now more than ever. 
   His excitement over knowledge was infectious, never pretentious. If he was energized by a book he had just read, he would implore others to do likewise. He challenged people not only to assess their own beliefs, but to risk undermining those beliefs with the addition of new facts, new arguments, and new ways of seeing the world. In short, he enriched the minds and souls of all those who knew him, and encouraged everyone he met to rise to their potential. 
   On that day when I first met Russ, an Ellsworth American photographer chronicled our discussion, particularly my reaction to Russ' comments. The images from that meeting later formed the basis of my first campaign poster--which hangs today in my Washington office and serves as a reminder of the time I spent with him and the example he set for the rest of us. And what a tremendous example that was. 
   Russell never strayed from his beliefs and integrity, as demonstrated by the high regard with which he was held among his contemporaries. And with his unparalleled skill, he captured the essence of the people he called his neighbors. 
   During his time with the Ellsworth American, he was able to bring out not just the news of Ellsworth and Hancock County, but also to convey the sensibilities and nature of a special region. Perhaps it is the fact that Russ saw and experienced so much of the world, that he continually showed that the rural coastal setting of Downeast Maine is anything but circumstanced. Whatever the reason, those of us in Maine are especially fortunate that he let us see the dynamic world through his eyes. 
   Throughout it all, James Russell Wiggins was comfortable in any company, not because he changed his stripes to suit the occasion, but because the essence of the man was always his generosity of spirit--and it was apparent for all to see. He shared what he knew not to elevate his own standing, but rather to elevate the standing of others. He voiced his opinions not to hear himself talk, but rather to advance the level of debate. He searched for the truth not in service to his own ends, but rather in service to humankind. 
   With his life having touched so many so deeply, it is no surprise that his death has done the same. Columns were written by those with whom he had worked. Katherine Graham, chair of the executive committee of The Washington Post, wrote a special piece eulogizing Russ and thanking him for his service. And letters to the editor expressed the sense of loss we all have felt in the wake of this giant's passing.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the prescription drug reimportation provisions included in the conference report for the FY 2001 agriculture appropriations bill. I also want to thank my colleagues, especially Senators JEFFORDS and DORGAN for their hard work and dedication to this important issue. 
   The United States is in the midst of a time of amazing prosperity. Nearly every week it seems that we hear of astounding new breakthroughs in biomedical research and in new prescription medications. And there is no question in anyone's mind that we have the best--the very best--health care in the world. 
   But our health care system is not without its flaws. Prescription drugs are revolutionizing health treatments, but their high cost is causing concern throughout the country. Everywhere we turn--from ``60 Minutes'' to Newsweek--we hear of the struggles that our nation's patients, especially the elderly, face, and the dramatic difference in costs of prescription medication between the U.S. and our neighbors to the North. 
   The high cost of prescription medications in the United States is forcing many of our nation's seniors to make unthinkable decisions that are harmful to their health and well-being. It is simply unacceptable that the elderly have to chose between filling a prescription or buying groceries. 
   A solution to the pressing problem of prescription drug coverage can't come soon enough. In 1998, drug costs grew more than any other category of health care--skyrocketing by 15.4 percent in a single year. And that's a special burden for seniors, who pay half the cost associated with their prescriptions as opposed to those under 65 who pay just a third. 
   Seniors are reeling from the burden of their prescription drug expenses--one of the latest studies shows that the average senior now spends $1,100 every year on medications. And with the latest HCFA estimates putting the number of seniors without drug coverage at around 31 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries--or about 12 out of nearly 40 million Americans--it's not hard to see why we can no longer wait to provide a solution. In fact, nearly 86 percent of Medicare beneficiaries must use at least one prescription drug every day. 
   Who are these seniors who don't have prescription drug coverage? Who are the ones traveling by the busload to Canada to buy their prescription drugs? These are people caught in the middle--most of whom are neither wealthy enough to afford their own coverage, nor poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. We know that seniors between 100 percent and 200 percent of the federal poverty level have the lowest levels of prescription drug coverage. 
   In my eyes, it is absolutely unconscionable that any senior would be arrested after purchasing their otherwise legal prescription medication in Canada. That is why I teamed up with Senators JEFFORDS and DORGAN to introduce the ``Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act'' as an amendment to the FY 2001 agriculture appropriations bill. The amendment was accepted overwhelmingly by a vote of 74 to 21. 
   I am pleased that the conference report includes a compromise on this amendment. The conference provision allows pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs for sale to American customers that were made in  the U.S. or in FDA-approved facilities. The provisions require stringent safety and efficacy regulations. Drugs may only be reimported from Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, Israel, New Zealand, and South Africa. Controlled substances, such as morphine, cannot be imported. 
   Drugs that are going to be reimported must meet U.S. labeling requirements and there will be stringent reporting requirements on any reimportation. The new provisions prohibit manufacturers from entering into a contract to prevent reimportation. Drug reimportation will not be allowed unless the Secretary of HHS can certify that the reimported drugs are safe and effective. The FDA will not be allowed to send letters to individuals about their personal reimportation unless the FDA believes that the drugs the person is bringing back are not safe, not effective, or not labeled correctly. Finally, the Secretary of HHS must certify that reimported drugs will save consumers money. 
   Opponents of the reimportation of prescription medications have well-founded concerns about the safety of these medications. There is no doubt that the 
   U.S. Food and Drug Administration is the world's premier agency in ensuring not only that drugs are safe and effective for their intended use, but that the actual manufacture of these drugs is done cleanly and safely. 
   So when Congress considers changing the law to allow the importation of either retail or personal use prescription medication, we must also consider the safety implications that are involved: Are other countries insisting on the same standards we are? Are other countries guaranteeing the effectiveness of the medication--medication that is purportedly identical in strength? Are other countries using the same ingredients and ensuring that there are no impurities in these ingredients? 
   The conference provision focuses on these safety considerations and includes substantial safeguards against the reimportation of lesser-quality prescription medication and stringent regulation to ensure that Americans have access to only the safest of products. 
   Clearly, seniors are traveling to Canada because the price of prescription medications is generally less expensive than in the United States. The difference in the prices between the Canadian and the American market for pharmaceutical products does not come because we are purchasing different drugs or different quantities of drugs. It is this point that I hear the most about from my constituents: why can a person buy the same exact drug, in the same exact dosage, and the same quantity, for so much less in Canada than they can in Maine? 
   The disparity in costs between U.S. and Canadian drug costs reflects our different markets, but also the government-run health care system that limits choices and proscribes doctors and care for Canadian consumers. The Canadian health care system is a government-run monopoly, an approach soundly rejected by the American public in 1994. In the U.S., costs are constrained through the market--not by the government--as health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, and preferred customers like the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs negotiate heavy discounts based on the size of their insurance pool. 
   Seniors in the U.S. have limited bargaining power to negotiate down drug costs because they are not part of a single pool. Yet if seniors were united in a single group, they could exercise substantial clout in the marketplace to negotiate lower drug costs. 
   There are 39 million Medicare beneficiaries--and these 39 million customers purchase a third of our nation's prescription medications. This represents a very large section of the market. Enacting prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries will make seniors a part of buyer groups with greater marketplace clout. This market force will allow seniors as a group to negotiate discounted pharmaceutical costs that will not only be the most economically sound solution, but will also guarantee seniors coverage of their prescription drugs. 
   When American seniors find they have no market power, they often determine that their only recourse is to buy their much-needed drugs in a completely different market. It is fundamentally unfair when seniors in Maine feel they must drive across the Canadian border to obtain affordable prescription medications. 
   Allowing the reimportation of prescription medications is, at best, an interim approach. It can be implemented while Congress debates the larger issue of Medicare reform, and enacting meaningful prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   Again, Mr. President, I rise in support of these provisions and I thank the conferees for their willingness to address this vital issue and their dedication to hammering out a workable compromise.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express how deeply saddened and angered I am by the apparent terrorist attack on the U.S.S. Cole on October 12th. Earlier today, along with many of my distinguished colleagues, I attended a memorial service in Norfolk, Virginia, the homeport of Cole. It was an emotional event. The nation lost 17 of its sons and daughters in the prime of their lives. 
   And we ask why? Why did this happen? I am hopeful that the details of the facts of this despicable act will be determined by the vigorous ongoing investigation. But I will tell my colleagues why--it is because we have national interests throughout the world and we have established a world wide military presence to protect these interests. We rely on these courageous young men and women who have volunteered to serve in our military to make the sacrifices necessary to protect these national interests. Mr. President, these young men and women of the U.S.S. Cole who were lost have made the ultimate sacrifice. 
   As the chair of the Seapower Subcommittee, I submitted a Senate resolution to memorialize those Sailors who were lost and to extend our heartfelt condolences to their families, shipmates, and other loved ones, to express our concern for the Sailors injured in the attack and wish them a speedy and full recovery, and to commend the entire crew for the performance and professionalism in saving their shipmates and their ship. You all remain in our prayers. 
   With this apparent terrorist attack, once again, we were brutally reminded of the dangers and risks that our young men and women who serve in uniform face each hour of the day as they safeguard our nation's security interests around the world. In difficult times, one's true colors are revealed--and so I applaud the valiant and courageous actions of the entire crew of the U.S.S. Cole as they fought to save their shipmates and their ship from this despicable act. 
   The courageous crew of the Cole embodies the motto of their ship as ``Determined Warriors.'' As we watched those first pictures unfold before our eyes I was struck by their professionalism, skill, and pride in fulfilling their duties. In that photo which shows a close up of the gaping hole at the waterline, I notice Sailors working on the deck just above, at once no doubt shocked and saddened by the loss of their shipmates, yet doing their jobs running pumps, securing lines, and carrying out the myriad other duties in this emergency with courage and determination. 
   Although I will reserve my judgement on the specific cause of this tragedy until the formal investigation has concluded and those responsible have been identified, there should be no mistake: those who want to disrupt peace and deter our nation from our global responsibilities must know that we will leave no stone unturned in our search to determine who is culpable. They must and will be held accountable. And I feel strongly that the US should keep all options open in determining the appropriate actions for holding those responsible accountable for this cowardly action. 
   The courage and resoluteness in the face of adversity shown by the gallant crew of the U.S.S. Cole is a national characteristic of Americans and when we are attacked under such circumstances, we all become ``determined warriors.'' 
   The men and women of our armed forces are today's patriots who remain ever vigilant against those who seek to undermine peace and stability in the uncertain world in which we live. I have said before and I continue to believe that one of the United States' greatest blessings is that so many of her young men and women elect to stand vigil knowing full well the sacrifices they may be called upon to make. Certainly, America is stronger for their sacrifice and remains forever indebted. 
   Mr. President, again it is with the deepest sorrow that I rise today to  mourn the loss of our brave Sailors--my heart goes out to their families as well as those who have suffered injuries and their loved ones. May God grant them comfort and solace in the days ahead. It is my hope that, with this enrolled resolution, they will know that the entire nation grieves with them.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1482, the National Marine Sanctuaries Amendments Act of 2000. This bill represents a major breakthrough for the protection of our coastal and marine resources by reauthorizing the marine sanctuary program. It is highly appropriate that we are considering this bill because just last week, on October 7, 2000, we designated our 13th national marine sanctuary in Thunder Bay. This is the first sanctuary in the system to be designated in the Great Lakes and serves as a perfect example of the type of federal and state partnerships that have contributed to the success of our other sanctuaries. 
   One hundred years after the first national park was created, the United States made a similar commitment to preserving its valuable marine resources by establishing the National Marine Sanctuary Program in 1972. Since then, 13 areas covering a wide range of marine habitats have been designated as national marine sanctuaries in the Atlantic, Pacific, Great Lakes and Gulf of Mexico. Today, the sanctuaries program protects over 18,000 square miles of our seas. Not only do the sanctuaries help protect unique ecosystems, but they also serve as models for multiple use management in the marine environment. Additionally, the sanctuaries can also function as platforms for better ocean stewardship, allowing opportunities for research, education, and outreach activities. 
   One of the most serious impediments to achieving the original goals of the program is the lack of funding. This bill authorizes funds at a level that we hope will allow full implementation of the sanctuary program. The bill authorizes $32 million in fiscal year 2001, with levels increasing by $2 million a year until fiscal year 2005. It also authorizes $6 million a year in fiscal years 2001 through 2005 for construction projects at the sanctuaries. 
   Additionally, we have set the priority for the next few years on making the existing sanctuaries fully operational before expanding the sanctuary system. These marine sanctuaries have tremendous potential for protecting our marine resources and increasing the public's awareness of the marine environment. However, lack of funding has prevented the sanctuary program from reaching its full potential. By increasing authorization levels and focusing our attention on the existing sanctuaries we can drastically increase the public benefits from these sanctuaries. 
   There are two exceptions to this limitation. The first is to allow for the completion of the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary designation. The second is to allow for the development of a sanctuary in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. These unpopulated islands provide a refuge for marine resources without the typical coastal development pressures. They are also home to the majority of the United States' coral reefs. The people of Hawaii have strong ties to these islands and, in recent years, have been working on a variety of conservation strategies to better manage these valuable resources. One of the options being discussed is a national marine sanctuary. Members of the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries want to ensure that this remains an option. The full complement of marine conservation and management programs administered by the Department of Commerce will provide for meaningful and lasting protections of these resources. 
   This bill also creates the Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarship Program to recognize outstanding scholarship, particularly by women and minorities, in the fields of oceanography, marine biology, or maritime archeology. The scholarships will be used to support the graduate studies and research of its recipients. It is being established in honor of Dr. Nancy Foster, a 23-year NOAA employee who was serving as the Assistant Administrator for Ocean Services and Coastal Zone Management at the time of her death in June. The scholarship will be funded by setting aside 1 percent of the National Marine Sanctuary Program's annual appropriated funds. I can think of no better tribute  to Dr. Foster's long commitment to marine resource conservation and management then helping the next generation of scientists and managers launch their careers. 
   I would like to thank Senator KERRY, the ranking member of the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee for his hard work and support of this bill. I would also like to thank Senator INOUYE for his support, particularly for his contributions to the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Reserve provision. In addition, I would like to thank Senator MCCAIN, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Senator HOLLINGS, the ranking member of the Committee, for their bipartisan support of this measure. We have before us an opportunity to significantly improve our nation's ability to conserve and manage our marine resources and I urge the Senate to pass S. 1482, as amended.

   Ms. SNOWE. I fully concur with my colleagues that robust public participation, oversight and review is necessary to ensure long-term meaningful protection of our living marine resources whether in Hawaii or in my home state of Maine. While I agree that it is appropriate to take action to protect our precious coral resources, I, to, am greatly concerned about the administration's plans to impose immediate and permanent prohibitions in marine areas without providing a meaningful opportunity for public comment on the proposal. Both the National Marine Sanctuaries Act and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act provide models for such a process. As my esteemed colleague from Hawaii pointed out, WESPAC has gone through an elaborate public process in developing the Coral Reef Ecosystem Fishery Management Plan which identified several potential closed areas. Does the Senator believe the development of this plan provided sufficient public review to support immediate closures under the Magnuson-Stevens Act or other marine conservation status implemented by the Secretary?

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to support H.R. 3417, the Pribilof Islands Transition Act with the amendment I have offered. This bill, as amended, contains a number of ocean, coastal, and fisheries related titles that will result in major conservation gains for our nation's marine resources at a time when we are placing enormous demands on them. The bill not only attempts to provide additional environmental protections through a number of state and local programs, but also tools for better management. 
   Title I of this bill is the Pribilof Islands Transition Act. The Alaskan Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea were a former reserve for harvesting fur seals. The Commerce Department, acting through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has been involved in municipal and social services on the islands since 1910. In 1983, NOAA tried to remove themselves from administering these programs. However, despite the $20 million in funds the Pribilof Islands received to replace future annual Federal appropriations, the Pribilof Islanders claim that the terms of the transition process were not met and the withdrawal failed. 
   This title authorizes $28 million over five years to again attempt to achieve the orderly withdrawal of NOAA from the civil administration of the Pribilof Islands. Additionally, it authorizes $10 million a year for five years for NOAA to complete its environmental cleanup and landfill closure obligations prior to the final transfer of federal property to the six local entities. The Pribilof Islands have historically been a very expensive program to the American taxpayers. Congress expects that this title will provide a final termination of NOAA's municipal and social service responsibilities on the islands and a distinct end to federal taxpayer funding of those services. 
   Title II of this bill is the Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000, which refines and reauthorizes funding for the nation's coastal zone management program. This is the same language that was passed by unanimous consent in the Senate on September 28, 2000. Not only is this federal-state partnership important to my home state of Maine, but it is also a significant management tool for coastal states throughout the country. Despite the fact that the coastal zone only comprises 10 percent of the contiguous U.S. land area, it is home to more than 53 percent of the U.S. population, and more than 3,600 people relocate there annually. Not only is it an important economic region, but the coastal zone is also critical ecologically. 
   We are currently facing a very serious problem in the coastal zone in the form of non-point source pollution. This type of runoff pollution is degrading the condition of our coastal rivers, wetlands, and marine environments. Compromising the environmental integrity of the coastal zone can in turn have a large impact on the regions' economic viability in a number of sectors, including tourism and fishing. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000 addresses this issue by encouraging and funding states to implement local solutions to their non-point source pollution problems. We have not created any new mandates or programs addressing non-point source pollution. Rather, the Coastal Community program can be used at the states' discretion if they want to create and implement 
   local community-based solutions to problems, which would include non-point source pollution control strategies and measures. 
   This title greatly increases authorization levels for the coastal zone management program, allowing states to better address their coastal management plan goals. While we have achieved many successes through the CZMA, the states have made it clear that they can do more and that they can raise additional funds to match the increased federal funding. Therefore, we have authorized a total of $136.5 million for fiscal year 2001 and increased authorization levels by $5.5 million a year through fiscal year 2004. This total authorization includes an increase for the National Estuarine Research and Reserve System (NERRS) to $12 million in fiscal year 2001, with an additional $1 million increase each year through fiscal year 2004. 
   Mr. President, Title III of the bill deals with the management of several Atlantic coast fisheries. Subtitle A reauthorizes the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act (ASBCA). The ASBCA was originally passed to help coordinate and improve interstate management of Atlantic striped bass, an important commercial and recreational fish. Because striped bass migrate along the eastern seaboard, it is imperative that management measures be coordinated among the various states. The rebuilding of striped bass populations is considered one of our fisheries management success stories and it is critical that we continue these efforts. This subtitle authorizes $1.25 million a year for fiscal years 2001 through 2003 to carry out the provisions of the act and another $250,000 to conduct a population study on the Atlantic striped bass. 
   Subtitle B, the Atlantic Costal Fisheries Act of 2000, will reauthorize the highly successful interstate program that manages coastal fisheries that cross jurisdictional boundaries along the east coast. The states have proven that joint management of these resources is far more effective than a piecemeal approach by individual states. In an effort to further increase the effectiveness of interstate management, the states have initiated the Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program. This joint data collection and analysis program is intended to meet the need for improved fishery statistics for management purposes. It is a comprehensive effort to address all  areas and fisheries and could serve as a model for a national cooperative statistics program. This subtitle authorizes $10 million in fiscal year 2001, increasing the authorization by $2 million a year until fiscal year 2005. 
   Subtitle C of this title deals with a significant problem facing the Atlantic bluefin tuna, ABT, fishery. In 1998, the Highly Migratory Species Advisory Panel unanimously requested and advised the Secretary of Commerce to ban the use of spotter aircraft in the General and Harpoon categories of the ABT fishery. Spotter aircraft tend to accelerate the catch of the ABT, and thus can create significant impacts on both the communities that depend on the fishery and the conservation intentions of the ABT management plans. Because NMFS has been unable to successfully implement a rule to ban the use of spotter aircraft in the ABT fishery over the past two years, it has become necessary for 
   Congress to take legislative action. Subtitle C prohibits the unfair use of spotter aircraft to locate or assist in fishing for ABT in the General and Harpoon categories of the ABT fishery. This action follows numerous public hearings held by NMFS and the discussion of this issue at several Senate hearings. This provision passed by unanimous consent in the Senate as part of an amendment to H.R. 1651, the Fishermen's Protective Act, on June 26, 2000. 
   Mr. President, to many Americans, as well as myself, the practice of shark finning is both wasteful and disturbing. Shark finning is a method by which the dorsal fin and tail of a shark are cut off and retained, while the rest of the shark carcass is discarded as waste. Much of the fin product is then exported for sale to Asian countries. Title IV, the Shark Conservation Act, attempts to address this problem by prohibiting the domestic landing and at-sea transhipment of shark fins. It also directs the Administration to begin international negotiations to reduce foreign shark finning. 
   Title V of the bill is the Fishermen's Protective Act Amendments of 2000. It amends the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 to lengthen the period during which reimbursement can be provided to owners of U.S. fishing vessels for costs incurred when a vessel is illegally seized, detained, or charged certain fees by a foreign country. Under the title, the reimbursement period is extended until fiscal year 2003. This provision passed by unanimous consent in the Senate on June 26, 2000. 
   Mr. President, title VI of the bill is the Yukon River Salmon Act of 2000. It creates a Yukon River Salmon Panel to advise both the Secretary of State regarding negotiation of any international agreements with Canada relating to management of Yukon River salmon stocks and Secretary of the Interior regarding management of those stocks. An Advisory Committee is created to make advisory recommendations to a number of entities, including the Panel. A total of four million dollars a year for fiscal years 2000 through 2003 is authorized. Of these funds, up to $3 million a year can be used for a Yukon River salmon survey, restoration, enhancement activities; $600,000 of the total is to be available for cooperative Yukon River salmon research and management projects. This provision passed by unanimous consent in the Senate on June 26, 2000. 
   This bill also address the very serious problem of an aging fishery research vessel, FRV, fleet. Because these vessels are used to conduct the majority of fishery stock assessments, they are a critical tool for improving management and regulation of our commercial fish species. Over the past year, I have conducted a series of six hearings across the country on fisheries management. At every hearing, the need for more and better data was raised repeatedly by the witnesses. The seventh title of the bill directs the Secretary of Commerce to acquire vessels, authorizing $60 million a year for fiscal years 2002 through 2004. They will be outfitted with the latest technology and enable innovative research. New England is in particular need of a replacement FRV, since the current NOAA vessel, the Albatross IV, is 38 years old and at the end of its useful life. Without a new vessel, the ability for NOAA to collect long term fisheries, oceanographic, and 
   biological data in New England will be seriously compromised. I had offered this provision as an amendment to the Fishermen's Protective Act which passed by unanimous consent in the Senate on June 26, 2000. 
   Mr. President, the bill also makes significant conservation and management improvements for our nation's coral reefs. Title VIII, the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000, requires the creation of a national coral reef action strategy. Of particular note is the use of marine protected areas to serve as replenishment zones. The U.S. Coral Reef Task Force has called for setting aside 20 percent of coral reefs in each region of the United States that contains reefs as no-take areas. However, many of the U.S. islands that have coral reefs have significant cultural ties to these reefs. It is imperative that any new marine protected areas are developed in close cooperation with the people of these islands and account for traditional and cultural uses of these resources. Without such cooperation, there will not be public support. The national strategy will address how such traditional uses will be incorporated into these replenishment zones. 
   The national program will also incorporate such important topics as mapping; research, monitoring, and assessment; international and regional management; outreach and education; and restoration. According to NOAA, the majority of our nation's coral reefs are within federal waters, therefore it is expected that NOAA will continue to work cooperatively with the states, territories, and commonwealths in the development and implementation of coral reef management plans and shift the burden of responsibility onto these states, territories, and commonwealths. 
   The title also creates a new coral reef conservation program, which will provide grants to states, governmental authorities, educational institutions, and non-governmental organizations. This is intended to foster locally based coral reef conservation and management. Creation of a coral reef conservation fund is also authorized. This fund would allow the Administration to enter into agreements with nonprofit organizations to support partnerships between the public and private sectors to further the conservation of coral reefs and help raise the matching funds required as part of the new grants program. 
   The title authorizes a total of $16 million a year for fiscal years 2001 through 2004 to be spilt equally between the local coral reef conservation program and national coral reef activities. 
   Title IX of the bill amends the American Fisheries Act to allow for the participation of two additional catcher vessels in the Alaskan pollock fishery. These vessels were able to demonstrate that they should have been included in the Act when it passed in 1998. This title also makes a number of minor technical changes to other fisheries laws. 
   Title X creates a new marine mammal rescue assistance grant program. This new program will assist eligible marine mammal stranding network participants by providing funding for recovery and treatment of marine mammals. Grants can also be used for data collection and the continued operation of these stranding centers. Efforts of these centers are critical for the continued conservation and management of marine mammals in our nation's waters. This program is authorized at $5 million for each of fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003. 
   I would like to thank Senator KERRY, the ranking member of the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee for his hard work and support of this bill. I would also like to thank Senator INOUYE for his support, particularly for his contributions to the coral reef conservation section of the bill. In addition, I would like to thank Senator MCCAIN, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Senator HOLLINGS, the ranking member of the Committee, for their bipartisan support of this measure. We have before us an opportunity to significantly improve our Nation's ability to conserve and manage our marine resources and I urge the Senate to pass H.R. 3417, as amended.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a friend and an outstanding public servant who is retiring from the United States Senate this year after 18 years in public service, Senator CONNIE MACK of Florida. 
   I have had the privilege of serving with Senator MACK in both houses of Congress. And I know him as a man deeply committed to the finest ideals of public service, as well as the beliefs he so passionately holds. 
   Perhaps no one believes more fervently in the inherent potential of each and every individual than Senator MACK. For him, it is not government that creates wealth or success or personal fulfillment. It is the American people. To give people opportunity--to give them the skills they need to compete and reach their greatest potential--is for Senator MACK perhaps the greatest end that government can serve. 
   I have also known Senator MACK as a staunch proponent of fiscal responsibility, back to the days when it often seemed that talk of balanced budgets was only slightly more fashionable than actually balancing the budget. I have to believe he must share my sense of wonder as to how far we've come, and it is thanks in no small part to the efforts of Senator MACK and those like him who have fought for years to make the current surpluses a reality. 
   Senator MACK has been a strong voice for the Sunshine State in the United States Senate. Most recently, his tireless efforts in helping to shepherd through the Senate the historic Everglades restoration plan, the Restoring the Everglades, an American Legacy Act, leaves a positive and lasting mark on Florida and one of our nation's true natural treasures that will be appreciated for generations to come. 
   One could argue, however, that Senator MACK has pursued no other goal with a higher degree of dogged determination than increasing our federal investment in medical research. He rightly sees this issue as a matter of national importance, knowing no political, social, financial, or racial boundaries. 
   He recognizes that disease touches every American family. Certainly, it has had a profound impact on his own family, including his wife, daughter, brother, and both parents--as well as affecting his own life. 
   Characteristically, Senator MACK and his wife, Priscilla, who is a courageous breast cancer survivor, met these challenges first with courage and dignity, and then with an unyielding determination to do something about them. 
   Both have been extremely active in spreading the word on the importance of early detection. As co-Chair of the bipartisan Senate Cancer Coalition, Senator MACK has provided outstanding leadership on matters relating to our fight against cancer, and in particular I have been honored to work with Senator MACK on providing greater funding for breast cancer research. 
   The depth of Senator MACK's concern when it comes to this dread disease cannot truly be measured. Certainly, having worked on this issue throughout my tenure in Congress, I was honored and thankful for Senator MACK's participation in a breast cancer hearing, or ``breast cancer summit'', we convened in 1996, but I was not surprised that he would be there to contribute his wisdom and his support. 
   From that summit came legislation to establish a national data bank of information on clinical trials involving experimental treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases. It also mandated that a toll-free number be instituted for patients, doctors and others to access this information. 
   Senator MACK has literally been instrumental in securing increased funding for medical research in general, and indeed for the fiscal year 2000 fought for the inclusion of a $2.3 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health. And he has rightfully called for funding to NIH to be doubled from $12.75 billion to over $25 billion over the next five years. 
   Finally, Mr. President, to quote a piece from the St. Petersburg Times from last year, ``the Senate will lose one of its nicest members.'' And that is absolutely true. Senator MACK has strongly held beliefs on the issues, let there be no doubt. 
   But he has always understood the fine but certain distinction between disagreeing and being disagreeable. He has been a credit to the Senate, to Florida, to the nation, and to his family. I wish him well as he returns to his beloved state and embarks on a new chapter in his life--one that I hope will be filled with happiness and good health for him and his wife, Priscilla. He will be missed by all those fortunate enough to have worked with him.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, for his support of this initiative. I agree with him and my colleague, Senator SANTORUM, and they are correct in their understanding of the intent of this authorization and the benefits center itself. 
   Cutler has a history of admirable and noteworthy support of the U.S. Navy. For nearly 40 years, the United States Navy's Computer and Telecommunications Station resided in Cutler and set standards for excellence in performing its vital national security mission. The civilian men and women of Cutler who contributed so much to this success personify Maine's celebrated work ethic. 
   Now, the residents of Cutler eagerly await the establishment of the new  benefits center and will once again showcase their loyalty, work ethic and stalwart support for the United States Navy.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to strongly support the fiscal year 2001 National Defense Authorization Conference Report which we are considering today. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the chair of the Seapower Subcommittee, I enthusiastically endorse this legislation, and further would like to particularly note its name as the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2001 in recognition of the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee's long and distinguished service. 
   I also want to acknowledge the senior Senator from Virginia, Senator JOHN WARNER, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee for the superb leadership he has provided in support of the committee in the context of the entire authorization bill, and our ranking member, Senator CARL LEVIN, for all his work on this conference report and for his contribution to the committee and its deliberations. 
   The Seapower Subcommittee addressed significant issues this year and we did so with the bipartisan support of the members of our subcommittee. I want to thank Senator KENNEDY, the ranking member of the Seapower subcommittee, and the other subcommittee members, Senators JOHN MCCAIN, BOB SMITH, JEFF SESSIONS, CHUCK ROBB, and JACK REED, for their contributions and their bipartisan support of not only this legislation but also of the work by the subcommittee throughout this year. 
   This conference report takes great strides toward modernizing our armed services, meeting their operational and maintenance funding requirements, and improving the quality of service for our dedicated and valuable men and women of the military. 
   Because we recognize that the service members are our most valuable asset, this bill makes a solid investment in substantive healthcare provisions which will improve the coverage and quality of healthcare for our active duty military members, retirees, and their family members. 
   Significantly, this legislation initiates a permanent program to provide ``healthcare for life'' to our military retirees age 65 and older by supplementing Medicare with TRICARE, the military's healthcare program. It also includes a provision, originally the Kennedy-Snowe amendment, which complements the ``healthcare for life'' legislation by expanding prescription drug coverage for all our retirees--to provide a comprehensive healthcare benefits program that our military retirees so richly deserve. 
   This conference report also reflects the Seapower Subcommittee's hard look at Navy and Marine Corps operations and the equipment our men and women require to carry out those operations. And, Mr. President, what we have found in testimony from our operational commander is that our Navy and Marine Corps continues to be the nation's 9-1-1 force. Our sailors and marines are forward deployed, carrying out the national military strategy, and they continue to function at a high level of operations. 
   In fact, between 1980 and 1989, the Navy/Marine Corps team alone responded to 58 contingency missions. However, between 1990 and 1999 that number had increased to 192 contingency missions--a remarkable threefold increase in operations! What makes this figure even more astounding is that this increase in missions occurred while the number of ships was reduced from 500 in 1980 to the current fleet of 316 ships. 
   The subcommittee recognizes the critical and unique role that the Navy and Marine Corps team filled in pursuing the national military strategy, and worked to create a bill that would support these diverse missions. To that end, I am pleased that this conference report authorizes an increase of $749 million to the Seapower Subcommittee procurement programs--on top of the President's budget request of $21.6 billion. 
   Furthermore, this conference agreement includes all of the original Seapower Subcommittee legislative provisions I referenced during my June 
   discussion of these issues on the floor of the Senate, as well as several positive additions which will enhance both our national security and the readiness of our naval forces. 
   I want to highlight several capabilities and programs that we addressed after receiving testimony from the service chiefs and operational commanders and after visiting and talking with our service men and women. 
   The Seapower conference report aggressively addresses the future of our nation's Navy and the importance of recapitalization of our fleet by authorizing the construction of eight new ships. This includes $4 billion for a Nimitz class aircraft carrier; $2.7 billion for three DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class destroyers--the most advanced surface combatant in the world; $1.5 billion for two LPD-17 San Antonio class amphibious ships which will begin to reduce lifecycle costs in our amphibious fleet; $339 million for one ADC(X) auxiliary supply ship; and $1.2 billion for one Virginia class attack submarine 
   It also authorizes the President's request of $357 million for the advance procurement of seven DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class destroyers, $508 million for SSN-774 Virginia class attack submarines, and $22 million for one CVN(X) nuclear powered aircraft carrier. 
   The subcommittee recognized this need to modernize the fleet and, as a result, invested in future ship research and development as the seed corn of the future Navy by approving the budget request of $38 million for CVN-77--the last aircraft carrier of the Nimitz class; $274 million for CVN(X); $207 million for the SSN-774 Virginia class attack submarines; and $535 million for the revolutionary DD-21 land attack destroyer. 
   This conference report also approves the President's request for $1.1 billion for the procurement of sixteen MV-22 Osprey Marine Corps tilt-rotor aircraft, $2.2 billion to procure twelve C-17 aircraft, and $176.4 million for contained research, development, test, and evaluation of the C-17 strategic airlift program. 
   I am pleased that $560 million of the total procurement authorization increase is for new ship construction and will assist the Navy in achieving potential savings of over $1 billion. This increase includes $460 million for advanced procurement of the LHD-8 amphibious assault ship and an increase of $100 million for advance procurement of DDC-51 Arleigh Burke class destroyers. 
   For the Navy and Marine Corps aviation communities the conference report authorizes an increase of $52.4 million to re-manufacture two additional SH-60 helicopters and a $41.8 million increase to procure two additional CH-60 Navy helicopters, an increase of $22 million for additional P-3 Anti-Surface Warfare Improvement Program Kits, and an increase of $17 million for modifications and night operations upgrades to the Marine Corps UH-1 and AH-1 helicopters. 
   The conference agreement authorizes a $179.5 million increase to the President's budget request of $4.5 billion for the research, development, test, and evaluation of Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force programs under the jurisdiction of the Seapower Subcommittee to include a $12.5 million increase for an additional Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle prototype, a $20 million increase to develop advanced shipboard simulators for Marines embarked on amphibious ships, a $15 million increase for a multi-purpose acoustic processor for anti-submarine warfare, a $10 million increase for development of command and decision software to be used throughout the surface Navy to improve communication among commanders, and an $8.4 million increase for the development of a defense system to protect our surface ships from torpedoes. 
   Mr. President, I want to emphasize that these increases were authorized by the Seapower Subcommittee to begin to provide much needed relief to the operational commanders who testified that they were being ``stretched too thin.'' This added funding supports critical programs that will provide commanders with the equipment and the modernized systems they require to successfully and safely accomplish their mission. 
   I say to my colleagues, this entire defense bill takes a positive step toward  modernizing our armed services, meeting their operational and maintenance funding requirements, and improving the quality of service for our committed men and women of the military. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of passage of the final version of the FY 2001 National Defense Authorization Act.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Violence Against Women Act of 2000, which is included in the conference report for the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (H.R. 3244). Current authorization for these programs expired at the end of September, and I believe that we must take immediate action to ensure that these programs are reauthorized before we go home. This bill has broad support on both sides of the aisle, with 73 cosponsors. 
   Domestic violence, no matter who commits it, is an extremely serious and tragically common crime that devastates families and takes a great toll on our society. Moreover, domestic violence often goes unreported, in large part because the incident is seen as a private and personal issue or because of the fear of a repeated attack by the assailant. 
   In my view, Congress must continue to address domestic violence in a comprehensive manner by providing resources for states and communities to disseminate education about domestic violence; provide counseling to the victim, the aggressor, and any children in the family; and ensure shelter to every person and child who needs to leave their home due to domestic violence. It is also important that health professionals are trained to identify and treat the medical conditions arising from domestic violence. This is a crime that we must put an end to and we must let those people who are suffering know there is help on the way. 
   Violence knows no gender barriers, but we must not turn a blind eye to the fact that women are especially likely to be vulnerable to danger and crime. The Violence Against Women Act is a critical tool in our fight to combat domestic violence across America. It is an absolutely essential bill for our mothers, our daughters, our sisters, relatives, friends, and co-workers. 
   One of the most important issues facing women today is the threat of violence. Three to four million American women are battered by their husbands or partners every single year. At least a third of all female emergency room patients are battered women. A third of all homeless women and children in the U.S. are fleeing domestic violence. At least 5,000 women are beaten to death each year. A woman in the United States is more likely to be assaulted, injured, raped, or killed by a male partner than by any other assailant. And women are six times more likely than men to be the victims of a violent crime. 
   This is more than just a nightmare for women. It is an America that millions of women and girls must wake up to each day. It is a grim reality millions of women and girls must enter each day of their lives just to go to work or attend school. It is real life America for millions of women and girls. And it is an unspeakable tragedy. 
   How many of us were shocked in June to read that women were attacked in New York City's Central Park in broad daylight following a parade? For days afterward we read headlines entitled ``Defenseless in the Park'' ..... ``Six More Arrested in Sex Attacks in Park'' ..... ``Police Study Central Park Mob's 35-Minute 
   Binge of Sexual Assault.'' The litany of tragedy and violence against the women assaulted that day in Central Park paints a full, stark and disheartening picture of a nation unable to protect a woman's safety. 
   One of the victims, Emma Sussman Starr, wrote the New York Times about her attack and about the prevalence of violence against women in America. She said: ``Women learn early which streets are safe to walk on, when it's safe to be there and even how to walk (hands wrapped around keys, eyes straight ahead). We accept that we must pay for our safety in the form of cabs and doorman buildings in more expensive neighborhoods.'' What a sad statement. 
   The threat of violence is pervasive, and as Ms. Starr writes, it influences every decision a woman makes. Every time a woman changes her pattern of behavior--for example, when she walks home from work a different way--in order to avoid potential violence such as rape, stalking, domestic assault, she is ultimately making a decision about how to live her life. 
   The original Violence Against Women Act, enacted in 1994, was a landmark piece of legislation. For the first time, Congress took a comprehensive look at the problem of violence against women, created the programs, and funded the shelters to help women out of these violent situations. Since then, thousands of women across the country have been given the opportunity to free themselves from violence. 
   But the problem of violence against women has not been solved in these six years since the original bill was signed into law. We must continue to talk about ways in which we can guarantee women's safety, further secure women's rights, and strengthen our ability as a nation to protect those inalienable rights as guaranteed under the Constitution. 
   After all, how can we defend a woman's right to ``life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'' when we cannot as a nation protect women from ``Rape, battery, and the onslaught of violence?'' 
   The Violence Against Women Act of 2000 reauthorizes these fundamental programs. The bill provides funding for grants to prevent campus crimes against women; extends programs to prevent violence in rural areas; builds on the progress we have made in constructing shelters for women who are victims of violent crimes; and strengthens protections for older women from violence. 
   I believe that no matter whatever else Congress does for women--from enacting public policies and designing specific programs aimed to promote women's health, education, economic security, or safety, we must also ensure that women have equal protection under our country's law and in our constitution. Reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act programs is an important step in this direction. 
   It isn't often that Congress can claim to enact a law that literally may mean life or death for a person. The Violence Against Women Act is such a law, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great Mainer and one of the most outstanding individuals I have had the good fortune to know, Francis Brown of Calais, ME. 
   There are many rewarding aspects to public service, not the least of which is the opportunity to meet people like Francis Brown. It has been my privilege to call Francis a friend for more than two decades now, and I know the people of Downeast Maine share my high regard and deepest respect for this devoted family man who has given so much of himself to the community and state he loves. 
   Francis is a leading citizen of Calais. He exemplifies the kind of values and ideals we frequently associate with those small towns throughout the country where neighbors still help neighbors, and where service to others is the standard by which a man or woman is measured. Indeed, for Francis, the concept of service is one indelibly woven through the fabric of his life. 
   As a student at the University of Maine, my alma mater, Francis spent four years in the ROTC program, and went on to serve in World War Two as a Radar Officer and in Korea as a member of the military police. Having more than fulfilled his duty to his country, Francis nevertheless later volunteered as an Army reservist with the Maine Army National Guard from 1946 until 1967, when he 
   retired with the rank of Major. 
   When he was not serving his country in the armed forces, Francis was working on behalf of his fellow Mainers not only in his law practice but as a longtime and well-respected city solicitor. As is typical of his nature, however, Francis was not content to allow his efforts in the practice of law alone--significant as they were--define his commitment to the community. 
   Giving generously of his time and talents, Francis has touched many lives and has made an indelible and positive mark on his beloved Washington County and the State of Maine. He was a member of the Advisory Committee to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court on Criminal Rules of procedure for thirteen years. A long-time active and integral member of the Calais Rotary Club, he earned distinction as a Paul Harris Fellow in 1976. 
   Emblematic of his commitment to and interest in education, Francis brought his tremendous wealth of knowledge and experience to his service on the University of Maine Board of Trustees for more than a decade. And  as a man whose faith has always been central to his life, he has served his beloved United Methodist Church in Calais as a trustee for many years. 
   Not surprisingly, Francis has been recognized with many awards over the years, including the Arlo T. Bates Award for Outstanding Community Service from the Calais Chamber of Commerce, the prestigious Jefferson Public Service Award, and the University of Maine Presidential Achievement Award. 
   And just as predictably, Francis has never been very impressed by all the recognition and adulation. For him, good deeds are always to be done for their own sake. Acts of kindness are made because that is simply the proper way to live one's life, not because they may bring personal glorification. Indeed, Francis is one of the most genuinely decent and humble people I have known. 
   Most of all, he is quite simply a wonderful person to be around. I would dare say there was never a person who has met Francis who does not like Francis. His generous spirit could warm even the coldest Maine day, and his humor could shine good cheer into the darkest of times. How thankful we are for such gifts as those he has so selflessly given to us. 
   Today, it is our turn to return the favor. With Francis having fallen ill in recent times, the hearts of many go out to him as do our prayers. It is not likely that any of us will be able to fully repay the debt of gratitude we feel to this beloved friend, neighbor, and fellow Mainer. But we certainly feel compelled to try. 
   The great American author Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote, ``to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived--this is to have succeeded.'' By that measure, Francis Brown is unquestionably one of the most successful people I know, and I want him to know that I am proud to call him a friend.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my unwavering support for passage of the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act (S. 662). This bill addresses an issue that is vital to the health and lives of so many low-income women--coverage of breast and cervical cancer treatment under the Medicaid program. 
   This legislation was originally introduced by our late colleague, Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island. Senator Chafee was always one of the Senate's leaders on health care issues, and like all of my colleagues, I am sad that he is not with us today to see his bill pass the Senate. I know that he would be pleased to know that his bill now has the support of 75 Senators. 
   I also want to take a moment to note the dedication of my colleagues Senators MIKULSKI, LINC CHAFEE, GRASSLEY, and HATCH--we have put many hours into ensuring that today's legislation gets through the Senate and can be reconciled quickly with the House version. Finally, this bill would not be before us today if not for the help of the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee--it was Senator ROTH who made a commitment to get this bill through the Finance Committee. 
   In 1990, while serving in the House, I was a proud cosponsor of the legislation that established the Center for Disease Control's National Breast and Cervical Early Detection Program. This groundbreaking program--sponsored in the Senate by Senator MIKULSKI--ensures that women who are medically underserved in this country receive regular screening for breast and cervical cancer. Since the program did its very first screening in 1991, over 1.4 million women have had either a mammogram or a test for cervical cancer. And more are screened every single day. 
   It is unquestionable that early detection is our best weapon against cancer. The success of the CDC program is proven. As a result of this program over 6,800 uninsured, low-income women across the country now know they have breast cancer and can take action to fight this disease. And over 34,000 uninsured, low-income women across the country now know they have either invasive cervical cancer or pre-cancerous cervical lesions. 
   In my home state of Maine, nearly 16,000 women have gone through the screening program since it began in 1995. And as a result of this screening 46 women with breast cancer and 23 women with cervical cancer have vital information that they might not have had otherwise. I don't like to think of what could have happened if they had found out about their cancer when it was too late. 
   Unfortunately, screening alone--and the life-or-death knowledge about one's health that comes as a result--cannot save a woman's life. It is estimated that breast and cervical cancer will kill more than half a million women this decade alone. In fact, breast cancer is the number one killer of American women between the ages of 35 and 54. While screening is the first line of defense in fighting cancer, and is so very, very important, it is really only the first part of the battle. 
   When the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program passed in 1990, we wanted to ensure that women would receive treatment. The law was written to require states to seek out services for the women they screen in order to receive timely and appropriate treatment. But the state programs are overwhelmed. Program administrators are scrambling to find treatment services--and even then these uninsured, low-income women must somehow come up the money for costly procedures. 
   This legislation will give women who have been screened through the CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program the chance to receive needed treatment that is truly life-and-death. This Act will allow states the option of providing Medicaid services to women who have breast or cervical cancer. 
   I would like to explain to my colleagues why this legislation is so important in a very personal way. One of my constituents went through the Maine Breast and Cervical Health Program and had an abnormal mammogram, followed by an abnormal ultrasound. She was advised to have a sterotactic biopsy but delayed for three months because she could not afford it. Three months in which her cancer could grow and spread. And while she eventually had the biopsy and was not diagnosed with cancer, these three months could have truly meant the difference between winning or losing her battle against cancer. 
   The women who go through this program have undergone enough solely by being diagnosed with cancer. And the stress of diagnosis is almost debilitating. But to compound this stress, to leave a woman with the knowledge that she has cancer, that she must--absolutely must-- receive treatment or her cancer will spread, but to not help her find the means to fight for her life is unconscionable. 
   We cannot sit back and claim that a screening program is enough to save a woman's life. We know that the uninsured are 49 percent more likely to die than are insured women during the four to seven years following an initial breast cancer diagnosis. This is unconscionable--we must provide an option for uninsured women who are not able to pay for treatment on their own. We cannot sit back and watch women die from a disease that they discovered through our program but not help them fight this disease. 
   I am extremely pleased that the Senate is bringing the bill up for passage today; the House overwhelmingly passed its version on May 9th and I hope that the two bills will be reconciled quickly in conference.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary contributions of Nathaniel T. Cobb of Waterville, Maine, to this great Nation. 
   Nate Cobb is a veteran of World War II, where he served as a combat engineer in the South Pacific and participated in the planning of six invasions during his tenure in the Army. Like so many brave Americans, he came home after the war and continued to contribute to his country and community. 
   Over the years, Nate has generously and selflessly reached out to fellow veterans and their families in need, working to ensure that veterans receive the benefits they have earned and so richly deserve. To this end, Nate often devoted his weekends and evenings to helping veterans, even as he worked full time for the Waterville Morning Sentinel newspaper in Waterville, Maine for almost 40 years. 
   In the 1960's Nathaniel Cobb demonstrated impressive foresight in proposing the idea of a veterans cemetery to former Senator Margaret Chase Smith, who worked with him to establish--in Maine--the first state veterans cemetery in the entire country. 
   As State Adjutant of the American legion at the time, he presented the resolution calling for a veterans cemetery to the State legislature, which approved it unanimously. Not only that, but he worked tirelessly to secure funding for the cemetery, which was dedicated in 1970, and later helped establish a chapel there as well. 
   Nate's achievements also extend into the realm of the written word, having written two books about the Maine Veterans Memorial Cemetery in order to raise funds to preserve the ground for generations to come. To this day, the proceeds from the sale of this book are still generating support for the cemetery association. I am proud that a letter I wrote in support of his efforts appears in the second edition of his book. 
   Nathaniel Cobb also initiated the ``Garden of Remembrance'' at the cemetery to honor those Mainers whose remains were never found. He was Sate Adjutant for the American Legion twice, State Treasurer for 12 years, and State Chaplain for 6 years. He has served on the Maine Veterans Home Board and on the Veterans Loan Authority Board. It was an honor to work with him on the fight to preserve Maine's only veterans hospital--the Togus Veterans Administration Medical and Regional Office Center--as well as other fundamental needs of Maine's veterans. 
   I congratulate Nate today as well as express my profound appreciation as an American for the lifetime of service and sacrifice he has rendered. He is truly an effective and doggedly determined advocate for veterans. 
   I have nothing but the utmost respect for those, like Nathaniel Cobb, who have served with courage, honor and distinction when their country--and the world, no less--needed them so desperately. From World War II through Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Bosnia, Kosovo, and numerous other conflicts, freedom and democracy have survived because when the call to duty came, our veterans were there to answer. 
   It is because of them that we enjoy lives unfettered by oppression, in a democracy that stands as a blueprint--and a beacon--for people the world over. It is because of them that we stand at the vanguard of human rights, human dignity, and personal opportunity. 
   And as long as America remains a beacon of hope, we must never forget it is a beacon that shines with the bright light of all those, like Nathaniel Cobb, who sacrificed for the principles for which America stands. We may hardly know where to begin in reconciling a debt to them that can never be fully repaid. but we know we can do no less than to try our very best. 
   In that light, it is truly an honor to congratulate Nate Cobb on a life of accomplishments and contributions to this country of which he should be rightfully proud. He is a credit to Maine and the Nation and a true American hero in every possible sense of the world. Thank you, Mr. President.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1534, the Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000. This bill reauthorizes and makes a number of important improvements to the Coastal Zone Management Act. Under the authorities in this Act, coastal states can choose to participate in the voluntary federal Coastal Zone Management Program. States design individual coastal zone management programs, taking their specific needs and problems into account, and then receive federal matching funds to help carry out their program plans. State coastal zone programs manage issues ranging from public access to beaches, protecting habitat, to coordinating permits for coastal development. 
   The Coastal Zone Management Act was originally enacted by Congress in 1972, in response to concerns over the increasing demands being placed on our nation's coastal regions and resources. These pressures have increased greatly since the Act was originally authorized. Although the coastal zone only comprises 10 percent of the contiguous U.S. land area, it is home to more than 53 percent of the U.S. population, and more than 3,600 people are relocating there annually. It is also an extremely important region economically, supporting commercial and recreational fishing, a booming coastal tourism industry, major commercial shipping, and a variety of other coastal industries. 
   The coastal zone is comprised of a number of delicate and extremely important ecosystems. Its health is of vital importance not only to the multitude of plants and animals that inhabit this area, but also the people and communities that are dependent on it for their livelihood. For example, coastal estuaries provide habitat for more than 75 percent of the U.S. commercial and 85 percent of the U.S. recreational fisheries. In turn, the commercial fishing industry, with value-added services included, contributes $40 billion to the U.S. economy each year. Recreational fishing added another $25 billion to the economy. Unfortunately, these major economic contributions are being threatened by environmental problems such as non-point source pollution. 
   Non-point source pollution is degrading the condition of our coastal rivers, wetlands, and marine environments. Although the states are currently taking action to address this problem under existing authority, the Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000 encourages them to take additional steps to  combat the problem through the Coastal Community Program. This initiative provides states with the funding and flexibility needed to deal with their specific non-point source pollution problems. The states will have the ability to implement local solutions to local problems. 
   The Coastal Community Program in this bill also aides states in developing and implementing creative initiatives to deal with problems other than non-point solution. It increases federal and state support of local community-based programs that address coastal environmental issues, such as the impact of development and sprawl on coastal uses and resources. This type of bottom-up management approach is critical. It allows communities to design their own solutions to their unique coastal environmental problems. The program also allows communities to be proactive in protecting their coastal resources, preventing them from reaching a point where drastic action may become necessary. 
   The Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000 significantly increases authorization levels for the Coastal Zone Management Program, allowing states to better address their coastal management plan goals. The bill authorizes $135.5 million for fiscal year 2001 and increases the authorization levels by $5.5 million each year through fiscal year 2004. 
   To provide further flexibility, the bill allows state matching funds to accrue in aggregate, as opposed to requiring the states to match each section individually. In my own state of Maine, our Coastal Zone Management Program raises an average of seven dollars in state matching funds for every single federal dollar appropriated. Unfortunately, not all states have been as successful. The new aggregate match provision will give coastal states more leeway to address important state and community projects. 
   Additionally, the Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000 increases authorization for the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) to $12 million in fiscal year 2001 with an additional $1 million increase each year through fiscal year 2004. The NERRS is a network of reserves across the country that are operated as a cooperative federal-state partnership. Currently, there are 25 reserves in 22 states. They provide an important opportunity for long-term research and education in estuarine ecosystems. Additional funds will help strengthen this nationwide program which has not received increased funding commensurate with the addition of new reserves. 
   I would like to address a very serious problem facing the Coastal Zone Management Program that we have tried to rectify in this bill. The Administrative Grant section, section 306, serves as the base funding mechanism for the states' coastal zone management programs. The amount of funding each state receives is determined by a formula that takes into account both the length of coastline and the population of each state. However, since 1992, the Appropriations Committee has imposed a two million dollar cap per state on Administrative Grants. This was an attempt to ensure equitable allocation to all the participating states. However, over the past eight years, appropriations for Administrative Grants have increased by $19 million, yet the $2 million cap has remained. The result has been an inequitable distribution of these new funds. In fiscal year 2000, 13 states had reached this arbitrary $2 million cap. These 13 states account for 83 percent of our Nation's coastline and 76 percent of our coastal population. 
   It is not equitable to have the 13 states with the largest coastlines and populations stuck at a two million dollar cap, despite major overall funding increases. While smaller states have enjoyed additional programmatic success due to an influx of funding, some of the larger states have stagnated. In an attempt to reassure members of the Appropriations Committee that a fair distribution of funds can occur without this hard cap in place, I have worked with Senator HOLLINGS to develop language that has been included in this bill that directs the Secretary of Commerce to ensure equitable increases or decreases between funding years for each state. It further requires that states should not experience a decrease in base program funds in any year when the overall appropriations increase. I would like to thank Senator HOLLINGS for his assistance in resolving this matter and his commitment over the years to ensuring that the states be treated fairly. 
   The Coastal Zone Management Act enjoys wide support among all of the coastal states due to its history of success. This support has been clearly demonstrated by the many members of the Commerce Committee who have worked with me to strengthen this program. I would like to thank Senator KERRY, the ranking member of the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee for his hard work and support of this bill. I would also like to express my appreciation to Senator MCCAIN, a co-sponsor of the bill and the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Senator HOLLINGS, the ranking member of the Committee, for their bipartisan support of this measure. I urge the Senate to pass S. 1534, as amended.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the contraceptive coverage provision included in the FY2001 Treasury-Postal appropriations conference report currently before the Senate. 
   This provision is fundamental to the health of the approximately 2 million women of reproductive age who rely on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, or FEHBP, for their health care, and I thank Chairman CAMPBELL for again including this important language. This language is essentially the same language that has been signed into law the last 2 years. 
   This provision says that if an FEHBP health plan provides coverage of prescription drugs and devices, they must also cover all FDA-approved prescription contraceptives. It also says that plans which already cover outpatient services also cover medical and counseling services to promote the effective use of those contraceptives. 
   This language respects the rights of religious plans that, as a matter of conscience, choose not to cover contraceptives. Furthermore, the committee language we have before us makes it clear that this language does not cover abortion in any way, shape, or form. 
   The contraceptive coverage provision signed into law the last 2 years, and contained in this year's bill, contains a conscience clause that strikes the appropriate balance between recognizing the legitimate religious concerns of individual health plans and physicians with the equally important goal of increasing access to prescription contraceptives and reducing unintended pregnancy and abortion rates in this country. 
   The religious exemption in current law specifically exempts the religious-based plans that the Office of Personnel Management, which manages FEHBP, identified as participating in FEHBP. And it exempts ``any existing or future plan, if the plan objects to such coverage on the basis of religious beliefs.'' 
   Despite concerns voiced by opponents, this provision has caused no upheaval in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program. When plans have left the program in the last 2 years they cited insufficient enrollment, noncompetitive premiums, or unpredictable utilization as the reason for leaving the program--not the requirement to cover prescription contraception. And other than the five plans specifically excluded in current law, no plan has requested to be excluded from the provision nor has any plan complained that the conscience clause is insufficient. Furthermore, OPM is not aware of any physician or other health care provider who requested an exclusion. 
   The need to retain the current committee language is clear. Today, nearly 9 million Federal employees, retirees, and their dependents participate in the FEHBP. Approximately 2 million women of reproductive age rely on FEHBP for all their medical needs. Unfortunately, before 1998, the vast majority of these women were denied access to the broad range of safe and effective methods of contraception. 
   It is clear that the need for prescription contraceptive coverage is well understood by women across the country. And while we in Congress debate this need and delay guaranteeing coverage to women across the country, states are taking up the call on their own. In fact there are 13 states--Maryland, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, Vermont, California, Delaware, Iowa, and Rhode Island--who have passed their own contraceptive coverage legislation. 
   Across America, the lack of equitable coverage of prescription contraceptives contributes to the fact that women today spend 68 percent more than men in health care costs. That's 68 percent. And this gap in coverage translates into $7,000 to $10,000 over a woman's reproductive lifetime. 
   So I ask my colleagues: with 10 percent of all Federal employees earning less than $25,000 what do you think is the likely effect of these tremendous added costs for these Federal employees? 
   Well, I'll tell you the effect is has: Many of them simply stop using contraceptives, or will never use them in the first place, because they simply can't afford to. And the impact of those decisions on these individuals and on this nation is a lasting and profound one. 
   Women spend more than 90 percent of their reproductive life avoiding pregnancy, and a woman who doesn't use contraception is 15 times more likely to become pregnant than women who do. Fifteen times. And of the 3 million unintended pregnancies in the United States, half of them will end in abortion. 
   Mr. President, I can't think of anyone I know, no matter their ideology or party, who doesn't want to see the instances of abortion in this nation reduced. Well, imagine if I told you we could do something about it. 
   We vote year after year to restrict abortion coverage in FEHBP plans. My colleagues know that I vote against this restriction every time it comes up. At the same time I firmly believe that, if the Senate is going to vote against allowing FEHBP plans to cover abortion, then we should require this same plan to cover prescription contraceptives if they cover other prescription medications--prescription contraceptives which prevent unintended pregnancies that lead to abortion. 
   That is what the committee language does. When the Alan Guttmacher Institute estimates that the use of birth control lowers the likelihood of abortion by a remarkable 85 percent, how can we ignore a provision like this which makes the use of birth control more affordable to our Federal employees, and do so--according to the Congressional Budget Office--with negligible cost to the Federal Government. 
   The fact is, all methods of contraception are cost effective when compared to the cost of unintended pregnancy. And with unplanned pregnancies linked to higher rates of premature and low-birth weight babies, costs can rise even above and beyond those associated with healthy births. 
   As the American Journal of Public Health estimates, the cost under managed care for a year's dose of birth control pills is less than one-tenth of what it would cost for prenatal care and delivery. 
   Whatever the reason, as an employer and model for the rest of the nation, the Federal Government should provide equal access to this most basic health benefit for women. The committee language would allow Federal employees to have that option. 
   In closing, Mr. President, let me say that if we, as a nation, are truly committed to reducing abortion rates and increasing the quality of life for all Americans, then we need to begin focusing our attention on how to prevent unintended pregnancies. Retailing contraceptive coverage for Federal employees is a significant step in the right direction. I thank Chairman CAMPBELL for again including this important language.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the issue we have been debating here in the Senate for the past week--the matter of permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) for China.  
   Mr. President, my concerns about China are longstanding. They are based in no way on antipathy for the people of China, but rather China's authoritarian government--a government with a human rights track record that no one in good conscience could even defend. That is why I opposed the annual renewal of normal trade relations for China just last year. 
   At the same time, we are faced with another irrefutable fact--China is becoming a member of the global trading community with or without the concurrence of the United States. The fundamental question we are faced with is whether the U.S. will be fully engaged with China during this process. 
   A vote in favor of PNTR for China represents a recognition of reality, a recognition that China currently has complete access to our market while we have very limited access to theirs, a recognition that China is about to burst on to the international trading scene as a full fledged member of the World Trade Organization, a recognition that we would be actively choosing to put ourselves at a distinct disadvantage relative to our fellow WTO members should we fail to grant China PNTR. 
   A ``yes'' vote is a recognition that our success in the new century's new global economy--which has arrived whether we care to admit it or not--will only be as great as our willingness to be a part of it, a recognition that we have, rightly or wrongly--and I would argue wrongly--already de-linked our trade policy with China from our human rights policy, and a recognition that the status quo has done little or nothing to help improve the lot of the typical Chinese man or woman. 
   Mr. President, this is an imperfect bill we have before us. Personally, I would have preferred to support a bill improved by a number of amendments we have considered during our debate. Because I believe we must do our utmost to impact human rights in china, to protect against the potential impact of their massive cheap labor market, to preserve our national security and to ensure compliance with our trade agreements. 
   For instance, as my colleague, Senator WELLSTONE, stated on the floor during the debate on his amendment conditioning PNTR on China's compliance with previous U.S.-China prison labor agreements, the 1992 agreement allowed on-site inspections by U.S. Customs officials in China to determine whether allegations that forced or prison labor were manufacturing products were true. 
   Yet as soon as Taiwan's then-President Lee visited his alma mater, Cornell University, In 1992, China demonstrated its displeasure with the U.S. by among other things, suspending its agreement to allow U.S. inspections. China still refuses to abide by the terms of this agreement. 
   That's why I supported Senator WELLSTONE's amendment because I believe it is time for China to start living up to the international economic role it seeks. Even absent that amendment, under the WTO, China is expected to abide by all trade agreements all the time--not just when it is in its best interest. And I will be looking to the WTO to hold them to that standard. 
   Indeed, as a WTO member, China would be subject to reams of trade rules, and any of the organization's 138 members would demand that a rule be enforced. I believe that this perhaps, more than anything else, would spur the development of a market economy in china which is based on full compliance with its trade agreements. 
   Moreover, it is encouraging that the Administration has put forth a plan to monitor China's compliance with the establishment of a new Commerce Department Deputy Assistant Secretary for China, who would be devoted to monitoring and enforcing China's WTO trade agreements. I am also encouraged by announcements that a ``rapid-response compliance'' team of 12 staff people working in the U.S. and China, and a China-specific subsidy enforcement team, will be established to monitor China's trade compliance. 
   Further, Mr. President, the legislation itself requires an annual report from the USTR on Chinese compliance with WTO obligations and instructs the USTR to work to create a multilateral mechanism at the WTO to measure compliance. It also authorizes funding deemed necessary for the U.S. to monitor China's compliance. This is a step in the right direction and a necessary component of this bill. 
   Another issue of utmost importance as we have reviewed PNTR from the perspective of what is in the best interests of the United States is our ability to maintain our national security. 
   As my colleagues are well aware, one of a president's primary responsibilities under the Constitution is to conduct foreign affairs, and in doing so, Americans assume that a president is promoting our national security and interests abroad. As trade among nations is inexorably intertwined with political relations among nations, national security cannot--and should not--be considered in isolation. Therefore, it has been entirely appropriate that China's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction have been part of this debate. 
   I have long been concerned about transfers of technology by China that contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or missiles that could deliver them. Recent issues have involved China's sales to Pakistan, Iran, North Korea, and Libya. On August 9, the CIA reported that China remained a ``key supplier'' of weapons technology and increased missile-related assistance to Pakistan in the second half of 1999. 
   This is why I was a cosponsor of the Thompson-Torricelli bill and a supporter of their amendment. It is vital that the U.S. demonstrates that we will not turn a blind eye to China's proliferation and that we will actively take steps to induce change. 
   The Thompson-Torricelli amendment did not address trade but, in fact, was a crucial part of this debate as China continues to facilitate the proliferation of missile technology and weapons of mass destruction, to rogue countries. It would have provided an annual review mechanism, mandatory penalties, and an escalating scale of responses to Chinese proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, missile technologies, and advanced conventional weapons. 
   Accordingly, I consider the passage and enactment of the Thompson-Torricelli proposal in the future not simply to be good policy, but a critical companion to PNTR, and I hope we will revisit this critical issue in the 107th Congress. 
   Mr. President, in addition to an in concert with our national security responsibilities, one of the most prominent national interests of the U.S. is the promotion of human rights around the world. Indeed, one of the ongoing and essential reasons I have voted against NTR status for China in the past was due to its infamous human rights abuses. 
   During the consideration by the House, provisions were added to the PNTR legislation to monitor China's human rights by creating a Congressional-Executive Commission. The Commission will submit to Congress and the President an annual report of its findings, including as appropriate WTO-consistent recommendations for legislative or executive action. 
   I also recognize that any U.S. trade sanction taken against China could be brought before the WTO for resolution by China. The WTO's focus is international trade law, not human rights. 
   Accordingly, I supported Senator HELMS' amendment that would require, as a condition of China receiving PNTR, that the President certify that China has taken actions regarding its human rights abuses and religious persecution. Just as importantly, I also supported another Helms amendment that called on U.S. businesses to conduct themselves in a manner that reflects the basic American values of democracy, individual liberty and justice--a voluntary code of conduct. 
   While both amendments were clearly defeated on grounds other than the merits of the issue itself, I make a personal appeal to America's businesses to conduct themselves in a manner that does credit to the ideas we hold dear as a nation. 
   And I'm certain my colleagues agree that it is clearly in America's best interest--not to mention in keeping with the principles on which we were founded--to keep up the pressure on China to improve human rights for its own people and it is my fervent hope that we will do so. 
   Mr. President, economically, U.S. companies have expressed to Congress  throughout this debate that our future competitiveness and, ultimately, our economic success as a country will be hamstrung without this agreement--but with it, all of America will be better off. Again, while I would have preferred to vote on a bill strengthened by the amendments I have just discussed, I find that I must concur. 
   For the past two decades, the U.S. has granted China low-tariff access to our market. And what have we gotten in return? Any number of different trade barriers which have severely limited U.S. access to China's market. To me, Mr. President, this has been far from fair. 
   Under this lopsided arrangement where China maintains nearly complete access to our market while we face stiff barriers, this has contributed to the increased trade deficit with China. In 1992, our trade relations with China produced $7.5 billion in U.S. exports and $25.7 billion in U.S. imports from China. By last year, our exports rose to $13.1 billion while our imports from China reached an astonishing $81.8 billion--a $68.7 billion deficit. 
   Now, some have argued that by improving the business climate in China, we're opening the floodgates for a massive outflow of U.S. businesses that will wish to relocate to that country. And certainly, China will be a more attractive place to do business should PNTR be approved. 
   But we must keep in mind that, under our current trade arrangement with China, many U.S. businesses have chosen to relocate a degree of their operations to China because Chinese tariff and non-tariff barriers make it very difficult to export products directly to that country. In order to gain access to the market, many firms build plants in China--however, this strategy has been by no means without is own problems. 
   In fact, businesses currently face a variety of discriminatory practices, including technology transfer, domestic content, and export performance requirements--in other words, that firms must export a certain share of their production. Once China becomes a member of the WTO--which of course we know is inevitable regardless of how we vote on PNTR--it will lower tariffs and eliminate a wide range of non-tariff barriers. 
   What does this all mean for U.S. businesses? It means that many firms--especially small and medium-sized firms, so we're not just talking about large corporations here--might choose instead to export products directly to China. 
   In other words, a greater investment in China under the provisions of the agreement that has been negotiated could promote an increase in U.S. exports to China. And that's not just me talking. According to the well-respected firm of 
   Goldman Sachs, passage of PNTR for China can be expected to increase our exports to China by anywhere from $12.7 to $13.9 billion per year by 2005. 
   In my home state of Maine, there are a variety of facets of our economy that can expect to benefit. Already, Maine is significantly engaged in trade with China--to the tune of $19 million in 1998. From agriculture to civil aircraft parts to insurance to wood products to high-tech industries and fish products, PNTR would allow these vital sectors of our economy to continue to complete on an even footing with our global competitors, and to do so under WTO enforced rules. 
   For example, there would be zero tariffs on all semiconductors, telecommunications equipment, and other information technology products by 2005. Tariffs on wood and paper would be reduced from between 12 to 25 percent to between 5 and 7.5 percent. And tariffs on fish products would be reduced from 20.5 to 11.4 percent. These are significant numbers for significant industries in Maine. 
   Now, some will argue that PNTR will adversely affect our textile industries. Mr. President, as someone who has long been concerned about our trade agreements because of the effect they will have on the textile and apparel industry in the U.S. and in Maine, nobody is more sensitive to this issue that I am. Since 1994, Maine has lost 26,500 textile and apparel jobs, so I have scrutinized every trade agreement with this situation in mind. 
   This legislation, however, represents an improvement over past trade agreements I have opposed. Again, the fact is, China will become part of the WTO. And all WTO members must abide by the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, or ATC, that phases out existing quotas and improves access to the markets of developing countries. In fact, all import quotas on textiles and apparels are to cease to exist by January 1, 2005, and China will reduce its tariffs on U.S. textiles and apparels from 25.4% to 11.7%. 
   In other words, under the ATC, the U.S. will be required to end quotas as will China. I understand that the textile industry wanted a 10-year phase out period and that opponents have contended that this will allow massive Chinese imports to the U.S., but the U.S. has negotiated specific protections regarding textiles and the PNTR legislation itself contains anti-surge safeguards. 
   Under the bilateral trade deal, the U.S. was able to retain the right to impose safeguard measures through 2008 and the PNTR legislation authorizes the president to take action if products from China are being imported in such increased quantities or under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market disruptions to the domestic producers. 
   Mr. President, I understand that textiles and apparels are an inviting industry for China to utilize its vast labor pool, but I believe that what we have negotiated and are about to enact into law addresses this issue while still allowing us to be full participants in the future. 
   And that is what this is about, Mr. President--the future--for both the United States and China. 
   The fact of the matter is, recent economic development has led to a rising standard of living for the average Chinese. Does China have a long way to go? Absolutely. Is this a hopeful beginning? I believe it is. 
   We are not going to change China overnight, with or without PNTR. But we must start somewhere. If we are not going to use the annual review of NTR for China as leverage for greater human rights in that nation--and clearly, as I noted at the beginning, we seem to have long since conceded the point, despite my protestations--then it is time to bring the American promise to China through the promise of increased economic opportunity for the Chinese people. 
   Change will be incremental at best. The Chinese government has proven itself a master of self-perpetuation. They still control the lion's share of finance and the means of production, and they are still a government not of the people or for the people. 
   But under this new trade agreement, and as a member of the WTO, the Chinese government will have a little less control then they had before. They will be subject to more rules--and rules made by those outside of China. And they will know that if they want to be a part of the tremendous promise of the 21st century, this is their only course. 
   Here at home, we have choices to make as well. Will we remain globally competitive? Will we embrace the opportunity to engage ourselves in a market of 1.3 billion people? Or will we tie oversees to the status quo, where China has access to our market, we don't have access to theirs, and the human rights issue gets no better than it has over the past ten years? 
   The bottom line is that the U.S.-China trade agreement--which is contingent on PNTR--represents an unprecedented, albeit imperfect, opportunity for the U.S. to gain access to the China market, for the U.S. to increase trade and thereby increase innovation and prosperity for ourselves and the generations to come. For these reasons, I will support PNTR for China.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pregnancy Discrimination Act Amendments of 2000. This bill would clarify that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act protects breastfeeding under civil rights law, requiring that a woman cannot be fired or discriminated against in the workplace for expressing breast milk during her own lunch time or break time. 
   When Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978, I wonder if any of my colleagues considered the definition of ``pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions'' delineated in this law would not include breastfeeding. But unfortunately, courts across the country have not interpreted the Pregnancy Discrimination Act to include breastfeeding. 
   According to the U.S. Department of Labor, women with infants and toddlers are the fastest growing segment of today's labor force. At least 50 percent of women who are employed when they become pregnant return to the labor force by the time their children are three months old. Although the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was enacted in 1978 and prohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, courts have not interpreted the Act to include breastfeeding. 
   Some employers deny women the opportunity to express milk; some women have been discharged for requesting to express milk during lunch and other regular breaks; some women have been harassed or discriminated against; some women have had their pay withheld or been taken off of shift work for saying that they wanted to pump milk. 
   On the other hand, many employers have seen positive results from facilitating lactation programs in the workplace, including low absenteeism, high productivity, improved company loyalty, high employee morale, and lower health care costs. Parental absenteeism due to infant illness is three times greater among the parents of formula-fed children than those that are breastfed. Worksite programs that aim to improve infant health may also bring about a reduction in parental absenteeism and health insurance costs. 
   There is no doubt as to the health benefit breastfeeding brings to both mothers and children. Breastmilk is easily digested and assimilated, and contains all the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients they require in their first five to six months of life. Furthermore, important antibodies, proteins, immune cells, and growth factors that can only be found in breast milk. Breastmilk is the first line of immunization defense and enhances the effectiveness of vaccines given to infants. 
   Research studies show that children who are not breastfed have higher rates of mortality, meningitis, some types of cancers, asthma and other respiratory illnesses, bacterial and viral infections, diarrhoeal diseases, ear infections, allergies, and obesity. Other research studies have shown that breastmilk and breastfeeding have protective effects against the development of a number of chronic diseases, including juvenile diabetes, lymphomas, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, some chronic liver diseases, and ulcerative colitis. A number of studies have shown that breastfed children have higher IQs at all ages. 
   Mr. President, this is a simple bill--it simply inserts the word ``breastfeeding'' in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. It will change the law to read that employment discrimination ``because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medication conditions'' is not permitted. 
   I believe that it is absolutely critical to support mothers across the country--they are, of course, raising the very future of our country. And we should ensure that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act covers this basic fundamental part of mothering. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this bill. 
   Mr. ROBB (for himself, Mr. L. CHAFEE, and Mr. MOYNIHAN):

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is considering passage of S. 1089, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2000. I have also filed a manager's amendment which makes a series of necessary changes to the reported bill. 
   The Coast Guard has been defined as ``a unique instrument of national security.'' But it is so much more than simply one-fifth of our Armed Forces. The Coast Guard's peacetime missions continue to expand as our nation asks more and more of these 36,000 men and women who serve our country. From its traditional roles of rescuing mariners in distress and protecting the marine environment, to more recent responsibilities including intercepting illegal drugs and alien migrants bound for U.S. shores, the Coast Guard has proven time and again why this agency is so valuable. Whether it is protecting mariners along the Maine coastline, managing inland waterway barge traffic on the Mississippi River, or enforcing fisheries conservation laws in the Bering Sea, the Coast Guard provides an indispensable service to our nation. 
   Despite the fact that demands on the agency continue to grow, the Coast Guard, like the other four military services, faces critical readiness problems. In January, the Commandant of the Coast Guard was forced to cut back all routine, non-emergency operations by 10 percent. Unfortunately, on May 30, the Commandant announced a further reduction in missions which resulted in an overall 25 percent reduction in routine operations. This cut resulted in a 20 percent reduction in fisheries law enforcement patrols in the Gulf of Maine and forced two Portland-based Coast Guard cutters to decrease their at sea time by nearly 65 percent this year. Mr. President, this is simply unacceptable. 
   Several weeks ago, the Military Construction Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2001 was enacted. This bill contained $700 million in supplemental emergency appropriations for the Coast Guard. It is now incumbent upon the Administration to declare the existing readiness shortfalls and reduction in operations as an emergency condition which requires supplemental funding. Only then will the Coast Guard receive this critical funding and be able to resume normal operations protecting our coasts, our resources and our citizens. 
   Mr. President, the bill before the Senate attempts to solve the Coast Guard's most immediate problems and provides future funding levels and other readiness improvements that would restore the Coast Guard's ability to continue operating at normal levels and prevent reductions in the future. S. 1089 authorizes the Coast Guard at $3.95 billion for fiscal year 2000, a $200 million increase over the fiscal year 2000 appropriated level. It also authorizes $4.75 billion for fiscal year 2001, an $800 million increase over the fiscal year 2000 appropriated level. In addition, the bill authorizes such funds as may be necessary in fiscal year 2002, depending on the Administration's request. It funds critical readiness areas, such as increases in military pay and housing allowances as well as enhanced recruiting programs. In addition, the bill authorizes several important procurement projects including the Integrated Deepwater System that will recapitalize the Coast Guard's fleet of aging ships and aircraft over the next ten years. Moreover, it authorizes the modernization of the Coast Guard's National Distress and Response system, our country's 1950's era maritime emergency communication system. S. 1089 also authorizes several management improvements requested by the Coast Guard to provide parity between Coast Guard military members and other Department of Defense service members. 
   The bill authorizes end-of-year military strength and training levels that would address personnel shortages created by a Service that may have been too aggressive in its streamlining initiatives during the last decade. This bill authorizes funding to recapitalize the LORAN-C radio navigation system, which continues to be the primary navigation system used by many vessel and aircraft owners. It also authorizes the Coast Guard to operate excess Navy patrol craft in their mission to stop the flow of illegal drugs across the Caribbean Basin. Finally, S. 1089 addresses various personnel management and marine safety issues to improve day-to-day operations of the Coast Guard. 
   During the winter of 1999-2000, my home state of Maine experienced severe freezing on our rivers and bays. Without the work of Coast Guard icebreakers, which cleared waterways for heating oil barges, Maine could have suffered from a heating oil shortage. The work of these small cutters is critical to Maine and the entire northeast. As such, this bill requires the Coast Guard to conduct an in depth study of future domestic icebreaking requirements. It further requires the Coast Guard to operate and maintain their fleet of harbor icebreakers until the Congress has had an adequate period to evaluate the agency's recommendations. 
   Mr. President, I believe the Coast Guard is up to the challenge of being the world's premier maritime organization despite the readiness problems it currently faces. It is my belief this bill provides the Coast Guard with the support it needs to meet that challenge. 
   Let me take this opportunity to thank Senator MCCAIN, the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator HOLLINGS, the ranking member on the Committee, Senator KERRY, the ranking member on the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee, and the other Committee members for their bipartisan support of the Coast Guard throughout this process. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the manager's amendment and passage of S. 1089.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his continuing support for the New England, Plant, Soil, and Water Research Laboratory in Orono, Maine. Quite frankly, with his help and the support of his Subcommittee, we have literally snatched this USDA-Agricultural Research Service potato research laboratory--so important to the Maine potato industry--from the jaws of defeat ever since the Administration called for its closing in 1995. Not only have we kept the doors open, but with his support, the research facility on the University of Maine campus in Orono now has not only Dr. Wayne Honeycutt as its very capable lead scientist, but has added two plant pathologists, a research chemist, and a soon to be added research agronomist because of his support last year. I want to once again re-emphasize just how critical the lab's survival is to the state of Maine, its potato growers, and its economy. 
   Ninety-five percent of the potato acreage in the six states in the New England region are in Maine, and the lab has the benefit of being in close proximity to the grower's fields. There has been a long and productive history of collaborative potato research involving the state, the university research program, and private agricultural interests. 
   The laboratory's last need is for a soil physicist to complete its scientific staff and not for a soil pathologist as originally requested and for which $300,000 is provided for as stated on page 31 of the Report Language for S. 2536. I request that this technical correction be made for a soil physicist.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, it is with profound sadness and the heaviest of hearts that I come to the floor today to pay tribute to the memory of a friend, a colleague, and a man who brought honor upon the State of Georgia, our country, and the institution of the Senate--PAUL COVERDELL. My deepest sympathies go out to his wife Nancy, PAUL's family, friends and his staff at this most difficult of times. 
   It is tragedies like this that remind us that, beyond the policy and the politics and the tremendous gravity of the issues we deliberate--beyond the grandeur of this Chamber and the history we write on a daily basis--we are at heart an institution of individuals--of people. And when one of our own is lost to us forever, all of us are diminished by that loss. 
   I first met PAUL when I was a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and he came before us as President Bush's Director of the Peace Corps. I recall being struck not only by his obvious qualifications for the job, but by his warmth and his obvious esteem for the mission he was chosen to fulfill. To help foster the ideals of freedom and democracy for people throughout the world was for PAUL a high and noble calling. And it was one he answered with typical energy and enthusiasm, optimism and hope. 
   Indeed, when I think about all that PAUL was--all that he symbolized, all that he meant to those who cared about him and the people he served--the single word that comes to my mind is, ``decency''. PAUL COVERDELL was many things: a devoted husband, a talented legislator, a strong and principled leader--but above all else, PAUL was simply one of the most decent human beings one could ever hope to know. And any of us should be so fortunate to be remembered as that. 
   I well remember when I first came to the Senate from the House in 1995, PAUL had of course been here for 2 years, and he knew how difficult it was to get started, to get your feet firmly planted on the ground in these foreign surroundings. 
   And so he helped us freshmen--and woman--to find our way around, to set up offices, to figure out the basics of how things work around here. While it is perhaps true that none of us have ever really figured out that secret, PAUL and is staff certainly did their best to give advice and lend a helping hand. But then, knowing PAUL as I do now, that really comes as no big surprise. 
   PAUL was always helping people, always contributing to the world around him. From his service in the U.S. Army to the state legislature to Director of the Peace Corps to United States Senator, PAUL believed that to serve others was a privilege, not a burden. He truly believed that he could made a difference in people's lives. And he was right. 
   What a a lesson his life can teach an often cynical world. We ask ourselves, what can one person do? What kind of a positive impact can government truly have on the lives of others? What happened to the idea of public service as a noble calling? 
   To those questions there is one simple answer--people like PAUL COVERDELL exist in the world: Good, honorable, trustworthy people who call us to  our better nature, who exemplify what the framers of this Nation had in mind when they created what they hoped would one day be the greatest deliberative body on earth. 
   He personified another virtue that often seems in short supply in a world where the volume of one's indignation is all too frequently the sole measure of one's passion--and that virtue is civility. PAUL let the weight of his arguments speak for themselves, and where there were disagreements he respected those who disagreed with him. Perhaps that is why he engendered such deep respect in return. 
   It is little wonder, then, that PAUL rose so rapidly through the ranks of leadership. He had a keen grasp of policy and detail, and nobody worked harder on behalf of his constituents and his party. 
   He was truly a ``legislator's legislator''--not only creative in developing solutions, but always focused on moving the ball forward, on producing results for the people of Georgia and America whether in the areas of education, keeping drugs out of the hands of our children, or allowing hardworking Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money. 
   In fact, I remember at one point my staff commented to me that it seemed like everything we were considering in the Senate seemed to have PAUL's stamp on it. But that was typical of PAUL. He never stood still--and he never forgot the sacred trust that must exist between elected officials and those they are obliged to serve. 
   Just as important, PAUL was a man for whom his pledge was his bond--and that only counts for everything in this institution. His words had credibility, his ideas merit, and is actions sincerity. He made me proud to be a member of the United States Senate. He made us all proud. 
   Once again, my heart goes out to PAUL's wife Nancy, his family, friends and all of his staff--whom I know are heartbroken as we all are--and to the people of the State of Georgia, who have lost a great leader and true friend. He will surely be missed by all of us who were fortunate to have known him, but his legacy will just as surely live on in all those whose lives he has touched.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague, Senator CHAFEE, to introduce a revised version of the ``Building, Renovating, Improving, and Constructing Kids' Schools (BRICKS) Act''--legislation that would address our nation's burgeoning need for K-12 school construction, renovation, and repair. 
   The legislation--which is endorsed by the National Education Association (NEA) and National PTA, and the National Association of State Boards of Education (NASBE)--would accomplish this in a fiscally-responsible manner while seeking to find the middle ground between those who support a very direct, active federal role in school construction, and those who are concerned about an expanded federal role in what has been--and remains--a state and local responsibility. 
   Mr. President, the condition of many of our nation's existing public schools is abysmal even as the need for additional schools and classroom space grows. Specifically, according to reports issued by the General Accounting Office (GAO) in 1995 and 1996, fully one-third of all public schools needing extensive repair or replacement. 
   As further evidence of this problem, an issue brief prepared by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in 1999 stated that the average public school in America is 42 years old, with school buildings beginning rapid deterioration after 40 years. In addition, the NCES brief found that 29 percent of all public schools are in the ``oldest condition,'' which means that they were built prior to 1970 and have either never been renovated or were renovated prior to 1980. 
   Not only are our nation's schools in need of repair and renovation, but there is a growing demand for additional schools and classrooms due to an ongoing surge in student enrollment. Specifically, according to the NCES, at least 2,400 new public schools will need to be built by the year 2003 to accommodate our nation's burgeoning school rolls, which will grow from a record 52.7 million children today to 54.3 million by 2008. 
   Needless to say, the cost of addressing our nation's need for school renovations and construction is enormous. In fact, according to the General Accounting Office (GAO), it will cost $112 billion just to bring our nation's schools into good overall condition, and a recent report by the NEA identified $332 billion in unmet school modernization needs. Nowhere is this cost better understood than in my home state of Maine, where a 1996 study by the Maine Department of Education and the State Board of Education determined that the cost of addressing the state's school building and construction needs stood at $637 million. 
   Mr. President, we simply cannot allow our nation's schools to fall into utter disrepair and obsolescence with children sitting in classrooms that have leaky ceiling or rotting walls. We cannot ignore the need for new schools as the record number of children enrolled in K-12 schools continues to grow. 
   Accordingly, because the cost of repairing and building these facilities may prove to be more than many state and local governments can bear in a short period of time, I believe the federal government can and should assist Maine and other state and local governments in addressing this growing national crisis. 
   Admittedly, not all members support strong federal intervention in what has been historically a state and local responsibility. In fact, many argue with merit that the best form of federal assistance for school construction or other local educational needs would be for the federal government to fulfill its commitment to fund 40 percent of the cost of special education. This long-standing commitment was made when the Individuals with Disabilities Education (IDEA) Act was signed into law more than 20 years ago, but the federal government has fallen woefully short in upholding its end of the bargain, only recently increasing its share above 10 percent. 
   Needless to say, I strongly agree with those who argue that the federal government's failure to fulfill this mandate represents nothing less than a raid on the pocketbook of every state and local government. Accordingly, I am pleased that recent efforts in the Congress have increased federal funding for IDEA by nearly $2.5 billion over the past four years, and I support ongoing efforts to achieve the 40 percent federal commitment in the near future. 
   Yet, even as we work to fulfill this long-standing commitment and thereby free-up local resources to address local needs, I believe the federal government can do more to assist state and local governments in addressing their school construction needs without infringing on local control. 
   Mr. President, the legislation we are offering today--the ``BRICKS Act''--will do just. Specifically, it addresses our nation's school construction needs in a responsible fiscal manner while bridging the gap between those who advocate a more activist federal role in school construction and those who do not. 
   First, our legislation will provide $20 billion in federal loans to support school construction, renovation, and repair at the local level. By designating that at least one-half of these loan monies must be used to pay the interest owed to bondholders on new school construction bonds that are issued through the year 2003, the federal government will leverage the issuing of new bonds by states and localities that would not otherwise be made. In addition, by providing that up to one-half of the monies may be used for state-wide school construction initiatives, the bill provides needed flexibility to 
   ensure that unique state and local approaches to school construction will also be supported, such as revolving loan funds. 
   Of importance, these loan monies--which will be distributed on an annual basis using the Title I distribution formula--will become available to each state at the request of a Governor. While the federal loans can only be used to support bond issues that will supplement, and not supplant, the amount of school construction that would have occurred in the absence of the loans, there will be no requirement that states engage in a lengthy application process that does not even assure them of their rightful share of the $20 billion pot. 
   Second, our bill ensures that these loans are made by the federal government in a fiscally responsible manner that does not cut into the Social Security surplus or claim a portion of non-Social Security surpluses that may prove ephemeral in the future. 
   Specifically, our bill would make these loans to states from the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF)--a fund that was created through the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 and has grown to hold more than $40 billion in assets. The principal activity of the fund--which is controlled solely by the Secretary of the Treasury--is foreign exchange intervention that is intended to limit fluctuations in exchange rates. However, the fund has also been used to provide stabilization loans to foreign countries, including a $20 billion line of credit to Mexico in 1995 to support the peso. 
   In light of the controversial manner in which the ESF has been used, some have argued that additional constraints should be placed on the fund. Still others--including former Federal Reserve Board Governor Lawrence B. Lindsey--have stated that, for various reasons, the fund should be liquidated. 
   Regardless of how one feels about exercising greater constraint over he ESF or liquidating it, I believe that if this $40 billion fund can be used to bailout foreign currencies, it certainly can be used to help America's schools. 
   Accordingly, I believe it is appropriate that the $20 billion in loans provided by my legislation will be made  from the ESF--an amount identical to the line of credit that was extended to Mexico by the Secretary of the Treasury in 1995. Of importance, these loans will be made from the ESF on a progressive, annual basis--not in a sudden or immediate manner. Furthermore, these monies will be repaid to the fund to ensure that the ESF is compensated for the loans it makes. 
   Although the ESF will recoup all of the monies it lends, it should also be noted that my proposal ensures that states and local governments will not be forced to pay excessive interest, or that they will be forced to repay over an unreasonable period of time. In fact, if the federal government fails to substantially increase its share of IDEA funding, states will incur no interest at all! 
   Specifically, to encourage the federal government to meet its funding commitment for IDEA--and to compensate states for the fact that every dollar in foregone IDEA funding is a dollar less that they have for school construction or other local needs--our bill would impose no interest on BRICKS loans during the first five years provided the 40 percent funding commitment is not met. 
   Thereafter, the interest rate is pegged to the federal share of IDEA: zero in any year that the federal government fails to fund at least 20 percent of the cost of IDEA; 2.5 percent--the long-term projected inflation rate--in years that the federal share falls between 20 and 30 percent; 3.5 percent in years the federal share is 30 to 40 percent; and 4.5 percent in years the full 40 percent share is achieved. 
   Combined, these provisions will minimize the cost of these loans to the states, and maximize the utilization of these loans for school construction, renovation, and repair. 
   Mr. President, by providing low-interest loans to states and local governments to support school construction, I believe that our bill represents a fiscally-responsible, centrist solution to a national problem. 
   For those who support a direct, active federal role in school construction, our bill provides substantial federal assistance by dedicating $20 billion to leverage a significant amount of new school construction bonds. For those who are concerned about the federal government becoming overly-engaged in an historically state and local responsibility--and thereby stepping on local control--my bill directs that the monies provided to states will be repaid, and that no onerous applications or demands are placed on states to receive their share of these monies. 
   Mr. President, I urge that my colleagues support the ``BRICKS Act''--legislation that is intended to bridge the gap between competing philosophies on the federal role in school construction. Ultimately, if we work together, we can make a tangible difference in the condition of America's schools without turning it into a partisan or ideological battle that is better suited to sound bites than actual solutions.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, Maine and the nation have an opportunity to accomplish an enormously meaningful level of forest protection in Maine's 10 million acre Northern Forest if significant funding for Forest Service accounts is allocated for Maine projects in fiscal year 2001. In the last two years, an astounding 20 percent of Maine's total forestland acreage has changed ownership, an occurrence that represents a significant shift in the pattern of stable long-term ownership and use that has characterized the Maine woods for at least the last hundred years.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4810--legislation that would dramatically reduce one of the most insidious aspects of the tax code: the marriage penalty. 
   As my colleagues are aware, there are several primary causes of the ``marriage penalty'' within the tax code, including different tax rate schedules and different standard deductions for joint filers versus single filers. 
   In terms of the impact of these differing tax provisions, the marriage penalty is most pronounced for two-earner couples in which the husband and wife have nearly equal incomes. While this may not have been as noticeable in society 30 or 40 years ago, the demographic changes that have occurred since the 1960s--with more married women entering the workforce to help support their families--has led to a significant increase in the share of couples who suffer from the marriage penalty. 
   Make no mistake, the impact of the marriage penalty is severe. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), 42% of married couples incur marriage penalties that average nearly $1,400. 
   When measured by income category, fully 12% of couples with incomes below $20,000 incurred a marriage penalty in 1996; 44% of couples with incomes of $20,000 to $50,000; and 55% of couples with incomes above $50,000. 
   In addition, according to CBO, empirical evidence suggests that the marriage penalty may affect work patterns, particularly for a couple's second earner. Specifically, because filing a joint return often imposes a substantially higher tax rate on a couple's second earner, the higher rate reduces the second earner's after-tax wage and may cause that individual to work fewer hours or not at all. As a result, economic efficiency is harmed in the overall economy. 
   Furthermore, while I would hope that the tax code would not be a factor in a couple's decision to marry or stay single, the simple fact is that a couple's tax status could worsen if married and could, therefore, impact a couple's decision to marry. Therefore, we should eliminate this potential barrier to marriage and ensure that couples make one of life's biggest decisions based on their values and beliefs--not on the federal tax code. 
   As a strong opponent of the marriage penalty, I am an original cosponsor of S. 15, legislation introduced by Senator  HUTCHISON that eliminates the marriage penalty through a proposal known as ``income splitting.'' Under this approach, a married couple would add up all their income and then split it in half. Each spouse would then file as a single individual and pay taxes on his or her half of the total income, with exemptions, deductions and credits being split evenly between the two spouses. 
   Last year, to advance this legislation or any other proposal that would provide marriage penalty relief, I offered an amendment during the markup of the FY 2000 budget resolution that ensured a significant reduction in--or the outright elimination of--the marriage penalty would be a central component of any tax cut package adopted during last year's reconciliation process. 
   Later that summer, in accordance with my budget amendment, the $792 billion tax cut reconciliation package that was passed by the Senate included such 
   relief, as did the final House-Senate conference report. However, just as President Clinton vetoed the tax bill in 1995 that included marriage penalty relief, last year's tax bill was vetoed as well. 
   In an effort to address this issue outside a broader tax package, the House of Representatives passed legislation earlier this year--by a bipartisan vote of 268 to 158--that would reduce the marriage penalty. The Senate considered its version of the legislation in April, but a Democratic filibuster prevented us from bringing the bill to a final vote. Today, we are considering nearly identical legislation yet again, but--thanks to the budget reconciliation process--we are assured it will come to a final vote. 
   Mr. President, H.R. 4810 would dramatically reduce the marriage penalty by doubling the standard deduction for married couples relative to single filers; expanding the 15 percent and 28 percent income tax brackets for married couples to twice the size of the corresponding tax brackets for single filers; increasing the phase-out range of the Earned Income Credit for couples filing joint returns; and permanently exempting family tax credits from the individual Alternative Minimum Tax. 
   I am especially pleased that the legislation does not penalize families in which a spouse foregoes an income to raise children. Unfortunately, the proposal that is being espoused by the minority would do just that. 
   Specifically, by allowing married couples to file their taxes as if they were single, the substitute proposal would provide relief only to families in which both spouses have taxable incomes. As a result, if a spouse has no earned income by virtue of the fact that he or she is working at home to raise the family's children--but doesn't actually earn a salary for each of the myriad of tasks this profession entails--the couple would receive none of the benefits of the larger tax brackets or standard deduction that a single taxpayer currently receives because only one-half of the couple has an income to report. 
   I believe a spouse's decision to work outside the home and utilize daycare, or work at home to raise children, should be made with only the best interests of the family in mind--not the tax code. We should not take a significant step to eliminate the marriage penalty only to replace it with a ``homemaker penalty''--and I'm pleased that H.R. 4810 ensures that the benefits it provides can be used by all couples, including those in which a spouse foregoes an income to raise a family. 
   It is my hope that, by considering this package of marriage penalty relief proposals as a stand-alone bill--and not as part of a broader, and potentially controversial, tax cut package--we will not only pass this legislation with strong bipartisan support, but ultimately send a bill to the President that he will sign for the benefit of all married couples. 
   The bottom line is that we should not condone or accept a tax code that penalizes married couples or discourages marriage, and this bill provides the Senate with the opportunity to correct this inequity in a straightforward manner. 
   Ultimately, the bill we are considering is not simply about providing the American people with a reasonable and rational tax cut--rather, it is about correcting a gross discrepancy in the tax code that unfairly impacts married couples. Accordingly, even though individual members of this body disagree on a wide variety of tax cuts policies, I would hope we would all agree that the act of marriage should not be penalized by the Internal Revenue Code--and would support S. 4810 accordingly.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this resolution is introduced to honor veterans exposed to radiation while serving in the U.S. military. 
   As many of my colleagues are no doubt aware, many veterans, veterans organizations, and scientists believe that exposure to environmental toxins or unknown diseases during military service has left thousands of veterans vulnerable to an array of disabilities and medical conditions. Over the years, Congress has responded to the concerns of veterans with claims resulting from service in nuclear testing areas, as well as Vietnam veterans suffering from exposure to Agent Orange, and Persian  Gulf veterans suffering with the Persian Gulf War Illness. Authority for the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide health care for diseases possibly linked to radiation has been made permanent. 
   The Department of Veterans Affairs is authorized by Congress to provide special priority for enrollment for health services to any veteran exposed to ionizing radiation while participating in the nuclear weapons testing program, or if he or she served with the U.S. occupation forces in Hiroshima or Nagasaki. These veterans are eligible to participate in the VA ionizing radiation registry examination program, under which the VA will perform a complete physical examination, including all necessary tests, for each veteran who requests it. The VA also pays compensation to veterans and their survivors if the veteran is determined to have a disability due to radiation exposure while in service. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, with some disorders, evidence of a service-connection is simply not conclusive. That is why Congress has in some cases permitted a ``presumption'' of a service-connection, so that veterans can be provided much-needed care, and given appropriate compensation, while science endeavors to verify whether a correlation can be established between military service and the subsequent development of a given medical disorder. 
   Authority for the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide medical treatment for diseases possibly linked to radiation has been made permanent by Congress. In 1987, Congress found that due to the fact that the evidence of exposure-level risk could not be conclusively verified, our national veterans benefits policy should depend on correlation of various diseases with radiation exposure. Public Law 100-321 included language establishing a presumption that 13 diseases would be presumed to be service-connected if they developed in veterans whose service histories included active duty in a ``radiation-risk activity.'' Since 1987, the list established under Public Law 100-321 has been expanded to include additional diseases, totalling approximately 16. 
   Mr. President, the resolution I am introducing today would recognize the contributions, sacrifices, and distinguished service of Americans exposed to radiation or radioactive materials in the line of military duty and authorize a day of remembrance for these men and women. 
   From 1945 to 1963, the U.S. exploded approximately 235 nuclear devices, potentially exposing an estimated 220,000 military personnel to unknown levels of radiation. In addition, roughly 195,000 servicemembers have been identified as participants in the post-WWII occupation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. Many of these veterans claimed that low levels of radiation released during the testing, or exposure to radiation in service in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, may be a cause of certain medical conditions that have developed since that service. 
   Under my resolution, Sunday July 16, 2000, the 55th anniversary of the first atomic explosion--the Trinity Shot in New Mexico--is designated as a ``National Day of Remembrance'' honoring veterans exposed to radiation in the line of military duty, and the President is urged to issue a proclamation observing the day and paying tribute to these Americans who have had to fight so hard to get the recognition and benefits they deserve. The measure also expresses the sense of the Senate that the Department of Veterans Affairs should take steps to ensure that veterans exposed to radiation in service to their country are awarded the benefits and services they deserve. 
   Mr. President, the nation has a solemn responsibility to veterans who are injured, or who incur a disease, while serving in the military, including the provision of health care, cash payments, and other benefits that may be awarded to veterans who experience disabilities resulting from military service. This precedent is well-established and should not be undercut or weakened. 
   I hope that my colleagues will join me in a strong show of support for this resolution and the men and women exposed to radiation in the line of duty. 
   Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator COLLINS in offering this amendment to the Interior Appropriations bill to make available $5 million in emergency supplemental funding for the restoration of Atlantic salmon. This is an issue that is critically important to the State of Maine. In 1997, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service (the Services) enthusiastically endorsed the Maine Atlantic Salmon Conservation Plan as the best possible approach to restoring these fish to Maine rivers. Unfortunately, this five-year plan was essentially shut down less than halfway into its implementation when the Services re-initiated a proposed listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) on November 17, 1999. 
   This short-sighted action has placed in jeopardy an innovative and cooperative restoration strategy involving habitat restoration, water quality improvement, and widespread restocking programs statewide. The Services have yet to demonstrate what additional benefits will be afforded the salmon through such a designation despite my repeated requests for such information. 
   We in Maine have worked hard and made many sacrifices to restore our treasured Atlantic salmon. I continue to believe that a fully implemented Maine Plan remains the best means of restoring these fish and there is no benefit in cutting short such a promising effort. 
   Unfortunately, the Services have entered into an agreement with litigants that requires them to make their final listing determination by November 17, 2000. This action precludes the possibility of seeking a six month extension, as allowed under the ESA, to resolve any questions of scientific uncertainty. Many such questions have been raised. Questions range from whether or not these fish actually constitute a genetically distinct population segment as defined by the ESA to whether the Services' river specific hatchery stocking program has produced any benefits and is an appropriate restoration strategy. I have asked the National Academy of Sciences to thoroughly review the quality of the science that forms the basis of this proposed listing. This information will guide future restoration efforts in Maine. The funding under consideration today will make such a review possible. 
   Additionally, the Services have not undertaken a quantitative risk assessment to ascertain the relative importance of various factors which may influence salmon survival. Without such a risk assessment, we have no way of knowing if the Services are focusing on the right problems or potential problems and there is no clear way for the Services to evaluate what more needs to be done. In essence, the Services have no way of knowing if they are asking the impossible of the State. The State of Maine has been asking for such an assessment for over one year. Since the beginning, the Maine Plan has been incredibly dynamic and has evolved to address new problems or concerns. In fact, the State has addressed in some form every concern raised by the Services. This risk assessment will provide the necessary guidance to again strengthen salmon restoration efforts and target limited resources most effectively. 
   This risk assessment is but one example of the critical activities that need to take place prior to November 17th if the Services are to make an informed decision as to whether or not to list. The State of Maine is poised to take further action, such as upgrading weirs at the river mouths, conducing genetic analyses, and testing fish marking techniques, that might render a listing unnecessary. Unfortunately, despite the tripling of the State budget for salmon restoration, there is not sufficient funding available to complete these critical activities. If the State is able to complete these priority items prior to the November 17th deadline, we may be able to render a listing unnecessary. I would hope that the Services will adhere to the letter and spirit of the Endangered Species Act and fully consider the restoration activities paid for by these funds when making their final determination whether or not to list. 
   I would like to thank Senators GORTON, BYRD, and STEVENS for all of their assistance in making sure that this money is made available to Maine. I know that they share my concerns regarding the importance of the recovery of U.S. salmon populations, particularly Senators GORTON and STEVENS who have been working hard with people in their home states to restore populations of Pacific salmon. The funding we are seeking today was originally included in the Agriculture Appropriations bill. I am pleased that the managers acknowledge how time sensitive this issue is and are receptive to including it on this bill which is moving more rapidly. I can assure you that this money will make a tremendous difference in our efforts to restore Atlantic salmon in Maine. Thank you.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has confirmed George Singal, the President's nominee for a seat on the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine, and rise to express my strong unequivocal support for his nomination. 
   In advance, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, for proceeding so expeditiously on Mr. Singal's nomination--especially when considering his nomination was transmitted to the Senate just six weeks ago. In addition, I would like to thank the Majority Leader for bringing his nomination to the floor so rapidly--just three days after being reported by the Judiciary Committee. 
   George Singal immigrated along with his family to the United States at a very young age, and has become a living embodiment of the American dream. He possesses a superior legal mind, has distinguished himself within the legal profession, and is deeply committed to upholding the very highest standards of our nation's judicial system. 
   Moreover, Mr. Singal has a wide range of experience serving as both a prosecutor and as a defense attorney--a deep understanding and appreciation for the constitutionally mandated roles of the three branches of government--and the enormous respect of his colleagues, a number of whom have contacted me in support of his nomination. Finally, and just as telling, he enjoys bipartisan support across the State of Maine. 
   Consider what George's background says about his character and qualifications. Born in a refugee camp in Italy after his family fled before the German invasion of his native Poland, he arrived in Bangor along with his sister and widowed mother in 1949. 
   After graduating summa cum laude from my alma mater, the University of Maine in 1967, and becoming only the second recipient of the highly respected Root-Tilden Scholarship in the history of the university, George briefly left our state to receive his law degree from Harvard University three years later. 
   Indeed, not one to forget his roots, George immediately returned to Maine to begin his legal career in Bangor, serving as the Assistant County Attorney for Penobscot County from 1971 to 1973, even as he worked his way to a partnership in the respected law firm of Gross, Minsky, Mogul, & Singal--the firm in which he has remained to this day.  
   Having served on a wide variety of professional committees--including the advisory committee for the District of Maine that was assembled pursuant to the Civil Justice Reform Act--George's impeccable credentials and reputation for impartiality led to his appointment in 1993 to the Governor's Judicial Selection Committee by my husband, Governor McKernan. 
   That appointment, and the fact that he now chairs this prestigious committee that assists in the appointment of judges across the state under Independent Governor Angus King, is why it's a special pleasure for me to speak on his behalf today. 
   Of note, the enthusiastic support George has received from both sides of the aisle in Maine speaks volumes about Mr. Singal's talents and work ethic, as well as the universal respect he has earned over his years of work in the Maine judicial system. 
   Throughout his career, Mr. Singal displayed remarkable legal acumen, thanks in large part to his thorough, reflective and balanced approach to his work. This approach has justifiably earned him accolades throughout his career, including his selection to the American College of Trial Lawyers--an award given to less than one percent of trial lawyers nationwide--and his naming to the Best Lawyers in America, a designation that is made by his colleagues in the legal profession. 
   Mr. Singal possesses precisely the kind of judicial temperament and experience I think we should expect from all our judicial nominees. I am certain this is due, in no small part, to his family's background and the perseverance and work ethic they instilled in him as an immigrant brought to the United States by the ravages of World War II. 
   Further, his work during the late-1960s in the office of then-Congressman Bill Hathaway undoubtedly impressed upon him the need for balance between the three branches of government. In fact, it is his broad range of experiences that has undoubtedly instilled in Mr. Singal a proper perspective on the appropriate role and appropriate constitutional limitations of each branch of our government. 
   Clearly, George Singal has not only the professional qualifications to serve us well on the federal circuit, but also the personal credentials to match. 
   My work with George over the past few weeks has only confirmed what I had already heard--this is a man of the highest integrity and personal character. 
   In conclusion, I am most proud to be able to express my support for Mr. George Singal. He has the qualifications, the intellect, the experience, the perspective, and the integrity to be an outstanding judge. Accordingly, I am pleased that my colleagues support his confirmation to the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the legislation sent to us by the House concerning disclosure for so-called ``Section 527 organizations''. 
   I want to thank the efforts of those involved in making this day a reality, and that includes a bipartisan group from both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Hill who have taken a leadership role in working toward restoring Americans' faith in its election system. Senator MCCAIN's herculean efforts and leadership on this issue have made today's vote possible. In addition, Senator FEINGOLD's leadership has been invaluable, and Senators LIEBERMAN and JEFFORDS and Congressmen SHAYS, MEEHAN, and CASTLE, have worked very hard to ensure that this legislation was both considered and passed. 
   I believe that disclosure of campaign activities is the most fundamental component of campaign finance reform. On the one hand, proponents of measures like the McCain-Feingold bill point to greater disclosure as part and parcel of additional reforms. On the other hand, opponents have argued that, rather than more comprehensive reforms, what we really need is simply more disclosure on what we already have. So disclosure should be common ground where we can all come together, a point proved by the overwhelming support for disclosure of 527 organizations in the House on a vote of 385-39. 
   As we know, these organizations have incorporated under the 527 section of the tax code to get tax exempt status to influence federal elections, but then they argue to the Federal Elections Commission that for their purposes these organizations aren't influencing federal elections, simply because they don't expressly advocate for the election or defeat of a particular candidate. 
   Right now, they don't have to disclose any of their activity--who they are, where they get their funding, and where they spend their money. Under this legislation, they will have to disclose on all their activities, and because political activities are all they do, that is as it should be. 
   It has also been expressed that if we are to target 527's, we should also have increased disclosure for other organizations that engage in political activities. And I couldn't agree more. Because the American people ought to know who these groups are, their major sources of funding, and where they are spending their money if they are working to influence a federal election. It's that simple. 
   Prior to this vote on 527's, we were working on legislation that would do just that--a bipartisan, bicameral measure that would satisfy the concerns that have also been raised about the scope of disclosure--that it not be so broad as to cover all manner of activities that have nothing to do with elections. 
   So we crafted a bill that was neither overly broad or vague. We narrowly and clearly defined political activities as those that mention a candidate for office, targeted specifically to the candidate's electorate, within a time frame near an election. And we only targeted large-scale communications so grassroots organizations will not be affected. 
   Our framework for this expanded disclosure drew from an amendment that Senator JEFFORDS and I, along with Senators MCCAIN, FEINGOLD, LIEBERMAN, and others, developed and introduced in early 1998. Based on a proposal developed and advanced by constitutional scholars, our measure was designed to withstand constitutional scrutiny, address some of the most egregious campaign abuses, and focus on areas where we know the Supreme Court has already allowed us to go--like disclosure. 
   We've already been to the Senate floor twice with this language, and I'm proud to say that the constitutional arguments made against our provision quite simply didn't hold water. And a majority of the Senate went on record in support of our provision. 
   In short, the three major provisions of the bill we were working on could be summed up as follows--disclosure, disclosure, and, finally, disclosure. That's what we're talking about here--sunlight, not censorship. Not speech rationing, but information. 
   I cannot emphasize enough that our effort would not have prevented anyone from making any kind of communication at any time saying anything they want. All we said is, if you're attempting to influence a federal election, we ought to know who you are, your major sources of funding, and where you're spending your money. 
   As the Brennan Center for Justice stated to me in a letter I had included in 
   the RECORD in our first debate on Snowe-Jeffords, and I quote, ``As the Supreme Court has observed, disclosure rules do not restrict speech significantly. For that reason, the Supreme Court has made clear that rules requiring disclosure are subject to less exacting constitutional strictures than direct prohibitions on spending.'' So if the Congress is truly serious about increased disclosure, there is no reason  why they should be able to support our approach. 
   The fact is, we all have to disclose as candidates, and we should. Is it unreasonable when we know groups running ads or sending out mass mailings to the public are influencing federal elections to ask them to disclose as well? 
   We know, for instance, that in the 1995-1996 election cycle, the Annenberg Public Policy Center estimates that between $135 to $150 million was spent by outside groups not associated with candidates on television ads. In the last cycle, that number jumped to between $275 to $350 million--more than double. But what we don't know is how much is being spent on efforts like mass mailings or phone banks, or who is funding them, and this legislation is designed to tell us. 
   As for those so-called issue ads, if any doubt remains about the real intent of many of the broadcast ads we see, the Brennan Center recently released a report on television advertising in the 1998 congressional elections. What did they find? When all the ads were evaluated in terms of how many within two months of the general election were actually political ads and how many were simply discussing issues or legislation, 82 percent were seen as campaign ads. Eighty-two percent. There's no question what these ads are attempting to do--yet, under current law, they fly right under the radar screen. 
   So, in short, our bipartisan approach got at the largest abuses while answering the critics who say that what's good for the 527 organizations are good for other groups and unions and corporations as well. Unfortunately, we did not reach agreement with the House on such an approach this year--but our work generated momentum for consideration and passage of this 527 bill. And we must look at this as a significant first step. Hopefully, we will have the opportunity to build on this legislation with the broader approach of Snowe-Jeffords. 
   The passage of this bill should also make it that much more difficult for those who supported it to now go back and say we shouldn't have greater disclosure for other groups engaging in political activities when Snowe-Jeffords is introduced next year. In other words, what we have done with this legislation is to throw a boulder in what has until this point been the still and brackish pond of the campaign finance status quo, and the ripple effect will continue expanding ever outward. 
   Again, I want to thank everyone involved in this great victory and I hope we will move forward to expand our efforts on campaign finance reform in the next Congress.

   Mrs. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the amendment being offered by Senators JEFFORDS and FRIST on genetic nondiscrimination in health insurance. This amendment, based on language I authored with Senator JEFFORDS and Senator FRIST, provides strong protection to all Americans against the unfair and improper use of genetic information for insurance purposes.  
   This amendment will: 
   Prohibit insurers from collecting genetic information 
   Prohibit insurers from using predictive genetic information, such as family background or the results of a genetic test, to deny coverage or to set premiums and rates, and 
   Require insurers to inform patients of their health plan's confidentiality practices and safeguards.  
   The need for this legislation is clear. As Senators DASCHLE and DODD pointed out this morning the announcement this week that scientists have completed their mapping of the human gene is a remarkable and historic event. It opens the door to new scientific breakthroughs that may well help lead us one day to the cause and the cure for cancer, for Parkinson's and for Alzheimer's disease. 
   This remarkable new tool has the potential, unfortunately, to become a dangerous tool. Because knowledge is power--Mr. President--and an insurance company could use genetic information to deny insurance to an individual because they know that the person is predisposed to a particular disease or health problem. 
   Consider a letter that I received from a constituent, Bonnie Lee Tucker, of Hampden, Maine, who wrote:  
   I'm a third generation [breast cancer] survivor and as of last October I have nine immediate women in my family that have been diagnosed with breast cancer ..... I want my daughter to be able to live a normal life and not worry about breast cancer. I want to have the BRCA test [for breast cancer] done but because of the insurance risk for my daughters future I don't dare.  
   Another of my constituents, Dr. Tracy Weisberg, Medical Director of the Breast Cancer at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute, told me that while she has offered screening for the breast cancer gene to approximately 35 women in 1997, only two opted for the test. She said that many of these women did not undergo testing because of their fear of discrimination in health insurance. 
   Dr. Weisberg emphasized the need for legislation to protect patients from this type of discrimination, so that they could make genetic testing decisions based on what they believe is best for their health, and not based on fear. 
   As a legislator who has worked for many years on the issue of breast cancer, and as a woman with a history of breast cancer in her family, I am delighted with the possibilities for further treatment advances based on the discoveries of two genes related to breast cancer--BRCA 1 and BRCA2. Women who inherit mutated forms of either gene have an 85 percent risk of developing breast cancer in their lifetime, and a 50 percent risk of developing ovarian cancer. 
   Although there is no known treatment to ensure that women who carry the mutated gene do not develop breast cancer, genetic testing makes it possible for carriers of these mutated genes to take extra precautions--such as mammograms and self-examinations--in order to detect cancer at its earliest states. This discovery is truly a momentous breakthrough. 
   But the tremendous promise of genetic testing is being significantly threatened by insurance companies that use the results of genetic testing to deny or limit coverage to consumers. Unfortunately, this practice is not uncommon. In fact, one survey of individuals with a known genetic condition in their family revealed that 22 percent had been denied health insurance coverage because of genetic information. 
   And consider that people may be unwilling to participate in potentially ground-breaking research trials because they do not want to reveal information about their genetic status. At NIH, 32 percent of women eligible for genetic testing for the breast cancer gene declined to undergo testing--the majority of those who declined cited privacy issues and a fear of discrimination as their reason. 
   Mr. President, this is simply unacceptable. The Jeffords, Frist, Snowe amendment before us today will go a long way toward putting a halt to the unfair practice of discriminating on the basis of genetic information, and to ensure that safeguards are in place to protect the privacy of genetic information. Now it's up to us to act by passing this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to join me in doing just that.

   Ms. SNOWE. I rise today to introduce a bill that will reauthorize the most important Federal fisheries management law, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. In 1996, Congress last reauthorized this law through enactment of the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA). The SFA contained the most substantial improvements to fisheries conservation since the original passage of the Magnuson Act in 1976. 
   The SFA made wholesale changes in fisheries management. For the first time, it required the regional fishery management councils and the Secretary of Commerce to prevent and end overfishing, reduce bycatch, protect essential fish habitat, and consider fishing communities in the regulatory decision-making process. These provisions of the SFA have presented a great challenge to the National Marine Fisheries Service the regional councils, and the fishermen who are regulated under this law. While the goals and intent of the SFA were certainly laudable, four years later, we still have a significant amount of work to do in that regard. 
   Therefore, today, Mr. President, I introduce the Magnuson-Stevens Reauthorization Act of 2000 with several very specific goals in mind. First and foremost, this bill provides for a major increase in funding. While the demands on fisheries managers at the local and federal levels have increased exponentially, funding has essentially remained level. One of the most serious problems in fisheries management is a lack of basic information on the resource. This bill, through increased funding and the establishment of two programs, will go a long way toward filling existing critical gaps in our information databases. For the past several years, Senators KERRY, GREGG, and I have worked to establish a cooperative research program in New England fisheries. This program, which requires federal and local scientists to partner with commercial fishermen in the gathering and development of fisheries data, has proven quite successful. Therefore, this bill would establish a National Cooperative Research and Management program to be administered by the agency in conjunction with the regional councils and local fishermen. In addition, the bill also establishes a National Cooperative Enforcement program. This too is based on existing programs in several states, where state marine law enforcement officers are deputized by their federal counterparts to help enforce conservation and management provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and other marine related laws. Lack of enforcement of fisheries laws has been a constant problem for fishermen and fisheries managers. 
   This bill also addresses one of the most serious and emotional questions in fisheries management--individual fishing quotas (IFQs). The SFA included a five year moratorium on new IFQ programs and required the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to study the issue. The NAS report issued a series of recommendations on IFQs. The first recommendation was for Congress to lift the existing moratorium on new IFQ programs and authorize the councils to design and implement new IFQs. The moratorium is set to expire on October 1, 2000. 
   This recommendation has received a lot of publicity. However, the NAS report contained a number of other recommendations to Congress that were to be considered in 
   conjunction with the authorization of any new IFQ programs. These recommendations concern substantive issues, yet they have not received the level of attention that they fully deserve. For instance, the NAS recommended that Congress should encourage cost recovery and extraction of profits from new IFQ programs through fees, annual taxes, and zero-revenue auctions. The NAS also recommended that the Act be amended to allow the public to capture windfall gains generated from the initial allocation of IFQs. Additional recommendations include requiring accumulation limits and determining rules for foreign ownership. 
   Mr. President, the NAS report contains important recommendations that should be thoroughly examined by Congress and the public. I understand that in some regions of the country, both commercial and recreational fishermen want to immediately move to the design and implementation of new IFQ programs. However, it is clear that many of the important questions associated with any new IFQ program have not been fully considered and immediate implementation of such programs could have deleterious affects on fisheries and fishing communities. For that reason, the bill I introduce today contains a three year extension of the existing moratorium. 
   This provision simply recognizes that fisheries conservation and management must be approached from a long-term perspective. Widespread implementation of IFQ programs will drastically alter the face of fishing communities and the way we pursue fisheries conservation measures. If IFQs are indeed the answer that many of their advocates claim, then surely IFQs will still be a viable option in three years. But, a short-term extension of the moratorium, as this bill proposes, will force the Congress and fishing communities to consider the many other necessary questions related to IFQs. The NAS report recommended Congress provide guidance on these issues because they are clearly questions of national concern, and I suggest that we follow that course. 
   Mr. President, this bill provides a number of other improvements, including increased flexibility to the agency to reaffirm the original intent of Congress that there is no ``one-size-fits-all'' solution to fisheries management. Moreover, the bill would provide for an expanded national observer program to help collect critical information. It is widely recognized that we need to increase our use of observers to gain data on species composition, age structure, and bycatch. The bill also establishes a pilot program to help fisheries managers begin the move toward ecosystem-based management. While it is clear that we do not currently have sufficient information of resources to make a full shift to ecosystem-based management, it is equally clear that we need to move in this direction and a pilot program can illustrate for us how to do this. 
   Finally, I would like to say that this bill represents a significant amount of work by the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries. Over the past year, the Subcommittee held six hearings in various parts of the country on the Magnuson Stevens Act. We begin the process in Washington, DC, and then visited fishing communities in New England, The Gulf of Mexico, the North Pacific and the Pacific. In this bill, I have tried to incorporate many of the suggestions we heard from those men and women who fish for a living and who  are most affected by the law and its regulations. I view this bill as a basis from which I intend to work with other members of the Subcommittee so that the Commerce Committee can consider it in executive session in July. I look forward to providing our fishing communities with a bill that will improve lives in a meaningful way.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering S. 2327, the Oceans Act of 2000. I am pleased to support this bill, which will have a major influence on the direction of U.S. ocean policy, management, and research for many years to come. 
   In 1966, Congress established the Stratton Commission through the enactment of the Marine Resources and Engineering Development Act. The Stratton Commission provided a comprehensive evaluation of the role of the ocean to the United States and provided a series of recommendations regarding ocean and coastal policy for the future. 
   After over 30 months of meetings, hearings, and correspondence, the Commission produced the 1969 report, ``Our Nation and the Sea''. The document made a significant impact on coastal and ocean policy, leading to the creation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 1970 and the National Coastal Zone Management Program in 1972. 
   Now, over thirty years after publication of the original Stratton Commission report, it is time to reexamine current U.S. programs and legislation that affect the oceans, Great Lakes, and coastal zones. Our coastal regions and ocean resources are under increasing pressures. In the United States, more than 53 percent of the population is living in coastal regions that comprise only 17 percent of the contiguous U.S. land area. Additionally, the coastal population is increasing by 3,600 people per day, with a projected coastal increase of 27 million people by the year 2015. 
   The increasing pressures on the coast are being mirrored in the oceans. Valuable commercial activities such as shipping and maritime transportation, oil and gas production, and fishing impact the oceans and Great Lakes. Additionally, environmental stresses, such as pollution and increased water temperatures potentially due to global climate change, are exacerbating existing problems. 
   The Oceans Act of 2000 will create a Commission on Ocean Policy to examine a variety of ocean and Great Lakes issues. Protection of the marine environment, prevention of marine pollution, enhancement of maritime commerce and transportation, response to natural hazards, and preservation of the United States' role as a leader in ocean and coastal activities will all be reviewed. The Commission will be composed of 16 members that represent state and local governments, ocean-related industries, academic and technical institutions, and relevant public interest organizations. The members will be nominated by Congress and appointed by the President. 
   The Commission will be responsible for submitting a report to Congress and the President, within 18 months, containing their recommendations. These recommendations will focus on the development of a comprehensive, cost-effective policy to address pressing ocean and coastal issues. It will provide important guidance to policy makers on how to shape the future direction of ocean policy for the United States. 
   Mr. President, I would like to recognize Senator HOLLINGS, the author of the bill, for his work creating the original Stratton Commission and for his leadership on this issue. In addition, Senator STEVENS and Senator INOUYE, both original cosponsors of the legislation, were involved with the work of the Stratton Commission, and I look forward to working with them and the other members of the Commerce Committee on the Oceans Act of 2000. Finally, I would like to thank Senator MCCAIN, the Chairman of the Committee and Senator KERRY, the ranking member of the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee for their support of this measure.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1651, the Fishermen's Protective Act Amendments of 1999. This bill makes a number of conservation and management improvements to several important fisheries laws. First, it amends the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 to extend current law from  fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2003 so that reimbursement may be provided to owners of U.S. fishing vessels illegally detained or seized by foreign countries. In 1998, there were not any claims filed under this law, but in 1996 and 1997, U.S. vessel owners were reimbursed over $290,000 based on 261 claims for illegal transit fees charged by Canada. Because this provision of the law has expired, the bill will ensure that U.S. vessels who are illegally seized or fined are able to seek reimbursement. 
   Second, the bill establishes a panel to advise the Secretaries of State and Interior on Yukon River Salmon management issues in Alaska. In 1985, the United States and Canada signed the Pacific Salmon Treaty. This treaty established a framework with which to bilaterally manage their shared salmon stocks. Ten years later, the countries signed an interim agreement regarding management of the stock of salmon in the Yukon River. The United States implemented the agreement on Yukon River salmon through the Fisheries Act of 1995, creating a Yukon River salmon panel and advisory committee. 
   When the interim agreement expired in 1998, it was unclear whether the advisory panel was still authorized to recommend salmon restoration measures. This bill codifies the Yukon River Salmon Panel, established under the 1995 interim agreement, to advise the Secretary of State on Yukon River Salmon management, advise the Secretary of Interior on enhancement and restoration of the salmon stocks, and perform other activities that relate to the conservation and management of Yukon River salmon stocks. H.R. 1651, as amended, also authorizes $4 million a year for each of fiscal years 2000 through 2003. Up to $3 million of these funds can be used by the Departments of Commerce and Interior for survey, restoration, and enhancement projects related to Yukon River salmon. In addition, the reported bill authorizes $600,000 for cooperative salmon research and management projects in the United States portion of the Yukon River drainage area that have been recommended by the Panel. 
   Third, the bill, as amended by the Commerce Committee, authorizes $60 million for each of the fiscal years 2002 and 2003 for the Secretary of Commerce to acquire two fishery research vessels. These vessels are one of the most important fishery management tools available to federal scientists. Because they conduct the vast majority of fishery stock assessments, their reliability is critical to fishery management. Species 
   abundance, recruitment, age class composition, and responses to ecological change and fishing pressure can all be studied with these research platforms. The information obtained using them is critical for the improvement of the regulations governing fisheries management. 
   In New England, there is only one NOAA research vessel--the Albatross IV. This vessel is 38 years old, at the end of its useful life, and practically obsolete. Despite this, the vessel continues to collect the survey data that is used for management decisions regarding valuable Northeast fisheries stocks, including cod, haddock and herring. A replacement vessel is crucial to maintaining the existing ability to collect the long term fisheries, oceanographic, and biological data necessary to improve fishery management decisions. According to the Commerce Department, the deterioration of the Albatross IV has created an urgent need for a replacement vessel in the Northeast. 
   Finally, the bill also addresses the use of spotter aircraft in the New England-based Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABT) fishery. Mr. President, in 1998, the Highly Migratory Species Advisory Panel, established under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, unanimously requested and advised the Secretary of Commerce to prohibit the use of spotter aircraft in the General and Harpoon categories of the ABT fishery. The use of these planes can accelerate the catch rates and closures in the General and Harpoon categories. In turn, the accelerated catch rates can have an adverse impact on the scientific and conservation objectives of the highly migratory species fishery management plan and the communities that depend on the fishery. Moreover, the use of such aircraft has resulted in an unsafe and often hostile environment in the ABT fishery. 
   Over two years ago, NMFS issued a proposed rule to adopt the Advisory Panel recommendation. Unfortunately, NMFS has delayed the rule time and again, and ultimately failed to finalize it. Consequently, it has become necessary to take legislative action on the issue. This bill adopts the Commerce Secretary's Advisory Panel recommendation and prohibits the use of spotter aircraft in the General and Harpoon categories of the Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery. 
   I thank Senator KERRY, the ranking member of the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee for his hard work and support, especially with regard to the provisions related to the NOAA fishery research vessels and the Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery. Both of these provisions are quite important in New England. I would also like to express my appreciation to Senator MCCAIN, the Chairman of the Commerce Committee and Senator HOLLINGS, the ranking member of the Committee for their bipartisan support of this measure. I urge the Senate to pass H.R. 1651, as amended.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for, once again, assuming the leadership on this most important issue. 
   I rise today as a cosponsor of the Murray amendment to repeal the ban on privately-funded abortions at overseas military hospitals. 
   Last year, when I spoke on this amendment, I said that ``standing here I have the feeling of `Deja vu all over again.' '' I have that same sentiment today--and this year I can add that ``the more things change, the more they remain the same.'' For in the last year we have deployed more women overseas--6,000 more women than there were just a year ago. 
   And yet here we are, once again, having to argue a case that basically boils down to providing women who are serving their country overseas with the full range of constitutional rights, options, and choices that would be afforded them as American citizens on American soil. 
   In 1973, 27 years ago, the Supreme Court affirmed for the first time women's right to choose. This landmark decision was carefully crafted to be both balanced and responsible while holding the rights of women in America paramount in reproductive decisions. But this same right is not afforded to female members of our armed services or to female dependents who happen to be stationed overseas. 
   Current law prohibits abortions to be performed in domestic or international military treatment facilities except in cases of rape, incest, or if the life of the pregnant woman is endangered. The Department of Defense will only pay for the abortion when the life of the pregnant woman is endangered--in cases of rape or incest, the woman must pay for her own abortion. In no other instance is a woman permitted to have an abortion in a military facility. 
   The Murray-Snowe amendment would overturn the ban on privately funded abortions in overseas military treatment facilities and ensure that women and military dependents stationed overseas would have access to safe health care. Overturning this ban on privately-funded abortions will not result in federal funds being used to perform abortion at military hospitals. 
   The fact is that Federal law already states that Federal funding cannot be used to perform abortions. Federal law has banned the use of Federal funds for this purpose since 1979. But to say that our service women and the wives and daughters of our servicemen cannot use their own money to obtain an abortion at a military hospital overseas defies logic. 
   Every year opponents of the Murray-Snowe amendment argue that changing current law means that military personnel and military facilities will be  charged with performing abortions--and that this, in turn, means that American taxpayer funds will be used to subsidize abortion. This seemingly logical segue is absolutely and fundamentally incorrect. 
   Every hospital that performs a surgery--every physician that performs a procedure upon a patient--must figure out the cost of that procedure. This includes not only the time involved, but the materials, the overhead, the liability insurance. This is the fundamental and basic principle of covering one's costs. 
   I have faith that the Department of Defense will not do otherwise. This is the idea behind a privately-funded abortion--a woman's private funds, her own money pays for the procedure. But she has the opportunity to have this medical procedure--a medical procedure that is constitutionally guaranteed--in an American facility, performed by an American physician, and tended to by American nurses. 
   During last year's debate, opponents of repealing the current ban claimed that American taxpayers would be subsidizing the purchase of equipment for abortions, and would be training doctors to perform privately-funded abortions. This false argument effectively overlooks the fact that the Department of Defense has already invested in the equipment and training necessary because current law already provides access in cases of life of the mother, rape, or incest. 
   But the economic cost of this ban is not the only cost at issue here. What about the impact on a woman's health? A woman who is stationed overseas can be forced to delay the procedure for several weeks until she can travel to the United States or another overseas location in order to obtain the abortion. Every week that a woman delays an abortion increases the risk of the procedure. 
   The current law banning privately-funded abortions puts the health of these women at risk. They will be forced to seek out unsafe medical care in countries where the blood supply is not safe, where their procedures are antiquated, where their equipment may not be sterile. I do not believe it is right, on top of all the other sacrifices our military personnel are asked to make, to add unsafe medical care to the list. 
   I believe that a decision as fundamentally personal as whether or not to continue one's pregnancy only needs to be discussed between a woman, her family, and her physician. But yet, as current law stands, a woman who is facing the tragic decision of whether or not to have an abortion faces involving not just her family and her physician, but her--or her husband's--commanding officer, duty officer, miscellaneous transportation personnel, and any number of other persons who are totally and completely unrelated to her or her decision. Now she faces both the stress and grief of her decision--but she faces the judgment and willingness of many others who are totally and wholly unconnected to her personal and private situation. 
   Imagine having made the difficult decision to have an abortion and then being told that you have to return to the United States or go to a hospital that may or may not be clean and sanitary. That is the effect of current policy--if you have the money, if you leave your family, if you leave your support system, and come back here. Otherwise, your full range of choices consists of paying from your own money and taking your chances at some questionable hospital that may or may not be okay. 
   This of course, is only if the country you are stationed in has legal abortion. Otherwise you have no option. You have no access to your constitutionally protected right of abortion. 
   What is the freedom to choose? It is the freedom to make a decision without unnecessary government interference. Denying a woman the best available resources for her health care simply is not right. Current law does not provide a woman and her family the ability to make a choice. It gives the woman and her family no freedom of choice. It makes the choice for her. 
   In the year 2000, in the United States of America it is a fact that a woman's right to an abortion is the law of the land. The Supreme Court has spoken on that issue, and you can look it up. Denying women the right to a safe abortion because you disagree with the Supreme Court is wrong, but that is what current law does. 
   Military personnel stationed overseas still vote, still pay taxes, and are protected and punished under U.S. law. They protect the rights and ideals that this country stands for. Whether we agree with abortion or not, we all understand that safe and legal access to abortion is the law of the land. But the current ban on privately-funded abortions takes away the fundamental right of personal choice from American women stationed overseas. And I don't believe these women should be treated as second class citizens. 
   It never occurred to me that women's constitutional rights were territorial. It never occurred to me that when American women in our armed forces get their visas and passports stamped when they go abroad--that they are required to leave their fundamental, constitutional rights at the proverbial door. It never occurred to me that in order to find out what freedoms you have as an American, you had to check the time-zone you were in. 
   The United States willingly sends our service men and women into harms way--yet Congress takes it upon itself to deny 14 percent of our Armed Forces personnel--33,000 of whom are stationed overseas--the basic right to safe medical care. And we deny the basic right to safe medical care to more than 200,000 military dependents who are stationed overseas as well. 
   How can we do this to our service men and women and their families? It seems to me that they already sacrifice a great deal to serve their country without asking them to take unnecessary risks with their health as well. We should not ask our military personnel to leave their basic rights at the shoreline when we send them overseas. 
   I believe we owe our men and women in uniform and their families the option to receive the medical care they need in a safe environment. They do not deserve anything less. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Murray-Snowe amendment. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to support Senator KENNEDY's amendment to the fiscal year 2001 Department of Defense Authorization Act. This amendment, the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, is a new version of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, of which I am a cosponsor. 
   Mr. President, there is nothing so ugly as hate. It saddens me that at the brink of a new century, when our country is in a time of almost unprecedented prosperity--when more people than ever before are educated, when major medical breakthroughs seem to occur almost on a daily basis--that we are still faced with racism and prejudice in our society. 
   Current law permits Federal prosecution of a hate crime only if the crime was motivated by bias based on religion, national origin, or color, and the assailant intended to prevent the victim from exercising a ``federally protected right'' such as voting, jury duty, attending school, or conducting interstate commerce. These tandem requirements substantially limit the potential for federal prosecution of hate crimes. 
   Most crimes against victims based on their gender, disability, or sexual orientation are now only covered under State law, unless such crimes are committed within a Federal jurisdiction such as an assault on a Federal official, on an Indian reservation, or in a national park. While more than 40 States have hate crimes statutes in effect, only 22 States have hate crimes legislation that addresses gender, and only 21 States have hate crimes legislation that address sexual orientation or disability. 
   The amendment before us today would expand Federal jurisdiction and increase the Federal role in the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes. 
   Under this legislation, hate crimes that cause death or bodily injury because of prejudice can be investigated and prosecuted by the Federal Government, regardless of whether the victim was exercising a federally protected right. The bill defines a hate crime as a violent act causing death or bodily injury ``because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability, or sexual orientation of any person.'' 
   I believe that one of our country's greatest strengths is Congress's ability to balance strong State's rights against a Federal Government that unites these separate States. I also believe that the Federal Government has a duty to provide leadership on issues of great moral imperative, especially in the area of civil rights. 
   Hate crimes go beyond the standard criminal motivation. We are all familiar with the horrible stories of James Byrd, Jr., who was chained to a truck and dragged to his death because of his race, of Matthew Shepard, who was beaten and tied to a wooden fence and died in freezing temperatures because of his sexual orientation, and of the attack last August at a Jewish community center because of religion. 
   There is no doubt that crime is morally and legally wrong and there is no one in this chamber who could possible argue otherwise. And I understand the argument that opponents of the amendment have: How can the law punish a crime for more than what it actually and literally is? 
   But hate crimes are not just about the crime itself, they are about the motivation. And there is something especially pernicious about a crime that occurs because of who somebody is. There is something all the more horrific when a crime happens because of the victim's race, or color, or religion. Hate crimes are meant to send a message to a group: ``you had better be careful because you are not accepted here.'' 
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that in 1998--the latest data available--almost 8,000 crimes were motivated by hate or prejudice. Over half of these crimes were motivated by racial bias; nearly 20 percent of these crimes were because of religious bias; and 16 percent of these crimes were a result of sexual-orientation bias. Twenty-five of these crimes happened simply because the victim was disabled, and 754 because of the ethnicity or national origin of the victim. 
   The amendment before us today is not about creating a special class of crime. It is not about policing our ideas or beliefs; it is about the criminal action that some people take on the basis of these beliefs. We cannot make it a crime to hate someone. But we can make it a crime to attack because a person specifically hates who the victim is or what the victim represents. 
   One of my favorite sayings is ``As Maine goes ..... so goes the Nation.'' This adage proves true again with the Hate Crimes Prevention Act and with Senator KENNEDY's amendment. I am proud that the Hate Crimes Prevention  Act, and today's amendment, are largely based on Maine's 1992 Civil Rights Law, which was enacted while my husband, John R. McKernan, was Governor of the State. And I am proud that the Hate Crimes Prevention Act is supported by our current Attorney General, Andrew Ketterer. 
   Mr. President, our laws are a direct reflection of our priorities as a nation. And I, along with the vast majority of Americans I would venture to say, fundamentally believe that crimes of hate and prejudice should not be tolerated in our society. 
   That is why I support prosecuting hate crimes to the fullest possible extent. The amendment before us today will expand the ability of the Federal Government to prosecute these immoral and pernicious crimes. I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I seek recognition with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the senior Senator from Alaska to discuss a very important matter to our national security. Both the House and Senate versions of the FY2001 national Defense authorization bill contain provisions that supported the President's budget request and authorized $1.51 billion for Navy procurement of two LPD-17 amphibious ships in FY2001. 
   The LPD-17 program is a critical ship for the modernization of the Navy's amphibious force. It will carry more than 700 Marines and the equipment and means for them to get ashore and perform their mission--whether that mission is combat related, peacekeeping or in response to crisis throughout the world. It is a Commandant of the Marine Corps, before the Senate Armed Services Committee that ``there are no underutilized amphibious ships,'' and the testimony by Lieutenant General Rhodes before the Seapower Subcommittee where he stated that ``the operational flexibility and forward presence our Amphibious Ready Groups represent will be significantly enhanced with the FY03 delivery of the first of 12 LPD-17 amphibious ships.'' He further stated, ``these ships will overcome amphibious lift shortfalls.''

   Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for making that point. As I discussed during the debate last week on the fiscal year 2001 Defense Authorization bill, the Armed Services Committee is working hard to come to terms with the force levels necessary  to accomplish the many missions our Navy and Marine Corps are called on to accomplish. 
   The increase to war fighting capability that LPD-17 brings is critical to our naval force's future success. The LPD-17's ability to accommodate new equipment, such as the Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAAV), the Landing Craft Air Cushioned Vehicle (LCAC) and the vertical lift MV-22, and the remarkable communications, integrated computer technology and quality of life improvements are the qualities of the ship that the Marine Corps and Navy need to support the National Strategy and the Marine Corps' doctrine of Operational Maneuver From The Sea.

   Ms. SNOWE. As always I am impressed by the chairman's knowledge and his grasp of the issues. We have worked closely over the past few weeks to determine how the Navy and industry stand in regard to their progress with this new ship class, and I appreciate that we are in agreement as to the value and need 
   for this critical ship. I look forward to our continued work together in support of this program.

   Ms. SNOWE. I thank the President. 
   I want to begin my remarks by commending our Chairman, Senator JOHN WARNER, who has provided extraordinary leadership in crafting this measure which supports our men and women in uniform with funding for the pay, health care, and hardware that they need and deserve. I can think of no one with greater credibility on these issues or a wider breadth of knowledge, and I thank him for his outstanding efforts. 
   I also want to thank the distinguished ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator LEVIN, who also has made invaluable contributions to the development of this reauthorization. 
   This critical legislation which we are considering here today, with our distinguished chairman, and the bipartisan support of the ranking member, Senator LEVIN, the senior Senator from Michigan, represents the committee's response to legitimate concerns and recognizes the sacrifices of those who are at the heart of the legislation--the men and women who serve in our Nation's Armed Forces. 
   As a member of the Armed Services Committee and chair of the Seapower Subcommittee, I know we must never forget that the men and women in uniform are the ones who make our Nation's defense force the finest and strongest in the world, and I salute each of them for their unwavering service. 
   We are honor bound to ensure that they are provided the very best equipment, afforded the highest respect, and compensated at a level commensurate with their remarkable service to this Nation. And I believe this bill reflects those principles. 
   Since the end of the cold war we have reduced the overall military force structure by 36 percent and reduced the defense budget by 40 percent--a trend that this bill reverses. 
   And let me say that comes not a moment too soon. Because while the size of our armed services has decreased, the number of contingencies that our service members are called on to respond to has increased in a fashion that can only be described as dramatic. 
   In fact, the Navy/Marine Corps team alone responded to 58 contingency missions between 1980 and 1989, while between 1990 and 1999 they responded to 192--a remarkable threefold increase in operations. 
   During the cold war, the U.N. Security Council rarely approved the creation of peace operations. In fact, the U.N. implemented only 13 such operations between 1948 and 1978, and none from 1979 to 1987. By contrast, since 1988--just twelve years ago--38 peacekeeping operations have been established--nearly three times as many than the previous 40 years. 
   As a result of the challenges presented by having to do more with less, the Armed Services Committee has heard from our leaders in uniform on how our current military forces are being stretched too thin, and that estimates predicted in the fiscal year 1997 QDR underestimated how much the United States would be using our military. 
   I fully support this bill which authorizes $309.8 billion in budget authority, an amount which is consistent with the concurrent budget resolution. For the second year in a row--we recognize the shortfall and reverse a 14-year decline by authorizing a real increase in defense spending. This funding is $4.5 billion above the President's fiscal year 2001 request, and provides a necessary increase in defense spending that is vital if we are to meet the national security challenges of the 21st century.  
   This bill not only provides funds for better tools and equipment for our service men and women to do their jobs but it also enhances quality of life for themselves and their families. It approves a 3.7-percent pay raise for our military personnel as well as authorizing extensive improvements in military health care for active duty personnel, military retirees, and their families.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this article describes the current state of the U.S. Armed Forces and how they are overstretched. This means that the military is attempting to respond to too many demands with too few forces. And I quote ``Nowhere is the problem worse than for the Navy.'' 
   In the Seapower subcommittee's work this year in review of the fiscal year 2001 budget request we continued the Congress' review of the adequacy of Navy and Marine Corps force structure to carry out the National Security Strategy, which we all know has been signed by the President of the United States. 
   This included hearings, visits to fleet units, and discussions with the most junior personnel in the fleet to the highest flag officers and civilian leaders in the Navy and Marine Corps. 
   The subcommittee constructed a firm foundation for review of the fiscal year 2001 budget request by requesting operational commanders to testify on their ability to carry out the National Security Strategy. 
   The operational commanders confirmed what my colleagues and I had been hearing directly from fleet units which included discussions with individual sailors and marines representing  a cross section of all ranks. The operational commanders provided convincing evidence that their commands do not have a sufficient number of ships and airplanes to carry out the National Security Strategy to shape the international environment and respond to crisis within the required time frame. 
   They further testified that the Navy has reduced the force structure to the extent that the brunt of the burden of this inadequate force structure is being borne, in their words, by the men and women in their commands. 
   Simply put, in the words of the Sixth Fleet commander,  
   Nine years ago, we never anticipated the environment in which we find ourselves operating. The sense that it was going to be a much easier load, that we might actually be able to take our pack off every now and again prevailed. And it for the most part underpinned the decline in defense spending in my estimation. We were wrong. And the facts have borne that out with ever increasing consistency in those nine years that have occurred.  
   And I quote the Second Fleet commander.  
   ..... back in the euphoric days at the end of the Cold War as we were drawing down, we actually figured that we would have a window of opportunity here where we could afford to, in fact, decrease structure, turn some of that savings into a long-term recapitalization, maybe forego an upgrade or modernization here and there. And that just has not been the case.  
   In this article, Mr. Goure quotes Vice Admiral Charles Moore, commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet, he states ``I am uncertain how much longer they can continue to juggle forces to meet the varied regional requirements.'' 
   And he further quotes Vice Admiral Dennis McGinn, commander of the Third Fleet, ``that force structure throughout the Navy is such that an increased commitment anywhere necessitates reduction of operations somewhere else, or a quality of life impact due to increased operating tempo.'' 
   Again, those are the words of our commanders on the front lines charged with carrying out the day-to-day operations of our naval forces and to the challenges and requirements around the world. 
   It is noteworthy that these commanders state that the prediction of how much our naval forces could be reduced does not represent the reality of what is going on in the world. 
   I have two charts which I think explain graphically the numbers that are consistent with the commander's explanations and characterizations of the demands that have been placed on them as a result of a reduced force structure, while at the same time increasing the number of responses to contingency operations. Both charts use the same timeframe across the board. The charts track data in 4-year increments starting in 1980 and continuing through 1990. Each chart shows the 8 years before the cold war, 1980 through 1987, then the period between the end of the cold war and the beginning of the Quadrennial Defense Review in assessing exactly how many ships will be required to meet the security demands around the world. Here we have the ship force structure from 1980 to 1999. 
   I bring to my colleagues' attention the last 8 years charted in the graphs, the time period between 1992 to 1995, which is before the Quadrennial Defense Review; and then in 1996 to 1999, the post Quadrennial Defense Review in terms of the number of ships we have. We have the ship force structure on the top chart, and on the bottom chart we have the number of contingency operations during these same time periods. These last two data points in these graphs are significant because they show the large force structure reductions of over 200 ships while at the same time the contingencies more than triple, from 31 to 103. 
   The QDR, we know, developed the exact force structure that was necessary for both the Navy and the Marine Corps in this instance to respond to the number of requirements around the world and what they anticipated would be the number of operations around the world. The QDR has anticipated there would be a rise in contingency operations but not to the extent to which they have occurred. 
   The first chart shows the ship force structure, the dramatic decline in the number of ships, both in decommissioning and in the reduction, and the number of new constructions. At its peak during the cold war, we were up to 500, going towards a 600-ship Navy. We can see we had 500 ships in 1980 to 1983; up to 1988, we had 550 ships. We were building up to a 600-ship Navy. We declined to 417 ships at the end of the cold war and, prior to the development of the Quadrennial Defense Review, to a total of 316 ships. In those 8 short years where we declined from 500 ships to 316 ships, we had a dramatic increase in the number of contingency operations. 
   The second chart shows during the end of the cold war we had 31 contingency operations, when we had 550 ships. During 1992 and 1995, prior to the Quadrennial Defense Review in terms of assessing how many ships we would need, we had 68 contingency operations and 417 ships. In the post QDR, in 1996 to 1999, we had 103 contingency operations, tripling the number we had during the cold war. Yet we only had 316 ships during this period. 
   This is a dramatic increase in the number of contingency operations. While we had the highest number of ships, we had the lowest number of contingency operations. While we now have the lowest number of ships, we have the highest number of contingency operations. That is placing tremendous pressure on our Armed Forces and our personnel because of the lack of ships to meet those responses. So not only is it a problem in trying to meet the demands around the world, but it also is problematic for our men and women in uniform in terms of the quality of life, in terms of morale, in terms of recruitment and retention. That is the end result of what is happening. It may be difficult to quantify. I think these charts illustrate very clearly the pressures that are being placed on our naval forces and the Marine Corps today. 
   This is a disturbing and alarming trend. I think it does support the commander's testimony that we are being stretched too thin in responding to the increasing number of contingencies while reducing the number of ships. The assertion that a smaller number of more capable ships resulting in a stronger Navy is just not being borne out. Some would say it is quality that matters. That may well be true. In fact, we are moving to enhance the quality of the ships in the future. 
   As the commanders have told us time and again and repeatedly in testimony before the Seapower Subcommittee, numbers do count. Quantity, as one commander said, is a quality all its own. 
   One ship, even though it is more capable than three ships it replaces, cannot cover two geographic areas at once. The fact is, we found that out during the course of the Kosovo campaign and the onset of the Kosovo campaign. In fact, General Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander, had requested an aircraft carrier presence in the Adriatic. It took 2 weeks before we were able to have an aircraft carrier in the Adriatic, 2 weeks into the Kosovo conflict. 
   We heard in testimony before the Seapower Subcommittee from Vice Admiral Murphy, who is commander of the 6th Fleet, who told us that:  
   ......if we had a Navy air wing-- 
   And I am using his words--  
   in the fight from day one, we could only speculate as to the difference the naval air would have made in the first 2 weeks but I believe it would have been substantial.  
   In his words, he said it would have been substantial. It could have made a difference, having that airpower there from day one of the Kosovo conflict. But that did not happen. It took 2 weeks. 
   In the meantime, we left a gap in the Pacific command. We left the Pacific command without an aircraft carrier because we had to cover the Persian Gulf and, of course, meet the demands in Kosovo. That is what happens when we are stretched too thin and we do not have the number of ships to meet our responsibilities around the world. 
   As I said in the course of my discussion this morning, the fact is, the demands being placed on our naval forces and the Marine Corps are becoming greater and greater. Yet the number of ships to meet those demands is becoming fewer. So the question becomes, How many ships? That is a good question, one we are striving to answer. Have we gone too far in bringing down  the number of ships to 300? The operational commanders will tell us yes. Without a doubt, due to the high operational tempo that is reflected in this chart, as we have seen, tripling the number of contingency operations compared to where we were during the cold war, I would have to agree. We have had 103 contingency operations during the period of 1996 to 1999, with 316 ships. Yet during the cold war period, during a 9-year period, we only had 31. So obviously the demands are greater. 
   I think we have to make some decisions about where we need to go in the future. As the commander of the 6th Fleet testified, again during the course of his testimony, he said:  
   Numbers count. If there is an insufficiency of numbers, by the time you figure it out, it is usually too late.  
   So these shortcomings become a concern, as I say, leaving gaps, for example, in the Pacific command, not being able to respond to the Supreme Allied Commander by having an aircraft carrier for the duration of the entire conflict because we don't have enough ships; or because of the impact on the men and women because of the extended deployments, because of the quality of life, because of the recruitment and retention problems and the soaring cost of contingency operations--it is having an impact across the board. So, yes, there are higher risks in all respects. We have to address those risks. 
   We are trying. As chair of the Seapower Subcommittee and member of the overall committee, we have been asking for a report from the Pentagon as to what is their long-term shipbuilding plan that will ascertain exactly how many ships will be required to respond to these demands. 
   Senator ROBB of Virginia had included an amendment to the Defense authorization last year that asked for this long-term shipbuilding plan. The statutory requirement included a deadline of February of this year for the Pentagon to submit this report to the committee and to the Congress. They have failed to meet this prescribed statutory requirement of this analysis so the committee could make some decisions for the long term because it is not easy to shift these decisions when it comes to shipbuilding. It takes 5 to 6 years, on average, to construct a ship. 
   If we are going to reverse some of the trends that are already inherent in the budgets that have been submitted by the Pentagon, and if we are going to respond to those shifts, it is going to take a required lead time to make those changes. Yet the Defense Department has not submitted this analysis that was required under the law by February of this year. We have asked time and again; we have submitted letters to the Pentagon. I plan to hold a hearing to find out exactly why this report has not been submitted to the committee so we, in turn, can make the decisions, evaluate the analysis, and make some changes for the future. 
   If we are being told by the top civilian and military leadership of the Navy and Marine Corps that they are being stretched too thin, even with today's force structure of about 316 ships, then we are required to make some decisions about the future. They have confirmed time and again the predicted operating tempo of the Quadrennial Defense Review upon which this force structure of 316 ships is being based is different, quite different from what is occurring around the world. In fact, in regard to the QDR, the Navy's Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Resources, Warfare Requirements and Assessments testified:  
   ......prognostications for the future were different than the reality has turned out in the last few years.......we need to build higher number of ships than we are building today.  
   Other witnesses have also confirmed the budget request that was submitted by the administration did not include the construction of 8.7 new ships required to recapitalize the fleet at a rate that would maintain 308 ships, let alone increasing the number above the 316 ships in the fleet today. 
   We had testimony from a Congressional Research Service witness that a $10 billion to $12 billion investment on an annual basis, depending on the actual ship mix, to build an average of 8.7 ships per year is required just to maintain a 308-ship Navy. However, as I said, the budget request submitted by the Pentagon and by the administration for future years was only 7.5 ships per year on average. So that exacerbates the force structure problem rather than addressing it with the required resources. 
   The fact is, the historical average for shipbuilding over the last 5 to 6 years has been 7.5 ships. That puts us on a course for 263 ships in the Navy. So it is obviously far below the 300-ship Navy that has been determined to be necessary by the Quadrennial Defense Review, certainly less than the 316-ship Navy we have today, and certainly that is fewer ships than we need to be able to respond when it comes to the number of challenges around the world and the number of contingency operations that we have been engaged in and are responding to, just in a 4-year period between 1996 and 1999, which has been 103 contingency operations. 
   The subcommittee has tried to respond to these challenges. We have tried to respond in a number of ways, at least to begin to reverse course until we get this analysis from the Pentagon. Again, as I said, we will demand that analysis from the Pentagon so we can make a decision whether it is going to be 300 ships or 263 ships--which we are on a course towards, given the request and given the previous budgets by the administration--or if we are going to change that course, increasing the number from 316 or 300 or whatever the number may be. But we need to have a realistic assessment of where we should go in the future. 
   We have tried in this budget before us today in the reauthorization to respond to some of the issues. We have decided to do it in a number of ways. First, we included a legislative provision that will provide for advanced procurement but at the same time save $1.1 billion in taxpayers' dollars, if the Navy takes advantage of the opportunities that are provided in this reauthorization. To attain $500 million of the $1.1 billion in savings, the bill authorizes the Navy to buy the next six DDG-51 ships under a multiyear agreement at an economic rate of three ships per year and provides $143 million in advanced procurement to achieve economies of scale. 
   An additional $600 million in savings will result from the Navy contracting for the LHD-8 with prior year funding, as well as $460 million in this bill, and future full funding. 
   These smart acquisition strategies are actions that leverage the ship construction funding. It also provides a number of other cost-saving provisions. We authorize a block buy for economic order quantities for up to five Virginia class submarines and smart product modeling for our Navy's aircraft carriers. Both of these initiatives will result in shipbuilding savings. 
   Over the long haul, to sustain the minimum ship requirements, the Navy must find economies in all areas, including reducing operational costs for its entire fleet. The key to reducing these operating costs of ships lies in research and development for the design of future ships that can operate more efficiently and with less manning. 
   Our bill does approve ship design research and development which will directly result in reduced overall life-cycle costs of the Navy's next generation of ships. The research and development investment includes $550 million for the DD-21 program, $38 million for the CVN-77, $236 million for the CVN(X) and $207 million for the Virginia class submarine technologies. 
   In addition to the ship force structure issues, subcommittee witnesses testified that capabilities must remain ahead of the threats designed to disrupt or deny maritime operations on the high seas and in the littorals. 
   We also had testimony that indicated air and sea strategic lift and support are absolutely important to support all warfighting commanders in chief and all services, as well as supporting other Government agencies. 
   We tried to address the requirements to modernize the equipment as soon as possible while continuing the research and development which has the potential to provide our forces with the future systems they require. 
   We also supported the Marine Corps requirements of two LPD-17 class amphibious ships, which is state-of-the-art advance transport ships, as well as 12 MV-22 tilt-rotor aircraft, one landing craft air cushion life extension, and an additional $27 million for the advanced amphibious assault vehicle research and development.  
   We tried to address a number of the requirements for both the Navy and the Marine Corps to address what we consider to be the deficiencies that were submitted in the budget request by the administration for the Navy and the Marine Corps. It is also an attempt to fill the gap that has been placed on both of those services with respect to demands that not only have been required of them in contingency operations, but also in terms of the reduced force structure that has been demonstrated by these charts and by the realities in the world today. 
   I hope in the future we will be able to have the kind of analysis upon which we can develop what will be an adequate force structure, what will be an adequate number of ships, and other requirements for the Navy and the Marine Corps. Whether it is a 300-ship Navy, 308-ship Navy, a 316-ship Navy or beyond, or a 263-ship Navy, which has been the historical trend, as I said, over the last 5 to 6 years and which this authorization is attempting to reverse, it is going to take more than that. Obviously, we need to have the numbers and the analysis upon which to base those numbers from the Defense Department so that Congress has the ability to analyze those numbers in terms of 
   what is sufficient to meet the security challenges around the world. 
   As I said earlier, the Quadrennial Defense Review developed a number. They said a 300-ship Navy would be adequate to respond to the security challenges. They anticipated there would be an increase in contingency operations, but the problem is they did not anticipate the extent to which those operations would place demands on our naval forces and our Marine Corps.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to this amendment that seeks to authorize two additional BRAC rounds in fiscal years 2003 and 2005. 
   I have been a steadfast opponent to future BRAC proposals. This Administration has proposed BRAC legislation for the last 3 years. Each year, this administration has asked us to address the same issue. Yet over the last three years, nothing has changed. 
   First, the estimated savings achieved by closing bases are just that--estimated; and second, the inconsistent application of the BRAC process--which this Administration so readily demonstrated after the 1995 round, will result in lost training areas or access to airspace or the sea space by our military forces. This will result in degraded force readiness and will be to the overall detriment of our Armed Forces. 
   Advocates of base closures allege that billions of dollars will be saved, despite the fact that there is no consensus on the numbers among different sources. These estimates vary because, as the Congressional Budget Office explains, BRAC savings are really ``avoided costs.'' Because these avoided costs are not actual expenditures and cannot be recorded and tracked by the DoD accounting systems, they cannot be validated which has lead to inaccurate and overinflated estimates. 
   For example, as revealed by the General Accounting Office, land sales from the first base closure round in 1988 were estimated by Pentagon officials to produce $2.4 billion in revenue, however, as of 1995, the actual revenue generated was only $65.7 million. That is about 25 percent of the expected value. And what was the real up-front cost to generate these so called savings? No one really knows. 
   This type of overly optimistic accounting establishes a very poor foundation for initiating a policy that will have a permanent impact on both the military and the civilian communities surrounding these bases. 
   I also want to address the issue of the up-front costs involved in the base closure process. This appears to be noticeably absent from the debate. The facts reveal that there are billions of dollars in costs incurred to close a base. 
   This includes over $1 billion in Federal financial assistance provided to each affected community--a cost paid by the Federal Government, not through BRAC budget accounts, and therefore is not counted in the estimates. And more significantly, there is $9.6 billion in environmental cleanup costs as a result of the first four BRAC rounds--a conservative figure according to a December 1998 GAO report--a number that will continue to grow. 
   The administration and proponents of additional BRAC rounds are quick to point out that reducing infrastructure has not kept pace with our post cold war military force reductions. They say that bases must be downsized proportionate to the reduction in total force strength. 
   However, this thinking is based on the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review. Since the end of the cold war we have reduced the military force structure by 36 percent and have reduced the defense budget by 40 percent. But now I ask you how much are we employing that force? 
   Let me point out that although the size of the armed services has decreased, the number of contingencies that our service members have been called upon to respond to has dramatically increased--the Navy/Marine Corps team alone responded to 58 contingency missions between 1980 and 1989, and between 1990 and 1999 they responded to 192--a remarkable threefold increase! 
   During the cold war, the U.N. Security Council rarely approved the creation of peace operations. The U.N. implemented only 13 such operations between 1948 and 1978, and none from 1979 to 1987. 
   Since 1988, by contrast, 38 peace operations have been established--nearly three times as many than the previous 40 years. 
   In hearing after hearing this year, the Armed Services Committee has heard from our leaders in uniform how our current military forces are being stretched too thin, and that estimates predicted in the fiscal year 1997 QDR underestimated how much the United Sates would be using its military. Clearly, the benefits of the peace dividend are not being realized. 
   So, we are seeing first hand that the 1997 QDR force levels underestimated how much our military force was intended to be used, that our military force is being called upon now more than what military strategies estimated, and that our forces are being stretched to cover a wide range of operations. 
   These force levels have to be revisited, and if the trend for current deployments remains true, I would expect that these force levels may have to be increased. So would we then go and buy back this property that we have given up in future BRAC rounds to build new bases--I think not. 
   Before we legislate defense-wide policy that will reduce the size and number of training areas critical to our force readiness, the Department of Defense needs a comprehensive plan that identifies the operational and maintenance infrastructure required to support the services national security requirements. The peacekeeping and humanitarian missions clearly require a greater force structure than expected. 
   It has become clear that we are committing more military forces--and more often--than we had planned or anticipated. There is no straight line corollary between the size of our forces and the infrastructure required to support them. 
   We must realize that once property is given up and remediated, it is permanently lost as a military asset for all practical purposes. In the words of the Chief of Naval Operations, ``we cannot give it away or we will never get it back''. 
   In the full committee hearings and the subcommittee hearings that the Armed Services Committee held this past year, the Chief of Naval Operations and fleet commanders testified that the QDR established force levels are not sufficient to support their operational requirements. A report released earlier this year by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded that the submarine force levels needed to be raised from the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review and I anticipate that the next QDR will support an increase in the ``300 ship'' Navy as well. 
   Therefore, given the elasticity in the QDR numbers, it would be premature and costly to base permanent BRAC decisions on estimates that we know are not being realized. 
   Finally, it would be hypocritical to say that opponents of additional BRAC rounds are politicizing the process. Politics weigh heavily on both sides of the debate. In December 1998, the General Accounting Office reported that of the 499 recommendations made by the four BRAC commissions, 48 were amended and removed from the closure list. And we are all well aware of the Administration's ``intervention'' in the last round that resulted in the ``privatization-in-place'' of the McClellan and Kelly Air Force Base depots instead of their closure. 
   I want to protect the military's critical readiness and operational assets. I  want to protect the home port berthing for our ships and submarines, the airspace that our aircraft fly in and the training areas and ranges that our armed forces require to support and defend our Nation. We cannot degrade the readiness of our armed forces by chasing illusive savings. 
   I reaffirm my opposition to legislation authorizing additional BRAC rounds and encourage my colleagues to join me to vote against it. I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution that recognizes the contributions and sacrifices to our nation's defense provided by the men and women of the United States Naval Submarine Service and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine, and to specifically recognize that ``last full measure of devotion'' shown by the crew of the USS Thresher on April 10, 1963. 
   As you are aware, this year the U.S. Navy is celebrating the 100th year of service to our country by the Naval Submarine Service. From the acquisition of its first submarine, the USS Holland, in April 1900 to the present day, the U.S. Naval Submarine Service has served America bravely, gallantly, and steadfastly. We are all aware of the debt we owe the Submarine Service for their role in World War II when, in the immediate dark days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the ``Silent Service'' took the war to the enemy. Although they lost 52 submarines and more than 3,500 submariners, they accounted for 55 percent of all enemy ships lost and significantly contributed to the final victory in the Pacific. Since that time the Submarine Service has continued to protect the nation through its deterrence patrols and many other missions. In just the past few years the ability of our submarines to provide a stealthy, land-attack capability in support of operations in the Persian Gulf and in Kosovo has proven once again that their adaptability and capability are vital to the security interests of this nation. 
   A significant supporter of the Submarine Service for the past 100 years and this nation for the past 200 years has been the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. Beginning in 1800, the shipyard provided the U.S. Navy with ``ships of the line'' and during the War of 1812 it became a Navy command. But it is the shipyard's contributions to the Submarine Service that I want to talk about here today. 
   In April 1917, the first submarine built in a government shipyard, the L-8, was launched at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and in the ensuing 52 years, the shipyard launched another 133 submarines, including a record 31 in 1944 alone. In November 1971, the last submarine built in a government yard, the USS Sand Lance, was launched at Portsmouth before they took on their new role to overhaul, repair, and refuel nuclear submarines. But during their 52 years of building submarines Portsmouth delivered many firsts to the Submarine Service: First U.S. submarine built with an all-welded steel hull--the Snapper; first U.S. submarine built of high tensile steel--the Balao; first snorkel installed in a U.S. submarine--the Irex; first truly submersible hull developed using dirigible form, a breakthrough in hydrodynamic design--the Albacore; and the first nuclear powered submarine built in a government shipyard--the Swordfish. 
   But the shipyard and the Submarine Service could not have accomplished these important contributions to our nation's security without the unfailing valor and unselfish service of the submarine crews and shipyard workers that put them to sea. Perhaps there is no greater example of our American virtue of standing together for the common defense than the story of the USS Thresher, a nuclear submarine launched at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on July 9, 1960. 
   When she was launched the Thresher represented a new class of submarine for the Navy. The Thresher-class was designed to be the world's first modern, quiet, deep-diving fast-attack submarine. Some of her innovative features included machinery rafts for sound silencing, a large bow-mounted sonar, torpedo tubes amidships and a hydrodynamically streamlined hull. After two and a half years of trials, evaluations, and the development of new fast-attack tactics, the Thresher returned to her home yard. On April 9, 1963, she got underway for a series of deep-diving trials to be held about 220 nautical miles east of Cape Cod. On board was a crew of 129 made up of sailors, officers, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard workers and contractors. Shortly after beginning her dive, something went horribly wrong and the Thresher and all 129 souls on board were lost at sea. 
   But another example of our American character is the drive to create success from adversity and from the loss of the Thresher came two initiatives that have permitted the Submarine Service to gain unchallenged preeminence in undersea warfare. 
   First was the implementation of the SubSafe program. This standard dictates that every submarine, every hull integrity-related system and every pressure-related part within those systems must be 100 percent certified safe for use aboard the submarine. And since that time, no submarine has been lost because of a similar casualty. 
   Second, a recommendation by the Deep Submergence Systems Review Group, which looked into the cause of the tragedy, was that a curriculum be established to train engineers to design and develop systems specifically for use in the ocean environment--the discipline of ocean engineering. Since that time ocean engineering programs have been established in Florida, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Texas, Virginia, Hawaii and the Naval Academy. From these programs have come the engineers who have designed and developed the Los Angeles, the Ohio, the Seawolf and the Virgnia-classes of submarines. Engineers like retired Admiral Millard Firebaugh, a former ship superintendent at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, who earned a doctorate of science degree in Ocean Engineering from MIT and went on to become the program manager for the design and construction of the Seawolf. 
   We in this nation owe a great debt to the 129 crewmen of the USS Thresher, to all who have served aboard submarines over the past 100 years and to the civilians who have accepted the risk and sacrified alongside their submarine shipmates. When I learned that there had never been a resolution passed in this body acknowledging the loss of this gallant crew and expressing our gratitude for their sacrifice, I believed that in this 100th year of the Submarine Service and the 200th year of their home yard, the Portsmouth  Naval Shipyard, it was entirely appropriate and timely of us to do so. 
   I therefore ask unanimous consent that an enrolled copy be transmitted to and accepted by the commanding officer of Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on behalf of the families and shipmates of the crew of the USS Thresher, the crews of the Naval Submarine Service and the workers of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Women's Health Office Act of 2000 and I am pleased to be joined on this legislation by my friend and colleague, Senator BARBARA MIKULSKI. Companion legislation to this bill has been introduced in the House by Congresswomen CONNIE MORELLA and CAROLYN MALONEY. 
   The Women's Health Office Act of 2000 provides permanent authorization for offices of women's health in five federal agencies: the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ); the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA); and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
   Currently, only two women's health offices in the federal government have statutory authorization: the Office of Research on Women's Health at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Office for Women's Services within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). 
   For too many years, women's health care needs were ignored or poorly understood, and women were systematically excluded from important health research. One famous medical study on breast cancer examined hundreds of men. Another federally-funded study examined the ability of aspirin to prevent heart attacks in 20,000 medical doctors, all of whom were men, despite the fact that heart disease is the leading cause among women. 
   Today, members of Congress and the American public understand the importance of ensuring that both genders benefit equally from medical research  and health care services. Unfortunately, equity does not yet exist in health care, and we have a long way to go. Knowledge about appropriate courses of treatment for women lags far behind that for men for many diseases. For years, research into diseases that predominantly affect women, such as breast cancer, went grossly underfunded. And many women do not have access to reproductive and other vital health services. 
   Throughout my tenure in the House and Senate, I have worked hard to expose and eliminate this health care gender gap and improve women's access to affordable, quality health services. Ten years, ago, as co-chairs of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues (CCWI), Representative Pat Schroeder and I, along with Representative HENRY WAXMAN, called for a GAO investigation into the inclusion of women and minorities in medical research at the National Institutes of Health. 
   This study documented the widespread exclusion of women from medical research, and spurred the Caucus to introduce the first Women's Health Equity Act (WHEA) in 1990. This comprehensive legislation provided Congress with its 
   first broad, forward-looking health agenda designed to redress the historical inequities that face women in medical research, prevention and services. 
   Three years later Congress enacted legislation mandating the inclusion of women and minorities in clinical trials at NIH through the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-43). Also included in the NIH Revitalization Act was language establishing the NIH Office of Research on Women's Health--language based on my original Office of Women's Health bill that was introduced in the 104th Congress. 
   And yet, despite all the progress that we have made, there is still a long way to go on women's health care issues. Last month, the GAO released a report--a ten-year update--on the status of women's research at NIH (``NIH Has Increased Its Efforts to Include Women in Research,'' published on May 2, 2000). This report found that since the first GAO report and the 1993 legislation, NIH has made significant progress toward including women as subjects in both intramural and external clinical trials. 
   However, the report notes that the Institutes have made less progress in implementing the requirement that certain clinical trials be designed and carried out to permit valid analysis by sex, which could reveal whether interventions affect women and men differently. The GAO found that NIH researchers will include women in their trials--but then they will either not do analysis on the basis of sex, or if no difference was found, they will not publish the sex-based results. 
   NIH has done a good job of improving participation of women in clinical trials, but our commitment to women's health this is not about quotas and numbers. It is about real scientific advances that will improve our knowledge about women's health. At a time when we are on track to double funding for NIH, it is troubling that the agency has still failed to fully implement both its own guidelines and Congress's directive for sex-based analysis. And as a result, women continue to be shortchanged by federal research efforts. 
   The crux of the matter is that NIH's problems exist despite the fact that it has an Office of Women's Health that is codified in law. If NIH is having problems, imagine the difficulties we will have in continuing the focus on women's health in offices that don't have this legislative mandate, and that may change focus with a new HHS Secretary or Agency Director. 
   Offices of Women's Health across the Public Health Service are charged with coordinating women's health activities and monitoring progress on women's health issues within their respective agencies, and they have been successful in making federal programs and policies more responsive to women's health issues. Unfortunately, all of the good work these offices are doing is not guaranteed in Public Health Service authorizing law. Providing statutory authorization for 
   federal women's health offices is a critical step in ensuring that women's health research will continue to receive the attention it requires in future years. 
   Codifying these offices of women's health is important for several reasons: First, it re-emphasizes Congress's commitment to focusing on women's health. Second, it ensures that Agencies will enact Congress's intent with good faith. Finally, it ensures that appropriations will be available in future years to fulfill these commitments. 
   By statutorily creating Offices of Women's Health, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Women's Health will be able to better monitor various Public Health Service agencies and advise them on scientific, legal, ethical and policy issues. Agencies would establish a Coordinating Committee on Women's Health to identify and prioritize which women's health projects should be conducted. This will also provide a mechanism for coordination within and across these agencies, and with the private sector. But most importantly, this bill will ensure the presence of enduring offices dedicated to addressing the ongoing needs and gaps in research policy, programs, and education and training in women's health. 
   Improving the health of American women requires a far greater understanding of women's health needs and conditions, and ongoing evaluation in the areas of research, education, prevention, treatment and the delivery of services. I urge my colleagues to join Senator MIKULSKI and me in supporting this legislation, to help ensure that women's health will never again be a missing page in America's medical textbook.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills that are important to my State of Maine. The first piece of legislation pertains to the Narraguagus River dredge in Milbridge and will reauthorize former Corps project areas so as to design a portion of the 11-foot channel as anchorage. The town has provided the Corps with harbor use data that indicates that the 11-foot channel need only be dredged to 9 feet. 
   I have already requested $30,000 for FY01 Energy and Water appropriations to complete plans and specifications for a maintenance dredge of the 11-, 9- and 6-foot channel from Narraguagus Bay to the town landings and the 6-foot anchorages in Milbridge. The project serves the important commercial fishing and lobstering fleet, acquaculture operations, and fish packing facility, and a small recreational fleet. 
   The second bill concerns the Kennebunk River in Kennebunkport that deauthorizes a small elongated section of the Federal Navigation Channel. Not only would this allow much needed moorings from a nearby marina to remain where they have been positioned, but most importantly, the deauthorization would be the last piece needed so that the important dredge project can go forward. 
   This is a very active channel, Mr. President, and the dredge is extremely important for the safe passage not only for fishermen, but also for the tour boats, transporting up to 150 people, which go in and out of the busy harbor area throughout the spring, summer and fall months. Anyone who has been to the ``Port'' during the heavy tourist season can tell you it is a very popular attraction, particularly the tour boat trips that take tourists out past the breakwater for a view of the Maine coastline. The New England District Corps has given its approval for the deauthorization as has the town and the Joint River Commission. 
   I look forward to the speedy passage of these two non-controversial bills separately and to support their inclusion into legislation reauthorizing the Water Resources Development Act, or WRDA, for which passage is being considered in this Congress.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation designed to guarantee funding for Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) McKinney Act homeless assistance programs, including Shelter Plus Care and the Supportive Housing Program (SHP). 
   The legislation I am introducing today mirrors legislation introduced earlier this year in the House by Representative LAFALCE and included in the House version of the FY01 supplemental, which would renew existing Shelter Plus and SHP contracts and fund them under the budget for the HUD Section 8 housing assistance program. 
   The renewals funded under this legislation would provide grant funding for existing programs that support assistance to some of the most vulnerable Americans--the homeless. Without the resources that this bill is designed to provide, many who receive assistance today will literally be left out in the cold. 
   Keep in mind that these are not new programs--they are renewals. And they fund community initiatives already in place in cities and towns across the country that provide assistance to those in need. Under Shelter Plus and SHP, states are awarded grants for services such as subsidized housing for the homeless, many of whom are physically or mentally ill or disabled, or who suffer from substance abuse problems, as well as job training, shelters, health care, child care, and other services for this population. Some of the victims that are helped are children, low-income families, single mothers, and battered spouses. Many are also veterans. 
   I have witnessed first-hand the dislocation that can be caused by non-renewal. In January of last year, HUD issued homeless grant assistance announcements to most states but denied applications submitted by the Maine State Housing Authority and by the city of Portland, Maine leaving the state one of only four not to receive any funds. We were alarmed to learn that this would mean that many homeless agencies and programs could lose  funding altogether, and that in fact, over 70 homeless people with mental illnesses or substance abuse problems would lose housing subsidies. 
   The Maine congressional delegation immediately protested the decision to HUD Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo. HUD officials ultimately restored about $1 million in funding to the city of Portland, a portion of the city's request, but refused to restore any State homeless funding. 
   In 1998, Maine homeless assistance providers received about $3.5 million for HUD, and the State had simply requested $1.2 million for renewals and $1.27 million to meet additional needs in 1999. What did they get to meet these needs--nothing. In spite of the proven track record of homeless programs in Maine, including praise by Secretary Cuomo during an August 1998 visit to Maine, HUD completely zeroed out funding for Maine. Not a penny for these disadvantaged children, battered women, single mothers, disabled individuals, and veterans who sacrificed to preserve the freedoms we cherish. 
   This could happen anywhere, but it shouldn't. This is why I have also cosponsored legislation authored by my colleague from Maine, Senator COLLINS, to guarantee minimum funding for every state and assure a fairer, more equitable allocation of funding in the future. The legislation requires HUD to provide a minimum of 0.5 percent of funding to each state under title IV of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. 
   Without this assistance, basic subsidized housing and shelter programs suffer, and it is more difficult for states to provide job training, health care, child care, and other vital services to the victims of homelessness. 
   In 1988, 14,653 people were temporarily housed in Maine's emergency homeless shelters. Alarmingly, young people account for 30 percent of the population staying in Maine's shelters, which is approximately 135 homeless young people every night. Twenty-one percent of these young people are between 5-12 with the average age being 13. 
   It is vitally important that changes be made to our homeless policy to ensure that no state falls through the cracks in the future. As such, I urge my colleagues to join me in a strong show of support for the legislation I am proposing today. I hope this legislation will contribute to the dialogue under way as to how best to enhance federal homeless assistance initiatives, so that programs around the country can continue to provide vital services to the less fortunate among us. 
   Lastly, Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not express my gratitude to Senator BOND, who chairs the Senate VA-HUD Subcommittee for his leadership and his support when HUD zeroed out funding for Maine's homeless programs. I am very grateful for his vision and leadership on issues of importance to homeless advocates nationwide. To that end, I am pleased that the Senate version of the fiscal year 2001 Agriculture Department appropriations report contains language expressing concern about the HUD policies that resulted in a number of local homeless assistance initiatives going unfunded in recent years, and urging HUD to ensure that expiring rental contracts are renewed. HUD is also directed to submit a report to Congress explaining why projects with expiring grants were rejected during the 1999 round. 
   I look forward to working with the Senate VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee as well as the Banking Committee as this year's legislative and appropriations process continues, and as we endeavor to craft a long-term solution to the homeless problem that is fiscally and socially responsible and improves the effectiveness of federal homeless programs for the future. 
   Once again, I applaud the leadership of the Senate VA-HUD and Banking panels on this important issue, and I am confident in their commitment to further improvements in the program.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a resolution honoring the 19 Marines who died on April 8, 2000 during a training mission in Marana, AZ, and extending the condolences of the Senate to their families and the Marine Corps. 
   I thank Senators WARNER and LEVIN, and the 13 other Senators--from both sides of the aisle on the Armed Services Committee--for joining me in bipartisan support of this resolution. 
   At approximately 8 p.m. on Saturday, April 8, while conducting training as part of the weapons and tactics instructor course, during an operational evaluation of the MV-22 Osprey, the aircraft unexpectedly plunged to the ground during landing, killing all 19 marines on board. 
   Their deaths stunned the Nation. Among those who died were fathers, husbands, boyfriends, brothers, grandsons, nephews, uncles, and friends. These dedicated men were from Texas, Maryland, Oklahoma, California, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Arizona, Washington, Virginia, and Florida but were bound together in the brotherhood of arms known as the United States Marine Corps. 
   Since it was first established through a resolution by the Continental Congress on November 10, 1775, the United States Marine Corps has been defined by the fearless and indomitable spirit of those who have served. Sharing an enviable ``esprit de corps,'' marines have used the Marine Corps emblem of the eagle, globe, and anchor to transcend race, ethnicity, gender, geographic and economic background. Their tenacity, uncompromising will, and outspoken pride in being a marine have endeared them to the nation, and we, as a nation, grieve their loss. 
   Nowhere is this loss felt more deeply than by the families of these men. I thank them for their unrelenting support and sacrifice that they have made to their marine, to the Marine Corps, and to their Nation, and offer my sympathy for their loss. I also recognize the Marine Corps family--specifically the 3d Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, the Marine Helicopter Squadron-1, and the Marine Wing Communications Squadron 38, Marine Air Control Group 38--who served side by side with these marines and will continue to carry out the mission without them. 
   This tragic accident is a brutal reminder that there is no such thing as ``routine'' training for our men and women in the military. Every day, all around the world our armed forces risk their lives, in peace and in combat, to support and defend our great Nation, and they deserve our thanks and admiration. 
   Mr. President, this resolution recognizes the sacrifices of these magnificent 19 marines and their families who embody the Marine Corps credo ``Semper Fidelis'' always faithful. It is the opportunity for the Senate to publically thank their families and the Marine Corps for their dedication, loyalty, and sacrifice to our Nation, and to extend our condolences on this loss.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Critical Access Hospital Enhancement Act of 2000. This bill provides some much-needed program flexibility and refinements to the Medicare Critical Access Hospital Program. 
   Congress created the Critical Access Hospital Program three years ago when we passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33). Under current law, a Critical Access Hospital must be located at a distance of over 35 miles from the nearest hospital; have emergency room and inpatient services provided by physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners; have fifteen or fewer inpatient beds; and inpatient stays must be limited to an average of 96 hours (four days). 
   The Critical Access Hospital program enables eligible rural hospitals to receive higher reimbursement rates for acute medical care. Through special allowances for staffing and reimbursements, designation as a Critical Access Hospital means that a community may be able to maintain local health care access which would otherwise be lost. 
   Many rural patients are Medicare and Medicaid participants and reduced reimbursements hit hospitals and medical centers hard: for example, two-thirds of the patients at Blue Hill Memorial Hospital in my home state of Maine are enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid. Designation as a Critical Access Hospital is especially important to these small, rural hospitals because it provides higher reimbursement rates 
   To date, there are 165 hospitals across the country that have been designated as Critical Access Hospitals, and three in Maine: Blue Hill Memorial in Blue Hill, St. Andrews Hospital in Boothbay Harbor, and C.A. Dean Memorial Hospital in Greenville. Without the Critical Access Hospital program many small, rural hospitals--many of which are often the only point of care for miles--will be lost. My bill seeks to strengthen this program; it is my hope that with passage of the legislation I introduce today, more of our nation's small, rural hospitals will be able to participate in this valuable program. 
   This bill will bring increased flexibility and programmatic refinements to the Critical Access Hospital Program through the restoration of bad debt payments, extending cost-based reimbursement to ambulance and home health services associated with Critical Access Hospitals, and modifying the provisions related to swing bed and laboratory services. In addition, I propose including a seasonality adjustment for hospitals that are based in communities that experience large seasonal population fluctuations. 
   Rural residents are often poorer and more likely to lack private health insurance when compared with their urban neighbors. As a result, rural hospitals 
   disproportionately incur bad debt expenses. The BBA reduced bad debt payments for hospitals and the Health Care Financing Administration has interpreted this provision to apply to Critical Access Hospitals. My bill restores bad debt payments as a way to improve participation rates in the Critical Access Hospital program. 
   Emergency medical care is a crucial component in the Critical Access Hospital health care delivery system. Congress clearly stated that all outpatient departmental services furnished by Critical Access Hospitals should be reimbursed on the basis of reasonable costs, but HCFA has carved out ambulance services. My bill extends cost-based reimbursement to ambulance services associated with Critical Access Hospitals as it follows Congress's original legislative intent. 
   Critical Access Hospitals are often the sole sponsor of home health services in remote areas. If a Critical Access Hospital is the only home health provider in a rural community, then it would be useful to reimburse those services on the basis of reasonable costs. This bill will extend cost-based reimbursement to home health services associated with Critical Access Hospitals and will help maintain access to post-acute medical care for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   Critical Access Hospitals are currently required to comply with extensive minimum data set standards under the skilled nursing facility (SNF) prospective payment system (PPS). This bill will provide cost based reimbursement to swing bed services furnished by Critical Access Hospitals to help alleviate some of the administrative expenses associated with SNF PPS. 
   Laboratory services furnished by Critical Access Hospitals have historically been reimbursed on the basis of reasonable costs. In an attempt to clarify the statute and eliminate the collection of beneficiary coinsurance, the Balanced Budget Refinement Act (P.L. 106-113) that we passed last November inadvertently referenced the fee schedule. Consequently, HCFA has interpreted the provision to mean laboratory services now will be reimbursed at the fee schedule rate. Correcting this provision is critical to ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to important laboratory tests, and my bill does just that. 
   Seasonal fluctuations can occur in places likes coastal Maine where tourism swells the population in an area or in a small town near a ski resort. This seasonal population increase makes many otherwise tiny hospitals ineligible for the Critical Access Hospital Program. We must ensure that hospitals are available year round for a community's permanent population. It seems to me that if a hospital generally serves a community with a population of 2,000 but is seasonally faced with substantially much larger population, it should not de facto be made  ineligible for the benefits of the Critical Access Hospital Program. 
   The final provision in The Critical Access Hospital Enhancement Act will allow a state flexibility in designating a hospital with more than 15 beds as a Critical Access Hospital if those additional beds are used only for seasonal fluctuations in admissions, and if the average annual occupancy is not more than 15. 
   Mr. President, small hospitals across the country are facing an increasingly uncertain future, and we must lend additional support to our rural health care providers. Refining the Critical Access Hospital program will ensure that the Critical Access Hospital designation is flexible enough for most rural areas. Expanding the Critical Access Hospital Program is critical to these small hospitals and the communities they serve.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Fiscal Year 2001 military construction appropriations bill and to commend my colleagues Senator STEVENS, Senator BYRD, Senator BURNS, and Senator MURRAY for their leadership in bringing this most important spending bill  before the Senate. This bill provides critical funding for military construction projects as well as Department of Defense related emergency supplemental funding for fiscal year 2000. 
   Other colleagues have already spoken on the merits of the military construction aspect of this bill and the importance of those projects to the men and women of our armed forces and their families. So today, I am going to focus my remarks on the critical provisions contained in the Byrd-Warner amendment and why I believe those provisions are as important to these same men and women and their families. 
   By including emergency supplemental funding in this bill, and fast tracking its passage, the Congress will be supporting the loyal men and women of our armed forces who are participating in contingency operations overseas. But, Mr. President, support of our troops is not always ``sending money,'' sometimes we support them best by ensuring that they are not overextended in missions that appear to have no end. And that is why I commend Senator BYRD and Senator WARNER for their leadership by including these provisions that will force the debate about open-ended obligations. 
   For example, on May 1, 2000, the top U.S. commander in Kosovo, Brigadier General Ricardo Sanchez told reporters that he predicts that NATO peacekeepers will have to remain in the Balkans for ``at least a generation.'' 
   In testimony before the Senate just this last April, Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen acknowledged that U.S. troops may not be pulled out during his final months in his cabinet position, and possibly not during the time of his predecessor. Our airmen performed superbly during the 78-day air war. Now, a year has passed and we have more than 5,500 troops on the ground in Kosovo, having spent more than $2 billion on the air campaign, and by September of this year estimates are that the U.S. will spend upwards of $5.9 billion in support of stabilizing the peace in Kosovo. And, as the policy currently stands, there is no end in sight. 
   We have learned through our experience in Bosnia that rhetoric alone will not expedite mission accomplishment and bring our troops home. In 1996, the U.S. sent 22,500 soldiers to the Balkans, in support of the Dayton Accords for an operation that was to last until December 16th of that year. We have made great progress there, but, four years later, the U.S. still has a significant force there and no deadline for withdrawal. So here we are Mr. President, four and one half years since the signing of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia, we have more than 4,300 troops in Bosnia and another 3,000 support personnel committed in the region and no deadline for withdrawal, no end in sight. 
   In Kosovo we won the peace in June 1999 with our air campaign and a year later we are providing more then 5,500 troops to support an operation that is becoming increasingly more 
   threatening. 
   In this bill, Mr. President, with the leadership of Senator BYRD and Senator WARNER, the Senate is taking action to establish some way of getting to an end in Kosovo. Provisions in this bill provide a limitation of funds for U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo. Section 2410 of this bill terminates funding for the U.S. presence in Kosovo after July 1, 2001, unless and until the President submits a report to Congress containing a request to specifically authorize continued U.S. ground troop deployment and Congress enacts a joint resolution specifically authorizing such continued deployment. I must note, that this provision does continue the support of non-combat troops in Kosovo who can provide limited support to the continued NATO peacekeeping operation. 
   The provision further requires the President to develop a plan, in consultation with appropriate foreign governments, by which NATO member countries, with the exception of the U.S., and other non-NATO countries will provide all ground combat troops necessary to execute peacekeeping operations in Kosovo. Again, we are looking for a plan--something that this Administration has not been able to do. The plan is to establish a schedule or target dates, at three month intervals, for achieving an orderly transition to a non-U.S. force in Kosovo. 
   Mr. President, it is also in this spirit that I must express my disappointment in the lack of support for operations in Kosovo by the European Commission, the European Union, and the European member nations of NATO and why I strongly support the provisions of the Byrd-Warner amendment. 
   In Kosovo, the U.S. has taken the lead toward ending the ethnic violence and establishing civil law with the intention of turning the responsibility for long term development and revitalization over to the European community. However, the European community has not stepped forward as a unified body to assume this responsibility, and appears unwilling to take a leadership role. 
   In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on February 29th, General Clark, then Commander-In-Chief of the U.S. European Command stated that ``despite our progress in missions assigned to the military, civil implementation has been slow and in Kosovo today, civil government structures are lacking.'' He further stated that ``the pace of contributions to the manning and resources of UNMIK [United Nations Mission in Kosovo] have resulted in sporadic and uneven progress toward civil implementation goals'' and concluded his testimony by saying ``the hardest part of securing peace in Kosovo lies ahead.'' 
   A well-publicized area where the lack of European support for civil implementation is readily apparent is the European's lack of support for the Kosovo Police Force. The United Nations has stated the requirement for 4,718 police and at this point the United States has provided 97% of the 550 police we have pledged, yet our European partners have only mustered 63% of the 1288 police they had pledged. Mr. President, I call on the leadership of our allies to meet their commitments! 
   Let me remind my colleagues that in the last decade we anticipated reaping the benefits of the peace dividend. Many touted that the end of the Cold War would allow us to draw down our military forces and spend less money on defense. Well we have 
   drawn our forces down, and they are deployed more now than ever anticipated in the post-cold-war era, and we are paying for it. In the period 1999 through 1999, U.S. taxpayers will have spent more than $23.6 billion for contingency operations. Mr. President, we just cannot afford to unilaterally deploy troops and provide monetary support to each global hot spot for an indefinite period of time, with tepid and inconsistent support from the UN, NATO, and our other allies. 
   In the four years of the Bosnia Operation, more Army reservists have been activated than in the entire Vietnam War, and I am concerned that our involvement in Kosovo will mirror our involvement in Bosnia. I tell you this first hand, because these reservists include men and women of the 112th Medical Company from the Army National Guard and members of the 101st Air Refueling Wing from my home state of Maine who were called up or volunteered to serve in Bosnia. 
   And we are paying for these extended deployments in more than just dollars. At a time when the Department of Defense is meeting only 92 percent of its active duty recruiting goal, 88 percent of its Reserve recruiting goal and is struggling to retain the highly trained people that are currently serving, we in Congress and in the Administration need to be mindful of the message that we are sending to the American people. They need to know that we are aware that we are closely watching, and that we are ready to step in to protect the best interests of the U.S. and our men and women in uniform. 
   Although military members reference the high operational tempo as a consideration for leaving the military, it is difficult to quantify the exact effect those contingency operations have had on the recruiting and retention of personnel. It is, however, easy to determine the monetary effect. As we marked-up the Fiscal Year 2001 Defense Authorization Act, we were forced to look for ways to find money to fund new equipment to modernize our forces, money to improve housing and the quality of life, and money to improve healthcare for our men and women in uniform, as well as their families and our often forgotten retirees. We continue to uphold our commitments, just as we are upholding our commitment to this operation in Kosovo--to the detriment of our readiness to fight and win if there was a  major theater war--while our European allies remain in the shadows. 
   Now this Senate is considering the addition of $1.85 billion in supplemental appropriations to support overseas contingency operations. But this bill is different in that the Byrd-Warner amendment limits the amount that can be obligated to 75 percent of the total Kosovo appropriation until the President certifies that four specific conditions have been met; at which time the remaining 25 percent would be released. These conditions stipulate that the European Commission, the European Union and the European member nations of NATO must provide a third of the assistance for reconstruction that they pledged, 75 percent of the funds promised for humanitarian assistance, 75 percent of the amount pledged for the Kosovo consolidated budget, and 75 percent of the personnel pledged for the Kosovo Police Force. 
   These provisions provide specific, tangible steps toward the fulfillment of the commitment promised by these countries. This does not require these countries to provide something that they do not have or something that they are not capable of supporting. It is merely a means of holding them accountable for that to which they have already committed. 
   If, however, our allies continue to go back on their pledged commitment, and the President cannot certify that those four conditions have been met by July 15th of this year, then the remaining funds must be used for the planned, phased, and safe withdrawal of U.S. troops from Kosovo. The details and time line for this withdrawal will be left to the President and his advisers, with these plans to be fully developed by the 30th of September. 
   So, as our troops in Kosovo valiantly conduct 1,321 security patrols each week and provide around the clock security at 48 checkpoints and 62 key facilities, we must support them in every way, beginning with holding our allies in Europe to the fiscal and personnel support they pledged to provide when the U.S. decided to support the air offensive in Kosovo. 
   I know, that as a result of the leadership of Senators STEVENS, BYRD, BURNS, and MURRAY, the FY2001 military construction appropriations bill is good legislation that provides our men and women in the armed forces the support they need as they go about their business of protecting our long-term national interests.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President. I rise today to speak about S. 2557, the National Energy Security Act of 2000. 
   First of all, I want to thank the Republican leader, Senator LOTT, who pulled together a task force to address the serious problem of the lack of a national energy policy, and also Senator MURKOWSKI, Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
   From my viewpoint on the Task Force, I was representing a State that appeared to be the proverbial canary in the coal mine as Maine was one of the early Northeast states not only to bear the brunt of low oil inventories during this past winter that was 20 degrees below normal in January, but a state that also experienced some of the highest prices in the country for home heating oil, kerosene and propane. Prices doubled and remained high throughout the winter months only then to be followed this spring by the highest prices in over two decades at the gas pump. And, this week, prices at the pump are once again on their way up, jumping more than 12 cents overnight. 
   The entire episode has pointed out just how vulnerable--and unprepared--the Federal Government is when it comes to a workable energy policy. As we found out, there was no short term policy to follow. The Administration, as Secretary Richardson stated at an oil crisis summit in Bangor last February, was caught napping. So, the goal of the task force was to come up with legislation that would decrease the country's dependency on foreign oil to 50 percent by the year 2010 through the enhancement of the use of renewable energy resources and includes the extension of tax credits for the production of energy from biomass, including wood waste; increases eligibility to the federal Weatherization Program, an outreach program to encourage consumers to take actions to avoid seasonal price increases through a summer fill and fuel budgeting program; and provides tax credits for residential use of solar power. 
   The bill enhances domestic energy production oil by offering tax relief for oil and gas produced from small marginal wells--wells that produce less than 15 barrels a day--that have already been drilled but have been capped when oil prices hit rock bottom over the past few years. Bringing these marginal wells back into domestic production also has the benefit of producing more U.S. jobs. 
   I am particularly pleased that the bill authorizes the Secretary of Energy to establish a Northeast Heating Oil Reserve to be used when home heating oil inventories fall dangerously low and prices escalate. The Reserve would store two million barrels of refined home heating oil within a day's delivery to Northeast states if supplies run dangerously low because of a sudden demand due to cold winter weather. 
   Mr. President, I would have liked to have been a cosponsor of S. 2557, because we need a comprehensive policy and the National Energy Security Act was an effort to start down that road. I cannot, however, because the bill also calls for the opening up of the Arctic Coastal Plain, which would allow for oil and gas exploration and drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I continue to believe that ANWR should remain protected and there are a number of other steps that can be taken to increase or conserve our domestic supply. 
   Now that this legislation has been introduced, potential solutions to our Nation's energy policy--or lack of it--can at least be considered and debated.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation designed to promote growth in the domestic cruise ship industry and at the same time enable U.S. shipyards to compete for cruise ship orders. The legislation would require that at least two U.S.-built ships be ordered for each foreign-built ship permitted to operate in the U.S. market, and provide tax incentives for U.S. cruise ship construction and operation.  
   Current law prohibits non-U.S. vessels from carrying passengers between U.S. ports. As such, today's domestic cruise market is very limited. The cruise industry consists predominantly of foreign vessels which must sail to and from foreign ports. The vast majority of cruise passengers are Americans, but most of the revenues now go to foreign destinations. That is because the high cost of building and operating U.S.-flag cruise ships and competition from modern, foreign-flag cruise ships have deterred growth in the domestic cruise ship trade. 
   By some estimates, a single port call by a cruise vessel generates between $300,000 and $500,000 in economic benefits. This is a very lucrative market, and I would like to see U.S. companies and American workers benefit from this untapped potential. However, domestic ship builders and cruise operations face a very difficult, up-hill battle against unfair competition from foreign cruise lines and foreign shipyards. Foreign cruise lines, for example, pay no corporate income tax. Nor are they held to the same demanding ship construction and operating standards imposed on U.S.-flag vessel operators. Foreign cruise lines are also free from the need to comply with many U.S. labor and environmental protection laws, and U.S. health, safety, and sanitation laws do not apply to the foreign ships. 
   The legislation I am introducing today is designed to level the playing field between the U.S. cruise industry and the international cruise industry. It requires that at least two U.S.-built ships be ordered for each foreign-built ship permitted to operate on a temporary basis in the U.S. market, and provide tax incentive for U.S. cruise ship construction and operation. For example, it provides that a shipyard will pay taxes on the construction or overhaul of a cruise ship of 20,000 gross tons or greater only after the delivery of the ship. 
   Under my bill, a U.S. company operating a cruise ship of 20,000 grt and greater may depreciate that vessel over a five-year period rather than the current 10-year depreciation period. The bill would also repeal the $2,500 business tax deduction limit for a convention on a cruise ship to provide a tax deduction limit equal to that provided to conventions held at shore-side hotels. The measure would authorize a 20-percent tax credit for fuel operating costs associated with environmentally clean gas turbine engines manufactured in the U.S., and also allows use of investment of Capital Construction Funds to include not only the non-contiguous trades, but also the domestic point-to-point trades and ``cruise to nowhere.'' 
   Finally, the bill provides that a foreign-built ship may be brought into the U.S. trades only after the owner or buyer of such vessel has entered into a binding contract for the construction of at least two cruise ships of equal or greater size in the U.S. The interim foreign-built ship must be documented in the U.S. The contract must require that the first ship constructed in the U.S. be delivered no later than four years from the date of entering the binding contract with the delivery of a second ship within five years, and that the foreign-built ship must exit the U.S. trade within 12 months of the delivery of the last ship, provided there is no longer than a 24-month elapse between delivery of second and subsequent ships, should the contract provide for construction of more than two ships.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators JEFFORDS, WELLSTONE, and COLLINS today as an original cosponsor of the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000. 
   There is no doubt that providing access to affordable prescription drugs for American consumers is a very important policy issue. It seems that everywhere we turn--from ``60 Minutes'' to Newsweek--we are hearing stories that our nation's patients face dramatically higher prices for their prescription medication than do our neighbors to the North. 
   In my view, a solution to the pressing problem of prescription drug coverage can't come soon enough. In 1998, drug costs grew more than any other category of health care--skyrocketing by 15.4 percent in a single year. And that's a special burden for seniors, who pay half the cost associated with their prescriptions as opposed to those under 65 who pay just a third. 
   Seniors are reeling from the burden of their prescription drug expenses. The March/April 2000 edition of Health Affairs reports that the average senior now spends $1,100 every year on medications. And with the latest HCFA estimates putting the number of seniors without drug coverage at around 31 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries--or about 13 out of nearly 40 million Americans--it's not hard to see why we can no longer wait to provide a solution. In fact, nearly 86 percent of Medicare beneficiaries must use at least one prescription drug every day. 
   Who are these seniors who don't have prescription drug coverage? Who are the ones traveling by the busload to Canada to buy their prescription drugs? They are people caught in the middle--most of whom are neither wealthy enough to afford their own coverage nor poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. In fact, we know that seniors between 100 percent and 200 percent of the federal poverty have the lowest levels of prescription drug coverage. And these seniors who are just over the poverty level are the least likely to have access to either employer-based coverage or Medicaid. 
   But even Medicaid is not the answer. According to the Urban Institute, in 1996, 63 percent of beneficiaries eligible for QMB (Qualified Medicare Beneficiary) protections--that is, those under the federal poverty level--actually receive those protections, while only 10 percent of those between 100 and 120 percent of the poverty level--those eligible for SLMB (Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary) protections--are receiving that coverage. And only 16 states--including my home state of Maine--have their own drug assistance programs. 
   The high cost of prescription medications in the United States is forcing many of our nation's seniors to make unthinkable decisions that are harmful to their health and well-being. It is simply unacceptable that any person should have to choose between filling a prescription or buying groceries.  
   It is fundamentally unfair that a senior in Maine, Vermont, or Minnesota must drive across the Canadian border to be able to afford to buy his or her prescription medications. And while it is illegal for Americans to go to Canada and purchase drugs to be brought back to the United States, we know that this happens on a daily basis. 
   Mr. President, we are in a time of unparalleled prosperity. Almost daily, it seems, we learn of astounding new breakthroughs in biomedical research and in new prescription medications. And there is no question in anyone's mind that we have the best--the very best--health care in the entire world. But yet what does it say when our seniors are forced to go to Canada to purchase their prescription medications? 
   Mr. President, the legislation introduced today by Senator JEFFORDS will allow Americans to legally purchase in Canada a limited amount of their medication for personal use. This will enable American patients to purchase their medications at the lower prices. In addition, pharmacists and wholesalers will be allowed to reimport prescription drugs that were made in the U.S. or in FDA-approved facilities. 
   Mr. President, I support this bill and believe that Senator JEFFORDS has written a sound piece of legislation. But the fact of the matter is that addressing the issue of seniors crossing the border to purchase drugs is really only an interim approach--the real issue for America's seniors is the lack of comprehensive prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   This is why last August I introduced the Seniors Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity (SPICE) Act, S. 1480, with Senator RON WYDEN of Oregon. Our plan will give seniors coverage options similar to those enjoyed by Members of Congress and other federal employees, through a choice of competing comprehensive drug plans. SPICE will prescribe prescription drug coverage for all Medicare-eligible seniors, with the federal government covering all or part of the premiums on a sliding scale. 
   SPICE has the advantage of working with or without Medicare reform--something I've heard time and again is important to seniors, because it means that they don't have to wait for meaningful prescription drug coverage. The SPICE gives us the best of all possible worlds--a system that can exist outside of Medicare reform, co-exist with a new Medicare regime when it comes, and actually serve as a downpayment on comprehensive reform. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator JEFFORDS as an original cosponsor of this bill. He has written a bill with the needs of American consumers in mind, and he is ensuring that Americans will have access to safe and affordable prescription medications while Congress works to devise a long-term solution to this very serious problem. 
   Thank you, I yield the floor.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare Osteoporosis Measurement Act. 
   Three years ago Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. In doing so, we dramatically expanded coverage of osteoporosis screening through bone mass measurements for Medicare beneficiaries. Since we passed this law, we have learned that under the current Medicare law, it is very difficult for a man to be reimbursed for a bone mass measurement test. The bill I am introducing today, the Medicare Osteoporosis Measurement Act, would help all individuals enrolled in Medicare to receive the necessary tests if they are at risk for osteoporosis. 
   Currently, Medicare guidelines allow for testing in five categories of individuals--and most ``at risk'' men do not fall into any of them. The first category in the guidelines is for ``an estrogen-deficient woman at clinical risk for osteoporosis.'' The bill I am introducing today changes this guideline to say that ``an individual, including an estrogen-deficient woman, at clinical risk for osteoporosis'' will be eligible for bone mass measurement. This change--of just a few words--will vastly increase the opportunities for men to be covered for the important test. 
   Osteoporosis is a major public health problem affecting 28 million Americans, who either have the disease or are at risk due to low bone mass. Today, two million American men have osteoporosis, and another three million are at risk of this disease. Osteoporosis causes 1.5 million fractures annually at a cost of $13.8 billion--$38 million per day--in direct medical expenses. In their lifetime, one in two women and one in eight men over the age of 50 will fracture a bone due to osteoporosis. Each year, men suffer one-third of all the hip fractures that occur, and one-third of these men will not survive more than a year. In addition to hip fracture, men also experience painful and debilitating fractures of the spine, wrist, and other bones due to osteoporosis. 
   Osteoporosis is largely preventable and thousands of fractures could be avoided if low bone mass were detected early and treated. Though we now have drugs that promise to reduce fractures by 50 percent and new drugs have been proven to actually rebuild bone mass, a bone mass measurement is needed to diagnose osteoporosis and determine one's risk for future fractures. And we have learned that there are some prominent risk facts: age, gender, race, a family history of bone fractures, early menopause, risky health behaviors such as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, and some medications all have been identified as contributing factors to bone loss. But identification of risk factors alone cannot predict how much bone a person has and how strong bone is. 
   Mr. President, we know that osteoporosis is highly preventable, but only if it is discovered in time. There is simply no substitute for early detection. My legislation will ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries at risk for osteoporosis will be able to be tested for osteoporosis.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, to introduce a bill that will enhance an already successful program and have a significant impact on women owned businesses. The purpose of the Snowe-Warner bill is to include women-owned businesses as eligible participants in the Department of Defense's Mentor-Protege Program. 
   In 1990, the Congress established the DoD Mentor-Protege Pilot Program to provide incentives for major defense contractors to furnish disadvantaged small business concerns with assistance. That act also established a participation goal of 5% for those small disadvantaged businesses; however, women-owned businesses were not covered under that legislation. 
   The overall results of that legislation were impressive. According to the GAO, from Fiscal Year 1992 through Fiscal Year 1998, appropriated mentor-protege funding of about $233 million was obligated through cooperative agreements, separate contracts, or line items in DOD contracts. And, according to the Department of Defense, between 1994 and 1997 there was a net gain of 3,342 jobs within protege firms; there was a net revenue gain in excess of $276 million within the protege firms; and mentors reported an additional $695 million in subcontract awards to small disadvantaged businesses during this period. So, clearly, our legislation had a beneficial impact on the hundreds of small and disadvantaged businesses that now have the opportunity to compete and win Defense contracts under this program. 
   Then, in 1994, we passed Public Law 103-355, otherwise known as the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, which, among other provisions, amended Section 15 of the Small Business Act to establish a 5% annual goal for women-owned business enterprise participation in federal prime contracts and subcontracts. The Act also amended Section 8 of the Small Business Act to give women-owned businesses equal standing with small and small disadvantaged businesses in the subcontracting plans of federal prime contractors. 
   And, again, the results were significant. In Fiscal Year 1997 the government reported that women-owned businesses received 2.5% ($5.6 billion) of the $225 billion prime and subcontract dollars spent, up from 1.3% in Fiscal Year 1991 when data by gender was first collected. And in the latest data from Fiscal Year 1999, women-owned businesses accounted for 2.42% or $4.6 billion of the total $190 billion federal contract dollars. The percentage of Federal agencies that awarded at least 5% of their prime contract dollars to women-owned businesses was 37.9% in Fiscal Year 1997, up from 20.4% in Fiscal Year 1987. 
   In Fiscal Year 1997 some 5,722 women-owned businesses were involved in 446,332 federal prime contract actions amounting to $3.3 billion while another $2.3 billion was awarded to women-owned businesses in subcontract actions. At that time, women-owned businesses comprised 8.3% of Federal prime contractors, 
   were involved in 4.1% of the prime contract actions and received 2.1% of Federal prime contract awards. 
   Why is this important? Women-owned federal contractors own much more substantial enterprises than the typical woman-owned firm. The average number of employees in women-owned federal contractor firms was 52.2 compared to just 2.3 among all full-time women-owned firms. Women-owned firms involved in Federal procurement have, on average, 1,742% higher sales and employ 23 times more employees than the average woman-owned firm.  
   Despite the resounding success of these initiatives, I must ask the question, ``Are we there yet?'' Not quite. Although all Executive Branch departments operate Mentor-Protege programs, the three agencies, Defense, Energy, and GSA, that account for the most contract dollars have never met the 5 percent goal. While Defense, the largest federal purchaser, provided $2.3 billion or 50% of all federal contracts going to women-owned businesses in Fiscal Year 1999, that amount represented only 1.92% of total Defense contracts. 
   The other two agencies together provided 16.4% of all federal contracts to women-owned businesses in fiscal year 1999 but, again, that funding only represented 3.1% of their combined contract funding. Of the three agencies, the GSA came closest to meeting the 5% goal with 4.75% of its contract dollars going to women-owned firms. 
   Some agencies, however, are doing very well at meeting the 5% goal. Housing and Urban Development sent 14.95% of its 1999 contracts to women-owned businesses, Veteran's Affairs sent 5.59%, and appropriately, the Small Business Administration spent 15.29% of their contract dollars at women-owned firms. 
   Mr. President, women-owned businesses are capable of doing more and they want to do more. Surveys indicate that when asked if the availability of mentor-protege programs would make them more interested in entering the government procurement market, 33% of women business owners responded favorably. Similarly, 30% of women with businesses more than 20 years old were among those most interested in taking part in a mentor-protege program. 
   When Section 831 of Public Law 101-510 establishing the DoD Mentor-Protege Pilot Program to provide incentives for major defense contractors to furnish disadvantaged small business concerns with assistance was drafted, it defined disadvantaged small business concerns as those owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, Indian tribes, Hawaiians and those that employ the severely disabled. It did not specifically provide for the participation by women-owned businesses, those firms that are at least 51% owned and whose management and daily business operations are controlled by one or more women. 
   Mr. President, very simply, this bill will correct that, and I, therefore, urge my colleagues in the Senate to support the passage of the Snowe-Warner bill that allows us to forge two pieces good legislation into one better piece of legislation that benefits American business women and, by extension, America.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Alabama, Senator SESSIONS, to introduce legislation that will improve Department of Defense business practices as well as assist the DoD in its ability to estimate cost savings, a process that has significant impact in the DoD's budget process. This legislation will also result in improved readiness by adding a more realistic approach to the DoD's cost estimating process by eliminating the unknowns that the DoD faces in projecting its budget. 
   Today the Department of Defense is using arbitrary cost saving objectives of up to $11.2 billion in its budget for Fiscal Years 2001 to 2005. These cost savings are projected efficiencies expected to be realized through processes such as outsourcing and the OMB Circular A-76 process. Unfortunately, both the Government Accounting Office and the Naval Audit Service have published reports stating that these savings are inflated and overly optimistic. 
   The greatest cause of concern however, is the self-inflicting damage caused by these overestimated savings. Once the individual services within the Department of Defense establish these arbitrary savings goals, they reduce the future operating budget estimates to take into account the estimated savings. But, when these predicted savings are not achieved, it is the readiness accounts and modernization programs that end up paying the price. 
   None of us would run our personal home finances in such a manner, and no business could proceed using such an accounting method. So that is what Senator SESSIONS, my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, and I want to address in this legislation. We want to establish better business practices, so that DoD is not setting itself up for failure. DoD needs to take a more realistic approach in the way it estimates projected savings and how it establishes performance standards to measure the impact of workforce  changes. The DoD and the American taxpayer need to understand the potential impact to the readiness of our armed forces. 
   This legislation has four basic provisions that will provide improved business practices. 
   First, this legislation requires the Department of Defense to establish a system to track the costs and savings incurred through managed competitions, efficient reorganizations, and the streamlining of other functions currently being performed by the government through the A-76 process or other re-engineering of a federal activity. 
   The data collected through the establishment of this system will serve two purposes. It will be compiled into a report the Department of Defense is required to submit to Congress each year, so that Congress will have the information necessary to provide oversight of the A-76 process and other cost saving reorganizing process. The data will also be used to establish a metric of current performance and current costs prior to outsourcing, to serve as a standard for future performance and future cost comparisons--so that the leaders within the Department of Defense will be able to validate the actual savings achieved and evaluate the maintenance of performance standards. 
   Second, this legislation requires that the cost and savings incurred through out-sourcing, strategic sourcing, or re-organizing each position currently staffed by federal personnel, be projected over the Future Years Defense Program. This requirement will improve savings estimates by including both the short and long term costs associated with outsourcing, or contracting out a function. 
   The third provision of this legislation requires the Secretary of Defense to certify that the function analysis and decision to outsource, strategically source, or to maintain the current federal force was not based on unfair personnel constraints that may prevent the current federal organization from operating efficiently. This will ensure that our federal workers are provided a fair chance in any process and will provide the Department of Defense the most efficient work force for the actual task at hand. 
   As part of the A-76 process, the Department of Defense is required to conduct an evaluation of the impact on local economies and communities if the decision is made to convert functions currently being performed by government workers to the private sector. The fourth provision of this legislation requires the Department of Defense to submit a statement of the potential economic impact on each affected local community. This notification will provide Congress and our constituents the opportunity to better understand these impacts. 
   Mr. President, in the short term, this legislation will require significant changes in the way the Department of Defense conducts its processes. But in the long term this legislation will yield significant benefit. These four provisions are based on the recommendations of experts in the U.S. General Accounting Office and the Naval Audit Service. By enforcing better business practices--which is what this legislation effectively does--the long term effects will benefit the Department of Defense by improving the accuracy of cost and savings estimates, stabilizing the budget, and protecting modernization programs. 
   Additionally, the benefits will extend to the current federal workforce, who will be guaranteed the opportunity to compete on an equal basis, and the local communities surrounding these agencies will be able to better understand the impact of any decisions that are made. 
   Mr. President, I firmly believe that this legislation supports the best interests of the Department of Defense and the federal work force. I urge my colleagues to review this legislation--and I am confident that they will see it's merits and join me and support this bill.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation, the Small Business Employment and Education Act of 2000, which is designed to enhance federal efforts to facilitate the involvement of small business owners and entrepreneurs in state and local initiatives to improve the quality of education programs for our young people. 
   Mr. President, last year, the Small Business Committee, of which I am a member, held a hearing on the challenges facing the small business community as a result of the failure of many of our educational institutions to teach students the basic skills that are necessary to succeed in today's work environment. The committee heard testimony from a number of small businesses and organizations about this growing problem. 
   And just how big is the problem? A 1999 American Management Association survey on workplace testing found that approximately 36 percent of employees tested for basic skills were found to be deficient in these skills, and small businesses reported deficiency rates well above the national average. Sixty percent of AMA-member companies reported that the availability of skilled manpower was scarce, and 67 percent believe that the shortages will continue. 
   A 1999 NFIB report found that 18 percent of NFIB members report that finding qualified labor is the single most important problem facing their business today. 
   Likewise, a 1999 poll of U.S. Chambers of Commerce found that 83 percent reported the ability--or lack thereof--to find qualified workers was among their biggest concerns, and 53 percent said education is the single most pressing public policy issue to them. 
   This information clearly illustrates that the business community, and small businesses in particular, have an important stake in the education of our youth. One of the most fundamental needs that any growing business faces is the need for employees with basic skills, and concerns have been expressed by the small business community that many students are not graduating with the basic skills in reading, writing, mathematics, and science--skills that need to succeed in today's workplace or become the entrepreneurs of tomorrow. 
   The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, the growth of high-skilled jobs is outpacing growth in all other fields. We must not allow basic skills to slip away if we are to remain competitive in an increasingly aggressive and technology-based global market. 
   Small business is the driving force behind our economy, and as we authorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we must take into account the needs of businesses, and small businesses in particular. To that end, locally-driven initiatives are crucial. In order to create jobs, we must encourage small business expansion and foster small business entrepreneurship, and I believe that education initiatives are key to this. 
   Under the Small Business Employment and Education Enhancement Act, the Department of Education would disseminate information and facilitate the sharing of information designed to assist small businesses in working with school systems to improve our education institutions. For example, the agency would publish guidance materials, best practices, checklists and other materials on the World Wide Web, in Department of Education publications and articles, letters, links to related World Wide Web sites, public service announcements, and through other means at the Department's disposal. 
   The Department of Education would establish a centralized database of materials and act as a clearinghouse for information on 
   initiatives that have proven successful. 
   The Secretary of the Department of Education would also establish an Office of Small Business Education to promote efforts to address the needs of small businesses through education programs. This division would work to remove any existing impediments to partnerships between school systems and small businesses, and propose solutions to education-related problems facing small businesses. 
   The goal of the bill I am introducing today is to facilitate partnerships between communities and businesses. I believe it should be easy for communities that are interested in designing business/school partnerships to get the information they need on how to do so. With access to kinds of sources envisioned in this legislation, communities would be able to model a program after a proven approach. 
   In addition, my bill authorizes technical assistance to be administered by the Office of Small Business Education to be used to provide guidance to small businesses, small business organizations, schools systems, and communities working cooperatively to enhance the teaching of basic skills. 
   The bill would also establish tax credits to encourage companies to provide work study, internship, or fellowship opportunities for students and teachers. 
   Finally, the bill includes a provision directing the Department of Education to conduct a study and report to Congress on the challenges facing small businesses in obtaining workers with adequate skills; an assessment of the impact on small businesses of the skills shortage; the costs to small businesses associated with this shortage; and the recommendations for the Secretary on how to address these challenges. 
   Mr. President, I hope this legislation will provide a foundation for cooperative initiatives between small businesses and school systems, and I look forward to working with the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and others as we prepare to reauthorize the elementary and secondary education act.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the S. 2346--legislation that would dramatically reduce one of the most insidious aspects of the tax code: the marriage penalty. 
   Mr. President, as my colleagues are aware, there are several primary causes of the ``marriage penalty"within the tax code, including different tax rate schedules and different standard deductions for joint filers versus single filers. 
   In terms of the impact of these differing tax provisions, the marriage penalty is most pronounced for two-earner couples in which the husband and wife have nearly equal incomes. While this may not have been as noticeable in society 30 or 40 years ago, the demographic changes that have occurred since the 1960s--with more married women entering the workforce to help support their families--has led to a significant increase in the share of couples who suffer from the marriage penalty. 
   Mr. President, make no mistake, the impact of the marriage penalty is severe. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), 42% of married couples incur marriage penalties that average nearly $1,400. 
   When measured by income category, fully 12% of couples with incomes below $20,000 incurred a marriage penalty in 1996; 44% of couples with incomes of $20,000 to $50,0000; and 55% of couples with incomes above $50,000. 
   In addition, according to CBO, empirical evidence suggests that the marriage penalty may affect work patterns, particularly for a couple's second earner. Specifically, because filing a joint return often imposes a substantially higher tax rate on a couple's second earner, the higher rate reduces the second earner's after-tax wage and may cause that individual to work fewer hours or not at all. As a result, economic efficiency is harmed in the overall economy. 
   Furthermore, while I would hope that the tax code would not be a factor in a couple's decision to marry or stay single, the simple fact is that a couple's tax status could worsen if married and could, therefore, impact a couple's decision to marry. Therefore, we should eliminate this potential barrier to marriage and ensure that couples make one of life's biggest decisions based on their values and beliefs--not on the federal tax code. 
   Mr. President, as a strong opponent of the marriage penalty, I am an original cosponsor of S. 15, legislation introduced by Senator HUTCHISON that eliminates the marriage penalty through a proposal known as ``income splitting.'' Under this approach, a married couple would add up all their income and then split it in half. Each spouse would then file as a single individual and pay taxes on his or her half of the total income, with exemptions, deductions and credits being split evenly between the two spouses. 
   Last year, to advance this legislation or any other proposal that would provide marriage penalty relief, I offered an amendment during the markup of the FY 2000 budget resolution that ensured a significant reduction in--or the  outright elimination of--the marriage penalty would be a central component of any tax cut package adopted during last year's reconciliation process. 
   Later that summer, in accordance with my budget amendment, the $792 billion tax cut reconciliation package that was passed by the Senate last summer included such relief, as did the final House-Senate conference report. However, just as President Clinton vetoed the tax bill 
   in 1995 that included marriage penalty relief, last year's tax bill was vetoed as well. 
   In an effort to address this issue outside a broader tax package, the House of Representatives passed legislation earlier this year--by a bipartisan vote of 268 to 158--that would reduce the marriage penalty. 
   Now, in the Senate, we are considering stand-alone legislation that would dramatically reduce the marriage penalty by doubling the standard deduction for married couples relative to single filers; expanding the 15 percent and 28 percent income tax brackets for married couples to twice the size of the corresponding tax brackets for single filers; increasing the phase-out range of the Earned Income Credit (EIC) for couples filing joint returns; and permanently exempting family tax credits from the individual Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). 
   Mr. President, it is my hope that, by considering this package of marriage penalty relief proposals as a stand-alone bill--and not as part of a broader, and potentially controversial, tax cut package--we will not only pass this legislation prior to ``tax day'' on April 17, but ultimately send a bill to the President that he will sign for the benefit of all married couples. 
   The bottom line is that we should not condone or accept a tax code that penalizes married couples or discourages marriage, and this bill provides the Senate with the opportunity to correct this inequity in a straightforward manner. 
   Ultimately, this bill is not simply about providing the American people with a reasonable and rational tax cut--rather, it is about correcting a gross discrepancy in the tax code that unfairly impacts married couples. Accordingly, even though individual members of this body disagree on a wide variety of tax cuts policies, I would hope we would all agree that the act of marriage should not be penalized by the Internal Revenue Code--and would support the proposal before us accordingly. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the conference report on the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution and to highlight a reserve fund that Senator DOMENICI has been referring to with respect to a new prescription drug benefit. 
   In advance, I would like to thank the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee for his unwavering commitment to a balanced budget and fiscally responsible decisionmaking over the years. Thanks to his leadership and efforts, the turbulent waves of annual deficits and mounting debt have certainly been calmed. And if we adhere to the principles as contained in this year's budget resolution, and retain these principles in the years to come, clearly, we will have provided security for many generations. 
   The conference report we are now considering not only maintains fiscal discipline but it also ensures that critical priorities are protected in fiscal year 2001 and beyond, which is the purpose of the balanced budget: to be able to provide a constraint on Federal spending but at the same time determine how best to invest in the future. 
   I commend the chairman of the Budget Committee for having taken the step last year to protect every dollar that belongs to the Social Security trust fund and devoting it solely to reducing the publicly held debt. Ultimately, this commitment and this conference report will ensure that we reduce the publicly-held debt by approximately $1 trillion over the next 5 years and eliminate it entirely by the year 2013. Clearly, it is a paradigm shift, not only with respect to the fact we are no longer using surpluses that belong to Social Security, but also the fact that we are able to reduce the publicly held debt and make a commitment to protecting Social Security. 
   The second issue in this budget that is critically important is that we are making investments where we should be making investments for the future--in education, health care, child care, and defense. In addition, this budget provides modest tax relief. The American people do deserve tax relief, given the burdens they have faced over the years to achieve debt reduction, and the constraints we have had to adhere to over this last decade. Certainly they deserve to have a piece of that pie through the elimination of the marriage tax penalty, through a deduction for college tuition expenses and a credit for the interest paid on student loans. Those are the priorities that could be accommodated in this conference report that the American people deserve. I think they are the right priorities. 
   Third, as the chairman of the committee has indicated, we have now included and have taken a giant step forward in ensuring our Nation's seniors have a prescription drug benefit program. Senator WYDEN, Senator SMITH, and I offered an amendment in the committee that would have laid out a bifurcated approach that would provide a down-payment of $20 billion for a new benefit in the first 3 years, and $20 billion in years 2004 and 2005 contingent on Congress moving forward on Medicare reform. Of importance, the initial down-payment of $20 billion would allow us to move forward in creating a new benefit this year with or without Medicare reform--and that structure has been retained in this conference report. 
   We also included a date certain by which the Senate Finance Committee would be required to report a new prescription drug benefit bill. If that date was not met, we would be able to proceed with the stand-alone prescription drug benefit on the floor. That time certain was dropped. 
   But the fact of the matter is, the conference report retains the reserve fund language, and we still have the ability to create a stand-alone prescription drug benefit this year. As a result, the Senate Finance Committee still has $20 billion available to develop a prescription drug benefit program for our Nation's seniors that is not contingent on Medicare reform or other legislation--and an additional $20 billion will be made available if they proceed with broader Medicare reform. 
   Accordingly, I thank Chairman DOMENICI for his efforts in ensuring that provision would be included in the conference report. The significance of it is twofold. One is that we have $20 billion that would be immediately available for such a benefit. As a result, this reserve fund gives us the opening we need to consider and pass a prescription drug benefit program this year. Furthermore, it not only provides a downpayment for such a benefit over the next 5 years, but it also provides an additional $20 billion if we move forward reach a consensus on Medicare reform. This total allotment of $40 billion over the coming five years is more than was contained in the Chairman's mark, and even more than was provided in the President's own budget proposal for a prescription drug benefit. 
   There are no caveats, there are no conditions. The Senate Finance Committee has the ability to proceed with a comprehensive Medicare reform package. But in the event they cannot grapple with this issue, if they fail to reach a consensus and Congress fails to reach a consensus, we can proceed and enact a prescription drug benefit program. 
   So the overall structure of this fund is the same as it was when we offered it as an amendment during the markup, as it was supported unanimously by Republicans and Democrats on the Budget Committee. As a result, it provides the Finance Committee with both the means and the motivation to act on this legislation in a timely manner. 
   In conclusion, I again applaud the efforts of the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, for preserving the essential structure of this reserve fund which enables the Senate and the Congress to create a prescription drug benefit in a timely fashion. I congratulate him because this is a significant step forward and gives us the opportunity, for the first time in a  very long time, to enact this very significant and critical benefit for our Nation's seniors. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Child Protection/Alcohol and Drug Partnership Act.'' I am pleased to be joined by my good friends, Senators ROCKEFELLER, DEWINE, and DODD on this exciting new proposal. Mr. President, this bill is an enormously important piece of legislation. It provides the means for states to support some of our most vulnerable families--families who are struggling with alcohol and drug abuse, and the children who are being raised in these abusive homes. 
   It is obvious, both anecdotally and statistically, that child welfare is significantly impacted by parental substance abuse. And it makes a lot of sense to fund state programs to address these two issues in tandem. The real question in designing and supporting child welfare programs is how can we--public policy makers, government officials, welfare agencies--honestly expect to improve child welfare without appropriately and adequately addressing the root problems affecting these children's lives? 
   We know that substance abuse is the primary ingredient in child abuse and neglect. Most studies find that between one-third and two-thirds--and some say as high as 80 percent to 90 percent--of children in the child welfare system come from families where parental substance abuse is a contributing factor. 
   The Child Protection/Alcohol and Drug Partnership Act of 2000 creates a new five-year $1.9 billion state block grant program to address the connection between substance abuse and child welfare. Payments would be made to promote joint activities among federal, state, and local public child welfare and alcohol and drug prevention and treatment agencies. Our underlying belief, and the point of this bill, is to encourage existing agencies to work together to keep children safe. 
   HHS will award grants to States and Indian tribes to encourage programs for families who are known to the child welfare system and have alcohol and drug abuse problems. These grants will forge new and necessary partnerships between the child protection agencies and the alcohol and drug prevention and treatment agencies in States so they will work together to provide services for this unique population. The program is designed to increase the capacity of both the child welfare and alcohol and drug systems to comprehensively address the needs of these families to improve child safety, family stability, and permanence, and to promote recovery from alcohol and drug problems. 
   Statistics paint an unhappy picture for children of substance abusing parents: a 1998 report by the National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse found that 36 states reported that parental substance abuse and poverty are the top two problems exhibited by families reported for child maltreatment. And a 1997 survey conducted by the Child Welfare League of America found that at least 52 percent of placements into out-of-home care were due in part to parental substance abuse. 
   Children whose parents abuse alcohol and other drugs are almost three times likelier to be abused and more than four times likelier to be neglected than children of parents who are not substance abusers. Children in alcohol-abusing families were nearly four times more likely to be maltreated overall, almost five times more likely to be physically neglected, and 10 times more likely to be emotionally neglected than children in families without alcohol problems. 
   A 1994 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that children prenatally exposed to substances have been found to be two to three times more likely to be abused than non-exposed children. And as many as 80 percent of prenatally drug exposed infants will come to the attention of child welfare before their first  birthday. Abused and neglected children under age six face the risk of more severe damage than older children because their brains and neurological systems are still developing. 
   Unfortunately, child welfare agencies estimate that only a third of the 67 percent of the parents who need drug or alcohol prevention and treatment services actually get help today. 
   Mr. President, this bill is about preventing problems. Senators ROCKEFELLER, DEWINE, DODD, and I know that what is most important here is the safety and well-being of America's children. We expect much of our youth because they are the future of our nation. In turn, we must be willing to give them the support they need to learn and grow, so that they can lead healthy and productive lives. 
   In 1997 Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act, authored by the late Senator John CHAFEE. The 1997 Adoption law promotes safety, stability, and permanence for all abused and neglected children and requires timely decision-making in all proceedings to determine whether children can safely return home, or whether they should be moved to permanent, adoptive homes. Specifically, the law requires a State to ensure that services are provided to the families of children who are at risk, so that children can remain safely with their families or return home after being in foster care. 
   The bill we are introducing today identifies a very specific area in which families and children need services--substance abuse. And it will ensure that states have the funding necessary to provide services as required under the Adoption and Safe Families Act.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the Worker Economic Employment Opportunity Act. Mr. President, every time we turn around it seems that we hear about how strong our nation's economy is right now--and how America's workers are daily facing new-found employment opportunities. We are in a period of almost unprecedented prosperity and sustained economic growth. And the bill we are voting on today is a direct consequence of that growth. 
   It wasn't long ago that benefits such as stock options were available only to the upper levels of management. Companies are now offering stock options as a way not only to attract, but to retain quality employees at all levels. This is a way of providing fairness to our nations workers--the ones who manage the daily ins-and-outs of the business, the ones who have quite literally built today's economy.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the motion to proceed to invoke cloture on S. 2285, the Federal Fuels Tax Holiday Act of 2000, a bill introduced by Senator LOTT, which I have been pleased to cosponsor. 
   This legislation will repeal, until the end of this year, the 4.3 cent-per-gallon increase to the federal excise tax on gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and aviation fuel added by the Clinton Administration in 1993. 
   At the same time, both the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airways Trust Fund are held completely harmless. It is a bogus argument that the Trust Funds will be impacted by giving consumers a tax break at the gas pump. The progress of important highway and airport projects will not be affected because the impact would be zero. This legislation allows for reimbursement of the Trust Funds that are financed by the gasoline and aviation fuel taxes. For both of these funds, any lost revenues to be replaced from the budget surplus. 
   Also, our legislation is set up so that should the national average for regular unleaded gasoline prices breach the $2 mark, it would also repeal, until the end of the year, the 18.3 cent-per-gallon federal gasoline tax; the 24.3 cent-per-gallon excise tax on highway diesel fuel and kerosene; the 4.3 cents per-gallon railroad diesel fuel; the 24.3 cent-per-gallon excise tax on inland waterway fuel; the 19.3 cent-per-gallon for noncommercial aviation gasoline; the 21.8 cent-per-gallon for noncommercial jet fuel; and 4.3 cents-per-gallon for commercial aviation fuel. 
   This will provide the nation with a vital ``circuit breaker'' in the midst of the very real possibility of high fuel costs as America takes to the road this summer--and the legislation ensures that any savings will truly be passed on to consumers and not pocketed before customers can benefit from any savings at the pump. 
   Some of my colleagues say that repealing the 4.3 cent per gallon gas tax will not amount to enough savings for the consumers to even care about. Well, I guess people in Maine think differently, especially after a winter of paying the highest prices in decades for both home heating oil and for fuel at the pump. 
   This past week, the Maine legislature, both the Senate by a vote of 26-9, and the House, by a vote of 94-54, endorsed a bill that allows for rebates to truckers for the state diesel fuel taxes they paid between February 1 and March 15 when diesel fuel prices skyrocketed to over $2.00 per gallon. While the funding decision now rests with the appropriators, the Maine legislature has spoken clearly that they know it makes a difference, especially where the trucking industry is concerned. 
   I am aware of a trucking company in Maine that has lost at least $200,000 in the last three months because of the failed energy policy of this Administration that caused diesel prices to spike. How can an owner buy equipment, hire people, keep his trucks rolling, and function within a set budget for the year with losses such as these? Tell him that temporary repeal of the federal 4.3 cent tax on diesel fuel won't make a difference. Well, let's run the numbers. 
   This company has a fleet of about 50 trucks that take 200 gallons of diesel every time you fill them up, and since these large rigs get no more than five miles to the gallon, they get filled up quite regularly. So, if we temporarily repeal even just the 4.3 cent federal gas tax, every time the fleet of trucks gets filled up, the company will be able to save at least $430, adding up to thousands of dollars a month. No wonder hundreds of truckers drove their rigs to Washington, D.C. to protest on two different occasions in the past month. Tell them that a temporary repeal of 4.3 cents per gallon diesel fuel tax won't make a difference. 
   Look to your own states--California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, New York, Wisconsin--all around the country state legislatures are considering their own responses to the rise in all fuel prices. 
   In California, there is a proposal for a four-month suspension of the 15 cent per gallon state tax. In Connecticut, the Legislature's Finance Committee unanimously approved a seven cent per gallon state gasoline tax over a three-year period. In New York, both parties have called for some sort of state gas tax relief. In Illinois, the State Senate has approved an elimination of the five percent sales tax on gasoline and diesel fuel. Lawmakers in Wisconsin have proposed both repealing or temporarily suspending the state gas tax. 
   In Florida, the Republican House Speaker has proposed a 10 cents per gallon tax cut, saying, ``If the federal government is not going to help the people of Florida, then we need to''. 
   What this legislation before you today does is take a concrete step toward more reasonable fuel prices for everyone, helping to serve as a buffer for consumers and businesses who are already reeling from the high cost of gasoline and other fuels. Of course, I hope the provisions for temporary repeal of the full tax will not be necessary. But if they are, they will provide immediate relief to taxpayers and ensure that, if prices are skyrocketing, any savings in fuel costs will be passed on to the purchasers of the gasoline products. 
   The retail price we pay for refined petroleum products for gasoline, diesel fuel, and home heating oil, for instance, substantially depends upon the cost of crude oil to refiners. We have seen a barrel of crude oil climb to over $34.00 recently from a price of $10.50 in February of 1999. That is a 145 percent increase. 
   While OPEC agreed last month to only very modest increases in crude oil production, White House officials say that the cost of gasoline at the pump will now decline in the coming months, even though their own Economic Advisor Gene Sperling was quoted in the Washington Post on March 29, as warning that ``there is still 
   significant and inherent uncertainty in the oil market, particularly with such low inventories, and we will continue to monitor the situation very closely''. 
   While the Administration has ``monitored'' the situation, crude oil prices have gone up and up, and our inventories have gone down and down. As a matter of fact, the Administration admits that it was ``caught napping'' after OPEC decided to decrease production in March of 1999--and while they napped through a long winter's sleep, prices for crude climbed as temperatures and inventories plummeted. 
   The effect on gasoline, diesel and home heating oil was predictable, and in fact was predicted. Last October--a half a year ago--the Department of Energy, in its 1999-2000 Winter Fuels Outlook, projected a 44 percent increase in home heating oil bills. In a severe winter, the agency estimated, an additional 28 percent increase in costs could be felt for residential customers. 
   In other words, the Department of Energy itself predicted an increase of over 70 percent, but did nothing. In actuality, home heating oil costs jumped from a fairly consistent national of 86 cents per gallon in the winter of 1998-99 to as high as $2.08 per gallon in Maine early last month--an increase of well over 100 percent. In that same time frame, conventional gasoline prices rose 70 percent or higher. 
   So now the Administration tells us that gasoline prices will most likely go down by this summer because of the small production increases agreed to by OPEC. Even with an increase in OPEC quotas, there will still be a shortfall in meeting worldwide demand for crude oil. Approximately 76.3 million barrels per day are needed to meet demand, but the anticipated new OPEC production is estimated to be only 75.3 million barrels per day. So you'll have to excuse me if I'm a little hesitant accepting estimates from an Administration that seems to make predictions while their gauge is on empty. 
   The Administration's projections of an average of $1.46 per gallon for gasoline this summer--which is still 25 percent higher than last summer I might add--does not presume production disruptions at the refinery. I would like to point out that one of the reasons prices went up and supply ran dangerously low a few months ago was the unexpected shutdown of four different refineries that serve the Northeast.  
   Just last week, DOE's Energy Information Administration stated that, ``..... motor gasoline markets are projected to exhibit an extraordinarily tight supply/demand balance.'' Against this backdrop, we cannot depend upon the Administration's predictions turning into fact, when they have so far been so incorrect. 
   Now is the time for Congress to act, even if the Administration refuses to. I want to at least make sure that American businesspeople and consumers have in their pockets what they would have otherwise paid in fuel taxes if the Administration is underestimating prices once again and gasoline hits $2.00 a gallon. 
   Beyond the pump, consumers are getting hit with extra costs directly attributable to high fuel costs. If you've paid to send an overnight package lately, you probably noted that you were charged a surcharge--a fuel fee--because their cost of diesel fuel has increased by about 60 percent over the past year. And with a 150 percent increase in jet fuel, that airline ticket you buy today will probably include something you've never seen before--a fuel charge of $20.00. How long will it be before costs of other products will also be passed on the consumer? 
   Consider the impacts to the nations' farmers. In some locations, the planting season has begun. The New York Times reported two weeks ago that a farmer paying 40 cents a gallon more this year to fuel his diesel tractors and combines, will be adding as much as $240 a day to his harvesting costs. In my home State of Maine, we are at the peak season for moving last year's potato crop out of storage and to the large Eastern markets. But the industry still can't get truckers to come into the State to move the potatoes because they are discouraged by the particularly higher price of diesel in Maine. 
   The only help the potato industry has had recently in getting their product to market was certainly not due to the energy policy of this Administration, but to local truckers who turned to hauling potatoes because wet weather kept them away from taking timber out of the Maine woods. 
   Soon, we will enter the summer months, when tourism is particularly important to the economy of New England and to Maine in particular. With the high price of gasoline, we need relief now, and that's what this bill provides. As a matter of fact, we could have used the relief in Northern Maine a few months ago--that's a big tourist season for them as snowmobilers from all over the East head to Maine to use the hundreds of miles of trails throughout the northern part of the State. 
   The choices are clear--do nothing for the taxpayers who are being gouged by failed energy policies, or do something by supporting legislation that gives some relief at the gas pump right now. We should temporarily repeal the 4.3 cent per gallon gas tax and support a bill that also acts as a circuit breaker, giving citizens a break at the gas pump if gas goes over $2.00 a gallon while protecting the Trust Funds that build our highways and airports. I urge my colleagues to support this bill by voting for cloture.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today marks an historic point for the Senate. Not only did the Federal Government last year experience a balanced Federal budget without the use of the Social Security surplus for the first time since 1960, but we are now considering a budget resolution that will ensure we have a balanced Federal budget without the use of the Social Security surplus for three consecutive years--the first time this has happened since 1947 to 1949--and that takes us one step further on the path to actually eliminating our Nation's publicly-held debt by the year 2013. 
   Needless to say, such a change in the way the Government does business is not only a significant step for the Senate and the Congress, but a welcome relief to a generation of Americans who have become all too accustomed to the terms ``deficit'' and ``debt.'' 
   Mr. President, in light of the non-Social Security budget surpluses we are now enjoying, I thank the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, PETE DOMENICI, for his unwavering commitment to a balanced budget and fiscally responsible decision-making over the years. Thanks, in part, to his leadership and efforts, the turbulent waves of annual deficits and mounting debt have been temporarily calmed. And, if we are willing to adhere to these principles in this year's budget resolution and others yet to come, we may be able to maintain the current budgetary calm for many years in the future. 
   The budget resolution reported by the Senate Budget Committee--and that we are now considering on the floor--not only maintains fiscal discipline, but it also ensures that critical priorities are protected and addressed in fiscal year 2001 and beyond. 
   Specifically, the Senate budget resolution contains the following key provisions: 
   First, it protects every penny of the Social Security surplus in upcoming years by devoting it solely to reducing publicly-held debt. 
   Second, through an amendment I offered in the Budget Committee markup with Senator WYDEN and Senator SMITH (OR), provides a ``down-payment'' for a new Medicare prescription drug benefit, while ensuring a strong impetus for much-needed, comprehensive Medicare reforms. 
   Third, it provides a fiscally responsible increase in Federal spending, while targeting funds for critically needed priorities including education and defense. 
   Fourth, it provides tax relief for Americans at a time when the typical family's tax burden exceeds the cost of food, clothing, and shelter combined. And as a result of another amendment I offered during markup, it places tax relief for higher education tuition paid and for interest paid on student loans as a top priority in any tax cut package that is ultimately crafted. When considering that the cost of college has risen twice as fast as inflation and eight times as fast as median household incomes over the past 20 years--and students borrowed more during the 1990s than during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s combined--I can think of no tax cut that would be more appropriate in any upcoming tax package. 
   Collectively, I believe these principles and priorities reflect those of most Americans--especially the protection of Social Security's monies. Accordingly, I believe this resolution deserves broad bipartisan support in the Senate and, ultimately, by the entire Congress. 
   To truly appreciate what is contained in this budget resolution, I believe it is appropriate to compare it with the only other major proposal on the table: the budget proposal put forth by President Clinton in early-February. 
   Specifically, as we have learned from CBO's analysis of his budget, President Clinton has proposed $1.3 trillion in new spending over the coming 10 years. This new spending--of which $866 billion would be for discretionary spending program--would utilize 70 percent of the projected on-budget surpluses over this period of time. 
   Furthermore, despite his initial claim of providing working Americans with a tax cut of $250 billion over the coming 10 years, we now know that the President's budget not only increases taxes by $5 billion in FY 2001, but he only cuts taxes by $4 billion over the coming five years and $146 billion over 10 years, representing eight percent of the projected on-budget surpluses, and the net result is far below his original proposal of a $250 billion tax cut! 
   In contrast, the Senate budget resolution provides a strong, but fiscally-responsible, increase in discretionary spending of $27 billion next year--a 4.6 percent 
   increase from the current fiscal year--and $125 billion over the coming five years. Furthermore, the resolution also provides a tax cut of up to $13 billion in FY 2001 and up to $150 billion over the coming five years--an amount that ensures for every dollar in tax relief, there will be $13 in debt reduction. 
   Finally, the Senate resolution contains a provision I authored with Senators WYDEN and SMITH (OR) that will be critical to our efforts to move forward on an issue of critical importance to our nation's seniors: a reserve fund that will provide up to $40 billion for a new Medicare prescription drug benefit. In contrast, the President's budget would provide less than $30 billion for such a benefit over the coming five years. 
   As my colleagues are aware, the need for a new Medicare prescription drug benefit could not be more clear. When Medicare was created in 1965 it followed the private health insurance model of the time--inpatient health care. Today, thirty-five years later it is sadly out of date and it is time to bring Medicare back to the future by providing our seniors with prescription drug coverage.  
   The lack of a prescription drug coverage benefit is the biggest hole--a black hole really--in the Medicare system. HCFA will tell you that up to 69 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have drug coverage from other sources--but that number simply doesn't tell the whole story. 
   Specifically, ten percent of Medicare beneficiaries get drug coverage from one of the three Medigap policies that cover drugs. Two of these policies require a $250 deductible and then only cover 50 percent of the cost of the drug with a $1,250 cap. You can run up that cap pretty fast with today's drug prices. The third policy provides a cap of $3,000 but the premium ranges anywhere from $1,699 to $3,171 depending on where you live. That is a significant amount of money for someone living on a fixed income. 
   An estimated 8 percent get drug coverage from participating in Medicare HMOs and another 11 percent receive coverage from Medicaid. Of course to do that, they must be very low-income to begin with and may have to spend a great deal out of pocket for their drugs--what we commonly refer to as spending down--before they are eligible in a given year for coverage. Finally there are those lucky enough--31 percent--to have employer sponsored drug coverage through their retiree program. 
   In my view, a solution to the pressing problem of prescription drug coverage can't come soon enough. Drug coverage should be part and parcel of the Medicare system, not a patchwork system where some get coverage and some don't. Prescription drug coverage shouldn't be a ``fringe benefit'' available only to those wealthy enough or poor enough to obtain coverage, it should be part and parcel of the Medicare system that will see today's seniors, and tomorrow's into the 21st Century. 
   Accordingly, during the markup of the Senate budget resolution, I offered an amendment--along with Senators WYDEN and GORDON SMITH--that ensures the Congress can move forward in creating a prescription drug benefit before we adjourn this fall, while still providing a strong impetus for comprehensive Medicare reform. Specifically, the reserve fund we offered not only provides a ``down-payment'' of $20 billion for such a benefit over the coming three years, but it provides an additional $20 billion in years four and five if Congress moves forward on legislation that extends the solvency of the Medicare program without any gimmicks. Furthermore, it ensures that the Finance Committee has ample time--until September 1, to be exact--to craft a new benefit that utilizes the $20 billion ``down-payment'' prior to these monies being freed-up for stand-alone proposals on the floor. 
   Why is this reserve fund and its structure so important? Put simply, by providing a ``down-payment'' on a new prescription drug benefit over the coming three years--but by linking the long-term funding of the benefit to substantive reforms--my amendment ensures that a benefit can be crafted immediately without undercutting the long-term reform effort. In fact, by linking the extension of this new benefit to actual reforms, my amendment serves as a strong impetus for reform as no member of Congress would want to risk having such a benefit expire due to a failure to act on broader reforms. 
   Ultimately, I believe this reserve fund--which was adopted by voice vote in the Budget Committee--will serve as a catalyst for the most important changes to the Medicare program since its inception, both in terms of creating a much-needed new benefit and in terms of enacting comprehensive reforms. 
   By maintaining fiscal discipline, protecting Social Security surpluses, buying down debt, providing funds for a Medicare prescription drug benefit, and enhancing funding for shared priorities such as education, I believe the Senate budget resolution deserves strong support by the full Senate. 
   Ultimately, while Members from either side of the aisle may disagree with specific provisions in the resolution that has been crafted, the simple fact is that this is a budget framework--or ``blueprint''--that establishes parameters and priorities, but is not the final word on these individual decisions. Rather, specific spending and tax decisions will initially be made in the Appropriations and Finance Committees, and ultimately by Members on the floor. 
   Therefore, I am hopeful that amendments offered to this framework do not harm the broad and reasoned parameters that have been set, and commend the Chairman DOMENICI, again, for his efforts in crafting this balanced resolution.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the motion to proceed to invoke cloture on S. 2285, the Federal Fuels Tax Holiday Act of 2000, a bill introduced by Senator LOTT which I have been pleased to cosponsor. 
   This legislation will repeal, until the end of this year, the 4.3 cent-per-gallon increase to the federal excise tax on gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and aviation fuel added by the Clinton Administration in 1993. 
   Also, our legislation is set up so that should the national average for regular unleaded gasoline prices breach the $2 mark, it would also repeal, until the end of the year, the 18.3 cent-per-gallon federal gasoline tax; the 24.3 cent-per-gallon excise tax on highway diesel fuel and kerosene; the 4.3 cents per-gallon railroad diesel fuel; the 24.3 cent-per-gallon excise tax on inland waterway fuel; the 19.3 cent-per-gallon for noncommercial aviation gasoline; the 21.8 cent-per-gallon for noncommercial jet fuel; and 4.3 cents-per-gallon for commercial aviation fuel. 
   This will provide the nation with a vital ``circuit breaker'' in the midst of the very real possibility of skyrocketing fuel costs as America takes to the road this summer--and the legislation ensures that any savings will truly be passed on to consumers and not pocketed before customers can benefit from the savings at the pump. 
   Some of my colleagues say this will not amount to enough savings for the consumers to even care about. Well, I guess my constituents in Maine are more thrifty than others, especially after a winter of paying the highest prices in decades for both home heating oil and high gas prices at the pump. 
   At the same time, it allows reimbursement of the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by the gasoline tax, and the Airport and Airways Trust Fund, financed by the aviation fuel tax. Both these funds are held completely harmless, with any lost revenues to be replaced from the budget surplus. No one should have any concerns about the impact this bill would have on the progress of important highway and airport projects because the impact would be zero. 
   This legislation takes a concrete step toward more reasonable fuel prices, helping to serve as a buffer for consumers who are already reeling from the high cost of gasoline and other fuels. Of course, I hope the provisions for temporary repeal of the full tax will not be necessary. But if they are, they will provide immediate relief to taxpayers and ensure that, if prices are skyrocketing, any savings in fuel costs will be passed on to consumers. 
   The retail price we pay for refined petroleum products for gasoline, diesel fuel, and home heating oil, for instance, substantially depends upon the cost of crude oil to refiners. We have seen a barrel of crude oil climb to over $35.00 recently from a price of $10.50 in February of 1999. That is a 145 percent increase. And while OPEC agreed this week to only very modest increases in crude oil production, White House officials say that the cost of gasoline at the pump will now decline in the coming months, even 
   though their own Economic Advisor Gene Sperling was quoted in the Washington Post on March 29, as warning that ``there is still significant and inherent uncertainty in the oil market, particularly with such low inventories, and we will continue to monitor the situation very closely''. 
   Mr. President, while the Administration has ``monitored'' the situation, crude oil prices have gone up and up,  and our inventories went down. As a matter of fact, the Administration admits that it was ``caught napping'' after OPEC decided to decrease production in March of 1999--and while they napped through a long winter's sleep, prices for crude climbed as temperatures plummeted. 
   The effect on gasoline, diesel and home heating oil was predictable, and in fact was predicted. Last October--a half a year ago--the Department of Energy, in its 1999-2000 Winter Fuels Outlook, projected a 44 percent increase in home heating oil bills. In a severe winter, the agency estimated, an additional 28 percent increase in costs could be felt for residential customers. 
   In other words, the Department of Energy itself predicted an increase of over 70 percent, but did nothing. In actuality, home heating oil costs jumped from a fairly consistent national of 86 cents per gallon in the winter of 1998-99 to as high as $2.08 per gallon in Maine early last month--an increase of well over 100 percent. And, in that same time frame, conventional gasoline prices have risen 70 percent or higher. 
   So now the Administration tells us that gasoline prices will most likely go down by this summer because of the small production increases agreed to by OPEC. Well, even with an increase in OPEC quotas, there will still be a shortfall in meeting worldwide demand for crude oil. Approximately 76.3 million barrels per day are needed to meet demand, but the anticipated new OPEC production is estimated to be only 75.3 million barrels per day. So you'll have to excuse me if I'm a little hesitant accepting estimates from an Administration that seems to make predictions by gazing into a crystal ball. I want to at least make sure that Americans have in their pockets what they would have otherwise paid in fuel taxes if the Administration underestimates prices once again and gasoline hits $2.00 a gallon. 
   Beyond the pump, consumers are getting hit with extra costs directly attributable to high fuel costs. If you've paid to send an overnight package lately, you probably noted that you were charged a fuel fee, because their cost of diesel fuel has increased by about 60 percent over the past year. And with a 150 percent increase in jet fuel, that airline ticket you buy today will probably include something you've never seen before--a fuel charge of $20.00. How long will it be before costs of other products will also be passed on the consumer? 
   And, consider the impacts to the nations' farmers. The New York Times reported just this past Wednesday that a farmer paying 40 cents a gallon more this year to fuel his diesel tractors and combines is adding as much as $240 a day to his harvesting costs. In my home state of Maine, we are at the peak season for moving last year's potato crop out of storage and to the large Eastern markets. But the industry can't get truckers to come into the State to move the potatoes because they are discouraged by the particularly high price of diesel in Maine. 
   The only help the potato industry has had recently in getting their product to market has certainly not been due to the energy policy of this Administration, but to local truckers who have turned to hauling potatoes because the recent wet weather has kept them away from taking timber out of the Maine woods. 
   Soon, we will enter the summer months, when tourism is particularly important to the economy of New England and to Maine in particular. With gas prices climbing even higher, we need relief now, and that's what this bill provides. 
   Mr. President, the choices are clear--do nothing for the taxpayers who are being gouged by failed energy policies, or do something by supporting legislation that acts as a circuit breaker that gives citizens a break at the gas pump, protects the Trust Funds that build our highways and airports, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and I yield the floor.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of S.J. Res. 14, I am proud to rise in support of the proposed constitutional amendment granting Congress the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States. Last June, the House of Representatives passed an identical resolution by the requisite two-thirds vote margin, so I urge that my colleagues in the Senate also pass this resolution with similar bipartisan support and send the proposed amendment to the states for ratification. 
   Our flag occupies a truly unique place in the hearts of millions of citizens as a cherished symbol of freedom and democracy. As a national emblem of the world's greatest democracy, the American flag should be treated with respect and care. Our free speech rights do not entitle us to simply consider the flag as ``personal property'', which can be treated any way we see fit including physically desecrating it as a legitimate form of political protest. 
   We debate this issue at a very special and important time in our nation's history. 
   This year marks the 55th anniversary of the allies' victory in the Second World War. And, fifty-nine years ago, Japanese planes launched an attack on Pearl Harbor that would begin American participation in the Second World War. 
   During that conflict, our proud marines climbed to the top of Mount Suribachi in one of the most bloody battles of the war. No less than 6,855 men died to put our American flag on  the mountain. The sacrifice of the brave American soldiers who gave their life on behalf of their country can never be forgotten. This honor and dedication to country, duty, freedom and justice is enshrined in the symbol of our Nation--the American flag. 
   The flag is not just a visual symbol to us--it is a symbol whose pattern and colors tell a story that rings true for each and every American. 
   The 50 stars and 13 stripes on the flag are a reminder that our nation is built on the unity and harmony of 50 states. And the colors of our flag were not chosen randomly: red was selected because it represents courage, bravery, and the willingness of the American people to give their life for their country and its principles of freedom and democracy; white was selected because it represents integrity and purity; and blue because it represents vigilance, perseverance, and justice. 
   Thus, this flag has become a source of inspiration to every American wherever it is displayed. 
   For these reasons and many others, a great majority of Americans believe--as I strongly do--that the American flag should be treated with dignity, respect and care--and nothing less. 
   Unfortunately, not everyone shares this view. 
   In June of 1990, the Supreme Court ruled that the Flag Protection Act of 1989, legislation adopted by the Congress in 1989 generally prohibiting physical defilement or desecration of the flag, was unconstitutional. This decision, a 5-4 ruling in U.S. v. Eichman, held that burning the flag as a political protest was constitutionally-protected free speech. 
   The Flag Protection Act had originally been adopted by the 101st Congress after the Supreme Court ruled in Texas v. Johnson that existing Federal and state laws prohibiting flag-burning were unconstitutional because they violated the first amendment's provisions regarding free speech. 
   I profoundly disagreed with both rulings the Supreme Court made on this issue. In our modern society, there are still many different forums in our mass media, television, newspapers and radio and the like, through which citizens can freely and fully exercise their legitimate, constitutional right to free speech, even if what they have to say is overwhelmingly unpopular with a majority of American citizens. 
   Accordingly, in 1995, I also joined as an original cosponsor of a proposed constitutional amendment granting Congress the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States. Although the House of Representatives easily passed that resolution by the necessary two-thirds vote margin, the Senate fell a mere three votes short. 
   I am hopeful that today's effort will deliver the three additional votes that are needed to send this proposed amendment to the states for ratification. Of note, prior to the Supreme Court's 1989 Texas v. Johnson ruling, 48 states, including my own state of Maine, and the Federal government, had anti-flag burning laws on their books for years--so it's time the Congress gave the states the opportunity to speak on this issue directly. 
   Mr. President, whether our flag is flying over a ball park, a military base, a school or on a flag pole on Main Street, our national standard has always represented the ideals and values that are the foundation this great nation was built on. And our flag has come not only to represent the glories of our nation's past, but it has also come to stand as a symbol for hope for our nation's future. 
   Let me just state that I am extremely committed to defending and protecting our Constitution--from the first amendment in the Bill of Rights to the 27th amendment. I do not believe that this amendment would be a departure from first amendment doctrine. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to uphold the great symbol of our nationhood by supporting the flag amendment. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join many of my colleagues in expressing my deepest concern about the problem concerning energy and the cost of energy to many working Americans, and certainly to my constituents in the State of Maine. 
   We have been plagued by a significant surge in increases at the pump--certainly during the wintertime in the State of Maine concerning oil prices, home heating oil prices that more than doubled within a 1-month period, not to mention the gasoline prices we are seeing and the tremendous spike in those prices, as well. And, even according to the Department of Energy's own information, we will not expect an abatement of those prices by the end of the year. In fact, we can expect to have continuously high prices in terms of gasoline. 
   We know that the OPEC countries are going to be meeting on Monday, 4 days from now. We hope the administration and the Congress sends an unequivocal message that they rethink their unconscionable policy of keeping a very low level of production when it comes to petroleum products. 
   We know that a year ago in October they made a decision to limit production when it came to oil. The administration was well aware of the fact that the OPEC cartel had made a deliberate and concerted decision to limit the production of oil. Even last fall, the Department of Energy's own report indicated that we could expect a 40-percent rise in home heating oil prices, and if it was a severe winter, a 30-percent rise in home heating oil prices. That was more than a 70-percent increase projected by the Department of Energy with respect to home heating oil prices. That was anticipated by our own Department of Energy last October. 
   In fact, my constituents in the State of Maine faced a 100-percent increase in home heating oil prices--a 100-percent increase. Yet we had silence from the administration--silence when the OPEC cartel made this decision to limit the production of oil without any apparent reason, and without any rationale. 
   Then the Department of Energy anticipated we could have up toward a 70-percent increase in home heating oil prices. In fact, we face a 100-percent increase. Yet there was a deafening silence from the administration when it came to the types of policies that could mitigate the burden the surging prices imposed on working Americans. 
   Here we are today anticipating what might or might not happen on Monday, the kinds of decisions made by the OPEC cartel. I hope the administration is working very hard to send a strong message that the OPEC cartel should reconsider its policy. Its policy is all the more shocking when we consider the men and women all across this country who defended the freedom of democracy for countries such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, that the United States lost 147 American lives, 458 were wounded, and 23 were taken prisoner in the struggle during the Persian Gulf war. 
   I think it is entirely appropriate for Congress and the administration to press OPEC in terms of the kind of decision they should be making on Monday. The administration also should consider predicating foreign assistance to some of these foreign countries that are part of the decisionmaking of the OPEC cartel, such as Mexico, whom we bailed out 5 years ago when it came to the peso crisis to the tune of $13.5 billion. We were prepared to bail them out up to the tune of $20 billion to ease the economic hardship imposed on their people. It is no different now. 
   Or Indonesia and Nigeria, for whom the President is proposing $256 million in economic assistance because these are countries in transition. Again, our assistance should be predicated on their cooperation. 
   Those are the kinds of issues we must confront. In the short term, we have to deal with the reality of what is happening at the gas pump. I hope Congress will give consideration to recommendations that will be made by many who have been working on this issue to suspend the 4.3-cent gas tax which many Members opposed back in 1993 because we didn't think this was a hardship we should impose on the American people. 
   Beyond that, if the price of gasoline is going to surge upwards of $2--which it is already doing in California--we should clearly suspend all of the taxes on diesel and gasoline because it is that important to our economy and to Americans in all parts of the country, not just in one region; it will be in all regions. 
   When the Department of Energy says it would undoubtedly be too late to deflect domestic gasoline prices on their way to record nominal levels and may be too little to reduce prices much by the end of the year 2000, clearly we have something to be concerned about. 
   No one really knows even if OPEC will make a positive decision on Monday. I am concerned about the decision they will make on Monday or if they decide to have other meetings. 
   What does that all mean if this does not translate into lower prices at the gas pump this summer? We clearly will have problems. I know my State will have problems. It is a tourist State. We rely on tourism. It is the second biggest industry in the State of Maine. 
   I think we have to be prepared. I hope we do fashion a policy that is contingent upon what the price might be, irrespective of the decision made by OPEC. That is a decision the administration is not prepared to make, and they are not even prepared to take a step forward in any direction. The President announced last week: We will do a reserve in the Northeast but we need to do an environmental impact study; it needs legislation from Congress. 
   Senator DODD introduced legislation in which many joined because we think it is a prudent policy to set up a reserve in the Northeast to mitigate the impact of high price increases or an interruption in oil supply. What is so difficult about that? The 
   President can't even take that step. He says there are a lot of contingencies involved. In effect, we don't have anything from this administration to address this problem. We don't have an energy policy. 
   Congress is going to have to take the concerted steps necessary to address these problems in the short term to be sure these are short-term solutions. We also have to look at the long term. I did support the CAFE standard issue that Senator GORTON addressed today as well. Obviously, the costs have been significant to this country in terms of transportation. We need to get better fuel efficiency with respect to automobiles and minivans. 
   We also should look at providing some incentives for the marginal producers in this country, the small producers, about which Senator HUTCHISON has also talked, as well. Congress will have to take the lead because it is clear that this administration is not intending to in any respect. Beyond anticipating we will have this problem this year, the administration has been virtually silent. I hope they make the message very clear to the OPEC countries about how important their decision will be on Monday.  
   Beyond that, we also have to be prepared for any contingencies in the future that these prices might not decline in the short term or for the reminder of this year. Frankly, it is not just my word, it is the word of the Department of Energy. 
   Again, I hope we will be taking actions in the next few days irrespective of what the decision might be from the OPEC nations.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Sole Community Hospital Fair Payment Act. This legislation will correct an unintended drafting error involving Medicare reimbursements for the Sole Community Hospital program, enacted last year as part of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act (P.L. 106-113). 
   Medicare designates Sole Community Hospitals based on factors such as isolated location, weather or travel conditions, or the absence of other hospitals within a 35 road-mile radius. These hospitals are considered the only source of inpatient services that are reasonably available in a geographic area. Sole Community Hospitals are reimbursed for services on either a federal national standardized amount or on a hospital-specific target amount that is based on either updated FY 1982 or updated FY 1987 costs. 
   Last year, Congress passed legislation updating the federal rate reimbursement level to costs based on Fiscal Year 1996. A drafting error in the bill, however, unintentionally updated the reimbursements for hospitals that are paid on a specific rate--leaving out 327 hospitals across the country that Congress intended to help.  
   If this error had not been made America's rural hospitals would be expecting an additional $600 million over five years. Without correction, the error could cost four hospitals just in my state approximately $2.84 million annually that had been anticipated from this legislation. These hospitals--Mayo Regional Hospital in Dover-Foxcroft, Down East Community Hospital in Machias, Northern Maine Medical Center in fort Kent, and Rumford Community Hospital in Rumford--are a vital part of their communities and had expected these additional funds. 
   Small hospitals across the country are facing an increasingly uncertain future, and we cannot afford to lose any more of our rural health care providers. This funding is critical to these small hospitals and the communities they serve. These facilities and the patients they serve should not be penalized for a mistake made by Congress I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and I urge the Senate to pass this technical correction bill immediately.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a remarkable man and cherished member of the community of Lewiston-Auburn, Maine who sadly passed away in December at the age of 86. 
   When I learned of the passing of George Orestis, I was stricken by the news. George was quite honestly one of the finest people I have ever had the privilege to know--a remarkable man and true gentleman who cared deeply about the community he loved, and was a devoted leader of my church, Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church of Lewiston, Maine. He was one of those rare individuals who could make you feel a better person just for having met him. Indeed, by always seeing the best in people, he helped others to see the best in themselves--and his compassion for humankind has left an indelible mark on all those whose hearts he touched. 
   My memories of George go back to my earliest days, and they are fond ones. He was a wonderful and dear friend, whose generous spirit I will feel fortunate to carry with me throughout my days. His loss is especially difficult for all of us in Maine's Greek-American community--his kindness and spirituality formed the heart and soul of our Church, and his devotion was the bedrock upon which Holy Trinity Church was quite literally built. 
   As the Church's chanter for over two decades, he expressed his faith with soaring eloquence and brought us all closer to God. His words reached out to us in a warm embrace, comforting us in our darkest days. George was always there for us, and today we know that he is now in the company of angels, dwelling forever in the glow of God's eternal love. 
   George Bernard Shaw once said, ``Life is no brief candle to me--it is like a splendid torch which I have hold of for the moment, and I want it to burn as brightly as possible before handing it over to the next generation.'' For 86 years, George Orestis shined as brightly as any mortal being could, and his is a light that will never be diminished for any of us who knew and loved him. In particular, I know what a special and loving relationship he and his wife Toni shared. My thoughts and prayers continue to be with Toni and her entire family--my love is with them always. 
   With his values and beliefs--in the way he conducted his life--George was as close to God as one could ever hope to be. We will miss you, George, more than words have the power to convey. We were so very grateful to have you in our lives--now, you belong to God.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Foster Care Independence Act. I am a cosponsor of the foster care bill that was originally introduced in the Senate by our colleague, the late Senator John Chafee. Mr. President, this bill is an enormously important piece of legislation. It provides the means for States to support some of our most vulnerable children--teens who are facing the tenuous position of being dropped from foster care support for the simple reason that they are turning 18. 
   For many young people, the transition to adulthood is an exciting time of newfound independence. These young people navigate this challenging time with the help and support of their parents and family, secure in the knowledge that a ``safety net'' awaits them at home. 
   This momentous transition can be much more daunting, however, for the 20,000 foster children who make the difficult shift from foster care to independence and adulthood. Research has shown that these children--who average four homes in the final 7 years of their foster care--face many challenges when their benefits end and they are left on their own at the age of 18. 
   Today, there are more than 500,000 children in foster care throughout the United States--young people wrenched from the security of their homes by death, abuse, or other tragedy. For these children, foster parents offer the only support they know, and the abrupt end of care can make transition to adulthood all the more important. We are asking these teens to move out of their foster care and immediately become productive members of society--yet we forget that older foster kids face the same growing pains faced by teens in more stable homes. They are struggling with growing up, struggling with establishing their independence, and struggling to mature and develop their personal identity. But this struggle is made exponentially more difficult when the teens must also face the struggle of housing, poverty, and unemployment. 
   In 1986, Congress created the Independent Living Program to address the transitional needs of foster children as they reach the age when they are asked to live independently. Studies of teens who are forced to abruptly leave foster care have found that they have a significantly higher-than-normal rate of school dropouts, out-of-wedlock births, homelessness, health and mental health problems, poverty, and unemployment. One 1998 study of former foster care youth by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that more than 40 percent of interviewed youth had been homeless, incarcerated, or had received public assistance since leaving State care. This same study found that during the 12- to 18-month period after leaving care, 44 percent of former care youths had difficulty obtaining medical care due to a lack of medical insurance and the high cost of care. 
   These foster children deserve a safe, stable, and nurturing environment in order for them to become productive, self-sufficient members of society. The Foster Care Independence Act will expand Independent Living Program services to provide this support for foster children who are 18 to 21 years old and are still learning valuable life skills. This bill will enable teens between the ages of 18 and 21 to successfully shift from foster families into independent adulthood. This bill will help teens during this important transition by doubling Independent Living Program funding and expanding access to Medicaid health care and mental health services through their 21st birthday. 
   Foster children frequently lack a sense of permanency and the skills that are essential to becoming self-reliant and productive adults. Through State-administered Independent Living Programs, foster children will be able to obtain mentoring and personal support. The expanded program will assist older foster care adolescents in obtaining a high school diploma and/or secondary education; career exploration; and preventative health services. They may also use this program to develop vital daily living skills such as budgeting, locating and maintaining housing, and financial planning. 
   We expect much of our youth because they are the future of our Nation. In turn, we must be willing to give them the support they need to learn, grow, and transition to productive and stable adult lives. The Foster Care Independence Act provides these crucial services for America's older foster children. As Congress works to conclude the first session of the 106th Congress, it is essential that the Senate echo the broad, bipartisan support given to this bill by the U.S. House of Representatives--which recently passed a companion bill by a vote of 380-67--and give these older foster children the stability they deserve. 
   Mr. President, we have all heard the old adage ``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound a cure.'' Surely this rings true for helping our older foster children in their transition to adulthood. I can think of no better tribute to Senator Chafee, in tribute to his memory and to his life's work as an advocate of America's children, to name this bill in honor of him. And for this reason I rise today in support of the bill and I ask my colleagues to vote for this tremendously important piece of legislation.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2116, the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act of 1999. 
   I would like to begin by thanking my colleague, Senator SPECTER, chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, for his leadership on issues of importance to veterans. H.R. 2116 contains a number of provisions that will benefit veterans in Maine and elsewhere because of his strong leadership. I applaud Senator SPECTER for his efforts. 
   I would especially like to thank the chairman for his efforts to address a concern I had about a specific provision in the House-passed version of the bill, which would have jeopardized millions of dollars in grant funding for the Maine State Veterans Homes system. 
   H.R. 2116 contains a provision which fundamentally reorders the manner in which VA construction grants will be awarded in the future, placing the focus on renovation of existing facilities so that maintenance projects will take precedence in grant awards over proposals to construct new facilities. The House-passed version of the bill would have made Maine veterans homes and state homes in a number of states ineligible for funding, even through they had already prepared and filed grant applications under existing law and regulations. 
   In an effort to address this concern, I worked closely with Senator SPECTER to craft a transition provision balancing the need to treat current state home applicants fairly and not change the rules in the middle of the game, while at the same time implementing the new rules as soon as possible. 
   I am very pleased that the conference for H.R. 2116 agreed to the measure I helped author that grandfathers proposals already filed by veterans homes, thereby exempting them from new criteria in the bill that would have precluded funding in this and coming fiscal years. 
   I believe this compromise remains true to the intent of the new criteria included in the House-passed version of the bill, while at the same time protecting the interests of states that had already submitted applications for funding. 
   In addition to work with Senator SPECTER personally, I wrote a letter to the chairman in September alerting him to my concerns, followed by a letter to my colleague from Maine, Senator COLLINS. In addition, last month, I spearheaded a letter with 14 other Senators urging modification of the House construction grant provision to grandfather proposals made by Maine and other states under existing law, so that it would not change the methodology in the middle of the current fiscal year--after applications have been filed; after architectural, engineering, and legal fees have been incurred, and after local matching funds have been appropriated or borrowed by states for these projects. 
   If the House-passed provision had been enacted without this change, many states veterans homes would have lost their positions for Fiscal Year 2000 grants because these applications would have been judged according to a new set of criteria. 
   In Maine, this would have jeopardized funding for the entire Maine Veterans Homes system, which earlier this year applied for about $9.3 million in grant  funding, and is seeking to construct new veterans' residential care facilities in Augusta, Bangor, Caribou, and Scarborough. In their applications, the Maine Veterans Home System notes that more than half of Maine's veterans population is reaching the age where long-term nursing care or domicillary care is typically required. Since 1991, the number of Maine veterans aged 75-79 has doubled, from 6,000 to 12,500. Over the same time period, the numbers of veterans aged 80-84 has doubled from 2,400 to 6,000; and veterans over the age of 85 has increased by 50 percent from 1,200 to 1,800. 
   I would also like to thank Senator SPECTER for supporting another provision in H.R. 2116 based on legislation I introduced in the Senate, S. 1579, the Veterans Sexual Trauma Treatment Act. S. 1579 extends a VA program that offers counseling and medical treatment to veterans who were sexually abused while serving in the military, and requires a VA mental health professional to determine when counseling is necessary. Currently, the VA Secretary makes this determination. The bill also calls for the dissemination of information concerning the availability of counseling services to veterans through public service announcements. 
   According to the Department of Defense, at least 55 percent of active duty women and 14 percent of active duty men have been subjected to sexual harassment. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I credit the DoD with working to reduce the prevalence of sexual harassment in the military. However, as long as there is harassment in the military, it is vital that victims have access to treatment, and H.R. 2116 provides the tools to do this. 
   Finally, I would like to commend the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees and the conferees for H.R. 2116 for their efforts to expand a whole range of benefits for veterans in this conference report. For example, the bill expands long-term care for veterans, and will increase home and community-based care and assisted-living options for veterans. It expands mental health services, and requires the VA to enhance specialized services for PTSD and drug abuse disorders. It provides coverage for uninsured veterans who need care but who do not have access to a VA facility. It expands VA authority to provide services to homeless veterans. It improves Montgomery GI bill benefits by providing benefits for students in preparatory courses and to those whose enlistment is interrupted to attend officers training school. And these are just a few of the important provisions in this bill. 
   Mr. President, this is a strong bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in a strong show of support. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. SNOWE. I commend my colleague, Senator SPECTER, chairman of the Senate Veteran's Affairs Committee, for the remarkably responsive and skillful manner in which he managed the progress of H.R. 2116. This bill means a lot to veterans throughout the nation, and especially in my home state of Maine. I applaud Senator SPECTER's leadership on issues of importance to veterans. 
   I have only one point of clarification. Does the transition clause of Section 207(c) of the bill mean, that for all state home grant applications covered by the transition clause and otherwise in compliance with applicable law and regulations in effect on November 10, 1999, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall award grants first to all unfunded applications remaining for fiscal year 1999 priority one projects? And that following those projects, the Secretary shall next fund those FY 2000 applications and which both meet the criteria set forth in the bill and which were accorded priority one status for FY 2000? And that the Secretary would fund these projects in the order in which they would appear on the fiscal year 2000 priority one list, prior to awarding grants to any other applications?

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I reiterate my support for the two year extension of the very successful Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. And after all I have read recently--not that one should believe everything they read--I feel compelled to set the record straight on this issue one more time. 
   The Northeast Dairy Compact has addressed the needs of states in New England who compacted together within their region to determine fair prices for locally produced supplies of fresh milk. All six legislatures and all six governors in New England approved the Compact. 
   In fact, in 1989-1990, the Vermont House passed it unanimously and the Senate passed it 29 to 1. The Maine House passed it 114 to 1 and it was unanimously adopted by the Senate. The legislatures in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island adopted it overwhelmingly in 1993. 
   I would also note that despite the varying views, party affiliations and economic philosophies, this is one issue where the entire New England Congressional Delegation is united. And that, in and of itself, is quite a feat. 
   Let me tell you why New England is united behind the Dairy Compact. We want our family farmers. This way of life is threatened for a number of reasons including the encroachment of development which leads to the increased cost of land. 
   I think one Mainer summed it up quite nicely in a letter to the editor. In this letter she noted that it was okay to be against the Compact ``..... if you think we will be better off having subdivisions where our farms once stood, if you believe it's to our advantage to say good-bye to the last family farms and hello to big business controlling the production, distribution and pricing .......'' 
   In my own state of Maine we have lost 31 percent of our dairy farms in the last 10 years. We have 485 dairy farms left and they average 80 milking cows and provide 2100 related jobs. They allow the continuation of a rural way of life that is fast disappearing not only in New England but throughout the country. And it is a way of life that we will not give up without a fight. 
   The men and women who own our dairy farms are doing it because it is in their blood--their parents did it, their grandparents did it and in many cases their great grandparents did it. You don't go into dairy farming to make money--you go into it because it is in your blood, it is what you know and what you love. And the Compact is the only thing standing between many of these families and the loss of not only their farm but their way of life. 
   In Maine we have a saying that you are ``from away'' if you are not from Maine. Let me assure you that if you told a Maine dairy farmer that he was part of a price fixing cartel, as several newspapers have claimed, he would immediately know that you were from away ..... far, far away. 
   The beauty of the Compact is that it reflects the New England way of life--self-reliance--we don't ask the federal government for one penny. Instead, New Englanders pay a few cents more for milk to support the Compact--a very small price to pay to protect our rural way of life. 
   Let me repeat that--we are not asking the federal taxpayer in Wisconsin  or Texas or Minnesota to subsidize our farmers--although I might add that New England's taxpayers have historically subsidized farmers in other parts of the country. 
   The Compact has proven to be an effective approach to address farm insecurity. The Compact has protected New England against the loss of their small family dairy farms and the consumers against a decrease in the fresh local supply of milk. The Compact has stabilized the dairy industry in this entire region and protected farmers and consumers against volatile price swings. 
   Over ninety-seven percent of the fluid milk market in New England is self-contained within the area, and fluid milk markets are local due to the demand for freshness and because of high transportation costs, so any complaints raised in other areas about unfair competition are quite disingenuous. 
   All we are asking, Mr. President, is the continuation of the Northeast Dairy Compact, the existence of which does not threaten or financially harm any other dairy farmer in the country. 
   Let there be no mistake, the Northeast Dairy Compact does not stand alone in the Omnibus bill. Additional dairy language is included in the bill that restores the existing federal program, the Milk Marketing Order system, which fixes the price of milk in different regions across the country, and is initiated and approved by producers in specific areas. 
   The USDA adopted a final Rule on Milk Marketing Orders in March, a rule I might add that favors dairy farmers in the Upper Midwest at the expense of the rest of the country. On September 22, the House expressed its opposition to this rule when they voted 285-140 to restore the current system by placing a moratorium on the Final Rule. So, this is not one region of the country speaking--although some apparently believe that New England's family farmers make a good scapegoat--as 65 percent of the House of Representatives voted to pass the moratorium language. 
   The New England Compact adds about two cents a gallon to the consumer--not 20 cents as the Wall Street Journal would have you believe. They seem to be under the impression that the farmers set the price for the milk you buy at the store--the fact is that the prices, as we all know, are set by the retailer. Under the Compact, New England retail milk prices have been among the lowest and the most stable in the country. 
   The opposition has tried to make the argument that interstate dairy compacts increase milk prices. This is just not so as milk prices around the U.S. have shown time and again that prices elsewhere are much higher and experience much wider price shifts than in the Northeast Compact states. Just take a look at dairy prices around the country for a gallon of milk. 
   The price in Bangor and Augusta, Maine ranged from $2.89 to $2.99 per gallon from February to April of 1999 and has remained stable at $2.89 for the last several months. 
   In the Boston, Massachusetts market, the price stayed perfectly stable--at $2.89--from February to April of 1999. 
   The price in Seattle ranged from $3.39 to $3.56 over the same time period. Washington State is not in a compact, yet their milk was approximately 50 cents higher per gallon than in Maine. The range in Los Angeles was from $3.19 to $3.29. In San Diego, the range was from $3.10 to $3.62. California is not in a compact. 
   Las Vegas prices were $2.99 all the way up to $3.62. Not much price stability there, but then, Nevada is not in a compact. In Philadelphia, the range was $2.78 to $3.01 per gallon--not as wide a shift as Nevada but a much wider price shift than the Northeast Compact states. It's no wonder Pennsylvania dairy farmers want to join us. 
   How about Denver--Colorado is not in a compact. A gallon of milk in Denver has cost consumers anywhere from $3.45 to $3.59 over the past few months, over one half of a dollar more than in New England. So, the Northeast Dairy Compact has not resulted in higher milk prices in New England, but the milk prices are among the lowest in the country--and are among the most stable. 
   Only the consumers and the processors in the New England region pay a few cents extra for milk that already costs less than just about anywhere else in the country--to provide for a fairer return to the area's family dairy farmers and to protect a way of life important to the people of the Northeast. 
   Also, where is the consumer outrage from the Compact states for spending a few extra pennies for fresh fluid milk so as to ensure a safety net for dairy farmers so that they can continue an important way of life? I have not heard any swell of outrage of consumer complaints over the last three years. Why, because the consumers also realize this initial pilot project, whose costs are borne entirely by the New England consumers and processors, has been a huge success. 
   So, I ask my colleagues to look at the facts, not the fables being spread by those who have simply chosen not to let the facts get in their way.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, last Wednesday, the Senate confirmed Governor Joseph E. Brennan as a commissioner on the Federal Maritime Commission, and this week Governor Brennan was sworn in for a term to expire in 2003. 
   Governor Brennan, who formerly served as a Member of Congress for four years, where he was a member of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, and Governor of Maine for eight years prior to that, is eminently qualified to confront the challenges facing the maritime community. With his broad experience at both the state and federal level, Governor Brennan is an outstanding choice to serve as a Commissioner on the FMC. 
   His service in Congress gave him first-hand knowledge of federal maritime issues as a member of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee that will be invaluable on the Maritime Commission. 
   Established in 1961, the Federal Maritime Commission--FMC--is an independent regulatory agency charged with administering laws relating to shipping and the waterborne domestic and offshore commerce of the U.S. 
   The FMC's jurisdiction encompasses many facets of the maritime industry. The Chairman and four Commissioners of the FMC are responsible for protecting shippers, carriers and others engaged in foreign commerce from restrictive rules and regulations of foreign governments and from the practices of foreign-flag carriers that have an adverse effect on shipping in U.S. trades. The FMC also reviews and monitors agreements under shipping law, reviews and approves or rejects tariff filings, issues licenses for ocean freight activities, administers passenger indemnity laws, reviews alleged or suspected violations of shipping statutes, and promulgates rules and regulations on shipping laws. 
   The maritime sector is vitally important to our economy, and the FMC's responsibilities are fundamental to sustaining U.S. competitiveness in this area. 
   As a Senator from Maine, a state with a rich maritime heritage, I am keenly aware that our nation has always been dependent upon the sea and has thus enjoyed a rich maritime tradition. To this day, our merchant marine remains an integral part of our culture and our economy. 
   Today, one out of every six jobs in the United States is marine related. America's ports support more than 95 percent of all our overseas foreign trade, and within the U.S., more than one billion tons of commercial cargo is transported by ship each year. We must  do all that we can to preserve our maritime legacy for future generations, and the FMC plays a key role in the commercial component of this legacy. 
   Mr. President, I would also like to recognize Senator MCCAIN, Chairman of the Commerce Committee, for his leadership, and for making it possible to move the nominations of both Governor Brennan and Anthony Merck prior to adjournment. I am grateful to Senator MCCAIN and to Majority Leader LOTT for their efforts to move this nomination expeditiously--and to my colleagues for their support. 
   Finally, I would like to offer my heartfelt congratulations to Governor Brennan. I am very pleased that the President recognized that he would make a valuable contribution to the FMC. As senior Senator from Maine and a member of the Commerce Committee, I look forward to working with Governor Brennan on maritime issues in the years to come. 
   Mr. President, once again, I would like to thank Chairman MCCAIN Majority Leader LOTT, and my colleagues, and I yield the floor.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Building, Renovating, Improving, and Constructing Kids' Schools (BRICKS) Act''--legislation that would address our nation's burgeoning need for K-12 school construction, renovation, and repair. The legislation would accomplish this in a fiscally-responsible manner while seeking to find the middle ground between those who support a very direct, active federal role in school construction, and those who are concerned about an expanded federal role in what has been--and remains--a state and local responsibility. 
   Mr. President, the condition of many of our nation's existing public schools is abysmal even as the need for additional schools and classroom space grows. Specifically, according to reports issued by the General Accounting Office (GAO) in 1995 and 1996, fully one-third of all public schools needing extensive repair or replacement. 
   As further evidence of this problem, an issue brief prepared by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in 1999 stated that the average public school in America is 42 years old, with school buildings beginning rapid deterioration after 40 years. In addition, the NCES brief found that 29 percent of all public schools are in the ``oldest condition,'' which means that they were built prior to 1970 and have either never been renovated or were renovated prior to 1980. 
   Not only are our nation's schools in need of repair and renovation, but there is a growing demand for additional schools and classrooms due to an ongoing surge in student enrollment. Specifically, according to the NCES, at least 2,400 new public schools will need to be built by the year 2003 to accommodate our nation's burgeoning school rolls, which will grow from a record 52.7 million children today to 54.3 million by 2008. 
   Needless to say, the cost of addressing our nation's need for school renovations and construction is enormous. In fact, according to the General Accounting Office (GAO), it will cost $112 billion just to bring our nation's schools into good overall condition. Nowhere is this cost better understood than in my home state of Maine, where a recently-completed study by the Maine Department of Education and the State Board of Education determined that the cost of addressing the state's school building and construction needs stood at $637 million. 
   Mr. President, we simply cannot allow our nation's schools to fall into utter disrepair and obsolescence with children sitting in classrooms that have leaky ceilings or rotting walls. We cannot ignore the need for new schools as the record number of children enrolled in K-12 schools continues to grow. 
   Accordingly, because the cost of repairing and building these facilities may prove to be more than many state and local governments can bear in a short period of time, I believe the federal government can and should assist Maine and other state and local governments in addressing this growing national crisis. 
   Admittedly, not all members support strong federal intervention in what has been historically a state and local responsibility. In fact, many argue with merit that the best form of federal assistance for school construction or other local educational needs would be for the federal government to fulfill its commitment to fund 40 percent of the cost of special education. This long-standing commitment was made when the Individuals with Disabilities Education (IDEA) Act was signed into law more than 20 years ago, but the federal government has fallen woefully short in upholding its end of the bargain, only recently increasing its share to approximately 10 percent. 
   Needless to say, I strongly agree with those who argue that the federal government's failure to fulfill this mandate represents nothing less than a raid on the pocketbook of every state and local government. Accordingly, I am pleased that recent efforts in the Congress have increased federal funding for IDEA by a full 85 percent over the past three years, and I support ongoing efforts to achieve the 40 percent federal commitment in the near future. 
   Yet, even as we work to fulfill this long-standing commitment and thereby free up local resources to address local needs, I believe the federal government can do more to assist state and local governments in addressing their school construction needs without infringing on local control.  
    Mr. President, the legislation I am offering today--the ``BRICKS Act''--will do just that . Specifically, it addresses our nation's school construction needs in a responsible fiscal manner while bridging the gap between those who advocate a more activist federal role in school construction and those who do not. 
   First, my legislation will provide $20 billion in federal loans to support school construction, renovation, and repair at the local level. By designating that these loans may only be used to pay the interests owed to bondholders on new, 15-year school construction bonds that are issued by state and local governments through the year 2002, the federal government will leverage the issuing of new bonds by states and localities that would not otherwise be made. 
   Of importance, these loan moneys--which will be distributed on an annual basis using the Title I distribution formula--will become available to each state at the request of a Governor. While the federal loans can only be used to support bond issues that will supplement, and not supplant, the amount of school construction that would have occurred in the absence of the loans, there will be no requirement that states engage in a lengthy application process that does not even assure them of their rightful share of the $20 billion pot. 
   Second, my bill ensures that these loans are made by the federal government in a fiscally responsible manner that does not cut into the Social Security surplus or claim a portion of non-Social Security surpluses that may prove ephemeral in the future. 
   Specifically, my bill would make these loans to states from the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF)--a fund that was created through the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 and has grown to hold more than $40 billion in assets. The principal activity of the fund--which is controlled solely by the Secretary of the Treasury--is foreign exchange intervention that is intended to limit fluctuations in exchange rates. However, the fund has also been used to provide stabilization loans to foreign countries, including a $20 billion line of credit to Mexico in 1995 to support the peso. 
   In light of the controversial manner in which the ESF has been used, some have argued that additional constraints should be placed on the fund. Still others--including former Federal Reserve Board Governor Lawrence B. Lindsey--have stated that, for various reasons, the fund should be liquidated. 
   Regardless of how one feels about exercising greater constraint over the ESF or liquidating it, I believe that if this $40 billion fund can be used to bailout foreign currencies, it certainly can be used to help America's schools. 
   Accordingly, I believe it is appropriate that the $20 billion in loans provided by my legislation will be made from the ESF--an amount identical to the line of credit that was extended to Mexico by the Secretary of the Treasury in 1995. Of importance, these loans will be made from the ESF on a progressive, annual basis--not in a sudden or immediate manner. Furthermore, these monies will be repaid to the fund with interest, to ensure that the ESF is compensated for the loans it makes. 
   Although the ESF will recoup all of the monies it lends plus interest, it should also be noted that my proposal ensures that state and local governments will not be forced to pay excessive interest--or that they will be forced to repay over an unreasonable time line. Specifically, my bill sets the interest rate for the loans at the average prime lending rate for the year in which the bonds are issued, with a cap of 4.5 percent--an amount that is lower than the prime lending rate in any of the previous 15 years. Furthermore, no payments will be owed--and no interest will accrue--until 2005, unless the federal government fulfills its commitment to fund 40 percent of the cost of special education prior to that time. 
   Combined, these provisions will minimize the cost of these loans to the states, and maximize the utilization of these loans for school construction, renovation, and repair. 
    Mr. President, by providing low-interest loans to states and local governments to support school construction, I believe that my bill represents a fiscally-responsible, centrist solution to a national problem. 
   For those who support a direct, active federal role in school construction, my bill provides substantial federal assistance by dedicating $20 billion to leverage a significant amount of new school construction bonds. For those who are concerned about the federal government becoming overly-engaged in an historically state and local responsibility--and thereby stepping on local control--my bill directs that the monies provided to states will be repaid with interest, and that no onerous applications or demands are placed on states to receive their share of these monies. 
    Mr. President, I urge that my colleagues support the ``BRICKS Act''--legislation that is intended to bridge the gap between competing philosophies on the federal role in school construction. Ultimately, if we work together, we can make a tangible difference in the condition of America's schools without turning it into a partisan or ideological battle that is better suited to sound bites than actual solutions.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans Health Care Quality Assurance Act of 1999. 
   This legislation contains a number of proposals designed to ensure that access to high quality medical services for our veterans is not compromised as the Department of Veterans Affairs--the VA--strives to increase efficiency in its nationwide network of veterans hospitals. 
   Mr. President, the VA administers the largest health care network in the U.S., including 172 hospitals, 73 home care programs, over 800 community-based outpatient clinics, and numerous other specialized care facilities. 
   Moreover, there are approximately 25 million veterans in the U.S., including approximately 19.3 million wartime veterans, and the number of veterans seeking medical care in VA hospitals is increasing. The FY99 VA medical care caseload was projected to increase by 160,000 veterans over the FY98 level, and is projected to increase by an additional 54,000 in FY00, reaching a total of 3.6 million veterans, an increase from 2.7 million in FY97. In FY00, outpatient visits at VA medical facilities are projected to increase by 2.5 million to 38.3 million. The average age of veterans is increasing as well, and this is expected to result in additional demands for health care services, including more frequent and long-term health needs. 
   The VA is attempting to meet this unprecedented demand for health care services without substantial increases in funding, largely through efforts to increase efficiency. Not surprisingly, these seemingly competing objectives are generating serious concerns about the possibility that quality of care and/or patient satisfaction are being sacrificed. 
   Mr. President, many VA regional networks and medical center directors report that timely access to high quality health care is being jeopardized,  and that is why I am introducing the Veterans Health Care Quality Assurance Act, legislation which seeks to ensure that no veteran's hospital is targeted unfairly for cuts, and that efforts to ``streamline'' and increase efficiency are not followed by the unintended consequence of undermining quality of care or patient satisfaction. 
   I believe that all veterans hospitals should be held to the same equitable VA-wide standards, and that quality and satisfaction must be guaranteed. Toward that end, the Veterans Health Care Quality Assurance Act calls for audits of every VA hospital every three years. This will ensure that each facility is subject to an outside, independent review of its operations on a regular basis, and each audit will include findings on how to improve services to our veterans. 
   The legislation will also establish an Office of Quality Assurance within the VA to ensure that steps taken to increase efficiency in VA medical programs do not undermine quality or patient satisfaction. This office will collect and disseminate information on efforts that have proven to successfully increase efficiency and resource utilization without undermining quality or patient satisfaction. The director of this new Office of Quality Assurance should be an advocate for veterans and would be placed in the appropriate position in the VA command structure to ensure that he or she is consulted by the VA Secretary and Under Secretary for Veterans Health on matters that impact quality or satisfaction. 
   The bill would require an initial report to Congress within six months of enactment, which would include a survey of each VA regional network and a report on each network's efforts to increase efficiency, as well as an assessment of the extent to which each network and VA hospital is or is not implementing the same uniform, VA-wide policies to increase efficiency. 
   Under the bill's reporting requirement, the VA would also be required to publish--annually--an overview of VA-wide efficiency 
   goals and quality/satisfaction standards that each veterans facility should be held to. Further, the VA would be required to report to Congress on each hospital's standing in relation to efficiency, quality, and satisfaction criteria, and how each facility compares to the VA-wide average. 
   In an effort to encourage innovation in efforts to increase efficiency within the agency, the bill would encourage the dissemination and sharing of information throughout the VA in order to facilitate implementation of uniform, equitable efficiency standards. 
   Finally, Mr. President, the bill includes provisions calling for sharing of information on efforts to maximize resources and increase efficiency without compromising quality of care and patient satisfaction; exchange and mentoring initiatives among and between networks in order to facilitate sharing of such information; incentives for networks to increase efficiency and meet uniform quality/patient satisfaction targets; and formal oversight by the VA to ensure that all networks are meeting uniform efficiency criteria and that efforts to increase efficiency are equitable between networks and medical facilities. 
   Last week America celebrated Veterans Day 1999--81 years after the Armistice was signed in France that silenced the guns and ended the carnage of World War I. World War I was supposed to be ``the war to end all wars'' ..... the war that made the world safe for democracy. Sadly, that was not to be, and America has been repeatedly reminded that the defense of democracy is an on-going duty. 
   Mr. President, keeping our promise to our veterans is also an ongoing duty. The debt of gratitude we owe to our veterans can never be fully repaid. What we can and must do for our veterans is repay the financial debt we owe to them. Central to that solemn duty is ensuring that the benefits we promised our veterans when they enlisted are there for them when they need them. 
   I consider it a great honor to represent veterans, these brave Americans. So many of them continue to make contributions in our communities upon their transition from military to civilian life--through youth activities and scholarship programs, homeless assistance initiatives, efforts to reach out to fellow veterans in need, and national leadership on issues of importance to veterans and all Americans. The least we can do is make good on our promise, such as the promise of access to high quality health care. 
   I have nothing but the utmost respect for those who have served their country, and this legislation is but a small tribute to the men and women and their families who have served this country with courage, honor and distinction. They answered the call to duty when their country needed them, and this is a component of my on-going effort to ensure that we, as elected officials, answer their call when they need us. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that a commemorative postage stamp should be issued honoring the United States Naval Shipyards. 
   This legislation calls upon the United States Postal Service to issue a commemorative postage stamp honoring the legacy of our naval shipyard system on the occasion of its 200th anniversary, which will take place in the year 2000. 
   Mr. President, naval technology has proven invaluable to our nation by strengthening our national defense, preserving world maritime freedom, and producing significant scientific breakthroughs. In peacetime, ships built in naval shipyards patrol around the clock to preserve peace and keep the United States free. As Chair of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower, I am proud that, today, the U.S. Navy is the preeminent naval force in the world. Ships constructed in U.S. yards have helped lead the way to victory in numerous global conflicts. 
   Naval shipyards workers, both past and present, have a well-deserved sense of pride in their accomplishments which have kept our Navy strong and our country free. Likewise, veterans of the United States Naval Force have served with courage, honor and distinction, risking their lives in combat and against an unforgiving sea. 
   On June 12, 2000, the Kittery/Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine will celebrate the 200th anniversary of its founding. Kittery/Portsmouth was the first major naval shipyard of the modern era. From the beginnings at Kittery/Portsmouth, the naval shipyard system grew to eventually include eleven yards located on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. In the two hundred years since 1800, naval yards have built hundreds of naval ships, and completed thousands of overhauls on ships of both the U.S. Navy and those of U.S. allies. 
   I believe this resolution would be a fitting way to recognize the forthcoming bicentennial of our public shipyards. I strongly believe that the contributions of the hundreds of thousands of men and women who work in our shipyards are worthy of recognition. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in this show of support for our shipyards.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that a series of commemorative postage stamps should be issued honoring veterans service organizations across the United States. 
   As we near Veterans Day--81 years after the Armistice was signed in France that silenced the guns and ended the carnage of World War I--this legislation calls upon the United States Postal Service to issue a series of commemorative postage stamps honoring the legacy and the continuing contributions of veterans to our country. World War I was supposed to be ``the war to end all wars'' *.*.* the war that made the world safe for democracy. Sadly, that was not to be, and America has been repeatedly reminded that the defense of democracy is an on-going duty. That is why this is such an opportune moment to recognize those brave Americans who fought to defend the freedoms we cherish. 
   Mr. President, when many of us think about war veterans, we think about the tremendous sacrifices these defenders of freedom made. From the War for Independence, through the Persian Gulf War, Bosnia, and Kosovo--more than two hundred years later--Americans have answered their country's call to duty to safeguard our freedoms. Of those who have worn our nation's uniform, more than a million never returned. They made the ultimate sacrifice so that those who followed could enjoy the blessings of liberty. The debt of gratitude we owe to our veterans can never be fully repaid. What we can and must do for our veterans is to keep alive the values of freedom and democracy they have defended, and honor them as the guardians of those ideals. 
   Elmer Runyon once wrote that: ``We will remain the home of the free only as long as we are also the home of the brave''. Today, America and the world is basking in the shine of freedom because of yesterday's and today's service men and women--who offer nobly to sacrifice in war so that others may live in peace. These are America's true heroes. 
   After all, winning freedom is not the same as keeping it. The cost of safeguarding freedom is high. It requires vigilance and sacrifice. Time and again when freedom has been threatened, American men and women have emerged as heroes. 
   America's veterans have served our country and the world ably in times of need, and know well the personal sacrifices which the defense of freedom demands. It is a true honor to represent these brave Americans, as so many of them continue to make contributions day-in and day-out in our communities--through youth activities and scholarships programs, homeless assistance initiatives, efforts to reach out to fellow veterans in need, and national leadership on issues of importance to veterans and all Americans. 
   I have nothing but the utmost respect for those who have served their country. This legislation is a tribute to the men and women and their families who have served this country with courage, honor and distinction. They answered the call to duty when their country needed them, and this is but a small token of our appreciation. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in this show of support and an expression of appreciation to all veterans.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that this past June 2, 1999, the Fort James Corporation Paper Mills 2 was recognized for its impressive safety record of performance for the entire year of 1998. The award was presented by the Pulp & Paper Association, which honored the St. James Mill at its Awards Banquet at the Association's annual Professional Development Conference in St. Petersburg, Florida. 
   The award is the highest honor given for safety performance throughout the paper industry, and reflects the most improved safety record in the class of 56 mills working between one and to two million hours per year. Mr. President, the mill logged over 1.3 million work hours with an extremely low incidence of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordable work injuries--only 21, yielding an exemplary incident rate of 3.2. This incident rate reflects that very few employees required any type of medical attention while carrying out their demanding jobs. 
   Further, in light of their accomplishments on behalf of the safety of the community and its people, the City of Old Town issued a resolution to the Fort James Corporation honoring its employees for their outstanding commitment. And at a follow-up picnic, mill employees were given a true Maine ``thank you'' as mill management, along with corporate environmental and safety leaders as well as local officials, helped out in cooking and serving a Celebration Picnic to all of the mill's employees. Each employee was also presented with a gift in recognition of the worker safety accomplishments. 
   To the entire workforce and management at the Fort James Mill, I would like to add my congratulations and a sincere Maine thank you as well for their efforts in worker safety that have culminated in this well deserved award, and I thank the Chair.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing my profound sadness on the passing of our good colleague and our great friend, Senator John Chafee, and to offer my most sincere condolences to his wife Ginny, their 5 children, and 12 grandchildren, the entire Chafee family, and also people in Rhode Island, who have lost a strong advocate, a compassionate leader, and a true friend. 
   This body and this Nation are diminished today by the loss of one of the finest people I have ever had the privilege to know in politics. 
   Senator Chafee's life was an ode to the finest ideals of public service. He fought in World War II and Korea because he believed in freedom. He served in the State legislature and as Governor of Rhode Island because he loved his State. He answered the call to become Secretary of the Navy because he wanted us to have the best defensive force in the world. He ran for the Senate because he thought he could make a difference, and what a difference he has made. 
   I had the honor of working with Senator Chafee in this body for only a little under 5 years, but as did everyone else on Capitol Hill, I had long known of his reputation for thoughtfulness and reason. Indeed, for anyone who really cared about the art of legislating, John Chafee was a household name. 
   I consider myself fortunate for the opportunity to have worked with this great American and to have seen firsthand why he engendered such respect and affection from both sides of the aisle and from all political persuasions. He was an extraordinary man of sincere humility, boundless energy, and steadfast integrity. It was difficult enough coming to terms with his impending retirement from the Senate. Now it will be immeasurably more difficult to come to terms with his passing. 
   Throughout my tenure in the Senate, I have felt a special kinship with Senator Chafee on a number of levels. For one thing, he and his wife Ginny have long had a home in my State of Maine, a home that has been in his family more than 100 years, in the beautiful town of Sorrento just across the bay from where my husband's family has a place. And we had a chance to see them during the course of the summer. Clearly, I knew from the start that Senator Chafee was a man of discerning taste. 
   In fact, he would often say--only half-jokingly--he considered himself the third Senator from Maine. If such a thing were really possible, we could not have been more honored, and we certainly could not have had a better advocate for our great State. 
   On the political front, I always saw Senator Chafee as something of a kindred spirit. He epitomized what it meant to be a modern, moderate Republican. For him, compromise was a way things got done. It was the way we distilled all the opinions, all the issues, all the viewpoints, and arrived at legislation that could change America and change lives for the better. For John Chafee, there was strength in compromise, courage in compromise, honor in compromise, and he was right. He viewed it not as an abdication of principle but a catalyst for constructive policy. 
   Senator Chafee was willing to take risks in order to do what he believed was in the best interests of Rhode Island and our country. For him, leadership and the public good were two concepts forever and eternally intertwined. Sometimes that meant being a lone voice in the wilderness, and he was willing to be that voice. 
   Time and again, John Chafee was there, both out in front and behind the scenes, as Senator Breaux just mentioned, forging consensus, breaking deadlocks, and bringing people together on countless issues that were key for Americans, issues that resonate today in people's daily lives and will continue to resonate for generations to come. 
   John Chafee always put ideas ahead of ideology. That is 
   why he was at the forefront of the legislative and political debates in Congress. He proposed sensible, viable, and realistic alternatives. I well remember in the budget  debates of 1995 and 1996 when Senator Chafee joined Senator Breaux to form a bipartisan group of Senators to bridge the political gulf that had opened in the aftermath of the Government shutdown. I was proud to be a member of that group because John Chafee was never about making the political points; John Chafee was about making the process work, and that is precisely what he did during the budget debate and throughout his entire 23 years in the Senate. 
   He was a tireless advocate on so many issues vital to the future of this country, perhaps none more important than the health of our Nation's environment. In fact, when it comes to the protection of our natural resources, it can truly be said that John Chafee has left a lasting mark on the landscape of America. 
   He was a strong voice for the environment, shepherding the Clean Air Act of 1990 and consistently supporting the preservation of our country's precious wetlands and open spaces. He has played a role in every major Federal initiative to control pollution and protect our natural resources over the past 20 years, and it is testament to his vision that generations of Americans not even born will have John Chafee to thank for a healthier world. 
   Of course, it is not only the health of our environment he sought to protect. Until the very end, John Chafee was a champion for those less fortunate, and that includes health care for low-income families and expanded health coverage for uninsured low-income children. He was a visionary on the issue of child care. He knew we had to make it safer, more accessible, more affordable, and it was my privilege to join him in that fight. 
   More recently, just last week, I joined him on a bill he and Senator Rockefeller introduced that will help foster children make the transition to independent living. Just shortly after I learned of John's passing, I had to get on a plane yesterday, and I picked up a newspaper and read an editorial in the Los Angeles Times, in fact, praising this legislation, saying this is not extending a welfare project but building a bridge to independence. That is the type of approach John would take on issues.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, that was typical of John Chafee. He saw the potential of people--the best in people--and did everything he could to enhance their lives. He did not just root for the underdog; he was on the field helping the underdog. We can attribute more than a few upset victories over the years to his efforts. 
   It is hard for me to believe it was just 6 days ago I saw John at the weekly lunch we moderate Republicans hold every Wednesday. We take turns holding them in our offices. Last week, it was in John's office. Little did we know it would be for the last time. 
   It was a tradition he started in 1995. Back then, our circle included Senators Cohen and Kassebaum. We always looked forward to them. They were our refuge to discussions of what was happening on the floor, in the Senate, and in the country. It was a refuge from the ``hurly-burlyness'' of the process in the Senate with like-minded Senators. It was a tradition we looked forward to every week. I know it will not be the same without him. 
   At these luncheons, John always brought to the table the issues about which he most cared. We would also expect he would have a list of issues and legislation he was promoting that he thought was important to bring to our attention and to get our support. In fact, John was just speaking last week, as I said, about the foster children legislation, and I joined him on that issue because he was so passionate, as he was on all of the issues, whether it was child care, the environment, or families on welfare looking to make a better life for their family. Such talk never surprised any of us in the room because it was the essence of the man; it was what drove him. 
   Once again, it was also revealed in words forged by deep compassion and unyielding humanity in so many respects. Maybe it sounds trite in our world at the end of the 20th century, maybe it sounds old fashioned in a time when cynicism is celebrated over optimism, but John Chafee cared. He was a good man who believed he had something to offer the Nation in which he felt privileged to live, and he saw public service as a noble calling. Ironically, perhaps, it is precisely because of people such as John Chafee that public service remains a noble calling. 
   So today, there is a hole in the Senate where this great man once was. There is an empty desk on this floor where a remarkable leader once stood. There is a hollowness in our hearts. 
   But even in the midst of our sadness, let us also celebrate the life of a man who brought such extraordinary credit upon himself, his family, his State, and this institution. Senator Chafee now and forever will be a part of this Chamber. His compassionate and reasoned voice will forever echo from these walls, and his legacy will endure. It is a legacy we would all do well to follow. 
   We measure success in our lives and in this body by many different standards. But at such a solemn time as this, I cannot help but think of the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson who wrote:  
   ..... to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. ..... This is to have succeeded.  
   So many lives have breathed easier because John Chafee lived, because John Chafee cared, because John Chafee was a United States Senator. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my objections to the Africa trade bill. I have listened to how this bill will help those countries on the African Subcontinent, and I support that goal. However, Mr. President, what I don't support is watching mills close in my State, and around the country, and having to tell these people that they no longer have jobs because cheap labor overseas has either caused their company to go out of business or move overseas. 
   At the same time, I don't believe that this legislation will serve the intended purpose of helping to raise the living standards of Africans through increased trade and economic cooperation between the United States and African countries. In order for this to occur, workers need to be paid well, treated well and have a suitable workplace. Workers in many countries in both Africa and the Caribbean Basin are subjected to abusive conditions at work while their governments remain uninvolved, or, with government complicity. This legislation does not have the provisions necessary to guarantee that the workers in these countries receive the benefits of U.S.-Africa trade. 
   In addition, being from Maine, I understand the importance of balancing the needs of loggers with the desires of environmentalists. This legislation would result in increased rates of logging, which has been cited as the greatest threat to Africa's remaining native forests. As only eight percent of Africa's forests still exist in large undisturbed tracts, forcing African nations to give even more access to foreign logging companies could be fatal to these vital tropical forests. 
   In the last 57 months, from December 1994 to September 1999, the U.S. apparel industry has lost 309,000 jobs. The textile industry has lost 128,000 jobs, for a total of 437,000 American jobs lost. 
   My home state of Maine has seen its fair share of lost jobs as well. Since 1994, 26,500 Mainers have been told that they no longer have a job to provide for them and their families. I have heard some of my colleagues state that this legislation is about jobs. Well, I am unwilling to trade well-paying jobs with benefits for lower paying ones--but that's precisely what's happened under our ill-conceived trade agreements. As the trade deficit and globalization of U.S. industries have grown, more quality jobs have been lost to imports than have been gained in the lower-paying sectors that are experiencing rapid export growth. Increased import shares have displaced almost twice as many high-paying, high-skill jobs than increased exports have created. 
   It was my concern about the impact of foreign labor on the American job market, Mr. President, that led me to oppose passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993. Unfortunately, NAFTA has become a trade agreement whose provisions are not adequately enforced--to  the detriment of the United States, our industries, and our workers. 
   I am in agreement with my distinguished colleague from South Carolina, 
   Senator HOLLINGS, in his assessment of NAFTA last week. We were told that NAFTA would create jobs in America. I have seen in my state that they were wrong.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the more than 9.1 million women business owners nationwide on the occasion of National Business Women's Week. This week marks the celebration of the 71st annual National Business Women's Week. 
   On this occasion, advocates for women business owners may have a well-deserved sense of pride. I am pleased to be able to report that between 1987 and 1999, the number of women-owned businesses increased by 103 percent nationwide, employment increased by 320 percent, and sales grew by 436 percent. Today, women business owners across the country employ more than 27.5 million people and generate in excess of $3.6 trillion in sales. These businesses account for 38 percent of all U.S. businesses. 
   In my home State of Maine, there are more than 48,200 women-owned businesses, employing 91,700 people and generating $10.2 billion in sales. For Maine's economy, this represents growth of more than 85.3 percent between 1987 and 1996. 
   Mr. President, this data demonstrates just how vital women and women-owned businesses are to the health of the U.S. economy. Although women-owned businesses have grown at an astronomical rate, we must continue to ensure that women have access to the knowledge and capital necessary to start their own businesses. 
   That is why I ask that, as we celebrate the tremendous accomplishments of women during National Business Women's Week, my fellow colleagues join me in supporting opportunities for women to become entrepreneurs. 
   As a member of the Senate Small Business Committee, I am proud of the role the Committee and the Small Business Administration have played in providing access to assistance from women entrepreneurs, 
   because many of the businesses in this rapidly growing sector are small businesses. Just last month, the Committee reported legislation, the Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act, that would significantly increase funding for the Women's Business Centers Program, which provides women with long-term training and counseling in all aspects of owning and managing a business--fostering the growth of women's business ownership and providing a foundation of basic support to women business owners. 
   This program promotes the growth of women-owned businesses by sponsoring business training and technical counseling, access to credit and capital, and access to marketing opportunities, including Federal contracts and export opportunities. Over the past 10 years, the program has served tens of thousands of women entrepreneurs by providing them with consulting, training, and financial assistance as they seek to start or expand their own business. As a result, women are starting new firms at twice the rate of all other business, and employ roughly one in every five U.S. workers. Today, the program is comprised of nearly 70 centers in 40 States. 
   In my view, creating new opportunities for historically disadvantaged groups, such as women and minorities to help provide tangible opportunities for economic independence must remain a top priority, and National Business Women's Week is a perfect opportunity to focus attention on the importance of such efforts. 
   In closing, I would like to express my appreciation to the Business and Professional Women/USA organization, which has played a pivotal role in making the celebration of National Business Women's Week possible. 
   Since its creation in 1928, National Business Women's Week has been sponsored by Business and Professional Women/USA for the purpose of recognizing and honoring the achievements of working women. 
   Business and Professional Women/USA local organizations across the country, and in my state of Maine, will take this week to honor outstanding business women and employers of the year, and I would like to congratulate them and thank them for their important contributions.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President I rise today to oppose the so-called ``Partial Birth'' Abortion Ban. 
   In 1973 the Supreme Court held that women have a constitutional right to an abortion. That decision--Roe v. Wade--was carefully crafted to be both balanced and responsible while holding the rights of women in America paramount in reproductive decisions. This decision held that women have a constitutional right to an abortion, but after viability, states could ban abortions as long as they allowed exceptions for cases in which a woman's life or health is endangered. 
   The legislation before us today is in direct violation of the Court's ruling. It does not ban postviability abortions as its sponsors claim, but it does ban an abortion procedure regardless of where the woman is in her pregnancy. And this legislation, as drafted, does not provide an exception for the health of the mother as required by law, and provides a very narrow life exception. In fact, the legislation's exception only allows that the ban, and please let me quote from the bill here, ``shall not apply to a partial-birth abortion that is necessary to save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or injury.'' Not her health, but only her life. 
   There is no question that any abortion is an emotional, wrenching decision for a woman. No one would debate this. And when a woman must confront this decision during the later stages of a pregnancy because she knows the pregnancy presents a direct threat to her own life or health, the ramifications of such a decision multiply dramatically. 
   We stand on the floor of this body day after day and pontificate on laws, treaties, appropriations bills, and budget resolutions. But how often do we really, truly consider how a piece of legislation will affect someone specific ..... a wife or a husband ..... a mother or a father? And I don't mean knowing how the budget numbers or appropriations will generally help our constituents, I mean considering the very, very personal lives of our constituents.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, Barbara and her husband had been ecstatic when they discovered that they were expecting a child--an unborn daughter they would name Tristan. But this anticipation and delight turned to profound sorrow when, at 20 weeks into the pregnancy Tristan was diagnosed with a rare genetic disease called Edwards' syndrome. An extra chromosome in Tristan's DNA had caused lethal abnormalities. 
   The Sun Journal reports that ``Their daughter would have severe heart and gastrointestinal problems, they were told. In an ultrasound image, they could already see cystic tissue forming on top of Tristan's brain and partly outside of the skull tissue. The shape of her stomach and diaphragm muscle were abnormal. Her diaphragm was perforated. Her stomach was growing in her heart and lung cavity. In all likelihood Tristan wouldn't be born alive. She probably would suffocate before that because her lungs would be so underdeveloped. Barbara and her husband were told that no surgery could or would be possible.'' In fact, doctors predicted that Tristan would probably die before she was born. And if not, she had a 95 percent chance of dying before her first birthday. 
   Barbara told the Sun Journal that ``It seemed to us that it would be cruel, that it would be absolute torture to put our little girl through the pregnancy. ..... With her heart and her lungs being crushed by her stomach and her diaphragm. We were worrying what it would feel like. What sensation she might be experiencing as the cystic tissue continued to grow on her brain.'' And as Barbara and her husband consulted other medical specialists and prayed over the fate of their daughter, Barbara remembers that ``I was so afraid for my baby. I didn't want her to feel any pain in the last hours of her life....... It wasn't really life yet. She wasn't born.'' 
   Barbara remembers that ``Loving the baby was never part of the discussion...... Of course you would love the baby no matter what was going on, disability or healthy. I think sometimes there's a misperception about that, that love might be conditional based on whether it's a perfect fetus or not.'' 
   This family in Maine is what the debate today is really about--when does the State have the right to tell Barbara and her husband that they cannot have the abortion they believe to be the best medical procedure? A procedure that will protect her health and her future fertility? At the very end of her story, Barbara tells the Sun Journal that women who have abortions are unfortunately ``portrayed as some kind of careless monsters without any kind of moral direction. The people who know me would be aghast that that's how I'm seen by people who don't even know me.'' 
   I stand before this body today and I am saddened that there are those out there who would so judge Barbara and her husband. Because I do believe they have moral direction--and I don't believe that I or my fellow Senators should be able to tell them when a decision such as this is wrong or medically inappropriate. I don't believe that I have the medical training necessary to decide when one type of medical procedure is best used over an alternative procedure. 
   And let there be no doubt about it, this legislation does nothing but create an inflammatory political issue. This legislation does nothing to end postviability abortion--nothing--or to prevent unwanted pregnancies. And courts around the country have recognized this. 
   In fact, of the 30 states that have enacted legislation banning so-called ``partial birth'' abortions, there have been 21 court challenges and 19 of these challenges have been either partially or fully enjoined while their constitutionality is considered. Four U.S. Courts of Appeal have ruled on the issue--and just this September, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed three trial court injunctions on partial birth abortion bans in Arkansas, Iowa, and Nebraska. 
   When the Kentucky District Court overturned its State's ban on these so-called ``partial birth'' abortions this year, the author of the decision, the Honorable John G. Heyburn, II, said ``By adopting a considerably less precise definition of a partial birth abortion, the legislature not only defined the terms of its prohibition, but also said a lot about its own collective intent. Though the Act calls itself a partial birth abortion ban, it is not. The  title is misleading, both medically and historically. ..... A few [legislators] seem to disregard the constitutional arguments and push for language which they believed would make abortions more controllable.'' 
   And though proponents of this legislation claim that these bans address only one abortion procedure, courts have disagreed. Last year, the Honorable Charles P. Kocoras, a U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, also struck down an Illinois law banning these so-called partial birth abortions. In his opinion Judge Kocoras stated that, ``[The Act] has the potential effect of banning the most common and safest abortion procedures....... To ensure that her conduct does not fall within the statute's reach, the physician will probably stop performing [all] such procedures....... Because the standard in [the Act] effectively chills physicians from performing most abortion procedures, the statue is an undue burden on a woman's constitutional right to seek an abortion before viability.'' 
   And this year, the Honorable G. Thomas Porteous, writing for U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana said that the Louisiana ``Partial Birth'' Abortion ban ``advances neither maternal health nor potential life and clearly would create undue burdens on a woman's right to choose abortion. At most, the Act may force women seeking abortions to accept riskier or costlier abortion procedures which nevertheless result in fetal death.'' 
   Riskier or costlier? At what price? Can you ask Barbara and her husband to risk that? They desperately wanted their baby--and though they were faced with losing her they knew that they would want to try again. Four years later they have a beautiful 2 1/2 -year-old daughter. But they would not have this daughter nor even had the chance to try again had Barbara been forced to have a procedure that threatened her ability to have another child. What if the riskier or costlier procedure Judge Porteous referred to had been a total hysterectomy? 
   Is this what we really want? To put Barbara's health and life at risk? To put women's health and lives at risk? Shouldn't these most critical decisions be left to those with medical training, and not politicians? 
   I believe so. I believe that a decision such as this should only be discussed between a woman, her family, and her physician. I am absolutely and fundamentally opposed to all post-viability abortions except in the instances of preserving the life of or preventing grievous physical injury to the woman. This legislation neither provides for those exceptions nor does it prevent post-viability abortions. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Exhibit I  
   Abortion: One Woman's Story  
   For weeks Barbara and her husband had consulted medical experts and researched scientific journals. They meditated and prayed. 
   To the visible mound protruding above her waist Barbara spoke quietly, lovingly. She sang to it. She sometimes felt the light flutter of kicks. 
   The day before final tests had confirmed the diagnosis, Barbara and her husband had named their unborn daughter Tristan, which means tears and sadness. 
   Then the time came for Barbara's decision. 
   It's not the kind of choice that any mother ever wants to have to make. 
   She would have an abortion.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I would like to salute five outstanding young women who have been honored with the Girl Scout Gold Awards by the Abnaki Girl Scout Council in Brewer, ME. The are Jodie Comer, Kaitlin Coffin, Jessie Mellott, Sara Agouab, and Michelle McLaughlin. These young women will receive their award at a ceremony this Sunday, October 17. 
   The Girl Scout Gold Award is the highest achievement award in U.S. Girl Scouting and it symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service, career planning, and personal development.  
   In having this honor bestowed upon them, Jodie, Kaitlin, Jessie, Sara, and Michelle have shown that they are dedicated and committed to these qualities, and, just as important, that they enjoy what they are doing. For their parents, family and friends, this is a proud moment--and, as a Mainer, I share this feeling. 
   To reach this goal a Girl Scout must earn four interest project patches, the Career Exploration Pin, the Senior Girl Scout Leadership Award, and the Senior Girl Scout Challenge, as well as design and implement a Girl Scout Gold Award project. A plan for fulfilling these requirements is created by the Senior Girl Scout and is carried out through close cooperation between the girl and an adult Girl Scout volunteer. All of the girls throughout the United States who have earned this award have fulfilled a personal goal which will benefit them in the years to come. 
   For their project, Jodie Comer, Michelle McLaughlin, and Sara Agouab researched, designed, and produced a booklet on auto care and maintenance for women. In addition, they put on an auto care workshop for cadette and senior Girl Scouts. Kaitlin Coffin and Jessie Mellott produced a video to help recruit and retain younger girls in Girl Scouting. 
   I have always been, and will continue to be, supportive of the Girl Scouts and recognize the important values that it instills in young people, such as service, honesty and leadership. By helping to form the character of young women, the Girl Scouts makes a lasting contribution on the lives of people throughout Maine and the United States. 
   I know that my Senate colleagues join me in offering my congratulations to these young women for what they have accomplished. This prestigious award is a testament to their convictions and individual commitment to serve those in their community for the betterment of society.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2000 contains a provision allowing the Navy to apply up to $190 million in FY 2000 advanced procurement funding to the DDG-51 multiyear procurement contracts renewed by Section 122 of the same legislation. 
   Are my colleagues, the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the Majority Leader, and the senior Senator from Mississippi, aware of any provision of the FY 2000 Defense Appropriations Conference Report that conflicts with Section 122 of the FY 2000 National Defense Authorization Act?

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to once again reiterate my support for the reauthorization of the very successful Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, and I must vote against the FY2000 Agriculture appropriations conference report without its reauthorization. This past Thursday night, I came to the Senate floor to urge my colleagues to consider certain points that should prove that support of the Compact is justified and I would like to briefly reiterate them again today. 
   The Northeast Dairy Compact has addressed the needs of states in New England who compacted together within their region to determine fair prices for locally produced supplies of fresh milk. All of their legislatures and the governors approved the Compact and all that is required is the sanction of Congress to reauthorize it. 
   The Compact has proven to be an effective approach to address farm insecurity. The Compact has protected New England farmers against the loss of their small family dairy farms and the consumers against a decrease in the fresh local supply of milk. The Compact has stabilized the dairy industry in this entire region and protected farmers and consumers against volatile price swings. 
   Mr. President, over ninety seven percent of the fluid milk market in New England is self contained within the area, and fluid milk markets are local due to the demand for freshness and because of high transportation costs, so any complaints raised in other areas about unfair competition are quite disingenuous. 
   All we are asking, Mr. President, is the continuation of the Northeast Dairy Compact, the existence of which does not threaten or financially harm any other dairy farmer in the country. 
   Only the consumers and the processors in the New England region pay to support the minimum price to provide for a fairer return to the area's family dairy farmers and to protect a way of life important to the people of the Northeast. 
   Under the Compact, New England retail milk prices have been among the lowest and the most stable in the country. The opposition has tried to make the argument that interstate dairy compacts increase milk prices. This is just not so as milk prices around the U.S. have shown time and time again that prices elsewhere are higher and experience much wider price shifts than in the Northeast Compact states. 
   Also, where is the consumer outrage from the Compact states for spending a few extra pennies for fresh fluid milk so as to ensure a safety net for dairy farmers so that they can continue an important way of life? I have not heard any swell of outrage of consumer complaints over the last three years. Why, because the consumers also realize this initial pilot project has been a huge success. 
   Mr. President, there is almost $8 billion in the Agriculture Appropriations Conference Report for farm disasters partially created by competition in the global marketplace and because of a series of weather-related problems. The funding will be paid for by the federal government. Now, some of my colleagues want to create a disaster situation for Northeast dairy farmers by taking away a program that has not cost the federal government one cent. There has been no expense to the federal government--not one penny--for the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. The costs to operate the Dairy Compact are borne entirely by the farmers and processors of the Compact region. And, when there has been a rise in the federal milk marketing prices for Class I fluid milk, the Compact has automatically shut itself off from the pricing process. 
   In addition, the Compact requires the compact commission to take such action as necessary to ensure that a minimum price set by the commission for the region does not create an incentive for producers to generate additional supplies of milk. There has been no rush to increase milk production in the Northeast as has been stated here today. There are compensation procedures that are implemented by the New England Dairy Commission specifically to protect against increased production of fresh milk. No other region should feel threatened by our Northeast Dairy Compact for fluid milk produced and sold mainly at home.

   Ms. SNOWE. An important point here, Mr. President, is that, despite what has been said on the Senate floor today, the Eastern region of the country from Maine to Florida--the very states that wish to compact--sold no surplus dairy products to the USDA this past fiscal year. All Commodity Credit Corporation purchases came from the Western and Midwest states. 
   And, despite what has been stated by the opposition, there are no added costs to the federal nutrition program. There has been no adverse price impact on the WIC program--the Women's Infants and Children's program--or the Federal school lunch and breakfast programs. In fact, the advocates of these programs support the Compact and serve on its commission. 
   So, I ask for the support of my colleagues today for my dairy farmers in Maine and to vote against the Agriculture Appropriations Conference Report because it does not include the reauthorization of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact as the State of Maine and every other New England state legislature, governor and its citizens have requested, and I thank the Chair.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his effort and cooperation. 
   With this debate on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, the Senate discharges one of its most fundamental and solemn duties, the stewardship of our national defense. I think there is little question among us that a world free of nuclear weapons would be a world more secure. Obviously, we all look forward to the day when we do not have to rely on our nuclear stockpile as a necessary deterrent. We know full well over 80 percent of the American people share that point of view. But the fact is, that day has not yet arrived. Until it does, as the world's last remaining superpower, we walk a line both fine and blurred. This debate must be about how we walk that line. It should be about how we balance our clear and shared interests in a nuclear-free planet within the reality of a post-cold-war world. 
   The reality is this: At the same time the world looks to us to provide leadership in stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons, so, too, does it rely upon us for a credible nuclear deterrent that will keep in check international aggressors, nations that seek to undermine democracy and freedom. That is the challenge before us, to move towards our shared goal in a responsible and measured manner, ever mindful  that a post-cold-war world does not mean a world devoid of duplicity or danger. That is the dynamic we can neither escape nor ignore. That is the dynamic that must inform each and every one of us as we consider the ramification of a zero-yield treaty of unlimited duration. 
   The question is not whether we support nonproliferation measures. We obviously make that as one of our key national security objectives. The question is, Are we going to support a treaty that is a significant departure from what every Chief Executive of the atomic age, except President Clinton, has laid down for criteria in any test ban treaty? Are we going to support a treaty predicated on a program that is yet to be tested and may remain unproven for decades? Are we going to support a treaty that assumes reliable verification when we know we cannot always detect low-level tests, when we know that rogue nations such as North Korea, Iraq, or Iran could develop crude first-generation nuclear devices with no testing at all? In fact, the CIA Director George Tenet stated, back in 1997, in response to questions submitted to him by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence:  
   Nuclear testing is not required for an acquisition of a basic nuclear weapons capability. Tests using high explosive detonations only could provide reasonable confidence in the performance of a first generation device. Nuclear testing becomes critical only when a program moves beyond basic designs, incorporating more advanced concepts.  
   We cannot even verify what is going on in Iraq with Saddam Hussein. We all recall we set up an onsite inspection program as a condition for his surrender in the Persian Gulf war. Today he has systematically and unilaterally dismantled the U.N. weapons inspection system regime. 
   So these are the pressing issues that confront us about the ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. That is why I am disappointed, regretting that we have had politics permeate both sides of the political aisle, both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue with respect to this debate. Because the ratification of any treaty, and certainly this one, is a solemn and unique responsibility for the Senate, and we should accord this debate the level of gravity it deserves. It is not just about process and procedure. It is certainly not about politics. It is about policy; what is in the best interests of this country as well as the security interests of the world. What is at stake is no less than our ability to stop proliferation and to ensure at the same time the continued viability of our stockpile. 
   When we get into debates about procedure and process, I think it ignores the overwhelming magnitude and gravity of the centerpieces of this treaty. We should not be making this agreement a political football. Duty, a constitutional duty, compels us to look at the facts before us. 
   I can tell you, after I sat through hours of deliberations and testimony on the Armed Services Committee last week, the facts are not reassuring. I know there is an honest difference of opinion among experts, among former Secretaries of Defense. But you have to look at the honest difference of opinion and take pause when you have six former Secretaries of Defense, two former Clinton administration CIA Directors, four former National Security Advisers, and three former National Weapons Lab Directors, all opposing the treaty before us. 
   Why? Because they believe a no-testing, unlimited duration policy at this time would fatally undermine confidence in the reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile as a sturdy hedge against the aggressive intent of once and future tyrants. That is a risk we simply cannot afford to take. 
   Consider the backdrop of the Rumsfeld Commission report in 1998. We are all too familiar with the stark fact that North Korea, Iran, and Iraq, to name a few, would be able to inflict major destruction on the United States within 5 to 10 years of making a decision to acquire ballistic missile capabilities. 
   Thanks to the testimony last week of three current National Weapons Laboratory Directors, we also know full well that the very program the administration proposes to rely on to monitor the safety, effectiveness, efficiency, and accuracy of the arsenal is between 10 and 20 years away from being fully validated and operational, and that is assuming it will work. That is 10 to 20 years. We could have weapons in our stockpile left untested and unproven for decades while rogue states acquire the means of mass destruction. 
   That is what we are addressing today fundamentally: a treaty that has ultimately been negotiated by this administration with a noble long-range goal that almost everyone accepts but one which requires this country to accept an unproven and incomplete computer-model-based system for the security of our nuclear deterrent in this age of weapons proliferation. In other words, we put the cart before the horse. We ought to know that our Stockpile Stewardship Program works first before we commit to any zero-yield, unlimited-duration treaty. 
   As the Director of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, Dr. Tarter, testified to the committee last week, the program is an approach that the country must pursue ``short of a return to a robust schedule of nuclear testing.'' By closing the door entirely, we would be making a question mark of our nuclear stockpile. 
   As President Bush reminded us in 1993, one-third of all U.S. nuclear weapons designs fielded since 1958--one-third--have required nuclear testing to correct deficiencies after deployment. 
   In his words:  
   The requirement to maintain and improve the safety of our nuclear stockpile and to evaluate and maintain the reliability of U.S. forces necessitates continued nuclear testing for those purposes, albeit at a modest level, for the foreseeable future.  
   Even within the Clinton administration, these conditions found a voice. According to Mr. Robert Bell, a member of the National Security Council staff, soon before President Clinton released his August 1995 statement of support for the treaty, Defense Department officials argued that the United States should continue to reserve the right to conduct underground nuclear tests at a threshold of 150 kilotons or below. 
   That would seem to be the prudent course on what we know at this moment in time. It is yet another fact today that we face a real danger of fewer and fewer scientists with the first-hand knowledge that comes from a testing process. Indeed, of the 85 remaining nuclear weapons experts at the Los Alamos and Livermore Laboratories today, only 35 have coordinated live underground tests. 
   Even as early as 1994, barely 18 months after the United 
   States stopped underground nuclear testing, a report from the Congressional Research Service sounded an alarm, and my colleagues would be wise to read it. Back in 1994, it sounded the alarm that:  
   These trends ..... threaten to undercut U.S. ability to maintain the safety, reliability, and performance of its warheads; to correct defects that are discovered or that result from aging; and to remanufacture warheads. They also work at cross-purposes with President Clinton's declaration that the United States will maintain the capability to resume testing if needed.  
   Again, we must remember that these considerations must be made in the context of a treaty that raises the bar by allowing absolutely no testing at any level in perpetuity. 
   As Dr. John Nuckolls, the former Director of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, put it, even an ``extended duration test ban'' would trigger the loss of all nuclear trained expert personnel as well as ``major gaps in our understanding of scientific explosives.'' 
   Again, the CRS in 1994 in its report said:  
   This skills loss is in its greatest jeopardy.  
   Director Tarter, the current Director of Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, testified before our committee last week. What did he say in his testimony?  
   It is a race against time. Before long, our nuclear test veterans will be gone.  
   We are counting on our current cadre of experienced scientists to help develop and install the new tools that are only now starting to come online. 
   We have now heard from our Directors: A minimum of 10 years and maybe as high as 20 years from now, the Stockpile Stewardship Program will be determined to be workable. 
   We have the loss of our nuclear scientists trained in the testing field. That is a safety net we cannot do without as we walk the tightrope of sustaining a credible strategic nuclear deterrent and aggressively promoting  global arms control. Consider that our successive agreements with the Soviet Union, and now Russia, will eventually reduce the entire American nuclear warhead stock to about 25 percent of its peak size in the cold war. Consider also that we maintain only 9 categories of nuclear weapons today from a level of more than 30 in 1985. 
   We are making remarkable strides, as we should, on our priorities in the arms control arena. But knowledge about the arms we must sustain as bulwarks against future military conflicts cannot be lost, and this fact suggests that time has not ripened for the United States to sacrifice a 50-year, fool-proof position to keep the testing option open as unprecedented arms reductions have occurred and must continue. Indeed, the administration itself agrees we need a viable strategic nuclear arsenal to deter conflicts that could arise in critical areas such as the Middle East, the western Pacific, or northern Asia. 
   In the view of the vast majority of treaty opponents and supporters alike who submitted opinions and testimony to the Armed Services Committee last week, the Stockpile Stewardship Program will produce low levels of confidence in many aspects of nuclear warhead capability for at least a decade to come and perhaps more. 
   Perhaps Dr. Robinson, the Director of the Sandia National Laboratory, put it best and simplest when he told the committee:  
   Confidence on the reliability and safety of the nuclear weapons stockpile will eventually decline without nuclear testing.  
   It was expert scientists, not politicians, who told the committee that the Stockpile Stewardship Program brings the U.S. nuclear weapons complex into uncharted waters of reliability. 
   So, too, is confidence key when it comes to another vital component of this treaty, and that is verification. At first glance, the technology behind the treaty's verification regime seems airtight. Article IV of the accord establishes a joint international monitoring system and international data center with a total of 337 facilities around the world. If these installations detect a potentially illegal underground explosion that subsequent diplomacy cannot resolve, the accusing state may request an onsite inspection. 
   Fair enough, you might say, until you read the fine print. Then you discover that the onsite inspection provision requires an affirmative vote by 30 of the 51 members of the Executive Council of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organization authorized under article II, an awfully high threshold. Article II does not give the United States or any of its allies permanent or rotating seats on the Council. 
   That is not all. Science itself throws a wrench into the treaty's verification mechanism. 
   According to a 1995 study by the Mitre Corporation, an established scientific research center, neither the National Technical Means of the United States nor the Monitoring System envisioned by the treaty can detect very low-yield or zero-yield tests. 
   Finally, article V of the treaty establishes ``measures to ensure compliance.'' The most important of these measures entrusts the Conference of States Parties, the treaty's ratifying governments, to refer urgent cases to the United Nations Security Council, a forum in which Russia or China could exercise a unilateral veto. 
   In other words, article V could mean if the United States diagnosed an imminent nuclear danger in a strategic region of the world, Moscow or Beijing might emerge as the final courts of appeal for sanctions or other punitive acts. 
   The day for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty may come where we could have a zero-nuclear testing regime for an unlimited period of time. It may arrive. And we may be confident that we will be able to verify that level, as well as the low-level detections of other countries when it comes to explosions. But I think we have to consider the facts as we know them now. 
   I think we have to look very carefully at the troubling aspects of the Stockpile Stewardship Program and whether it is a viable alternative to nuclear testing. In the strategic and scientific communities many say it is not, and maybe we will not know for 10 to 20 years. That is what we are predicating our nuclear deterrent strategy on. 
   So we have to vote--if we do vote today or tomorrow--on what we know today. We may know something differently in the future. But I submit that we cannot subject our security interests to what we might know 20 years from now. 
   I hope we will defer the vote on ratification because of all the current concerns that I and others have cited. We would do well to heed the advice of the letter that was submitted to the majority leader asking for deferral, the letter that was written by Henry Kissinger; John Deutch, a former CIA Director for the administration; and Brent Scowcroft, that we should defer until we can give more consideration to all of the issues that are before the Senate with respect to this treaty. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator. 
   Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Agriculture conference report. I rise in strong opposition to the conference report. 
   First, I wish to commend my colleague from Vermont, Senator JEFFORDS, for his leadership, for his perseverance, for his hard work and determination on behalf of all the small dairy farmers, not only in his State of Vermont but in the State of Maine and throughout New England. I thank him. I commend him for the extraordinary effort he has displayed and exhibited throughout this process. 
   It is only regrettable that those members of the conference committee in resolving the differences between the House and the Senate on the Agriculture conference report did not recognize the position that has been held by all of us who represent the New England States for the Northeast Dairy Compact. That is why I rise in strong opposition to the Agriculture appropriations conference report because it does not extend a reauthorization of the Northeast Dairy Compact. 
   This issue is a States rights issue more than anything else. Quite simply, it addresses the needs of the States in the Northeast, and most specifically those in New England, that have organized in a way that we can allow fair prices for locally produced supplies of fresh milk. 
   All the legislatures have approved the compact in New England, and in the Northeast, and all that is required is the sanction of Congress to reauthorize this compact. The compact has protected New England farmers against the loss of their small family dairy farms and consumers against the decrease in the fresh supply of local milk. The compact has proven to be an effective approach to address farm insecurity. The compact has stabilized the dairy industry in this entire region and has protected farmers and consumers against volatile price swings. 
   As I say, we are talking about small dairy farmers. In my State of Maine, the farmer has an average of 50 cows on their farm. They are trying to preserve a way of life, a way of life that has been there for families for generations. We are trying to protect them through this dairy compact. 
   All we are asking from this Congress is a reauthorization so we can extend this way of life to small dairy farmers--not agribusiness, not big business, not co-ops, just small dairy farmers who want to produce milk so they can sell it to the consumers in my State of Maine, to Senator JEFFORDS' State of Vermont, and within the New England region. 
   Over 97 percent of the fluid milk market in New England is self-contained. Fluid milk markets are local due to the demand for freshness and high transportation cost. So any complaints raised from other parts of the country about unfair competition is quite disingenuous. 
   All we are asking for is a continuation of the Northeast Dairy Compact, the existence of which does not threaten or financially harm any other dairy farmer in the country--not any other dairy farmer in the country. It is to help our dairy farmers within New England, to help the consumers, to help a way of life. The Northeast Dairy Compact currently encompasses the New England States and only applies to fluid milk sold on grocery store shelves in the Northeast. 
   Only the consumers and the processors in the New England region pay to support the minimum price to protect a fair return to the areas' family dairy farmers and to protect a way of life important to the people of Northeast. 
   All six of the New England States have supported this through the acts of the legislature, and through all of their Governors, because each Governor has signed a resolution supporting the Northeast Dairy Compact. 
   Let me repeat. Every Governor and every State legislature in New England have supported the dairy compact. Republicans, Democrats, and Independents support the dairy compact through acts of the legislatures because they recognize how important this compact is to the small dairy farmers in the Northeast. 
   Under the compact, New England retail milk prices have been among the lowest and the most stable in the country. The opposition--again, we have heard it day in and day out--has manufactured arguments against the compact, saying that increased milk prices. 
   Let's look at dairy prices over the past few months around the country for a gallon of fresh milk. The price in Augusta, ME, ranged from $2.89 to $2.99 per gallon from February to April of 1999; in Boston, MA, the market price stayed perfectly stable at $2.89 from February to April of 1999; the price in Seattle ranged from $3.39 to $3.56 over the same time period. Washington State is not in the compact. Yet their milk was approximately 50 cents higher per gallon than in the State of Maine. The range in Los Angeles was from $3.19 to $3.29; in San Diego, the range was from $3.10 to $3.62. California is not in the compact. Las Vegas prices were $2.99 all the way up to $3.62 in that time period; not much price stability there. And then Nevada is not in the compact. In Philadelphia the range was $2.78 to $3.01 per gallon, not as wide a shift as Nevada but a much wider price shift than the Northeast Compact States. 
   That is why Pennsylvania dairy farmers want to join us. That is why Pennsylvania supports joining the compact. 
   Denver, CO, on the other hand, is not in the compact. A gallon of milk in Denver has cost consumers anywhere from $3.45 to $3.59 over the past few months, over one half a dollar more than in New England. 
   The Northeast Dairy Compact has not resulted in higher milk prices in  New England in spite of what the opposition has said, but milk prices are among the lowest in the country and are among the most stable. 
   Opponents also say consumers are getting a raw deal having to spend more on milk. Obviously, based on what I have said thus far in terms of prices around the country, this claim is inaccurate, as prices are among the lowest in the Northeast Compact area and reflect greater price stability. 
   Also, where is the consumer outrage from the compact States for spending a few extra pennies for fresh fluid milk so as to ensure a safety net for dairy farmers so they can continue in an important way of life. Where is that consumer outrage? It isn't in New England. I have not heard of consumer complaints in my State over the last 3 years as a result of this dairy compact, even in instances where milk prices might have gone up a few pennies because consumers support our dairy farmers. They realize that this pilot program is very important to a way of life, to the kind of milk they want in their region, and they are willing to support it. They recognize this dairy compact has been a huge success. 
   The Compact Commission sent out over $4 million in checks to Northeast dairy farmers this past month. That averages to over $1,000 for each dairy farmer--enough to help keep small family farmers in business and continue a historical way of life that is so important. 
   The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has provided the very safety net that we have hoped for when the compact passed as part of the Freedom to Farm Act, the omnibus farm bill of 1996. The dairy compact has helped farmers maintain the stable price for fluid milk during times of volatile swings in farm milk prices. 
   In the spring and summer months of 1997 and 1998, for instance, when milk prices throughout most of the country dropped at least 20 cents a gallon while consumers' prices remained constant, the payments to the Northeast Interstate Compact dairy farmers remained above the Federal milk marketing prices for class 1 fluid milk because of the dairy compact and I might add, at no expense to the Federal Government. The costs to operate the dairy compact are borne entirely by the farmers and the processes of a compact region. 
   Also, consider what has happened to the number of dairy farmers staying in business since the formation of the dairy compact. Another goal of the compact is to preserve a way of life of the small dairy farmer. It is now known throughout New England there has been a decline in dairy farmers going out of business. This is a clear demonstration that with the dairy compact, the dairy producers were provided a safety net, which is what we had hoped for. The results have been just that. 
   In addition, the compact requires the Compact Commission to take such action as necessary to ensure that a minimum price set by the commission for the region does not create an incentive for producers to generate additional supplies of milk. There has been no rush to increase milk production in the Northeast, as has been stated. Oh, we heard time and time again by the opposition that it would increase milk production. 
   We inserted in the compact legislation back in 1996 compensation producers that have been implemented by the New England Dairy Commission specifically to protect against increased production of fresh milk. That legislation in the 1996 farm bill required the commission to reimburse the USDA for any portion of the Government's cost of purchasing surplus dairy products that could be attributed to an increase in milk production in the Northeast in excess of the projected national 
   average. This provision was included in the farm bill in response to critics' concern that the compact price would lead to overproduction of milk in the Northeast and thus cause Government purchases of surplus milk under the dairy support program to rise. 
   Between March and September of 1998, the commission placed $2 million in escrow in anticipation of a potential liability to USDA for surplus purchases. The commission ended up paying $1.76 million to the USDA toward the end of the fiscal year and returned unused escrow funds of $400,000 to the Northeast producers who did not increase milk production during fiscal year 1998. 
   I welcome anybody in this Chamber to cite any other commodity farm program that actually paid back the Federal Government money, that didn't cost the Government any money. I daresay there is no other instance of any other commodity farm program that actually reimbursed the Federal Government, that didn't cost the Government one dime--other than the New England Dairy Compact. 
   How can other regions of the country feel threatened by a Northeast Dairy Compact for fluid milk produced and sold mainly at home in our region of the country? This compact did what it said it would do: Preserve its way of life, create price stability; it didn't cost the Government money; it didn't increase production, and if it did in any small way, we reimbursed the Government so it wouldn't cost any money. 
   Despite what has been stated by the opposition, again there has been no additional cost to the Federal nutrition programs, no adverse price impact in the WIC Program--the Women's, Infants and Children Program--or the Federal school lunch and breakfast program. In fact, the advocates of the programs support the compact and serve on its commission. 
   It should be noted that in the farm bill conference in 1996, the Secretary of Agriculture was required to review the dairy compact legislation before implementation to determine if there was compelling public interest for the compact within the compact region. In August 9, 1996, and only after a public comment period, Secretary Glickman authorized the implementation of the dairy compact, finding that it was, indeed, in the compelling public interest to do so. 
   In addition, another mechanism for guaranteeing that this was in their interest, that it wasn't going to cost money to the Federal Government, the Agricultural Appropriations Act of 1998 directed the Office of Management and Budget to study the economic effects of the compact and especially its effect in the Federal food and nutrition programs. Key findings of the OMB study released in February 1998 showed that, for the first 6 months of the compact, the New England retail milk prices were 5 cents per gallon lower than retail milk prices nationally. 
   Also, a GAO study stated that the compact economically benefited the dairy producers, increasing their income from milk sales by about 6 percent, with no adverse effects to dairy farmers outside the compact region. 
   These were independent studies. We had OMB, GAO, we had every safety mechanism and precaution in this legislation, and it has demonstrated time and time again it is in the best interests of our small dairy farmers, not costing the Government money--in fact, to the contrary. 
   The consumers in the Northeast Compact area are showing their willingness to support this compact, to pay a little more for milk if the additional money is going directly to the dairy farmer. Because we are not talking about big corporate farms, we are talking about the small dairy farmer whose family has been in business 100 years, 150 years--generational. That is what they want to do--to maintain their families, to maintain a way of life, and to sell their milk to their local consumers. 
   Environmental organizations have supported dairy compacting as the compact helps to preserve dwindling agricultural land and open spaces that help combat urban sprawl.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my distinguished colleague from Oregon, Senator WYDEN, to discuss legislation we introduced in July concerning prescription drug coverage. The legislation is known as the Seniors Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act, or SPICE. 
   We have come to the floor to address a number of questions that have been raised with respect to our legislation. We want to answer some of those questions so the Members of this body can be informed in terms of what our legislation is all about on this most critical issue. 
   I am also pleased to announce Representatives ROUKEMA and PALLONE have introduced a companion bill to our legislation in the House of Representatives. 
   I have always believed, as being part of the elective process, we have an obligation to serve the people by addressing the problems that are the most immediate and most critical. We are not here solely for the purpose of creating issues so our parties can run on those issues in the next election. Yet it seems all too often now Congress is only focusing on the difference between the two parties, the difference between Congress and the President, instead of focusing on how we can achieve a consensus on the most significant issues facing this country, where we can make a meaningful difference in the lives of our constituents. The people of this country rightfully expect us to legislate good public policy on those issues, to address problems facing this country. 
   Yet, time and again, it seems the more critical issues we face in Congress and in this country are the ones that are the most polarized. Time and time  again, we fail to achieve a consensus on the key issues. The most notable, recently, of course, is the tax cut bill. While we might all have differences in terms of what kind of tax cut bill we should have or how much, there was no difference of opinion with the President or with Congress in terms of having a tax cut but, rather, what the size of that tax cut package should be. People say to me: Where is it going from here? I say: That is a good question. 
   Inevitably, there will be another train wreck, and it doesn't have to be so. We ought to be able to demonstrate to the American people we are very serious about creating solutions, rather than issues, as a platform and a basis for the next election, which, by the way, is more than a year away. It is almost as if compromise has become a lost art. 
   So here we are in September, approaching October, closer and closer to adjournment, and the only thing that will be falling faster than the leaves will be our legislative agenda and the public's faith. America expects us to build bridges and not to draw lines. So often bipartisanship has become a joke. It may well be within the beltway, but I can tell my colleagues, in the real world, it is no laughing matter. 
   That is why Senator WYDEN and I are taking the floor, not only to discuss our legislation but to urge the Members of the Senate and of the Congress, and the President, to come together on this most vital of issues to our Nation's citizens. That is why we are here, because we have introduced a bill that puts the interests of the American people over the best interests of politics, a bill that gives us a chance to show America's 
   seniors and the American people that, yes, we can come together on an issue of great significance to our constituency. 
   I believe that how a society treats its seniors speaks volumes. What does it say that while America is 4 or 5 months shy of its longest expansion ever in the history of this country, while this Nation enjoys an era of unprecedented wealth and prosperity and growth, a third of Medicare recipients still have no insurance coverage whatsoever on one of their most basic health needs, prescription drug coverage? What does it say, when seniors are cutting prescription medications out of their budgets and their lives simply because they cannot make ends meet; they cannot afford to pay for them? 
   What does it say when the New England Journal of Medicine reports that poor elderly persons without Medicaid coverage spend about 50 percent of their total income on out-of-pocket health care costs such as Medicare premiums and prescription drugs? It says: Wait until next year. 
   Wait until next year? That may be good and may be acceptable in the world of sports and elections, but it is not acceptable when it comes to America's seniors and a matter of life and death. For them the status quo is a bitter pill to swallow. 
   Our plan--the only bipartisan one, I might add, in the Senate--represents a straightforward, comprehensive, responsible approach. It will appeal to anyone who wants seniors to have coverage, to have choice, to pay for it in a responsible fashion, to get it done this year, regardless of whether or not we have Medicare reform. 
   How does it work? Instead of reinventing Medicare, because we know that is complicated and contentious, we created a program that builds on the existing medigap system, using the basis and the model of the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, the one that benefits Members of Congress and all Federal employees, and we have choice. So why shouldn't seniors have the same choices that are afforded Members of Congress and Federal employees with respect to their health insurance and to this prescription drug coverage? 
   All Medicare-eligible individuals will have the option of purchasing this plan. It will be voluntary, a supplemental insurance program. It will be similar to medigap. We create a board that will disseminate the information on the choices available. Not only is this approach better for Medicare beneficiaries, but it keeps the costs down by encouraging competition because we have a potential pool of 39 million Medicare beneficiaries. All seniors will receive some premium support assistance on a sliding scale: 100 percent for those with incomes under 150 percent of the poverty level and under, and then it phases out to 175 percent and above to 25 percent, so at least at a minimum 25 percent premium support, and 100 percent for those under 50 percent of poverty level. 
   Individuals will pay for the copayments and the deductibles. The policies will be the threshold standard developed by the board, which will include consumers and State representatives, insurance representatives, commissioners, designed with the seniors' needs in mind. There will be a number of choices based on the need and based on encouraging competition among a number of insurance companies across America because of the size of the pool. 
   The question people ask the most about our plan is, Are you changing seniors' current Medicare program? No. SPICE will not be a part of Medicare. What is more, it is completely optional. Best of all, we pay for it with a reasonable and reliable funding mechanism that would not in any way affect the solvency of Medicare or dip into Social Security surpluses, which is a key issue, both on the Social Security and Medicare question. 
   Senator WYDEN and I, as members of the Budget Committee, last March offered an amendment to the budget resolution. At that time we had an amendment that allowed for the use of surpluses for the financing of a prescription drug program, predicated on the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means, to report out a Medicare reform package. 
   This seemed a great way to create an incentive for Medicare reform and also a way of financing a prescription drug program, given that we will have projected surpluses of a trillion dollars over the next 10 years. 
   But in the event we don't have a reform package--and I hope we do work on it because it is critically important and we should not be deferring this issue, but given the fact that we might not, and given the precarious state of the projected surpluses, Senator WYDEN and I decided to offer another alternative of financing a prescription drug program when the budget came up. 
   We offered an amendment based on the President's proposal to increase the tobacco tax by 55 cents and also accelerate the scheduled tax increase of 15 cents on tobacco. Even though we were defeated on a budgetary point of order that required 60 votes, we got 54 votes. We had a majority of support for financing a prescription drug program through tobacco tax revenues. It makes good policy sense. Columbia University did a study in 1995, and it showed, in that year alone, smoking-related illnesses cost the Medicare program $25 billion or 14 percent of the total expenditures of the Medicare program. There is no reason whatsoever to think those costs have diminished at all. So we think this is a reasonable, logical way to finance a prescription drug program. 
   People may have differences and say: We don't want to raise any kind of tax, even if it is a tobacco tax. But I urge my colleagues that there are other alternatives. We have to have funding. It isn't responsible to introduce a prescription drug program and have no financing mechanism. What we don't want to do with the SPICE program is to add layers of bureaucracy. We are minimizing bureaucracy by creating a board that will maximize oversight. But HCFA will not be presenting this program. We will not affect current Medicare benefits, and we won't be affecting the solvency of the program. 
   I urge the Members of the Senate to give careful consideration to the legislation we are offering. It is critically important. We have the luxury, so to speak, of deferring issues, but our seniors in this country--certainly in the State of Maine--don't have the luxury of deferring their well-being. A third of Medicare enrollees have nothing, not to mention the patchwork quilt involved in the coverage for all the other seniors. 
   Now, if you think it is acceptable for 15 million enrollees in the Medicare program not to have any coverage whatsoever, then fine. But if you are truly concerned about the fact that 15 million Americans have nothing, then I urge you to consider this legislation. 
   Some of our opponents have said, well, the lack of prescription drug coverage isn't a crisis; it is a mirage. They  label our bill, and other bills for prescription drug coverage, a ``solution in search of a problem.'' They use words such as ``misguided,'' ``regressive,'' ``unnecessary,'' and ``fictitious.'' They say our claims about seniors having to choose between drug coverage and filling their cupboards are simply not true. 
   Ask the seniors in my State and all across this country who have written to us and said they are cutting their pills in half, or cutting dosages, or skipping dosages, and not simply filling prescriptions when they get them from the doctor because they are unable to pay for them. That is the bottom line. It will be a big surprise to older Americans if you say it is not a problem. 
   Mr. President, I yield to my colleague, Senator WYDEN from Oregon, 10 minutes.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I commend Senator WYDEN for his idea on having seniors in this country send their prescription drug bills to the Members of the Senate and to their Representatives. It is absolutely critical for people to understand the significance of this issue in the daily lives of our seniors. 
   Doesn't the Senator find it somewhat remarkable there are some in Washington saying there is no crisis among our Nation's seniors when it comes to prescription drug coverage, that this is a fictitious problem? My seniors are telling me: We cannot afford to pay for our prescription drug bills. 
   I met with a senior recently who said she is reducing the number of pills she takes every day because she cannot afford to fill the entire prescription. So she tries to make it last longer. That is a real story. It is happening all across America. 
   I find it somewhat amazing people are suggesting it is not a problem. On average, the seniors will spend $642 a year on drugs. That is on average. Prescription drug access in America, for most seniors, is out of reach. I think we have to impress upon Members of this body, Congress, and the President, this is an issue we all need to come together on, to work out now, not 2 years from now. 
   People say: After the election. The election is a year from November. Then it will be another year, at the minimum, before we can get anything passed. That is 2 years. 
   The American seniors cannot defer their health, their well-being. In many instances, it is the difference between life and death. Much sicker seniors are being discharged from hospitals today than ever before. That is why prescription medication becomes all the more compelling and urgent in helping our seniors.

   Ms. SNOWE. The Senator raises an important question about the choices that would be available to seniors by creating this board. We look at the needs of seniors. What are the prescription drugs seniors most use? What is most available? What is out there already for insurance coverage? Where are the gaps? This board will have the ability to devise a number of plans across the board and make it available to seniors. Then they can make decisions as to whether or not that plan is tailored to their needs, similar to what Members of Congress get. 
   Members of Congress can avail themselves to an array of plans that provide for prescription drug coverage. The seniors in America should have the same choices. We want them to have choices and to avail themselves, as Senator WYDEN indicated, to the state-of-the-art, advanced developments in prescription drugs and medications. 
   We did not rely on Government programs, a big bureaucracy of price controls in order to achieve prescription drug coverage because there are bills out there in the House and the Senate that will either control the price of drugs or create a huge Government bureaucracy or impinge on the Medicare Program that already has significant financial problems. 
   Could the Senator tell Members how our bill will help seniors without relying on Government price controls but at the same time giving them the ability to have access to the most advanced prescription drug coverage in America?

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague, Senator WYDEN, for the comments he made. It is critically important to understand the differences in our approach as compared to others for controlling the price of drugs which will have an impact on the developments that have occurred in prescription drugs in America. 
   Most importantly, Senator WYDEN and I have come together on an approach we think is reasonable both from a fiscal standpoint as well as from a policy standpoint. We are allowing competition; we are allowing choice. We don't create a bureaucracy; we don't affect Medicare. We provide a financing mechanism. 
   It truly is a reasonable solution to a crisis that is facing America's seniors. I encourage my colleagues to take a very close look at this bipartisan proposal, the only one that has been introduced in the Senate, to talk to Members to see if we can come together so we can address this issue this year in this Congress. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I seek recognition today along with my colleague, Senator COLLINS, to draw to the Chairman's attention our request for funding within the budget for the Environmental Protection Agency to defray some of the costs of researching and developing an effective new technology for monitoring mercury vapor emissions. 
   As we know, mercury is one of the most toxic substances in our environment and one of most common air pollutants and, unfortunately, remains largely unregulated, causing great neurologic damage if ingested by humans. This is why I have cosponsored a bill, S. 673, that will go a long way towards developing a much needed solution to the problem of mercury emissions in our environment. 
   I am advised that researchers in Maine and in Maryland are teaming together to research and develop a new, environmentally beneficial technology for tracking mercury vapor emissions. I am hopeful that in Conference, the distinguished Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member, Senator MIKULSKI, will look again at the proposal and to consider designating it for funding within the appropriate budget account.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that will remedy a problem facing one of Maine's home health agencies--Home Health & Hospice of St. Joseph, in Bangor, Maine. This bill would reclassify Home Health & Hospice of St. Joseph as a ``new agency'' under the Medicare Home Health Interim Payment System, allowing it a higher per-beneficiary rate. 
   When Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act, the intention was to modestly control the dramatic growth rate of home health care agencies. But the broad financing constraints and administrative regulations codified in the Balanced Budget Act have had unintended consequences. Almost every week I hear concerns from home care agencies in Maine about the implementation of regulations and restrictions on these agencies. 
   Since enactment of the Balanced Budget Act, many of our home healthcare agencies have found themselves in a position of financial insolvency. Nationwide, more than 2,000 agencies have closed since BBA's passage. The State of Maine had 90 Medicare/Medicaid certified home health care agencies in the beginning of 1998. By the beginning of 1999, 16 of those agencies had closed. 
   At the time of the BBA's enactment, the Congressional Budget Office expected home health care expenditures to drop by $75 billion over ten years. In March of this year, CBO examined the Medicare program expenditures of the home health agencies and increased the expected savings by $56 billion--a three-quarter increase over the same ten years! 
   As a component of the general funding reductions enacted by the Balanced Budget Act, the law created detailed regulations in determining agency per-beneficiary payment limits. These regulations have had several unforeseen and unintended consequences when applied to real-life agencies. 
   Home Health & Hospice of St. Joseph serves over 700 patients in Bangor, Maine and the surrounding area. Under the BBA, per-patient cost reimbursement 
   is based solely on cost reporting ending in fiscal year 1994. Unfortunately for Home Health & Hospice of St. Joseph--an established and vital component of Bangor's health care system--fiscal year 1994 was an unprecedented period of clinical and financial upheaval. As a result of these problems, the agency's per-patient reimbursement limitation is artificially low. And in spite of the extensive clinical and financial reforms enacted during this unique and transitional period, the cost data for this one year is significantly and permanently flawed. 
   As a result of the anomalous cost report, the Medicare payment amount for Home Health & Hospice of St. Joseph is only 59 percent of the true costs of treating each patient. For every patient the agency treated in 1998, it lost $1,148. The agency is a cost effective home health care agency: its actual per-patient cost of $2,752 is substantially below the national medial of approximately $3,200. Unfortunately, St. Joseph's anticipates an aggregate loss of $780,000 for its service to Medicare patients over 1998. Simply put, they cannot sustain such a deep loss of funding and continue to operate. 
   Mr. President, I introduce this bill today in order to address the problem faced by Home Health & Hospice of St. Joseph. This legislation will reclassify Home Health & Hospice of St. Joseph as a ``new agency'' under the BBA, and is targeted to St. Joseph's. Mr. President, my state relies on home health agencies for much of its healthcare, and we cannot face the prospect of losing such a fine agency.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation honoring the centennial of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) of the United States, which will occur on the 29th of this month. 
   Earlier this year, the Senate passed my legislation designating September 29, 1999, as ``National VFW Day.'' I would like to express my sincere appreciation to my colleagues for joining me in honoring the more than 2 million members of the VFW, and urge the approval of this legislation, which congratulates all members of the VFW on the occasion of the organization's centennial. Similar legislation passed the House on June 29 and awaits approval by the Senate. I hope that we can pass this legislation before September 29 in order to pay tribute to these brave protectors of liberty. 
   As I indicated, September 29, 1999, marks the centennial of the VFW. As veterans of the Spanish-American War and the Philippine Insurrection of 1899 and the China Relief Expedition of 1900 returned home, they drew together in order to preserve the ties of comradeship forged in service to their country. 
   They began by forming local groups to secure rights and benefits for the service they rendered to our country. In Columbus, OH, veterans founded the American Veterans of Foreign Service. In Denver, CO, veterans started the Colorado Society of the Army of the Phillippines. In 1901, the Philippine War Veterans organization was started by the Philippine Veterans in Altoona and Pittsburgh, PA. In 1913, these varied organizations with a common mission joined forces as the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. I am truly honored to salute this proud organization. 
   The joint resolution I am introducing today recognizes the unselfish service VFW members have rendered over the last 100 years to the Armed Forces, to our communities, and other veterans. It also highlights the historic significance of this important day in the lives of so many veterans, and calls upon the President to issue a proclamation recognizing the anniversary of the VFW and the contributions made by the VFW to our Nation. 
   I have nothing but the utmost respect for those who have served their country. With this legislation, we say ``thank you'' the men and women and their families who have served this country with courage, honor and distinction. They answered the call to duty when their country needed them, and this is but a small token of our appreciation. 
   The centennial of the founding of the VFW will present all Americans with an opportunity to honor and pay tribute to the VFW and to all veterans. I thank my colleagues for joining me in a strong show of support and an expression of thanks to the VFW and all veterans.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the fiscal year 2000 Defense authorization conference report. 
   The bill emerges in the turnmoil of a post-cold-war world--one demanding a U.S. military that can face transnational developments such as weapons proliferation, regional tyrants such as Saddam Hussein or Slobodan Milosevic, and emerging powers such as China. 
   As a result, the authorization cycle of the last few months allowed Congress to bring the Pentagon's budget into alignment with the changing Armed Services on which the nation will rely to deter a broad spectrum of global threats to U.S. national security. 
   I caution my colleagues not to confuse the unpredictable nature of these threats with the disappearance of serious global challenges to the security of the United States and its key allies. 
   The former menace of imperial communism has yielded to a less detectable, but still destructive, gallery of aggressors: the cyber-terrorist, the rogue dictator, the narcotics lord, and violent dissidents throughout the world with ideological resentments against the culture and prosperity of the West. 
   A brief tour of the global horizon furthermore alerts us to the ongoing requirement for a robust and flexible national defense. 
   The burned and bloodied streets of East Timor warn the United States that the world's fourth most-populous country, guarding the sea lanes between the Pacific and Indian Oceans, faces an anxious period of political and military strife. 
   Saddam Hussein still hopes to strangle the Arab-Israeli peace process and hold the oil reserves of the Persian Gulf hostage to his lust for warfare. 
   China wants to build a nuclear and naval force to counter the United States and Japan as a major power among the trading states of Western Asia. 
   The North Koreans and the Iranians quietly try to siphon weapons of mass destruction out of a chaotic Russia. India and Pakistan have intensified their grim nuclear standoff, and the rumbling Balkans undermine stability and economic development from the Caucuses to the Mediterranean Basin. 
   The Senate, therefore, should embrace a Defense authorization conference report that increases the President's request by more than six billion dollars to a total of $288.8 billion. Almost one-half of the eight billion dollar increase goes towards procurement--the keystone of force modernization--and keeps the Pentagon on schedule to level this account at $60 billion next year, as Secretary Cohen proposed in February 1998. 
   Beyond the numbers in the budget, however, this bill takes care of 
   the needs of our Service people. The Conference Report, Mr. President, recognizes the human dimension of military readiness by approving an across-the-board 4.8% pay increase for uniformed personnel-the largest since 1982. It also equalizes retirement benefits, extends bonuses for second and third-term re-enlistments, and gives troops the same chance that civilians have to achieve financial security by making thrift saving plans available, for the first time ever, to the Total Force. 
   This legislation furthermore takes the bold step of re-organizing the Energy Department of fight the emerging threat of nuclear proliferation through reformed intelligence and security systems. Our statutory effort on this front reflected the chilling fact that the Department, as it exists, cannot adequately safeguard the secrets that give nuclear arsenals their range and mobility. 
   An alarming flood of evidence produced by two distinguished panels this year, the Cox and Rudman Commissions, uncovered a fractured and apathetic DoE bureaucracy that failed over the course of twenty years to protect the design plans for America's most sophisticated warheads against foreign espionage. As a result, the conference report mandated the creation of a new semi-autonomous organization within the Energy Department,  accountable directly to the Secretary, that will streamline reporting procedures and tighten security at the country's national weapons laboratories. 
   In addition, as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Seapower Subcommittee, I was honored to join my colleagues in forging an FY 2000 budget authorization that enhances the nation's naval power projection, force protection, and strategic lift capabilities. I want to thank Senator KENNEDY, the ranking minority member of the Subcommittee, along with the panel's other members, Senators JOHN MCCAIN, BOB SMITH, JEFF SESSIONS, CHUCK ROBB, and JACK REED, for both their hard work on this year's bill and their support of me as the Chairman. 
   The conference report approves the President's request for authorization of six new construction ships, including $2.681 billion for three DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, $1.508 billion for two LPD-17 San Antonio-class amphibious ships, and $440 million for one ADC(X), the first of a class of auxiliary refrigeration and ammunition supply ships. 
   It also authorizes the President's advance procurement request of $748.5 million for two SSN-774 Virginia-Class attack submarines, and $751.5 million for the CVN-77, the last Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. 
   These budget levels will enable the Navy to set the stage for a planned increase in annual ship construction rate from six per year today to eight per year between FY 2001 and FY 2004 and nine per year beginning by FY 2005. As the Assistant Service Secretary for Research, Development, and Acquisition, Dr. Lee Buchanan, testified to the Subcommittee on March 24, 1999, a yearly production rate of between eight and ten vessels is essential to the maintenance of a Fleet within the range of 300 ships over the next 35 years. 
   Beyond the procurement priorities of today, the subcommittee supported the Navy's revolutionary research efforts to shape a 21st century fleet of greater speed, precision, and maneuverability for littoral operations near coastal waters. According to the Navy's official definition, littoral engagements requires forces to deploy ``close enough to influence events on shore if necessary.'' 
   This post-Soviet mission connects our force structure to our security interests since by 2010, 80 percent of the world's population will live within 300 miles of the shorelines known as the littorals. And as our maritime Service, Mr. President, the Navy operates as the first and most significant force of relief and response in the littoral waterways. 
   In the realm of ship research, development, testing, and evaluation, the conference report approves $270 million for the DD-21 next-generation land attack destroyer, $205 million to advance the post-Nimitz aircraft carrier program known as CVN(X), and $116 million for SSN-774 Virginia-class attack submarines. These initiatives will help the fleet in meeting one of its core force structure goals for the years ahead: the deployment of ships with intensified firepower and lower life-cycle costs. 
   The sailors and marines of tomorrow, Mr. President, will also require worldwide mobility to bring American power to the shores of conflict or instability. Towards this end, our bill extends the Pentagon's core tactical and strategic lift programs, including the C-17 airlifter and the MV-22 Osprey helicopter. 
   The seapower portion of the conference report includes a number of legislative provisions allowing the Pentagon to take advantage of the most cost-effective acquisition strategies to sustain a fleet of at least 300 ships--the bare minimum, according to the testimony of senior officials before the Seapower Subcommittee this year, that the Navy needs to meet its forward-deployed operational requirements. 
   These legislative provisions extend the multi-year procurement authority to include fiscal years 2002 and 2003 in the DDG-51 production program, and authorize advance procurement and construction funding for both a new LHD-8 amphibious assault ship and an additional large, medium-speed roll on/roll off ship. 
   We also authorize the Secretary of the Navy to enter into auxiliary ship leases for 20 or more years. This initiative should give service leaders more flexibility to invest resources into complex war fighting ships by relying more on qualified commercial ship owners to build and maintain the supply fleet. 
   Finally, Mr. President, long-range fleet planning will prompt the naval leadership to concentrate on developing a broad force structure to execute the National Security Strategy. For this reason, the conference report directs the Department of Defense to submit a report next February detailing the Navy's shipbuilding schedule and needed maritime capabilities through fiscal year 2030. 
   In summary, the fiscal year 2000 Defense authorization conference report address the key acquisition, research, hardware, and operational challenges that will provide the nation with a flexible and responsive 21st century fleet. I urge my colleagues to uphold a valuable tradition of the United States Senate by voting on a strong bipartisan basis in favor of this landmark legislation.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans Sexual Trauma Treatment Act, legislation authorizing a program within the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) which will offer counseling and medical treatment to veterans who suffered from sexual abuse while serving in the armed forces. 
   I have nothing but the utmost respect for those who have served or are currently serving their country in uniform. Countless men and women, and their families, have served this country with courage, honor and distinction. Today, as they have throughout this proud nation's history, they stand ready to answer the call to duty, and they deserve, at the very least, to serve free from the threat of sexual abuse and harassment. And yet, an estimated 35 percent of all female veterans report at least one incident of sexual harassment during their military service. That it why I am introducing this legislation today. 
   The Veterans Sexual Trauma Treatment Act, which is similar to legislation introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative GUTIERREZ, will enable former military personnel who were subjected to sexual harassment or abuse while in the military to receive proper medical and psychological care. The legislation does so by extending and improving the VA's abuse counseling initiatives. 
   The bill makes permanent a program to require the VA to provide counseling to veterans to overcome psychological trauma resulting from a physical assault or battery of a sexual nature, or from sexual harassment, which occurred during active military service. Under current law the program authorizing such counseling expires in 2001. 
   The bill authorizes the program to include appropriate treatment, and requires a VA mental health professional to determine when such counseling and treatment is necessary. Currently, the VA Secretary makes this determination. 
   The bill also calls for the dissemination of information concerning the availability of counseling services to veterans, through public service and other announcements. It also calls for a report on joint DOD/VA efforts to ensure that military personnel are informed upon their separation from service about available sexual trauma counseling and treatment programs. 
   Most importantly, the bill eases restrictions under the existing program. I find it very troubling, for example, that women with fewer than two years of service are not eligible for counseling, even if they separated from the military due specifically to incidents of harassment or abuse. 
   According to the DOD, over 5 percent of female active duty personnel have been sexually assaulted while in the service. And a recent survey conducted for the Pentagon found that between 1988 and 1995, the percentage of active duty women who reported that they had received uninvited or unwanted sexual attention stood at 55 percent, while the percentage for men stands at 14 percent. 
   The survey also reported that 78 percent of female respondents said they had experienced one or more specific types of unwanted behaviors from a range of specified inappropriate behaviors. 
   Eighty eight percent of females said the harassment occurred on a base; 74 percent said the harassment occurred at work; 77 percent said it occurred during duty hours; 44 percent said that military coworkers of equal rank were the perpetrators; and 43 percent said the perpetrator was of a higher rank. 
   These findings are very disturbing. The data illustrates just how widespread this problem is, and indicates the need for a program to treat victims upon separation from active duty service. I credit the DOD with working to reduce the prevalence of sexual harassment in the military. However, as long as there is harassment and abuse in the military, it is vital that victims have access to counseling while on active duty and after separation from the service as well. 
   We expect active duty servicemen and women to make extraordinary sacrifices to safeguard the democracy we cherish. We should not expect them to accept abuse and harassment while they serve. 
   The legislation I am introducing today is aimed specifically at ensuring that veterans have access to abuse counseling after they leave the military. It has the backing of the VFW, Vietnam Veterans of America, the American Legion, and AMVETS. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in a strong show of support for this legislation.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1999. I am pleased that Senator MCCAIN, Chairman of the Commerce Committee, is a cosponsor of this legislation. This bill reauthorizes the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) through Fiscal Year 2004. This legislation will improve the qualify of life for those Americans fortunate enough to live in coastal communities and the millions of others who visit these regions each year. First and foremost, the bill recognizes the many benefits of economic development, and balances those needs with the protection of our valuable public resources. 
   The United States has more than 95,000 miles of coastline along the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic Oceans, Gulf of Mexico, and the Great Lakes. Nearly 53 percent of all Americans live in these coastal regions, but that accounts for only 11 percent of the country's total land area. This small portion of our country supports approximately 200 sea ports, contains most of our largest cities, and serves as critical habitat for a variety of plants and animals. 
   To help meet the growing challenges facing these coastal areas, Congress enacted the CZMA in 1972. The CZMA provides incentives to states to develop comprehensive programs that balance the many competing uses of coastal resources and to meeting the needs for the future growth of coastal communities. 
   As a voluntary program, the framework of the CZMA provides guidelines for state plans to address multiple environmental, societal, cultural, and economic objectives. This allows the states the flexibility necessary to prioritize management issues and utilize existing state regulatory programs and statutes wherever possible. Obviously, each state's priorities and needs are unique. That is why this bill provides maximum flexibility to states to address the diverse problems affecting our coastal areas. 
   The coastal zones managed under the CZMA range from the arctic to tropical islands, from sandy to rocky shorelines, and from urban to rural areas. Because of these varying habitats and resource types, no two state plan and the same, nor should they be. 
   Likewise, there are multiple uses of the coastal zone. Coastal managers are asked to strike a balance among residential, commercial, recreational, and industrial development; harbor development and maintenance; shoreline erosion and commercial and recreational fishing. Coastal programs address these competing needs for resources, steer activities to appropriate areas of the coast, and attempt to minimize the effects of these activities on coastal resources. As you may imagine, being able to balance economic development while protecting public resources requires careful strategies, substantial financial resources, and cooperation among stakeholders. 
   So far, 32 of the 35 eligible coastal states and U.S. territories have federally approved coastal zone management plans under the CZMA. Two of the remaining eligible states are currently completing their plans. I am proud to say that my state of Maine has had a federally approved plan since 1978. The approved plans cover 99% of the eligible U.S. coastline. 
   Another component of the CZMA is the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. These reserves not only provide habitat for a wide variety of fish, invertebrates, birds, and mammals, but they also serve as natural laboratories for research and education. There are currently 22 of these reserves in 18 states. 
   Mr. President, this bill authorizes $100 million to carry out the objectives of the CZMA for fiscal year 2000. The authorization level increases by $5 million each year to $120 million in FY 2004. Of the annual $5 million increase, $3.5 million would be targeted for the base state-grant programs; $1 million would be authorized for coastal zone enhancement and coastal community grant programs; and $500,000 would be authorized for the national Estuarine Research Reserve System. This bill will enable the states to build upon the successes of their management plans an confront emerging problems along our coasts. Further, this bill allows each state to maintain the flexibility it requires in order to address the specific needs of its coastal communities. 
   Because flexibility at the state level is a critical element of this bill, titled the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1999 allows states to establish partnerships with local communities to encourage wise and sustainable development of their public resources. As the United States' population continues to increase in coastal communities, it is imperative that we provide those communities with the capability to plan for growth. This will enable coastal communities to address open space needs, environmental protection, and infrastrasture needs. 
   Finally, let me say that the foundation of this legislation is the existing federal/state partnership that has made the CZMA so effective. The federal funds to implement CZMA management plans are matched by state matching monies. Some states have capitalized on the opportunities presented by the CZMA by leveraging even more money than the required match. In my state, the State of Maine, for example, the importance of investing in coastal areas has been clearly recognized and the CZMA federal funds have been matched at a rate of seven state dollars per federal dollar. Given examples like this, the potential for this reauthorization could produce several hundred million dollars for coastal zone management programs. 
   I believe the legislation that I am introducing today will provide states with the necessary funding and framework to meet the challenges facing our coastal communities in the 21st Century.  
   Mr. President, this is a solid, reasonable and realistic bill that enjoys bipartisan support on the Commerce Committee. I look forward to moving this bill at the earliest opportunity.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of extending the Federal Milk Marketing Order system for one year, and in support of the preservation of small family dairy farms throughout Maine and all of New England. 
   As you are aware, Mr. President, the Farm Bill of 1996 authorized the USDA Secretary to fundamentally revisit the federal Milk Marketing Orders, which is a regulation voluntarily initiated and approved by a majority of producers in a given area. The regulation places requirements on the first buyers or handlers of milk from dairy farmers, such as processors who distribute fluid milk products in a designated marketing area. One of those requirements is that handlers must pay an assigned minimum price according to the use of the milk. Also, a milk order requires that all payments by handlers be pooled and the same average price is paid to individual dairy farmers. 
   On January 30, 1998, the USDA proposed two options to reform differentials, including Option 1-A that closely reflects the current program, which is a market-oriented option for fluid milk prices, and Option 1-B that would be accompanied by transition assistance for dairy farmers. I immediately heard from Maine dairy farmers, who asked for my support for the Option 1-A differential because it is the fairest and most equitable pricing option for them as it stabilizes prices for dairy farmers and ensures that consumers do not pay higher milk prices in the supermarket. 
   My response was to join 60 other Senators on April 29, 1998 and send a letter to USDA Secretary Glickman in support of Option 1-A, saying that the other option, Option 1-B, would further reduce the price of milk received by farmers in almost all regions of the country, thereby reducing local supplies of fresh, fluid milk and increasing costs for consumers. 
   My actions the previous year, 1997, were the same as I joined 47 other senators, in writing to Secretary Glickman stating that Option 1-A was the most viable and economically sound approach to the future pricing of fluid milk. 
   When the USDA announced its final rule on March 31, 1999, it selected a form of Option 1-B that will reduce monies to dairy farmers in New England by at least 2 percent. The final rule will become law in October unless there is Congressional action to stop the final rule. I believe the Congressional action to extend the Milk Marketing Order system until October 1, 2000--which also extends the Northeast Dairy Compact until that time--is required so that there is an appropriate time period to assess such a major and potentially devastating change to the pricing formula for producers throughout my region, and other regions as well. 
   I am currently a cosponsor of S. 1256, Senator COVERDELL's bill that will implement Option 1-A for Class I fluid milk as part of the implementation of the final rule to consolidate the federal Milk Marketing Orders. 
   Mr. President, since the Northeast Compact was put in place in 1996, there has been no groundswell of opposition from the consumers of New England, but they have actually preferred to protect a cultural way of life for the region. In addition, for this August, the Maine dairy producers will be receiving an extra $2.28 per hundred weight for their milk because the Compact is currently in place--and this is still not bringing in enough money to the dairy farmers to meet their cost of production. No one is getting rich off of the Compact, Mr. President, but they will get poorer or go out of business after this October if the Compact is allowed to expire. 
   The Compact has only helped stabilize the dairy industry in the Northeast and protected farmers and consumers against volatile price swings. The Compact has protected against the loss of small family owned dairy farms and protected against a decrease in the fresh local supply of milk at a fair price for consumers. 
   Mr. President, Maine had over 2,000 dairy farms in the 1980s. We now have less than 500. The Compact has helped stem the tide of the loss of small family owned dairy farms--and a way of life. We have been talking on the floor for two days now about how natural disasters are affecting the family farmer. I urge you not to create a manmade disaster by allowing the Northeast Compact to expire. I urge my colleagues to support the extension of the federal Milk Marketing Orders--which will also extend the Northeast Dairy Compact--and I thank the Chair.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as the distinguished Senator from Mississippi is aware, at the present time, the United States has no capability for the culture of cold-water, marine finfish, and the industry continues to need a consistent supply of high quality eggs or juvenile organisms. At the same time, I am especially aware as Chair of the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee, that many important wild fish stocks in the United States, including the Gulf of Maine, as well as around the world, are suffering from overharvesting. This has the potential to greatly diminish the food supply of many nations whose greatest source of protein is from the fish they catch. The opportunity for cold water aquaculture research is immense and the rewards great for U.S. salmon farming in particular, which is a strategic industry in my State of Maine, especially in the rural area of Downeast Maine. 
   It is important for the committee to know that representatives of the Maine Atlantic salmon industry and the University of Maine have been working with USDA's Agricultural Research Service and have defined the need to study the feasibility of a research center concept, program criteria and site criteria, site identification and evaluation. Once this has been completed, I hope we can look forward to the committee's future consideration for establishing a cold-water, marine aquaculture research center in an appropriate State such as Maine.

    Ms. SNOWE. 
   Mr. President, today I am introducing the Seniors Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity (SPICE) Act along with my colleague from Oregon, Senator WYDEN. The purpose of this bill is to provide Medicare beneficiaries with access to prescription drug coverage. The program is voluntary and federal assistance will be provided to help pay for the premiums. Senator WYDEN and I believe that this bill is one solution to the lack of prescription drug coverage for America's seniors and we believe that it is a bill we could and should enact this year.  
   Lack of prescription drug coverage is a serious problem facing our seniors. When Medicare was created in 1965 it was based on the inpatient care system that was prevalent at that time. Today, thirty four years later, drug therapy often allows individuals to stay out of the hospital--but Medicare does not cover drugs. And the lack of coverage means that those over 65 years of age end up paying for half the costs associated with their prescriptions, while the average person under age 65 pays only a third. It also means that seniors are forgoing medication because they cannot afford it. 
   The SPICE Act creates a voluntary supplemental drug insurance policy that all Medicare eligible individuals can purchase. These policies will be guaranteed issue--no one can be turned down. SPICE eligibility will begin when Medicare eligibility begins. There will be a penalty for late entry, just as there is for those who make a late entry into the Medicare Part B program. The penalty fee for late entry will be waived if the late entry is based on the loss of prior drug coverage from a Medicare + Choice plan or a retiree group health plan. 
   All seniors will receive some premium support assistance on a sliding scale based on income. Every senior will receive at least 25% premium support. Those below 150% of the federal poverty line will receive 100% premium support. A sliding scale will phase down the premium support from 100% to 25% for those between 150% and 175% of the federal poverty line. 
   The federal premium support will be used to allow seniors to purchase SPICE policies from private providers, similar to the Medigap program. The policies will all meet a threshold standard developed by the SPICE Board, which includes consumers, state insurance commissioners, and insurance representatives, and will be designed with seniors needs in mind. Medicare+Choice and group health plans which provide drug coverage for Medicare eligible individuals will be able to receive the actuarial value of the drug benefit if their plans meet or exceed the SPICE Board threshold benefit plan. 
   Seniors will be given a choice of plans. This will ensure competition and help keep the costs down and will allow seniors to choose the plan that best meets their needs. To provide an idea of the types of choices, plans may offer coverage for different drugs (formularies), copays, deductibles, and caps. The SPICE Board will disseminate information about these choices, much like the Federal Employee Benefit Health Program (FEHBP) does. 
   Funding sources for the benefit will come from the on-budget surplus, which the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates show to be $505 billion after the $792 billion tax cut legislation that is currently in conference. Additional funding may come from implementing the President's FY2000 budget proposal to raise the tobacco tax by 55 cents per pack in addition to enacting the 15 cent tobacco increase already in law one year earlier than originally planned. 
   America's seniors need help in obtaining prescription drug coverage. SPICE is a doable proposal that can be passed whether or not we are able to move forward on Medicare reform this year.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National Marine Sanctuaries Amendments Act of 1999. I am pleased that Senator KERRY, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries, Senator MCCAIN, Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator HOLLINGS, Ranking  Member of the Commerce Committee, and Senator BREAUX are joining me as cosponsors on this legislation. This bill will protect our nation's valuable marine resources while facilitating their sustainable use. 
   One hundred years after the first national park was created, the United States made a similar commitment to preserving its valuable marine resources by establishing the National Marine Sanctuary Program in 1972. Since then, twelve areas covering a wide range of marine habitats have been designated as national marine sanctuaries. Half of these designations have occurred in the last decade. 
   Today, our marine sanctuaries encompass everything from kelp forests and marine mammal nursery grounds, to underwater archeological sites. Together these sanctuaries protect nearly 18,000 square miles of ocean waters, an area nearly the size of Vermont and New Hampshire combined. 
   Acting as a platform for better ocean stewardship, these sanctuaries offer an opportunity for research, outreach, and educational activities. The national sanctuaries are also a model for multiple use management in the marine environment. 
   Obviously, balancing the protection of public resources with fostering economic activities requires the cooperative efforts of the federal, state, and local governments, as well as nongovernmental organizations and the public. There are many of these partnerships working together within the national marine sanctuary program. Most of the successes of the program can be attributed to these partnerships. 
   One of these sanctuaries is located in the Gulf of Maine. The Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary provides feeding and nursery grounds for more than a dozen types of whales, including the endangered humpback, northern right, sei, and fin whales. This has led to the development of a thriving whale watching tourist trade in the sanctuary. The area also supports diverse seabird species and other fish and shellfish such as bluefin tuna, herring, cod, flounder, lobster, and scallops. Consequently, important commercial fisheries for lobster, bluefin tuna, cod and others exist in and around the sanctuary. 
   Historic data strongly suggest the presence of several shipwreck sites within the sanctuary, including the recently discovered wreck of the steamship Portland which sunk in 1898. Seven historic shipwrecks have been identified within or adjacent to the boundaries. However, a complete inventory of historical resources has not been conducted. These traditional shipping lanes are still active today. A heavily-used vessel traffic separation lane in the sanctuary facilitates the passage of more than 2,700 commercial vessels in and out of regional ports each year. 
   Through careful management and cooperation, all of these diverse uses co-exist in a marine sanctuary while providing protection to the marine resources. This is just one example of the diverse management strategies being utilized by the national program. 
   The goal of the national marine sanctuary program is quite ambitious. Unfortunately, lack of funding has hampered their success. To date, insufficient funds have been provided to keep up with the pace of expansion of the sanctuary system. As a result, the 12 existing sanctuaries are not fully operational. Nationwide, individual sanctuaries are understaffed; unable to fully implement their management plans; unable to review existing management plans every five years as required by law; and lack educational and outreach materials and facilities. Consequently, management plans that were written twenty years ago have not been updated to adapt to the changing needs of the area nor for advances in science and resource management. 
   Congress identified the need for these sanctuaries when we passed the original Act in 1972. It is time now to provide the funds necessary to achieve what we set out to do. This will require an increase in the authorization level. The bill we are introducing today provides $30 million in FY 2000 and increases the annual authorization level by $2 million a year to $38 million in FY 2004. 
   It is time to move beyond fundamental planning and reach full implementation of the national program. This bill focuses the sanctuary program on making the existing sanctuaries fully operational before the formal designation process can begin for additional sanctuaries. It is our intention that management plans be developed in an open and participatory process so that partnerships between resource protection and compatible uses are given every chance to succeed. Further, management plans must be reviewed and updated in a timely manner so that we can prioritize our objectives and respond to the changing needs of the resources and the people who utilize them. 
   A large part of the implementation process is the development of enforcement capabilities. It is one thing to plan resource protection, it is another thing to actually provide it. At the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries hearing on reauthorization of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, it was disappointing to hear about the overwhelming lack of enforcement in our marine sanctuaries. This bill encourages the development and implementation of meaningful enforcement plans, including partnerships with the states and other authorized entities. This will now become a part of the management plan review process. Further, the Administration will need to demonstrate that effective enforcement plans exist for the current sanctuaries before beginning the formal designation process for additional sanctuaries. 
   The National Marine Sanctuaries Act expires at the end of Fiscal Year 1999. This bill gives us the opportunity to realize the goals first laid out by Congress in 1972. There can be no doubt that this revitalization of the sanctuary program is long overdue. 
   Mr. President, this is a strong and much-needed bill that enjoys bipartisan support on the Commerce Committee. I look forward to moving this bill at the earliest opportunity.

   Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today in support of S. 335, the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act, legislation authored by my colleague from Maine, Senator SUSAN COLLINS. I applaud her leadership on this issue as chair of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. I believe that this legislation strikes an important balance between consumer protection and over-regulation of the sweepstakes industry. 
   This issue has long been a priority for me. In the late 1980s, while in the House of Representatives, I began working on initiatives to curb deceptive mailings, and during the 101st Congress, I co-authored H.R. 2331, the Deceptive Mailings Prevention Act of 1989, which was signed into law by President Bush on November 6, 1990. H.R. 2331 prohibited solicitations by private entities for the purchase of products or services or the contribution of funds or membership fees, which imply false federal government connection or endorsement. 
   At the time, our main focus was on mailings that led one to believe that they were endorsed by the government--for example, offers that promise consumers information on federal benefits for which they may be eligible for a fee, when in fact such information is available at no cost directly from federal agencies. 
   The legislation barred the use of any seal, insignia, trade or brand name, or other symbol designed to construe government connection or endorsement. Today, I am pleased to support S. 335, which builds on the foundation laid by the 1990 law, in recognition of the problems that have emerged as sweepstakes offers have proliferated, with all of the accompanying abuses we have witnessed. 
   How many times have each of us received an offer in the mail promising enormous sweepstakes payoffs or other prizes? These promises are a clever way to market magazine subscriptions and other products. The old adage--``if it's too good to be true, it probably is''--comes to mind. Regrettably, for many, such offers seem too good to pass up particularly when the are accompanied by dire warnings such as ``urgent advisory,'' ``don't risk losing your multimillion dollar prize,'' or ``don't risk forfeiture now!'' Many consumers are misled by this type of advertising, which is deliberately designed to mislead. 
   Many offers are designed to entice the consumer into believing that he or she has already won a valuable prize, for example, or is on the verge of winning, when in fact, the odds against winning may be astronomical. 
   The sad truth is that companies use deceptive advertising because it works--it sells more product. And the tragic problem facing us today is this: all too often, the consumer who is being victimized is a senior on a fixed income or is disabled. 
   We have all heard the horror stories about unwitting victims on fixed incomes who have purchased hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of magazine subscriptions--sometimes multiple subscriptions to the same magazine, thinking they would improve their chances of winning a prize. We have heard the tragic accounts of individuals flying to another city or state to claim a prize, genuinely believing that they had been selected as the winner, 
   only to find that they have become a victim. Some have squandered life savings on misleading offers. When these types of incidents become commonplace, I think, we have a good indication that there is a problem. And we have a responsibility to correct the problem. 
   What I find most troubling about this issue is that many unscrupulous companies intentionally target the most vulnerable consumers, knowing full well how devastating the results can be. S. 355 is designed to target these those companies that have demonstrated that they will not police themselves. 
   Among other things, S. 335 requires sweepstakes mailings to display rules clearly and state explicitly that no purchase is necessary to increase one's chance of winning. It requires the sponsor of an offer to clearly state the odds of winning and the value of the prize, and prohibits companies from making false statements, such as an individual is a winner, unless they have actually won a prize. It also strengthens safeguards to protect those who have requested not to receive sweepstakes mailings and other such offers, and enhances the Postal Service's authority to investigate, penalize, and stop deceptive mailings.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It will dramatically improve access for working American families in this country to pursue higher education. The bottom line is that even as the cost of college has quadrupled over the past 20 years, in fact, growing nearly to twice the rate of inflation, the value of Pell grants has actually decreased. Where it used to cover 39 percent of the cost of public education, today it is 22 percent. In fact, in the last 5 years alone, the total amount of college loans has soared by 82 percent, even after adjusted for inflation. I hope that we will help American families with this amendment.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, essentially this takes a provision that is included in the amendment that Senator SCHUMER and I had offered that addresses the growing debt burden faced by recent college students. 
   The bottom line is, we all recognize that the cost of college education has quadrupled over the last 20 years, growing at twice the rate of inflation. In fact, over the past 5 years, the demand for college loans has soared by more than 82 percent. Therefore, recent graduates have been forced to assume a greater burden of debt after they graduate from college. 
   My amendment would add a tax credit for interest on student loans for the first 5 years upon graduation so that it would ease the amount of debt that individuals have to assume. It would be a $1,500 tax credit. In fact, this has received the support of the American Council on Education. 
   I will quote from this letter:  
   By adding your amendment to the Roth provision, students who are working hard to repay their loans will receive tax relief for the duration of their repayment and benefit from the additional relief of your credit during their first years out of college.

   Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I congratulate Senators BREAUX, CHAFEE, JEFFORDS, and KERREY for reigniting the centrists on an issue that certainly is important to the American people. 
   It is interesting that we are here today confronted with a major issue, and it is not surprising that various Members of this Senate, the House, and the President have different positions on an issue of such significance. What we have tried to do with the package that has been offered by Senator BREAUX and Senator CHAFEE is to bridge the gap between what the President has offered, what the House has offered, and the package that has been offered by Senator ROTH and the Senate Finance Committee. We are trying to bring the differences together to preserve the viability of a tax cut for the American people. 
   Lyndon Johnson once said: The good news is, I see the light at the end of the tunnel. The bad news is, it is the light of an oncoming train. 
   That is the prospect we are facing in Congress with the tax cut proposal because all the positions are different and everyone is taking a very polarized position on this very important issue. 
   I hope our package will be one that can bridge the differences from all sides. That is why we have tried to stake out this position so that we can have a bipartisan proposal that will avoid that train wreck. 
   Over the last few days, we have heard comments from the administration and from Members of this body saying there is no room for compromise; there is zero room for a consensus. I think that kind of intransigence is unacceptable because ultimately it will result in no tax cut at all, and that is not in the best interest of the American people. We should not reject out of hand the possibility of developing a consensus on this issue, and that is what this proposal is all about. 
   This proposal is certainly similar to ones that have been offered on the floor by the Senate Finance Committee and by Senator MOYNIHAN. So it is not a question of substance because if you look at the various components of the tax cut package, they certainly exist in all of them. 
   It is a matter of size, and that is why we decided that instead of the $792 billion package offered by the Senate Finance Committee or the President's package of $300 billion, we would come in the middle with $500 billion. That represents a consensus upon which I think we can all agree. That represents less than 40 percent of the $1.1 trillion projected on-budget surplus over the next 10 years, less than 40 percent. 
   It comes in the middle between the President's package and the Finance Committee's package. I think that it is eminently sensible, it is prudent, and we have to err on the side of economic caution when it comes to how much we are going to spend of the projected surpluses over the next 10 years because those surpluses are just that, they are projections. Some have referred to them as the hypothetical jackpot. 
   We have to be particularly cautious about how much we intend to spend over the next 10 years from projected surpluses. We want to save the additional $300 billion so we can look at Medicare, so we can look at prescription drug plans, so we can look at Social Security, and all the other issues contained within discretionary spending that we think happen to be a priority, or we can create a surplus reserve.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the University of Maine Black Bear hockey team--winner of the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I hockey championship for the second time this decade.  
   Mr. President, collegiate athletics have been an important part of the educational experience for generations. As an adjunct to academics, collegiate sports at their best teach the values of teamwork, the virtues of good sportsmanship, the lessons of disappointment, and the joys of personal as well as collective achievement. 
   Collegiate sports also bring communities and, often, entire states together. In Maine, there are few places charged with the level of excitement and comradery you'll find in Orono's Alfond Arena, where the action is close, the play intense, and the pride palpable. 
   But you don't need to be at the Alfond to feel the excitement. All Over Maine, families gather to watch their team and cheer ``Go Blue''--from Fort Kent to Calais to Cumberland to Kittery. 
   And this year especially, the Black Bears gave us a lot to cheer about. With a 31, 6 and 4 record, the 1998-1999 Maine Black Bears hockey team clearly played to win--and achieved that goal with remarkable regularity. And with only one loss coming at home, the Black Bears at Alfond were almost as sure a thing as snow in January. 
   In the playoffs--which included three New England Teams--the Black Bears continued to thrill all of Maine, rewarding audiences with college hockey as it was meant to be played. 
   Maine's players never gave in and they never gave up. Unyielding in their play, believing in themselves to the very end, Maine clinched the championship in a hard-fought, well-played overtime game against a superb University of New Hampshire team. And at that moment, Mainers near and far--even those who didn't attend my alma mater--were reunited with each other in the spirit of fellowship and victory. 
   So it is an honor for me to commend each and every member of the Black Bear team--not only for their tremendous commitment to personal excellence, but also to the success of the entire team. 
   In particular, seniors Steve Kariya, Marcus Gustafsson, Jason Vitorino, Bobby Stewart, and David Cullen thrilled us with their outstanding play and their remarkable leadership. And Maine's goalie, junior Aflie Michaud, deserves special mention for stopping an astounding 46 shots--a feat that rightfully brought him the honor of being named the tournament's most valuable player. 
   Finally, I applaud the Black Bear coaching staff for a job well done. You can't win without the fundamentals, and Maine's coaches certainly had this team prepared to take the ice--just ask their opponents. But perhaps most importantly, they took young men who were talented in their own right and made them into something even far more formidable--a singular, unstoppable force that would not be denied in its quest to become the very best. 
   Mr. President, there is something about excellence, especially at the highest levels of competition, that elevates all those who come in contact with it. And the magic of a sport like hockey is that, even if you have never strapped on a skate, never taken a slapshot, never iced a puck, never scored a hat trick, you're amazed by the passion of those who do. You're inspired by the athleticism and artistry. And you come to believe that perhaps we all have the potential for greatness, if only we are willing to work hard enough and care deeply enough to pursue our dreams. 
   The 1999 Maine Black Bears hockey team had the kind of year that dreams are made of. Today, by virtue of posting a win in the last game of the last NCAA Hockey tournament of the century, Maine is truly the final word in college hockey. 
   On behalf of the people of Maine, I commend the players, staff, and administration at the University of Maine hockey program for a season to remember. All of Maine is very proud, and we look forward to many more seasons of excitement in the new millennium.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the Chairman, Senator GREGG, and the Ranking Member, Senator HOLLINGS, for accepting the one year extension of the Community Oriented Policing Services Program. This extension, being offered by Senator BIDEN, with my support, will allow communities in Maine and across the country, to continue receiving assistance from this very successful program. 
   The COPS program was created in 1994, when President Clinton signed into law the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. Not only does it provide grants that help communities hire additional police officers to help with the war on crime, the COPS Program also provides funds to acquire new technologies and equipment and provides police with opportunities to work with schools to address persistent school-related crime problems. This program is so worthwhile that one of Maine's police chiefs said it is one of the most innovative programs he has seen in his thirty-five years in police work. 
   Since its creation, COPS grants have been awarded to more than half the policing agencies in the country. In Maine there are an additional 258 police officers in 90 city and county police forces as a result of the COPS Program. All across my state, from the Androscoggin County Sheriff's Department to the Town of Ft. Kent and from the Kennebunk Police Department to the Washington County Sheriff's Department, I am proud that the State of Maine has been able to utilize almost $18 million in COPS program funding to hire these new police officers. These new police officers have helped reduce the amount of violent crime in Maine and across the country. In fact, since 1994, violent crime in America has fallen by 13%. 
   By restoring $495 million for Fiscal Year 2000, the Community Oriented Policing Services program will be able to fund the deployment of almost 4,000 more police officers. These new additions to the front lines of the war on crime will allow our communities to continue to reduce violent crime in America. 
   Again, Mr. President, I appreciate Senator GREGG's willingness to accept this amendment.

   Mrs. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support of the Patients' Bill of Rights. This bill will provide needed reform to our managed care system and ensure some basic patient protections for those with health insurance who do not fall under state jurisdiction. 
   This week the Senate debated an issue that goes to the heart of the personal security of every American.....an issue that underlies all other issues.....that cuts across racial lines, income levels, gender, or profession. Health care in this Nation affects all of us, touches all of our lives. And I am pleased that we are having this opportunity to discuss how we can ensure that health care delivery in the new century never loses sight of its most important component--the patient. 
   We need to have this discussion because, to paraphrase the recent car commercial, this is not your father's health care system. It isn't even the system we knew ten or fifteen years ago. Not so long ago, health care was delivered on a fee-for-service basis. Today, an explosion of advances in medicine and technology along with the advent of managed care, HMO-based networks, have changed the face of health care in America. And it is time to take stock. 
   We need to ensure that medical decisions are dictated by patients and their doctors--not the fine print on an insurance policy. And we must do so in a way that doesn't step on the toes of sound policies already put in place by individual states and doesn't substitute endless courtroom litigation for immediate medical treatment. 
   As more and more people enter into managed care plans, we hear of more and more problems--in some instances, it seems that patients are barely off the operating room table before they are sent home, whether they are ready or not. Or patients are denied access to a treatment or the specialist they need--something my state staff hears time and time again from constituents. 
   I happen to think that medical tests and medical doctors should be driving medical decisions, not actuaries or accountants. In all too many cases, it seems as though health care has become too much about crunching numbers and not enough about healing patients. 
   Indeed, the whole drive toward managed care has been prompted by an effort to contain and reduce health care costs in this nation--by itself, a worthy goal. And by-and-large, managed care has proven less costly than the traditional fee-for-service system--in fact, last year, the average premiums for traditional fee-for-service plans were almost 20 percent higher than HMO premiums and about 7 percent higher than premiums for preferred provider organizations. 
   But the question is, at what price? There is a real feeling among many Americans that, in some far off place, bureaucrats they will never see are making decisions that will dictate the quality and level of care they will receive. There's a real feeling that the average American has little say in what is probably the most deeply personal issue there is--and that the dollar sign is more compelling than any X-ray or MRI. 
   This bill addresses these concerns in a number of important and effective ways, all designed to put patients first. 
   This bill recognizes that medical emergencies are just that--emergencies. If you are being rushed to the hospital with a heart attack, that's hardly the time to have to phone ahead for prior approval--under this bill you'll know you're covered. 
   This bill protects a patient's right to hear the full range of treatment options from their doctor. It is outrageous that patients are often denied the best possible information just when they need it most, and this legislation would make these so-called ``gag clauses'' a thing of the past. 
   This bill would allow parents to bring their children directly to pediatricians, instead of having to go through primary care physicians. How much sense does it make that some managed care plans consider pediatricians to be specialists? The last time I checked, being a child is not a sickness--children deserve the quick and direct access they need to doctors who are really just general practitioners for kids, and under this bill they get it. 
   This bill would protect one's right to see a specialist. If a patient believes that seeing a specialist is the only way to get a sound diagnosis, they should not be denied that option. 
   And finally, this bill allows patients who are pregnant, terminally ill, or in the hospital to continue to see their current doctor, even if that doctor is no longer participating in the patient's health care plan. It's unconscionable that, after seeing a doctor who knows your condition better than anyone else, you could be asked to return to square one--and that would no longer happen under this legislation. 
   I realize that both parties have identified some of the more pressing problems with managed care, and both have laid out ideas on how to address these problems. And I truly believe that Senators on both sides of the aisle are concerned with what they've seen and heard from their constituents. The point that must be made here is that it is not so much our goals that differ, but rather the path we take in getting there. 
   And one of the most glaring differences is the way we approach existing state laws. Not surprisingly, many states have already beaten us to the punch when it comes to patient protections, and this bill respects the work they have done by complementing, rather than undercutting, their efforts. 
   Maine, for example, banned so-called ``gag clauses'' back in 1995, provided direct access to ob/gyns in 1996, and instituted the prudent layperson standard for emergency care in 1998. Wouldn't it make a lot more sense for the federal government to focus on fixing what's broken, instead of the problems that states like Maine have already fixed? 
   Yet, the Kennedy-Daschle bill asks us to overturn all the laws duly passed by 50 state legislatures and substitute then with a ``father knows best'' approach. It basically says, ``thanks for all your efforts on this issue 
   --now step aside and let the real experts take over''. We think a better idea is to complement, not displace, state decisions and this bill does just that by providing benchmark protections for patients who are not already covered by State regulated plans. 
   We also take a different approach when it comes to disputes over care, emphasizing swift access to providers over the slow grind of the legal system. Under this bill, if an individual has a problem with a decision about their health, they can appeal, under an expedited process, to an independent party who is an expert in the condition being reviewed. 
   Why? Because what patients need first and foremost is medical relief now, not legal relief later. If I were sick today and I didn't believe I was getting the care or treatment I needed, I would rather see a doctor than a lawyer. The bottom line is getting well, and this bill would rather put medication ahead of litigation. 
   Finally, let me just say that I believe no patients bill of rights could be complete without a provision to protect against genetic discrimination. 
   Every day, scientists are finding links to a whole host of diseases. An estimated 15 million people are affected by over 4,000 currently known genetic disorders. Today, testing is available for about 450 disorders--but testing is useless if people are afraid to take advantage of it for fear of insurance discrimination. 
   No wonder then a reported 8 out of 10 people who undergo genetic testing pay for it out of their own pockets. Others simply forgo testing altogether. And still others refuse to participate in important medical research. 
   This is a travesty that must be remedied, and it would be remedied by this bill, which includes a provision I authored that provides absolutely fundamental protections against genetic discrimination in health insurance. This language has a long history--I first introduced these protections in the 104th  Congress in conjunction with Representative LOUISE SLAUGHTER in the House. 
   Since then I have worked extensively with Senators JEFFORDS and FRIST to ensure that this bill effectively addresses the need for protections against genetic discrimination in the health insurance industry. 
   Americans should not live in fear of knowing the truth about their health status. They should not be afraid that critical health information could be misused. They should not be forced to choose between insurance coverage and critical health information that can help inform their decisions. They should not fear disclosing their genetic status to their doctors. And they should not fear participating in medical research. 
   We have laid out stringent, tough, and sensible guidelines that allow people to use the information that can be obtained from genetic testing without fear. Any of my colleagues who have heard me talk about genetics know about my constituent, Bonnie Lee Tucker, who is 
   afraid to have a genetic test for breast cancer--despite the fact that she has nine immediate family members who have had this killer--and despite the fact that she believes this information could help protect her daughter. Why? Because she is afraid it will negatively impact her ability and her daughter's ability to get insurance. 
   Our language ensures that people who are insured for the very first time, or who become insured after a long period of being uninsured, do not face genetic discrimination. It ensures that people are not charged exorbitant premiums based on such information. 
   It ensures that insurance companies cannot discriminate against individuals who have requested or received genetic services. It ensures that insurance companies cannot release a person's genetic information without their prior written consent. And it ensures that health insurance companies cannot carve out covered services because of an inherited genetic disorder. 
   In short, it ensures that Bonnie Lee Tucker, and the thousands of Americans like her, can take advantage of the latest scientific breakthroughs to protect their health and well-being without losing their insurance coverage. 
   There will be no issue more important in the 106th Congress than the one before us this week. No issue affects people more personally than health care, and we have a real responsibility to ensure that any changes we make put the patient's interests first. I believe this legislation puts patients first without unnecessary bureaucracy, without excessive involvement from the federal government, without trampling the laws already on the books in all fifty states, without increasing the costs of insurance or increasing the number of the uninsured.

   Ms. SNOWE. Thank you. 
   I thank Senator FRIST for his leadership on obviously what is a very challenging and very difficult issue. 
   I think even in spite of the debate that has occurred on some of these issues where there may be apparent differences on how to approach this problem, there is no disagreement on the fact that we need to bring much needed reform to the managed care system in America today. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to submit an amendment to the Patients' Bill of  Rights that will ensure that appropriate medical care--not a bureaucrat's bottom line--will dictate how long a woman stays in the hospital after undergoing a mastectomy. 
   This amendment that I am introducing, along with my colleague from Michigan, Senator ABRAHAM, and Senators FITZGERALD, CRAPO, COLLINS, JEFFORDS, and HUTCHISON, is based on bipartisan legislation that I was pleased to introduce at the beginning of this year with bipartisan cosponsors. 
   I have been in Congress for 20 years--10 of those years in the House when I served as cochairman of the Congressional Caucus on Women, which addressed issues that affected women and families in America on a bipartisan basis. Throughout that time, I fought long and hard to advance women's health issues, women's health research, and protection for patients who are facing life-threatening diagnoses of breast cancer. 
   I feel justified in saying that I come to this debate not only with strong feelings about the issue but with a long history of involvement and close familiarity with the problem. It is in that light, I believe, that the amendment I am submitting today, along with Senator ABRAHAM and my other colleagues, is the most effective approach to address the issue of those individuals who are faced with breast cancer. 
   Our amendment is straightforward. First, it says that the inpatient coverage with respect to the treatment of a mastectomy, regardless of whether the patient's plan is regulated by ERISA or State regulations--in other words, all plans will be provided for a period of time--will be determined by the attending physician in consultation with the patient as medically necessary and appropriate. 
   Second, it allows any person facing a cancer diagnosis of any type to get a second opinion on their course of treatment. 
   Imagine having a life-threatening disease and not having access to the best possible advice. A diagnosis of breast cancer is something that every woman dreads. But for an estimated 175,000 American women, this is certainly the fear that they have to realize. The fact is that one in nine women will develop this terrible disease during their lifetime, and for women between the ages of 35 and 54, there is no other disease which claims more lives. 
   So it is not hard to understand why the words, ``You have breast cancer,'' are some of the most frightening words in the English language, because for the woman who hears them, everything changes from that moment. No wonder the diagnosis is not only accompanied by fear but also by uncertainty: 
   What will become of me? 
   What will they have to do to me? 
   What will I have to endure? 
   What is the next step? 
   For many women, the answer to that question is mastectomy or lumpectomy. 
   Despite the medical and scientific advances made, despite advances in early detection technology, and more and more often the need for radical surgery, it still remains a fact of life that at the end of the 20th century these procedures can be the most prudent options in attacking and eradicating cancer found in a woman's breast. 
   These are the kinds of decisions that come with the breast cancer diagnosis. These are the kinds of questions women must answer. And they must endure some of the most difficult and stressful circumstances imaginable. 
   The last question a woman should have to worry about at a time like this is whether or not her health insurance plan will pay for appropriate care after a mastectomy. A woman diagnosed with breast cancer in many ways already feels she has lost control of her life. She should not feel as though she has also lost control of her own treatment. All too often that is exactly what happens. 
   Imagine a patient who just had one or both of her breasts removed in the wake of a cancer diagnosis, and she agrees in consultation with her physician that it would be best if she stayed in the hospital for another day or so. Maybe it is because she still needs to learn how to take care of herself. Maybe there are concerns about the possible complications, like infections or uncontrolled bleeding. 
   Let's remember that this is a very complicated surgical procedure we are talking about. What other reason is the decision based on than medical advice from doctors who are likely involved with hundreds of thousands of these kinds of operations? Yet in many instances, because of the decisions made by accountants and insurance actuaries--none of whom have ever witnessed such operations, let alone go to medical school--that same woman cannot afford to follow her doctor's advice. She is not covered by her plan because whoever wrote her plan already decided that she didn't need inpatient care. Instead, that charge for that extra day in the hospital will come out of her own pocket, and unless it is an awfully deep pocket, she is just as likely to take her chances at home. That is just plain unacceptable. 
   If we are talking about patients' rights, I can't think of a more appropriate place to start than right here. That is why I appreciate that my Democratic colleagues raised this vital issue. As I have said, no one is more concerned about this issue than I am. 
   I looked carefully at the amendment and watched the debate very closely. But when all was said and done on this issue, and despite the good intentions of the amendment, I could not support the amendment that was offered yesterday by our colleague, Senator ROBB. Let me tell you why. 
   The Robb amendment relied on the phrase ``generally accepted" medical standard to instruct insurance companies as to what constitutes a ``medical necessity'' that requires coverage. What exactly does that mean, ``generally accepted'' medical standard? That is a good question. 
   The fact is that we are not exactly sure what it means. In fact, the problem is that it means different things in different places. Moreover, there has never been a consensus concerning the definition of ``medical necessity,'' though it has not been for lack of trying. 
   The most recent Federal attempt, as a matter of fact, was in 1993 when the Clinton health care working group tried and 
   failed. But they didn't give up. Instead, they decided to leave the definition of this crucial term not to physicians and their patients but to a national administrative board. 
   Perhaps that working group would have been better served if they looked to 1989 when Medicare tried to define ``medical necessity'' and Medicare failed. Medicare failed. Why did it fail? Because terms like ``medical necessity'' and ``appropriateness'' cannot be defined for an entire nation, and they certainly can't be defined by Congress. 
   The standards change with time, they change with individual patients, they change depending on the illness or disease, and they should change because medicine is marching forward. 
   Likewise, trying to define ``generally accepted medical standard'' is like hitting a moving target, and a low target at that. ``Generally accepted medical practices'' will vary tremendously among communities, hospitals, and even among doctors. 
   Just look at the chart behind me that was used yesterday by my colleague, Senator FRIST. It is a good chart because I think it illustrates the point on the very treatment prescribed for breast cancer patients. In some cases they use ``lumpectomy'' more sparingly than they do ``mastectomy.'' It obviously varies across regions and States. 
   Looking at the percentages using lumpectomy versus mastectomy treatments, very few were performed in South Dakota; but in the Northeast, including parts of New York, there is a higher degree of the use of lumpectomy versus mastectomy. 
   Obviously, the treatment varies. Obviously, the treatment is complicated. It is a very complicated treatment and set of options for a woman facing a mastectomy. As the chart shows, in the United States of America, the treatments vary all across the land. We cannot prescribe the status quo; we cannot prescribe uniformity. We have to allow the doctors and patients to have the latitude to determine what is best for the individual patient. We hear over and over again that the patient has choices. Let the patient have choices. This is allowing the patient to have choices as to what is in her best interest. 
   This chart illustrates very graphically the differences and the variations across the country in mastectomy and  lumpectomy surgeries. What is generally accepted in one area is not generally accepted or performed in another area. That is the way it should be. Should we be telling a woman who can be treated with a smaller, less invasive and less traumatic lumpectomy, Sorry, in your community, the generally accepted medical standard is a mastectomy? Of course not. 
   And the reverse is true. Should a woman have a mastectomy without knowing that she can have a lumpectomy first, to determine whether or not it is necessary to go to the more invasive surgery? 
   How can we say what is generally acceptable for a 31-year-old athlete in Oregon is generally acceptable for a 78-year-old grandmother in Maine? 
   The phrase ``generally accepted medical standard,'' far from 
   representing the cutting edge of medicine, is nothing more than the medical community status quo, a status quo that simply cannot keep up with the pace of medical science and new technologies. 
   What we are talking about in this amendment is offering the best practice, the best standards, the best quality care. Think how far we have come in the past decade. Mastectomies were once virtually the only option. Today, we have a whole host of alternatives available, depending on the woman's circumstance. If a mastectomy is a generally accepted medical standard, there are other options a woman may be missing out on in making her decision. 
   The web site of NIH shows a variety of options available to a woman to determine for herself, with her doctors, what is best, depending on the progress of her cancer. She could have a lumpectomy; she could have a segmental mastectomy, a modified radical mastectomy, or, if necessary, even a radical mastectomy. 
   The fact is, hardly a day passes when we don't hear of a promising new treatment or a research breakthrough. Parties need to be able to take advantage of these advancements now. They can't wait for generally accepted medical standards to catch up with the times. Under this amendment, they will not have to. 
   In contrast, my amendment dictates coverage in terms of medical standards. If a doctor and a patient agree on a course of treatment of care and an insurance plan refuses to allow that treatment, the patient has a right to appeal to an independent medical expert in that field of medicine. In turn, that expert can take into account all pertinent information in determining what is medically necessary and appropriate based on the relevant scientific and clinical evidence. That includes evidence offered by the patient and her doctor, expert consensus of peer review literature. 
   Not only does this put the patient first, but it also ensures we are not lowering the bar of coverage by handcuffing the physicians in their ability to employ the best strategy, the latest medical technology, with respect to their specific patient. If anything, this amendment raises the bar precisely because the ultimate decisions will be driven by physicians and patients, not lawyers and regulators. 
   Let me add another point. I heard over and over again that the language offered in the amendment yesterday was the language offered in my bill and the bill offered by Senator D'Amato in the last Congress. Let me state for the record, the D'Amato-Feinstein-Snowe legislation offered in the last Congress was legislation that said it was medically appropriate--medically appropriate. It did not use the definition of generally acceptable medical standards and practices. The legislation offered by myself and Senator FEINSTEIN uses the word ``medically appropriate.'' 
   The point I am making is, all of the bills that have been addressed in recent years on the issue of breast cancer treatment and whether or not the length of stay is to be determined by the doctor and patient have been using the words ``medically necessary,'' ``medically appropriate,'' not defining ``medical necessity.'' This would be the first time we are dealing with a definition of ``medical necessity'' which heretofore has not been practiced by Medicare, by the President's health care group, when developing a health care plan, not by CHAMPUS, not by the VA, not by Medicaid, not by 
   legislation introduced on a bipartisan basis over the last few years. 
   Finally, my amendment will also include the ability to provide full coverage for secondary consultations with a specialist whenever any type of cancer has been diagnosed or a treatment recommended. Imagine being given a life-threatening diagnosis and not being able to get another doctor's opinion. Patients cannot afford to forgo second opinions when it comes to cancer of any kind--from lung cancer, to leukemia, to breast cancer, to prostate cancer. Under this amendment, they will not have to. That is important because we all know, when it comes to cancer, time is of the essence and making the right decision in terms of treatment is paramount. 
   So often there are no second chances when it comes to taking the best course of action. Our amendment will allow the possibility of having that second opinion and making sure people are getting the right treatment so we can reduce senseless deaths resulting from false diagnosis, empowering individuals to seek the most appropriate treatment available. 
   The evidence for the need of this amendment is especially important when it comes to the so-called drive-through mastectomies. It is more than just allegorical, more than symbolism. We have heard time and time again antecdotal evidence that speaks for itself. Between 1986 and 1995, the average length of stay for mastectomies dropped from about 6 days to 2 to 3 days. Thousands of women across the country undergo radical mastectomies on an outpatient basis and are being forced out of hospitals before they or their doctors think is reasonable or prudent. 
   I recall the story of one woman from the State of Washington named Linda Schrier. Linda was a registered nurse who worked in the postoperative recovery room for 18 years before she underwent a mastectomy. Linda was doing well after the operation. The pain was under control. She opted to go home instead of staying overnight. Today, she believes that was a big mistake. When Linda woke up at home the next day without the benefit of the IV pain medication she had in the hospital, she was in excrutiating pain. She also had tremendous difficulty caring for her wound. 
   Keep in mind, this is someone who worked in the medical profession. Today, she feels, very strongly, based on her own experience as a nurse and as a patient, that no one should go home the day of their mastectomy. She also believes that no insurance company should tell a woman how long her hospital stay should be. It should be up to a woman and her doctor. 
   I could not agree more. I know we all could not agree more. This decision must be returned to physicians and their patients. All Americans who face the possibility of a cancer diagnosis must be able to make informed decisions about the appropriate and necessary medical care. 
   As we debate the Patients' Bill of Rights this week, let us not forget the women and men across the country who are battling cancer. Let's do the right thing for all of them. 
   I yield back my time.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank Senator JEFFORDS for his comment and for yielding time. 
   I want to clarify a few points that were made earlier because I do think it is important it does not get lost in the debate. 
   The amendment I am offering is not the amendment that was offered yesterday. The language is not identical. I thought I had made that abundantly clear. It is different from the D'Amato-Feinstein-Snowe legislation passed in the last Congress. It is different from the Snowe-Feinstein legislation offered in this Congress. It is different from the Feinstein-Snowe legislation because medical necessity is not defined, and that is the issue. 
   Secondly, the Robb amendment did not have a second opinion for cancer patients. That is included in this legislation. 
   This amendment is offered to the Republican legislation; that is, the substitute that was offered by the minority leader. That is the process that has been developed on a bipartisan basis and on unanimous agreement. The Republican substitute does not have this language. The option was to offer this amendment at this point in time. 
   I should also make it clear the amendment that was offered yesterday by the Senator from Virginia was restated in the language that was already included in the Democratic legislation. So it is just restating a fact. We are in a position to offer this legislation to the Republican substitute, language that has not been included in the Republican substitute. 
   This is the process that has been agreed to. Therefore, that is why this amendment is being offered at this time. I had hoped we could have worked on it yesterday, but the Robb amendment was offered to the Democratic plan yesterday, and that was a second-degree amendment. We had no ability to perfect that amendment.

   Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator. It does obviously represent the legislation that I introduced on this issue. I appreciate the Senator's forceful advocacy. Obviously, the issue is concerning scope at this point in time. I might agree with him on what he is attempting to do, but obviously there is a big difference in our legislative approaches with respect to scope. There are differences. Perhaps that ultimately can be worked out on the whole issue of clinical trials, and I hope it is. I believe it is that important. We were left in the position, given the scenario that has been developed on both sides, because I think this is so important, of having to offer it at this point in time or I lost the opportunity. We think it is important to add this language to the Republican substitute. We lost an opportunity yesterday, to be honest with you, with the amendment that was offered to the Democrat's plan. We are left in this parliamentary process at this point in time.

   Ms. SNOWE. I will look at the language. I would certainly want to support it. I know it does not include FDA-sponsored trials. I cannot speak for everybody in this conference or in this Senate, but certainly it is something I could support and obviously do support, given the legislation I have introduced in this Congress. I will be more than happy to do that. 
   At this point, we have to address the issue of mastectomies. It is that important to this legislation. We lost an opportunity to improve upon the Robb amendment, because 
   that was a second-degree amendment offered yesterday, and, obviously, that created another Hobson's choice.

I was aware, in fact, he was offering an amendment, but there was no strategy on this side to suggest we would not engage in that debate. I think there was some discussion on this side about the debate. I do not see that is a valid objection at all.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I still have some remaining time. 
   I would like to make a point. I think the point is, there are substantial differences between the legislation offered by the Senator from Virginia yesterday and the legislation we are offering in this amendment. We are not defining ``medical necessity.'' As I indicated previously, there has been no other legislation on this issue that defines ``medical necessity,'' legislation that has been introduced on a bipartisan basis over the last few years. 
   That is going to take away from women the variety of treatments and prescriptions for breast cancer, as you can see what is illustrated on this chart. I think we ought to opt for the best treatment, the best practice, the best standard, and the best principles. No one else, no professional, no government agency, no private association with medical credentials has defined ``medical necessity'' because you can't. 
   Leave it up to the doctor and the patient. That is what we are asking with respect to women who have breast cancer. That is a huge difference between this amendment and the one that was offered yesterday. By the way, the language offered yesterday was already included in the minority's plan, so it did not have to be restated. I think we could have worked something out that we could have agreed to on a bipartisan basis, as we already have in legislation that has been introduced on this very issue. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to make a few points to wrap up. I applaud the leadership of Senator DODD with respect to clinical study trials. Obviously, I could not agree with him more on this issue. 
   This is an issue that will be addressed further in this debate, as it should. But the Senator is frustrated, and if other Senators are frustrated at the process, then we all have a collective responsibility to make sure it does not happen again. We cannot pretend we do not know how we got here. It is unfortunate we have a Hobson's choice today, but we had a Hobson's choice yesterday when it came to mastectomies when the amendment was offered by Senator ROBB to the legislation that already had the identical language. I had planned to offer this legislation well before the recess because I wanted to improve upon the Republican legislation on managed care. I thought it was absolutely essential. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts asked, why did we just identify mastectomies and women with breast cancer? I say to the Senator, why? For the same reason the Senator singled out mastectomies in his own legislation and Senator ROBB singled it out in his amendment that he offered yesterday. Because we have an identifiable problem with drive-through  mastectomies and HMOs. That was the genesis of the legislation to begin with when former Senator D'Amato had introduced that legislation with Senator FEINSTEIN and myself several years ago. I introduced the same legislation this year with Senator FEINSTEIN for that very reason, because there has been a problem with managed care and drive-through mastectomies. 
   We have all heard the horror stories. That is why this legislation was developed. That is why I am offering this amendment to the Republican legislation, because it does not have that language. 
   Some suggest there is some partisan political ploy. I will compare my credentials on bipartisanship with anybody across the aisle. We have worked on a bipartisan basis on issues concerning women's health since I came to the Congress 20 years ago. I would have hoped yesterday we would have had the opportunity to work it out rather than having to vote on an amendment that included language that was already in the Democratic bill. 
   We should have been working together, but now we are having to address the issue of defining ``medical necessity'' that no other legislation, no board, no governmental agency, no association has defined. It is going to limit the treatment that is offered to women when it comes to breast cancer. That is a fact. 
   So the choice is, are you going to get the best care, the best treatment, the best principles when it comes to breast cancer? Or are you going to lower the threshold and say: Well, everybody offers this, no matter what, when there are other options? There is better science developing all the time, and it could be available to a woman who has breast cancer. 
   Those are the choices. That is why we are at this point. I just say to everybody in this Chamber, if we want to avoid this kind of contrivance when it comes to this amendment process, then I suggest it is the responsibility of each of us to make sure it does not happen, so that we get the very best legislation, that we can walk across the aisle, rather than being constrained by the parliamentary procedures that we confront today.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate a courageous World War I veteran from my home state of Maine who on Friday will be awarded the most prestigious honor that France bestows, the National Order of the Legion of Honor. 
   Everett McKenney who has lived in Augusta and Waterville will receive this distinguished honor for the tremendous sacrifices he made to safeguard freedom and democracy while serving in France during the first World War. 
   In 1998, the French Government announced Project 1918-1998. The purpose of Project 1918-1998 is to honor the 80th anniversary of the armistice of World War I, and as part of this undertaking, France announced that it would award the Legion of Honor designation to surviving American veterans who, like Mr. McKenney, served in France between 1914 and 1918. This step is taken in recognition of the decisive support Americans gave to French soldiers as they fought to defend French soil. 
   Up to 1,000 American veterans who served in France during World War I may still be alive today, and there is a search underway to locate as many of these men and women as possible. 
   Private Everett McKenney, who is 104 and a longtime resident of Waterville and Augusta, has two daughters, five grandchildren, four great grandchildren, and one great, great grandchild. He was the youngest of four children and was born in Freedom, Maine in 1895. He enlisted in July 1918 at 23, in Waterville. He was stationed in Fort Devens, Massachusetts and received special training in New Jersey. He was assigned to the 41st Rainbow Division and later was assigned to the 101st Field Artillery unit. In New Jersey, he was notified to pack his gear and prepare for an overseas assignment. During a 12-day Atlantic crossing, a flu epidemic broke out and many of his comrades were buried at sea. This would be the first of many trials he would face. 
   I have nothing but the utmost respect for those who have served with courage, honor and distinction when their country--and the world--needed them so desperately. Indeed, I am truly honored to represent these men and women as Maine's senior Senator. 
   On November 11, 1918, almost 81 years ago, at the eleventh hour, the Armistice was signed in France that silenced the guns and ended the carnage of World War I. From the War for Independence, to World War I, through the Persian Gulf War and the Balkans more than two hundred years later, Americans like Everett have answered the call to duty--not for the glory or conquest or empire, but to ensure that the flame of liberty burns ever brightly. 
   The debt of gratitude owed to our veterans can never be fully repaid. What we can and must do for those who, like Mr. McKenney, answered the call to duty is keep alive the values of freedom and democracy they have defended, and honor them as the guardians of those ideals. 
   Elmer Runyon once wrote that: ``We will remain the home of the free only as long as we are also the home of the brave.'' Today, America and the world is basking in the shine of freedom because of yesterday's and today's service men and women--who offer nobly to sacrifice in war so that others may live in peace. These are America's true heroes. 
   This occasion reminds us that winning freedom is not the same as keeping it. The cost of safeguarding freedom is high. It requires vigilance and sacrifice. Time and again when freedom has been threatened, men like Everett McKenney emerged as heroes. America's veterans have served our country and the world ably in times of need, and know well the personal sacrifices which the defense of freedom demands. It is a true honor to congratulate Mr. McKenney on a well-deserved recognition.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute a veteran from Maine who this week will have bestowed upon him high honors from the French Government for the sacrifices he made during World War I. 
   Fred Gylfe will receive the most prestigious honor that France bestows, the award of the National Order of the Legion of Honor, in gratitude for the valor he displayed serving in France during the First World War. 
   Last year, the French Government announced Project 1918-1998, which honors the 80th anniversary of the armistice of World War I. As part of this undertaking, France is awarding the Legion of Honor Award to surviving American veterans who served in France between 1914 and 1918--in recognition for the crucial support American veterans lent to French soldiers fighting to defend French soil. 
   It is estimated that as many as 1,000 American veterans who served in France during World War I may still be living, and there is a search underway to locate as many of these men and women as possible. 
   Fred Gylfe was born in Worcester, Massachusetts on August 14, 1897. His parents emigrated from Sweden, and he was their first child born in the U.S. He entered the U.S. National Guard in 1916 and departed for France on May 16, 1918. He fought in Ypres/Lys and Saint Quentin Tunnel in the French province of Somme. He was a Sergeant in Headquarters Company for the 108th Infantry 27th division of the New York National Guard. He is the father of two children, and three grandchildren. 
   I have nothing but the utmost respect for those who have served with courage, honor and distinction, answering the call to duty when their country--and the world no less--needed them so desperately. Indeed, it is no small challenge to put into words the enormous pride I feel for the opportunity to represent men like Fred Gylfe as Maine's senior Senator. 
   On November 11, 1918, almost 81 years ago, at the eleventh hour, the Armistice was signed in France that silenced the guns and ended the carnage of World War I.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sincere appreciation to my colleagues for joining me in honoring the more than two million veterans of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW, of the United States as we pass legislation I introduced earlier this year, S.J. Res. 21, to designate September 29, 1999, as Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States Day. 
   September 29, 1999 marks the centennial of the VFW. As veterans of the Spanish American War and the Philippine Insurrection of 1899 and the China Relief Expedition of 1900 returned home, they drew together in order to preserve the ties of comradeship forged in service to their country. 
   They began by forming local groups to secure rights and benefits for the service they rendered to our country. In Columbus, OH, veterans founded the American Veterans of Foreign Service. In Denver, Colorado, veterans started the Colorado Society of the Army of the Philippines. In 1901, the Philippine War Veterans organization was started by the Philippine Veterans in Altoona and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1913, these varied organizations with a common mission joined forces as the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. I am honored to salute this proud organization. 
   Mr. President, when many of us think about war veterans, we think about the tremendous sacrifices these defenders of freedom made to safeguard the democracy we cherish, especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice. S.J. Res. 21 recognizes those contributions and sacrifices. It also recognizes the contributions that VFW members continue to make day-in and day-out in our communities--the youth activities and scholarships programs, the Special Olympics, homeless assistance initiatives, efforts to reach out to fellow veterans in need, and national leadership on issues of importance to veterans and all Americans. Over the last 100 years, members of the VFW have contributed greatly to our nation both in and out of uniform in ways too numerous to enumerate. 
   I have nothing but the utmost respect for those who have served their country. With this legislation, we honor the men and women and their families who have served this country with courage, honor and distinction. They answered the call to duty when their country needed them, and this is but a small token of our appreciation. 
   The centennial of the founding of the VFW will present all Americans with an opportunity to honor and pay tribute to the more than two million active members of the VFW and to all veterans, as well as to the ideals for which many made the ultimate sacrifice. I thank my colleagues for joining me in a strong show of support and an expression of thanks to the VFW and all veterans. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator TED KENNEDY, to introduce legislation that will play a critical role in the advancement of education as we prepare for the demands of the 21st Century. Specifically, the ``Educating America's Girls Act of 1999'' will ensure that our nation's children--and young women in particular--will be prepared for the job market of the coming millenium, while also ensuring that the unique needs of girls are properly addressed in our nation's schools and classrooms. 
   Given the critical role of education in preparing our children for the future, it is understandable that there is heightened interest in ensuring that the highest academic standards and best practices are incorporated in our nation's schools and classrooms. As Congress undertakes the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965, the provisions of the ``Educating America's Girls Act'' will ensure that the varying educational needs of all students, and young girls in particular, are recognized and addressed--and ultimately ensure that our efforts to reform and improve education are realized. 
   Mr. President, due to the changes adopted in 1994, gender equity is a major theme throughout the ESEA. Specifically, the needs of girls are addressed in current law by requiring professional development activities to meet the needs of diverse students, including girls; encouraging professional development and recruitment activities to increase the numbers of women math and science teachers; including sexual harassment and abuse as a focus of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act; broadening dropout prevention activities to address the needs of pregnant and parenting teens; and reauthorizing the Women's Educational Equity Act (WEEA), which funds research and programs to achieve educational equity for women. 
   During the ESEA reauthorization process, we should not only work to maintain the important gender equity provisions that were included in the 1994 law, but also to prepare girls for the future by adding the following provisions: ensure education technology programs are targeted in a manner that addresses the unique needs of all students, including girls; provide schools with resources to combat sexual harassment and abuse; collect data on high school athletic participation by girls; keep pregnant and parenting teens in school; and reauthorize WEEA. 
   Accordingly, the ``Educating America's Girls Act'' contains provisions that will address all of these needs, so I urge that my colleagues support this legislation and these additions during the upcoming reauthorization of the ESEA. 
   Mr. President, with the growing demand for technological skills in the workplace--including six out of 10 jobs requiring technological skills--the need to incorporate technology in the classroom cannot be understated. Accordingly, the utilization of education technology in the classroom is an arena in which we must ensure that all students, including girls, are not put at a disadvantage. 
   Of note, a 1998 report by the American Association of University Women, Gender Gaps: Where Our Schools Still Fail Our Children, found that girls, when compared to boys, are at a significant disadvantage as technology is increasingly incorporated into the classroom. Specifically, girls tend to come to the classroom with less exposure to computers and other technology, and girls believe that they are less adept at using technology than boys. As a result, girls tend to have a more ``circumscribed, limited, and cautious'' interaction with technology than boys, as highlighted in the report. 
   Schools can assist girls in developing a confident relationship to technology by integrating digital tools into the curriculum so girls can pursue their own interests. Unfortunately, current law lacks assurances that federal education programs will compensate for girls' different learning styles and different exposures to technology. 
   Accordingly, provisions in the ``Educating America's Girls Act'' will ensure that the different learning styles of girls and other students will be taken into consideration when monies are awarded for a variety of existing K-12 programs. Furthermore, it also includes the ``High Technology for Girls Act'' (High-Tech Girls), legislation I have already introduced that will ensure young girls are encouraged to pursue degrees and demanding careers in math, science, engineering, and technology--fields that are critical in the increasingly technologically-driven workplace. 
   Mr. President, as we seek to ensure that the unique technological needs of girls are addressed in the classroom, we also cannot ignore that sexual harassment and abuse is another issue of importance as we seek to educate our nation's children. 
   While comprehensive research should be done on the pervasiveness of sexual harassment in schools--and ``Educating America's Girls Act'' will ensure that such a study is completed--various studies have found that the vast majority of secondary school students experience some form of sexual harassment during their school lives. 
   For instance, the AAUW Educational Foundation's 1993 survey of 8th through 11th grade students on sexual harassment in schools, Hostile Hallways: The AAUW Survey on Sexual Harassment in America's Schools, found that the vast majority of secondary school students experienced some form of sexual harassment and that girls are disproportionately affected. 
   While data on the incidence of sexual harassment is scant, Hostile Hallways found that 85 percent of girls experienced some form of sexual harassment; 65 percent of girls who have been harassed were harassed in the classroom;  and 73 percent of girls who have been harassed were harassed in the hallway of their school; a student's first experience of sexual harassment is most likely to occur in the middle school/junior high years of 6th to 9th grade; and 81 percent of girls who have been harassed do not report it to adults. 
   A 1996 University of Michigan study showed that sexual harassment can result in academic problems such as paying less attention in class and Hostile Hallways found that 32 percent of girls do not want to talk as much in class after experiencing harassment. Furthermore, thirty-three percent of girls do not want to go to school at all due to the stress and anxiety they suffered as a result of the sexual harassment, and nearly one in four girls say that harassment caused them to stay home from school or cut a class. 
   We know little else about the extent of sexual harassment or even the nature and extent of more serious sexual crimes in schools. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (SDFSCA) requires the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to collect data on violence in elementary and secondary schools in the United States. However, these reports provide only a very limited picture of sexual offenses in schools because they only capture data on rape or sexual battery reported to police. Further, school crime victimization surveys do not include questions on threats or abuse that are sexual in nature. 
   Sexual harassment in schools is illegal, a form of sexual discrimination banned under Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972. Unfortunately, on the 25th anniversary of Title IX, a report by the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education (NCWGE) found that less progress was made in the area of sexual harassment than in any other gender equity issue in education. NCWGE concluded that few schools have sexual harassment policies, or effectively enforce them. Therefore, in addition to calling for more intensified Office of Civil Rights enforcement, NCWGE called on schools to adopt comprehensive policies and programs addressing sexual harassment. 
   The reauthorization of the ESEA gives us an opportunity to greatly reduce the incidence of sexual harassment by gathering data on these often hidden offenses and providing programs to prevent sexual harassment and abuse. Accordingly, the ``Educating America's Girls Act'' ensures that this data will be compiled and that schools are provided with resources to combat sexual harassment. Of importance, because the definition of sexual harassment in elementary and secondary schools can be contentious, the legislation ensures that local schools will have the sole authority to define the forms of sexual harassment that will be addressed, and the sole authority to determine the types of programs that will be undertaken to address it. 
   Mr. President, equal access to education for girls also means equal access to opportunities for athletic participation in our schools, particularly our high schools. Unfortunately, nationwide data measuring the participation of girls in physical education and high school athletics programs is very limited. 
   Participation in high school athletic programs is important for girls because research has shown that it improves girls' physical and mental health. For instance, a study by the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports recently found that girls playing sports have better physical and emotional health than those who do not. The study also found that higher rates of athletic participation were associated with lower rates of sexual activity and 
   pregnancy. Other studies link physical activity to lower rates of heart disease, breast cancer, and osteoporosis in later life. Sports build girls' confidence, sense of physical empowerment, and social recognition within the school and community. 
   In addition, many girls who participate in high school athletics programs receive college scholarships. Therefore, by participating in high school athletics programs, girls increase their chances at receiving a college scholarship--which may be the only way that some young women will be able to pursue a higher education. 
   Because of the lack of data on girls' participation in physical education and athletics during grades K-12, the ``Educating America's Girls Act'' will ensure that this data is collected and reported. Ultimately, this assembling of information will allow us to determine if girls are fully participating in these activities, and if further steps should be taken to increase their involvement. 
   Mr. President, education is ultimately the means for all girls, including pregnant and parenting teens, to achieve economic self-sufficiency. Yet despite our strides to make education accessible to girls, dropping out of school remains a serious problem that should be addressed in the reauthorization of the ESEA. 
   Five out of every 100 young adults enrolled in high school in 1996 left school without successfully completing a high school program. In October of 1997, 3.6 million young adults, or 11 percent of young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 in the United States, were neither enrolled in a high school program nor had they completed high school. Of note, girls who drop out are less likely than boys to return and complete school. 
   Twenty-five years after the enactment of Title IX, pregnancy and parenting are still the most commonly cited reasons why girls drop out of school, and the United States has the highest teen pregnancy rate of any industrialized nation. In fact, almost one million teenagers become pregnant each year and 80 percent of these pregnancies are unintended. 
   Pregnancy and parenting account for half the female dropout rate and one fourth of the dropout rate for all students. Two-thirds of girls who give birth before age 18 will not complete high school, and the younger the adolescent is when she becomes pregnant, the more likely it is that she will not complete high school. 
   The last reauthorization of ESEA broadened the dropout prevention program to address the needs of pregnant and parenting teens. Because this problem remains so pervasive, the ``Educating America's Girls Act'' contains provisions to strengthen the ESEA's support for programs that keep pregnant and parenting teens in school, including the utilization of mentoring programs. 
   Finally, Mr. President, the Women's Educational Equity Act (WEEA) represents the federal commitment to helping schools eradicate sex discrimination from their programs and practices and to ensuring that girls' future choices and success are determined not by their gender, but by their own interests, aspirations, and abilities. Since the program's inception in 1974, the WEEA has funded research, development, and dissemination of curricular materials; training programs; guidance and testing activities; and other projects to combat inequitable educational practices. 
   Because of the important role that the WEEA has played in addressing sex discrimination over the past 25 years, the ``Educating America's Girls Act'' reauthorizes the WEEA so that it can continue to address the needs of women for many years to come. 
   Mr. President, the bottom line is that the reauthorization of the ESEA provides us with a unique opportunity to address the numerous needs of our nation's students as we prepare for the 21st Century. I believe that the provisions of the ``Educating America's Girls Act'' will address a variety of these needs--and the unique needs of girls in particular--and urge that my colleagues support this legislation accordingly during the months ahead.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about Bread for the World, an organization which has dedicated itself to helping end hunger in the U.S. and throughout the world, and is celebrating its 25th Anniversary this year. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the members of Bread for the World on their 25 years of dedication to helping those less fortunate. 
   Bread for the World began in 1974 with a small group of Protestants and Catholics who were concerned about hunger. This group of individuals has now become a national movement with 44,000 members representing 40 denominations. In its informational campaigns around the world, and here on Capitol Hill, Bread for the World is a non-partisan organization whose legislative initiatives serve the purpose of providing assistance to those in need and, no less important, a means to provide for oneself. 
   Children and child nutrition programs have been a principal focus for Bread for the World. In addition, Bread for the World has advocated programs designed to help individuals in need to receive assistance and, ultimately, find a job. During my tenure here in the Senate, and earlier as a member of the House of Representatives, I have worked with Bread for the World on a number of initiatives related to these issues. Last year, the Congress passed and the President signed into law legislation backed by Break for the World, the Africa: Seeds of Hope Act, of which I was an original cosponsor. This law will redirect U.S. resources to small-scale farmers and struggling rural communities in Africa. It also established a revolving loan fund to provide food aid in response to emergency food crises throughout the world. 
   As a member of the board, I am pleased to commend the people of this fine organization for 25 years of dedicated efforts on behalf of Americans and people around the world who suffer from hunger.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will ensure our nation's students, and young women in particular, are encouraged to pursue degrees and careers in math, science, engineering, and technology. 
   Mr. President, if our children are to be prepared for the globally competitive economy of the next century, they must not only have access to the technologies that will dominate the workforce and job market that they will enter--but they should also be encouraged to pursue degrees in the fields that underlie these technologies. 
   We simply cannot ignore that six out of ten new jobs require technological skills--skills that are seriously lacking in our workforce today. The impact of this technological illiteracy is devastating for our nation's businesses, with an estimated loss in productivity of $30 billion every year, and the inability of companies across the nation to fill an estimated 190,000 technology jobs in mid- to large-sized companies. In fact, these very job vacancies led to Congress passing legislation last year that increased the number of H1-B visas that could be issued to foreign workers to enter the United States. 
   Furthermore, according to a 1994 report by the American School Counselors Association, 65 percent of all jobs will require technical skills in the year 2000, with 20 percent being professional and only 15 percent relying on unskilled labor. In addition, between 1996 and 2006, all occupations expect a 14 percent increase in jobs, but Information Technology occupations should jump by 75 percent. As this data implies, today's students must gain a different knowledge base than past generations of students if they are to be prepared for, and competitive in, the global job market of the 21st Century. 
   Mr. President, even as we should seek to increase student access and exposure  to advanced technologies in our nation's schools and classrooms through the E-rate and other programs, we should also seek to increase the interest of our students in the fields that are the backbone of these technologies: namely, math, science, engineering, and other technology-related fields. Clearly, if technology will be the cornerstone of the job market of the future, then it is vital that our nation's students--who will be tomorrow's workers--be the architects that build that cornerstone. 
   Accordingly, the legislation I am offering today is designed to ensure that our nation's students are encouraged to pursue degrees in these demanding fields. In particular, my legislation will ensure that young girls--who are currently less likely to enter these fields than their male counterparts--be encouraged to enter these fields of study. 
   Mr. President, as was highlighted in the American Association of University Women report, ``Gender Gaps: Where Schools Still Fail Our Children,'' when compared to boys, girls might be at a significant disadvantage as technology is increasingly incorporated into the classroom. Not only do girls tend to come into the classroom with less exposure to computers and other technology, but they also tend to believe that they are less adept at using technology than boys. 
   In light of these findings, it should come as no surprise that girls are dramatically underrepresented in advanced computer science courses after graduation from high school. Furthermore, it should come as no surprise that girls tend to gravitate toward the fields of social sciences, health services, and education, while boys disproportionately gravitate toward the fields of engineering and business. 
   In fact, data gathered in 1997 on the intended majors of college-bound students found that a larger proportion of female than male SAT test-takers intended to major in visual and performing arts, biological sciences, education, foreign or classical languages, health and allied services, language and lierature, and the social sciences. In contrast, a larger portion of boys than girls intended to major in agriculture and natural resources, business and commerce, engineering, mathematics, and physical sciences. 
   While all of these fields are invaluable--and students should always be encouraged to choose the fields of study and careers that interest them most--I believe it is critical that we ensure students do not balk at entering a particular field of study or career simply because it has typically been associated with ``males'' or ``females.'' Instead, all students should be aware of the multitude of opportunities that are available to them, and encouraged to enter those fields that they find of interest. 
   Mr. President, young women should not shy away from technical careers simply because they are more often associated with men--and they should not avoid higher education courses that would give them the knowledge and skills they need for these jobs simply because they are more typically taken by young men. Accordingly, my legislation will ensure that fields relying on skills in math, science, engineering, and technology will be promoted to all students--and especially girls--to ensure that the numerous opportunities and demands of the job market in the 21st Century are met. 
   Specifically, the ``High Technology for Girls Act'' will expand the possible uses of monies provided under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965 to ensure young women are encouraged to pursue demanding careers and higher education degrees in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology. As a result, monies provided for Professional Development Activities, the National Teacher Training Project, and the Technology for Education programs can be used by schools to ensure 
   these fields of study and careers are presented in a favorable manner to all students. 
   Of critical importance, schools will be able to use these monies for the development of mentoring programs, model programs, or other appropriate programs in partnership with local businesses or institutions of higher education. As a result, programs will be created that meld the best ideas from educators and the private sector, thereby improving the manner in which these fields are presented and taught--and ultimately putting a positive ``face'' on fields that may otherwise be shunned by young women. 
   Mr. President, as Congress moves forward in its effort to reauthorize the ESEA, I believe the provisions contained in this legislation would be a positive and much-needed step toward preparing our students for the jobs of the 21st Century. We cannot afford to let any of our nation's students overlook the fields of study that will be the cornerstone of the global job market of the future, and my legislation will help ensure that does not happen. 
   Accordingly, I urge that my colleagues support the ``High Technology for Girls Act,'' and look forward to working for its adoption during the consideration of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Nevada, Senator HARRY REID, to reintroduce the Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act. We are back today, with the support of 30 Members of the Senate, to finish the work we began in the last Congress. 
   Why are we back again this year? Because the need behind the Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act has not abated. There are three million unintended pregnancies every year--half of all pregnancies that occur every year in this country. And frighteningly, approximately half of all unintended pregnancies end in abortion. 
   I am firmly pro-choice and I believe in a woman's right to a safe and legal abortion when she needs this procedure. But I want abortion to be an option that a woman rarely needs. So how do we prevent this? How do we reduce the number of unintended pregnancies? 
   The safest and most effective means of preventing unintended pregnancies are with prescription contraceptives. And while the vast majority of insurers cover prescription drugs, they treat prescription contraceptives very differently. In fact, half of large group plans exclude coverage of contraceptives. And only one-third cover oral contraceptives--the most popular form of reversible birth control. 
   When one realizes the insurance ``carve-out'' for these prescriptions and related outpatient treatments, it is no longer a mystery why women spend 68 percent more than men in out-of-pocket health care costs. No woman should have to forgo or rely on inexpensive and less effective contraceptives for purely economic reasons, knowing that she risks an unintended pregnancy. 
   In last year's Omnibus Appropriations Bill, Congress instructed the health plans participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan--the largest employer-sponsored health insurance plan in the world--to provide prescription contraceptive coverage if they cover prescription drugs as a part of their benefits package. The protections we afford to Members of Congress, their staff, other federal employees and annuitants, and to the approximately two million women of reproductive age who are participating in FEHBP need to be extended to the rest of the country. 
   Unfortunately, the lack of contraceptive coverage in health insurance is not news to most women. Countless American women have been shocked to learn that their insurance does not cover contraceptives, one of their most basic health care needs, even though other prescription drugs which are equally valuable to their lives are routinely covered. Less than half--49 percent --of all large-group health care plans cover any contraceptive method at all and only 15 percent cover the five most common reversible birth control methods. HMOs are more likely to cover contraceptives, but only 39 percent cover all five reversible methods. And ironically, 86 percent of large group plans, preferred provider organizations, and HMOs cover sterilization and between 66 and 70 percent of these different plans do cover abortion. 
   The concept underlying EPICC is simple. This legislation says that if insurers cover prescription drugs and devices, they must also cover FDA-approved prescription contraceptives. And in conjunction with this, EPICC requires health plans which already cover basic health care services to also cover outpatient services related to prescription contraceptives. 
   The bill does not require insurance companies to cover prescription drugs. What the bill does say is that if insurers cover prescription drugs, they cannot carve prescription contraceptives out of their formularies. And it says that insurers which cover outpatient health care services cannot limit or exclude coverage of the medical and counseling services necessary for effective contraceptive use. 
   This bill is good health policy. By helping families to adequately space their pregnancies, contraceptives contribute to healthy pregnancies and healthy births, reduce rates of maternal complications, and reduces the possibility of low-birthweight births. 
   Furthermore, the Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act makes good economic sense. We know that contraceptives are cost-effective: in the public sector, for every dollar invested in family planning, $4 to $14 is saved in health care and related costs. And all methods of reversible contraceptives are cost-effective when compared to the cost of unintended pregnancy. A sexually active woman who uses no contraception costs the health care provider an average of $3,225 in a given year. The average cost of an uncomplicated vaginal delivery in 1993 was approximately $6,400. And for every 100 women who do not use contraceptives in a given year, 85 percent will become pregnant. 
   Why do insurance companies exclude prescription contraceptive coverage from their list of covered benefits--especially when they cover other prescription drugs? The tendency of insurance plans to cover sterilization and abortion reflects, in part, their long-standing tendency to cover surgery and treatment over prevention. Sterilization and abortion is also cheaper. But insurers do not feel compelled to cover prescription contraceptives because they know that most women who lack contraceptive coverage will simply pay for them out of pocket. And in order to prevent an unintended pregnancy, a woman needs to be on some form of birth control for almost 30 years of her life. 
   The Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act tells insurance companies that we can no longer tolerate policies that disadvantage women and disadvantage our nation. When our bill is passed, women will finally be assured of equity in prescription drug coverage and health care services. And America's unacceptably high rates of unintended pregnancies and abortions will be reduced in the process. 
   The philosophy behind the bill is that contraceptives should be treated no differently than any other prescription drug or device. It does not give contraceptives any type of special insurance coverage, but instead seeks to achieve equity of treatment and parity of coverage. For that reason, the bill specifies that if a plan imposes a deductible or cost-sharing requirement on prescription drugs or devices, it can impose the same deductible or cost-sharing requirement on prescription contraception. But it cannot charge a higher cost-sharing requirement or deductible on contraceptives. Outpatient contraceptive services must also be treated similarly to general outpatient health care services. 
   Time and time again Americans have expressed the desire for their leaders to come together to work on the problems that face us. This bill exemplifies that spirit of cooperation. It crosses some very wide gulfs and makes some very meaningful changes in policy that will benefit countless Americans. 
   As someone who is pro-choice, I firmly believe that abortions should be safe, legal, and rare. Through this bill, I invite both my pro-choice and pro-life colleagues to join with me in emphasizing the rare.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I draw the attention of the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee to a funding provision of the FY 2000 Defense Authorization Bill that passed after the Appropriations Committee had completed its military budget mark-up last month. Title X of the Authorization Bill allows the Secretary of the Navy to expend no more than $190 million for the advance procurement of components to support the planned construction of DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers in Fiscal Years 2002 and 2003. The Navy, as the Chairman knows, has already written to Congress that it will need $371 million for this purpose by FY 2001, but the obligation of some of this amount next fiscal year may reduce programmatic risks.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, Members of the Senate, last night the Senate did pass an amendment I drafted establishing a policy that would require the President to establish a multinational embargo against adversary nations once our Armed Forces have become engaged in hostilities. I thank the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, and Senator LEVIN, as well as minority and majority staffs of the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee for working with me on this initiative. 
   This amendment would impose a requirement on Presidents to seek multilateral economic embargoes, as well as foreign asset seizures, against governments with which the United States engages in armed hostilities. 
   After 1 month of conflict in Kosovo, the Pentagon had announced that NATO had destroyed most of Yugoslavia's interior oil-refining capacity. At approximately the same point in time, we had the Secretary of State acknowledging that the Serbians had continued to fortify with imported oil their hidden armed forces in the province. 
   Just 3 weeks ago, the allies first agreed to an American proposal, one which had been put forward by this administration, to intercept petroleum exports bound for Serbia but then declined to enforce the ban against their own ships. 
   On May 1, 5 weeks after the Kosovo operation had begun, the President finally signed an Executive order imposing an American embargo against Belgrade on oil, software, and other sensitive products. 
   Yet, NATO and the United States have paid a steep price for failing to impose a comprehensive economic sanction on Serbia from the beginning of the air campaign, which started in March. 
   As recently as May 13, a Government source told Reuters that the Yugoslavian Army continued to smuggle significant amounts of oil over land and water. 
   At the end of April, General Clark gave the alliance a plan for the interdiction of oil tankers coming into the Adriatic towards Serbian ports. To justify this proposal, he cited the fact that through approximately 11 shipments, the Yugoslavians had imported 450,000 barrels containing 19 million gallons of petroleum vital to their war effort. Let me repeat: 450,000 barrels, containing 19 million gallons of oil, that supported the war effort. Half of those 19 million gallons of oil would support them for 2 months; half of the 19 million gallons of oil supported the Serbian war effort for 2 months, yet we allowed 11 shipments to come through since the beginning of this air campaign. 
   Unfortunately, it has been economic business as usual for the Serbians as our missiles try to grind their will. The President declared on March 24 the beginning of the NATO campaign and set a goal of deterring a bloody offensive against the Moslem civilians. We know what happened. 
   I have a chart that illustrates a chronology of the situation when it comes to economic business as usual. We started the air campaign March 24. Then on April 13, while we were adding more aircraft to the engagement, Serbia had reached the midpoint of receiving 11 shipments of oil from abroad. 
   Of course, on April 27, General Clark announced:  
   We have destroyed his oil production capacity.  
   NATO estimates of displaced Kosovars rise to 820,000. Serbia receives 165,000 barrels of imported fuel over a 24-hour 
   period. 
   While we were adding more aircraft, it now had been a month later since the campaign began, we find they are still bringing in more oil. A month after the start, they were at the midpoint of receiving 450,000 barrels of oil. 
   By the close of April, General Clark confirmed the destruction of Yugoslavia's oil production capacity. On the same day, however, the Serbs took in 165,000 barrels of imported oil. As I mentioned earlier in this chronology, while we are still bringing in the aircraft, they are still bringing in the oil. 
   Interestingly enough, just today, in the Financial Times of London, General Wesley Clark was understood to have expressed concern about the oil issue when he briefed NATO ambassadors yesterday on the progress of the 9-week-old air campaign. He has expressed disappoint that U.S. proposals for using force to support the embargo, at least in the Adriatic, were rejected by other allies--notably France. NATO is still working out how the details of a voluntary ``visit and search'' regime under which the alliance warships would check on ships sailing up the Adriatic Sea. Let me repeat, they are still working out the details of a voluntary visit and search regime. 
   Now we are in the ninth week of the campaign, well over 400 aircraft, 23, 24 Apache helicopters, the President has called up 33,000 reservists, and they have yet to establish procedures for an oil embargo. They are still working out the details. 
   The article goes on to say the North Atlantic Council agreed this week to introduce the regime but has to approve the rules of engagement. 
   It is clear that the air campaign is still being operated, and, obviously, the oil embargo, according to committee. 
   On May 1, when the President signed the Executive order barring oil and  software receipts, there were 11 foreign oil shipments of 450,000 barrels. Milosevic has now received the last of the 11 April oil shipments, for a total of 450,000 barrels on the day when the President signed the Executive order barring the oil and software imports. 
   As of 3 weeks ago, the number of displaced Kosovars had topped 1 million, and NATO acknowledges the continuation--as we have certainly learned today in the most recent news updates--of energy imports by the enemy. These imported energy reserves play a significant role in supporting Serbian ground operations.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, access to quality health care concerns many of our military men and women, both active and retired. My amendment would allow the Department of Defense to start a pilot project allowing continuous open enrollment in managed health care plans form military retirees at 2 sites selected by the Defense Department. 
   The term ``continuous enrollment'' means the opportunity for military beneficiaries to join the Prime option in TRICARE at any time. Currently, military retirees and their beneficiaries wishing to enroll in the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan (USFHP) may only do so during an annual 30-day long, open session. 
   This arrangement inconsistent with the enrollment rules under TRICARE Prime option. These same beneficiaries can join TRICARE Prime on a continuous basis, but are restricted from joining the USFHP to joint once a year for a 30-day period. 
   Coupled with the many changes in TriCare, including new enrollment fees and higher copayments, many military beneficiaries are confused and unsure if the HMO option in TriCare, either Prime through the managed care support contractor of the USFHP, is the right choice for them and their families. Thus, as I have been informed by physicians from my own state, many beneficiaries and their families have decided not to join either program. 
   What this restriction means in practical terms for retirees is that they are not able to take advantage of health are providers that may practice in close proximity to their residences, but instead travel significant distances to a military treatment facility. In locations where there are no TriCare Prime network providers, the retirees are aced with limited choices and higher costs. 
   The Department of Defense has indicate that this open enrollment would be too costly; however, there is limited data to support their contention that this provision will generate a significant influx of new enrollees in the program. DOD's key concerns are based on two factors; the possible increase in cost due to the number of enrollees, and the risk adjustment in the Medicare program scheduled to take effect January 1, 2000. However, based on a review of the actual enrollment data the number of people enrolled in the USFHP program has actually declined from 29,256 in October 1997 to 26,950 in March 1999. 
   This trend represents a decline of 7.6% over eighteen months and an annual rate of decline of 5.0%. 
   As of June 1, six of seven designated providers which operate the USFHP will have completed ``open season'' enrollment. The preliminary results show a net increase of 3,754 individuals enrolled in the USFHP. Of this number, approximately 18% or 676, were 65 and older. This is a much lower percentage--18% compared to 28%--than the 65 and older enrollees were as a percentage of enrollment before the current open season started. 
   This amendment would authorize the Department of Defense to demonstrate the continuous open enrollment program at a minimum of two sites for a two year period. During the second year of the demonstration period, DOD would submit a report to Congress evaluation the benefits of the program and a recommendation concerning  whether the authorize open enrollments in the managed care plans on a permanent basis. 
   This proposal is supported by numerous organizations such as the National Military Family Association and the National Military and Veterans Alliance. The national Military and Veterans Alliance includes organizations such as: The Retired Officers Association, Non-Commissioned Officers Association, Naval Reserve Association, National Association of Uniformed Services, the Reserve Enlisted Association and the Korean War Veterans Association. 
   In testimony before the Personnel Subcommittee earlier this year, representatives from many of these organizations have emphasized that access to quality health care is one of their primary concerns. 
   Finally, I believe that this amendment is a measured step, but one that leads us toward a fair and good faith effort to address the inconsistency in providing our retirees access to health care on an equal basis with TriCare Prime.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this amendment imposes a straightforward but neglected requirement on the administration to seek multilateral economic embargoes as well as foreign asset seizures against governments with which the United States engages in armed hostilities. 
   After one month of conflict in Kosovo, the Pentagon had announced that NATO had destroyed most of Yugoslavia's internal oil refining capacity. 
   But the Secretary of State then acknowledged that the Serbians continued to fortify their hidden armored forces in the province with imported oil. 
   And just three weeks ago, the allies first agreed to an American proposal to intercept petroleum exports bound for Serbia on the high seas but then declined to enforce the ban against their own ships! 
   On May 1st, five weeks after the Kosovo operation had begun, the President finally signed an executive order imposing an American embargo against Belgrade on oil, software, and other sensitive products. 
   Yet NATO and the United States have paid a steep price for failing to impose comprehensive economic sanctions on Serbia from the beginning of the air campaign in late March. As recently as May 13th, an anonymous U.S. government source told Reuters that the Yugoslavian Army continued to smuggle significant amounts of oil over land and water. 
   At the end of April, General Wesley Clark, NATO's Supreme Commander, gave the alliance a plan for the interdiction of oil tankers streaming in the Adriatic towards Serbian ports. To justify this proposal, he cited the fact that through approximately 11 shipments, as this chronology shows, the Yugoslavians had imported 450,000 barrels containing 19 million gallons of petroleum vital to their war efforts. One Russian vessel alone deposited more than four million gallons of this amount. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, it has been economic business as usual for the Serbians as our missiles try to grind their will. The President declared on March 24th the beginning of the NATO campaign and set a goal of deterring a bloody offensive against Moslem civilians. 
   Less than four weeks later, with more than 400 planes flying over 400,000 internally displaced Kosovars, Belgrade reached the mid-point of receiving 11 shipments of oil from abroad. 
   By the close of April, General Clark confirmed the destruction of Yugoslavia's oil production capacity. On the same day, however, the Serbs took in 165,000 barrels of imported fuel. 
   And on May 1st, when the President signed the executive order banning U.S. trade with Yugoslavia, Milosevic had received the last of the 11 April oil shipments for a total of 450,000 barrels. 
   As of three weeks ago, the number of displaced Kosovars had topped one million and NATO acknowledged the continuation of energy imports by the enemy. 
   These imported energy reserves play a significant role in supporting Serbian ground operations. The U.S. Energy Information Agency estimates that Yugoslav forces consume about four thousand barrels of oil per day. This fact means that if Serbian armored units in Kosovo used only one-half of the imported fuel just from April, they could have operated for nearly two months. 
   It took barely one month after the start of the NATO campaign, however, for President Milosevic to uproot the vast majority of the ethnic Albanian population of the province. So by the time frame that NATO had claimed to destroy Serbia's oil refining capacity, mid-to-late April, the Yugoslavians still managed to perpetrate Europe's worst humanitarian crisis since World War II. 
   We now face the strategic and operational challenge of uprooting dispersed tank, artillery, and infantry units in Kosovo. This challenge confounds NATO because our military campaign ignored the offshore economic base sustaining the aggression that we had pledged to overcome. 
   This example, Mr. President, teaches us that military victory involves more than the decisive application of force. It also demands, as Operation Desert Storm so dramatically illustrated, a coordinated diplomatic and economic enemy isolation effort among the United States and its allies. 
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 1, 1990. Five days later, on August 6th, the United Nations Security Council, with only Cuba and Yemen in opposition, had passed a resolution directing ``all states'' to bar Iraqi commodity and product imports. This action first helped to freeze Saddam in Kuwait before he could move into Saudi Arabia. The wartime coalition subsequently faced the more manageable task of expelling this dictator from a small country rather than the entire Arabian Peninsula. 
   We must always try to damage or destroy the offensive military apparatus of a hostile state. But as the Persian Gulf War taught us, it should also be starved of resources. 
   Efforts to establish multilateral embargoes will always encounter resistance and lapses in enforcement. My amendment, however, puts the tyrants of the globe on notice that as a matter of policy, the United States will take immediate steps to deprive them of the finances and the imports to wage war should America and its international partners engage in hostilities against them. 
   The language of this provision instructs the President to ``seek the establishment of a multinational economic embargo'' against an enemy government upon the engagement of our Armed Forces in hostilities. If the conflict continues for more than 14 days, the President must also report to Congress on the actions taken by the administration to implement the embargo and to publish any foreign sources of trade and revenue that sustain an adversary's war-making capabilities. 
   This amendment will not constrain, but strengthen, future Presidents in organizing the international community against regional zealots like Milosevic. We must remember that the European Union states declined to enforce the Adriatic Sea embargo against the advice of the United States. But if we lend the force of law to administration's embargo efforts from the outset of a war, we could gain more allied partners to force an aggressor into military bankruptcy. 
   As our Balkan campaign reveals, the foreign energy and assets at the disposal of dictators can provide their forgotten tools of aggression. But this seamless embargo amendment signals that the United States will not only remember these tools, but take decisive action to break them. It signals that we should not bomb only so the enemy can trade and hide. 
   To enforce greater clarity in our strategies of isolating the nation's armed adversaries of tomorrow, Mr. President, I urge the Senate's unanimous support for this amendment.

    Ms. SNOWE. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation that will standardize coverage for bone mass measurement for people at risk for osteoporosis under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. This legislation is similar to my bill which was enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act to standardize coverage of bone mass measurement under Medicare. The bill I reintroduce today guarantees the same uniformity of coverage to Federal employees and retirees as Congress provided to Medicare beneficiaries two years ago. 
   Osteoporosis is a major public health problem affecting 28 million Americans, who either have the disease or are at risk due to low bone mass; 80 percent of its victims are women. This devastating disease causes 1.5 million fractures annually at a cost of $13.8 billion--$38 million per day--in direct medical expenses. In their lifetime, one in two women and one in eight men over the age of 50 will fracture a bone due to osteoporosis. Amazingly, a woman's risk of a hip fracture is equal to her combined risk of contracting breast, uterine, and ovarian cancer. 
   Osteoporosis is largely preventable and thousands of fractures could be avoided if low bone mass were detected early and treated. Though we now have drugs that promise to reduce fractures by 50 percent and new drugs have been proven to actually rebuild bone mass, a bone mass measurement is the only way to diagnose osteoporosis and determine one's risk for future fractures. And we have learned that there are some prominent risk facts: age, gender, race, a family history of bone fractures, early menopause, risky health behaviors such as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, and some medications all have been identified as contributing factors to bone loss. But identification of risk factors alone cannot predict how much bone a person has and how strong bone is--experts estimate that without bone density tests, up to 40 percent of women with low bone mass could be missed. 
   Unfortunately, coverage of bone density tests under the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program (FEHBP) is inconsistent. Instead of a comprehensive national coverage policy, FEHBP leaves it to each of the nearly 500 participating plans to decide who is eligible to receive a bone mass measurement and what constitutes medical necessity. Many plans have no specific rules to guide reimbursement and cover the tests on a case-by-case basis. Some plans refuse to provide consumers with information indicating when the plan covers the test and when it does not and some plans cover the test only for people who already have osteoporosis. 
   Mr. President, we owe the people who serve our Government more than that. We know that osteoporosis is highly preventable, but only if it is discovered in time. There is simply no substitute for early detection. My legislation standardizes coverage for bone mass measurement under the FEHBP and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair. 
   I gave a lengthy statement last night. I will not go into everything that I referred to, but I think there are several points that need to be reiterated with respect to base closing. 
   I strongly oppose the base closing amendment that has been offered by Senator MCCAIN and Senator LEVIN that would initiate another round in the year 2001. We come back to the same issues that have yet to be addressed by the Department of Defense with respect to creating a comprehensive analysis in terms of matching our infrastructure with our assets and the security threat mix that we can anticipate into the 21st century. 
   This is an analysis, in fact, that has been suggested and recommended by the National Defense Panel in order to have an overall assessment and accounting of exactly what we are going to need with respect to our domestic infrastructure into the 21st century. 
   I think everybody acknowledges that we are facing different types of threats today, more asymmetric, more unpredictable, more uncertain, far more diverse, regional threats than we have  ever encountered before. So as a result, it seems to me we need to have an accounting from the Defense Department as to exactly what are their needs. 
   They keep telling us over and over again from the previous four rounds that we have achieved and realized billions and billions of dollars in savings. Yet we have been unable to track those savings. In fact, in the reports by the General Accounting Office in 1996 and then again in 1997 and in addition to the Congressional Budget Office reports, all indicate the very same thing. It is very difficult to ascertain the amount of savings derived from the previous base closing rounds, 
   because the Department of Defense has never established a mechanism for tracking those savings. 
   I think it is important for us to have that data so we can document what has exactly been saved as a result of those four previous rounds. 
   When you look at this chart, this is in the General Accounting Office report: Why BRAC Savings are Difficult to Track and Estimate Changes Over Time. DOD accounting systems are not designed to track savings. Some costs are not captured initially; i.e. the environmental costs. 
   Well, we now find out that they are going to have to spend at least $3 billion more in environmental mitigation than they anticipated. 
   Some savings cannot be fully captured--long-term recapitalization costs. Again, we have found out in terms of sales, they anticipated they would realize $3 billion in sales, and they have only received about $65 million. So that is a great gap between what they projected for revenues of sales and what they actually realized. 
   DOD components do not have incentives to track savings because budgets may be reduced. Over time events may impact costs and savings that could not have been known when estimates were developed. 
   On and on it goes. We have no way of knowing. 
   Then the Department of Defense has said, well, we have cut back on personnel by 36 percent so, therefore, we should be reducing infrastructure by 36 percent. Since we haven't done that, it should be one on one, essentially, we should be reducing our infrastructure. But again, these determinations should not be made by arbitrary percentages but, rather, a documentation of exactly what we need for the future. 
   We have unpredictable challenges and, therefore, I think we should make those decisions based on the assessment of what should be our military infrastructure for the 21st century. Yet we have not had that kind of accounting. 
   I hope the Senate will not approve another round until we have the opportunity to have this kind of analysis from the Department of Defense they have resisted providing over the years. 
   In fact, in the 1998 Secretary's report on BRAC, it said additional rounds of BRAC in the years 2001 and 2005--that would be contingent on two rounds--would yield $21 billion in the years 2008 to 2015, the period covered by the QDR, and $3 billion every year thereafter. 
   But that is contradicted by the report by the Defense Department in 1999 with respect to BRAC savings. It says with four BRAC rounds between 1995 and 1998, DOD invested approximately $22.5 billion to close and realign 152 installations. So it costs as much to close those bases as what they are projecting for savings from another two rounds in the future.

   Ms. SNOWE. The real challenge and the problem with these base closing rounds has been the fact that they are costing far more than what the Defense Department anticipated. I think it is important for us to have the information and the verification 
   from the Defense Department as to exactly what they have saved and how much it has cost and what they anticipate in the future. In addition, they have not even completed the four previous rounds. They have yet to be totally implemented. So we could be incurring additional costs. 
   Of course, the final dimension to the whole problem is all of the contingency operations. We have had 25 contingency operations that have cost the Defense Department more than $20 billion. That has impacted readiness and modernization. 
   I say to this administration that perhaps if they had more clear objectives with respect to these operations, we could contain the costs, but we should not put pressure on reducing our domestic infrastructure if we are going to have more contingency operations in the future that demand the use of our domestic installations.

   Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Washington for, once again, providing leadership on this most significant issue. As she said, it is regrettable that we have to come back to the floor to seek support for our women in uniform who happen to be assigned overseas for this very basic right. I commend her for introducing this legislation once again to repeal the ban on privately funded abortions at overseas military hospitals. 
   It is unfortunate that this amendment is even necessary. It is unfortunate that we have to be here fighting for it once again. How could this debate be necessary? How can it be that this blatant wrong still needs to be righted? Yet, here we are, once again, having to argue a case that basically boils down to providing women who are serving this country overseas with the full range of constitutional rights, options, and choices that would be afforded them as American citizens on American soil. 
   We are here today because the U.S. law denies the right to choose to 227,000 spouses and dependents stationed with our servicemen overseas, and denies the right to choose for more than 27,000 servicewomen who volunteered to serve our country. Though these women are right now protecting our country's interests, year after year this body denies them access to safe and sanitary medical care simply because they were assigned to duty outside the United States. 
   In very simple terms, this amendment will allow women stationed overseas that right to privately funded abortions at their local American military facility. It will allow women and their spouses the freedom to consider the most difficult, heart-wrenching decision they could make without fearing the potentially substandard care they would be faced with in a country that does not speak their language and that does not train their medical personnel the way in which they are here in the United States. 
   I don't understand why we insist in denying our service men and women and their families their right as Americans. We ask a great deal of our military personnel and their families--low pay, long separations, hazardous duty. When they signed up to serve their country, I don't believe they were told, nor do I believe they were asked, to leave their freedom of choice at the ocean's edge. It is ironic that we are denying the very people who we ask to uphold democracy and freedom the basic and simple right to safe medical care. The Murray-Snowe amendment would overturn that ban and ensure that women and military dependents stationed overseas would have access to safe health care. 
   I want to clarify the fact that overturning this ban doesn't mean we will be using Federal funds to support a procedure such as abortion. This would allow American personnel stationed overseas to use their own funds for the support of an abortion in a military hospital. It is very important to make that distinction. 
   As the Senator from Washington indicated, there is also a clause so that medical personnel cannot be forced to perform a procedure with which they disagree. 
   We had this ban lifted in 1993 restoring a woman's right to pay for abortion services with her own money. Unfortunately, that ban was reinstated back in 1995. I think it is important to understand what choices women are left with under our current 
   policy. 
   Imagine a young servicewoman or the wife of an enlisted man living in a foreign country where language is a barrier. She finds herself pregnant and, for whatever reason, she has made a very difficult decision to terminate her pregnancy and she wants to have that procedure done in a military hospital and is willing to pay for it with her own funds. Under current U.S. law, she won't be able to do that. She won't be able to go to a base hospital near her family and friends. She won't be assured of the same quality care that she could receive here in the United States. She won't be able to even communicate under some circumstances because language might be a barrier. 
   So what are her choices? She must either find the time and the money to fly back to the United States to receive the health care she seeks, or possibly endanger her own health by seeking one in a foreign hospital, or she may have to fly to a third country, again where the medical services may not equate to those available at the military base--if she can't afford to return home. 
   What is the freedom to choose? It is a freedom to make a decision without unnecessary government interference. Denying a woman the best available resources for her health care simply is not right. Current law does not provide a woman and her family the ability to make a choice. It gives the woman and her family no freedom of choice. It makes the choice for her. 
   Our men and women in uniform--and the families standing behind them--are our country's best and most valuable assets. When people sign up for military service, they promise us they will do their best to protect our country and its ideals. We promise them we will provide for them and their families the necessities of life--to provide them with the most advanced and the safest health care available. That is the arrangement. This is the benefit that we make available to them in return for their commitment to serve our country. Our men and women and their spouses should not be required to give up their constitutional protections, and the Supreme Court supported right to privacy, and our promise of safe health care. 
   Yet, we prohibit women from using their own money--not taxpayers dollars--to obtain the care they need at the local base hospital. 
   What we are saying to our women in uniform, or to the dependents of others who serve in our military, is: Sorry. You are on your own. 
   So she faces a circumstance that she would not confront were she stationed at Fort Lewis, WA, or Brunswick Naval Air Station in Brunswick, ME, because she could go off base and be guaranteed safe and legal medical care. 
   The Murray-Snowe amendment is only asking for fair and equal treatment. It is saying to our men and women and their families, if you find yourself in a difficult situation, we will provide the service of safe medical care if you pay for it with your own money. Is that too much to ask? 
   We owe it to our men and women in uniform. We owe it to them so that they have the options to receive the care they need in a safe environment. They do not deserve anything less. 
   I urge my colleagues to join in voting for the Murray-Snowe amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment that has been offered by Senator MCCAIN and Senator LEVIN concerning the establishment of another Base Closing Commission process in the year 2001. 
   It is not a matter of when it is established. It is not a matter by whom it is appointed. I think the question is whether or not the Department of Defense and this administration has answered the questions that have been raised time and time again in the committee and on the floor of this Senate with respect to a number of issues that justify having another base closing round. Having been involved in the four previous rounds, I can tell you it raises a number of issues with respect to the efficiency and the effectiveness of base closings. 
   We are seeing already with our commitment in Kosovo the Defense Department cannot continue to decide which installations to downsize or close by making arbitrary comparisons to personnel reductions. Just since the hostilities began in March, we have seen the Pentagon divert a carrier battle group to the Adriatic leaving the western Pacific without a carrier for the first time in decades. 
   It has contributed more than 400 aircraft to the NATO campaign against Yugoslavia. 
   It has nearly depleted the Nation's air-launched precision missile stocks, exhausted our tanker fleet, and called up 33,000 reservists. 
   Now we have a situation where we are conducting a campaign regarding Kosovo and it has been revealed that the air and sea bridges required to ``swing'' forces into one major theater war to support a second conflict makes the risk of prevailing in the latter engagement too high because of the operational strains on personnel, weapons, and maintenance schedules. Yet, the Pentagon persists with the position that we must close more bases. But who is really making these assumptions about the volatile and complex nature of warfare as we approach the 21st century? 
   The standard the administration is putting forth is personnel reductions; that closing 36 percent of our bases is absolutely essential, if 36 percent of all our people have left the military since the peak of the cold war. But the standard must remain if we are to be truly honest about what kinds of assumptions and determinations we must make. We should be making a decision of adapting our infrastructure to the mix of security threats that we anticipate into the 21st century. I do not think that we have to project that far out to recognize what we can expect for the types of conflicts that we will be facing in the future. 
   As it did last year and in 1997, the administration rests its argument for more base closings primarily on the claim that facility cuts have lagged behind personnel reductions by more than 15 percent. I do not happen to think that a simple percentage can answer the types of questions that we need to determine the future of our military bases. 
   What systems, what airfields, and what ports do we need to sustain in light of our engagement in the Balkans and considering the fact that the Pentagon planners thought that the Nation's two simultaneous conflicts would likely occur in Asia and the Persian Gulf? 
   What depots can provide competition for the private sector? 
   What shipyards can provide the Navy with a diversified industrial base to sustain the next generation of submarines 
   that will maneuver in our waters? 
   What airbases must stay active to support long-range power projection capabilities we now have with the diminished forward presence overseas? 
   What configuration of domestic bases does the country require to project a smaller force over long distances that we now lack because we have a diminished presence in Asia and Europe? 
   This fact means at a minimum the country has to stabilize a number of domestic facilities to prepare forces once deployed abroad for long-range projections from this country. How has DOD calculated the vulnerability of political uncertainties of gaining access to our Middle Eastern military assets in the event of another regional crisis? 
   These are the unanswered questions. These are the questions that need answers, not some isolated percentages that should determine the size and the shape of our basing network. These are the answers that we do not have. 
   We have discrepancies in the numbers that have been provided to us by the Department of Defense. We do not have the assessments. We do not have the matching infrastructure to the security threat. We have not made a determination with respect to the assets, and even the national defense plan indicated in its own report that it was necessary to make that determination based on a report. In fact, the panel said it strongly urges Congress and the Department to look at these issues. 
   They talked about if there is going to be a next round, it might be preceded by an independent, comprehensive inventory of all facilities and installations located in the United States. This review would provide the basis for a long-term installation master plan that aligns infrastructure assets with future military requirements and provides a framework for investment and reuse strategies. 
   We raised this issue time and time again in the committee and in the Senate over the last 2 years to those individuals who are propounding this amendment and raising the fact that we should have another base closing round. Yet, how can we make those decisions and on what basis are we making those decisions? Are they going to be arbitrary determinations? Are they going to be politicized? 
   I know people argue: Oh, this is a depoliticized process in the Base Closing  Commission procedure. I argue to the contrary. Having been through this procedure on four different occasions since 1988, I can tell you we just moved politics from one venue to another. 
   I think we have to very carefully consider whether or not we want to initiate another base closing round for the future, absent the kinds of decisions and determinations that need to be made in order to make a reasonable decision. 
   Even in the Department's own report in April of 1998, it exposed the apparent base closure savings as a frustrating mystery rather than a confirmed fact. To its credit, the Department actually admitted in its own study that there was no audit trail for tracking the end use of each dollar saved through the BRAC process. They admitted in their own report that they did not have a procedure for determining the actual savings that they projected from the base closing rounds and how they were used, so that we could not correlate the savings and whether or not they were used for any purpose or, in fact, were there any savings. 
   So now the Department of Defense has said: Yes, there are savings from the four previous base closing rounds; and, yes, we are using them for readiness and modernization; and that is what we will do in the future. But they never established a process that we could document those savings that ostensibly occurred in the four previous rounds, and that they were invested in modernization and in the readiness accounts. The fact is, it never happened. 
   The General Accounting Office, in fact, recommended, in their 1997 report, and, in fact, documented what the DOD report said, that there is no process by which to track the savings which the Department of Defense claims occurred as a result of the base closings over the last 10 years. So we have no way of knowing if, in fact, we have realized real savings. 
   The Department claims that over the last four rounds there were savings of $21 billion, $22 billion. Yet, in their 1999 report, they admitted that the cost of closing bases was $22.5 billion. Their savings, in their 1999 report, from the four previous rounds is $21 billion. So they have $1.5 billion more than the estimated savings through 2015. So that is what we are talking about here. The Department of Defense is spending more to close these bases than they are actually saving. They have had more costs as a result of environmental remediation. In fact, they project to spend $3 billion more. 
   They said they would realize $3 billion from the first base closing round, to give you an example, from the sale of the property to the private sector, when in fact they only realized $65 million. That gives you an idea of the discrepancy that has occurred from their projected savings to the actual revenue that was realized through their sale process. 
   So that is the problem we have. We have been given promises by the Department of Defense that we will have the savings, and yet these savings have not really materialized. So we do not have a picture of what we need for the future in terms of domestic bases because we have closed so many abroad as well as at home. 
   Because we do not have the presence in other countries, it is all the more important that we have the necessary domestic bases to do the kinds of things we have to do, as we have seen in Kosovo. 
   It is interesting that back in 1991, when we went through a base closing round, we had Loring Air Force Base up in northern Maine. It was a B-52 base. We were told at the time B-52s were going to go out. They were old. They were aging. They were going to be rapidly removed from the defense program. 
   What are we seeing? B-52s are being used in Kosovo. No, we do not have the base in northern Maine that is closest to Europe, to the Middle East, to the former Soviet Union, to Africa. We are having to launch those B-52s from other bases that are not as close to Europe. So that is the problem we are seeing, because of the miscalculations and the underestimation of what we might need for the future. It has not been the kind of documentation that I happen to think is necessary. 
   In fact, it was interesting to hear--when talking about B-52s--what a former Air Force Secretary said a few weeks ago, that the current crises are proving the enormous value of the Nation's long-range bomber force of B-52s. That is what it is all about. 
   So what we were told in 1991: No; they are going to be out 
   of commission because they are simply too old, we find is not the case. 
   So I think we have to be very circumspect about how we want to proceed. That is why I think we have to be reticent about initiating any base closing process for the future until we get the kinds of answers that are necessary to justify proceeding with any additional base closing rounds. 
   We have had the miscalculations of the costs in the Balkans. In fact, that is why there is such great pressure within the Pentagon to try to find additional savings, because we have spent so much money in Bosnia. When we were only supposed to spend $2 billion, we are now beyond $10 billion. We will probably spend $10 billion in Kosovo by the end of this fiscal year. That has placed granted, inordinate pressures on the defense budget. 
   But as QDR said, and even the Pentagon has admitted, there are many ways, in which to achieve their savings. They could follow up on the management reforms that have been proposed by the Department of Defense through technology upgrades. They could obviously require the services to determine their budget priorities. We can obviously look even at the deployment in Bosnia, which has far exceeded the original estimates, as I said earlier. 
   So those are the kinds of challenges we face in the future. I think we have to be very, very cautious about suggesting that somehow we should close more bases--subject to another arbitrary process, subject to more arbitrary percentages--without the kind of analysis that I think is necessary to make those kinds of decisions. 
   We have to be very selective. We have to make decisions for the future in terms of what interests are at stake, what we can anticipate for the future, because it seems that we are going to have more contingency operations like the ones we are confronting now in the Balkans. Therefore, we will have to look at what we have currently within the continental United States. It is important to be able to launch these missions, simply because we cannot depend on a presence in foreign countries. 
   So I hope Members of the Senate will vote against the amendment which has been offered by the Senator from Arizona about initiating another base closing round, because we have raised these questions before. We have asked the Department: Please document what bases you are talking about. What bases do you need? What bases don't you need? Why don't you need them? How does that comport with the anticipated security threats for the future? 
   Of course, finally, the Department claims that they have made enormous savings from the previous base closing rounds, but now we find that the cost of closing those bases--of which more than 152 were either realigned or closed--was greater than the savings that have been realized to date and into the future. 
   So I think we have an obligation and, indeed, a responsibility to evaluate what has happened. I think it is also interesting that the Department of Defense has not responded to the General Accounting Office or to the National Defense Plan in terms of coming up with an analysis of what is actually necessary for our domestic military infrastructure, and then, secondly, setting up a mechanism by which we can evaluate whether or not savings have, indeed, been realized as a result of the four previous base closing rounds, because on the basis of what we have currently from the Pentagon, they cannot suggest in any way that they have made any savings. If anything, it has cost them more money. 
   Then when you look at what we are facing in Kosovo, what we can project in the future for additional asymmetric threats, we may want to be very careful about closing down any more bases in this country without knowing whether or not they are going to be necessary for the future, because once you lose that infrastructure, it is very difficult to recoup. 
   So I hope the Senate will reject this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Fiscal Year 2000 National Defense Authorization Act. This critical legislation brings the military to the threshold of a new century posing new challenges to the U.S. national security. Under the superb leadership of our distinguished chairman, the senior Senator from Virginia, the Armed Services Committee has reported a bill that shapes a more flexible, mobile, and precision Total Force required for the future. 
   This bill takes a proven and fundamental approach to enhancing our national defense by devoting more resources to readiness and modernization accounts and improving the quality of life for military families. The total authorized funding of $288 billion in the legislation increases the administration's request by $8 billion and represents a 2.2-percent increase in real terms over the fiscal year 1999 level. 
   These responsible funding levels try to rescue a defense budget that, as a percentage of the Nation's GDP, has reached its lowest points in 50 years. In modernization programs--those for weapons procurement--funding has fallen by 67 percent since 1985. 
   At the height of the Reagan buildup, the Pentagon obligated $138 billion for procurement. Since then, the spending fell to a low point of $44 billion in 1997. The fiscal year 2000 budget increases the account to $56 billion, and I commend Secretary Cohen for planning the first budget of this administration that brings procurement back to a threshold of $60 billion, as recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, starting in the year 2001. 
   The major weapons and systems authorized by this bill, particularly service combatants, strategic and tactical aircraft, and high-speed armored vehicles, will give the armed services more endurance and firepower at lower life cycle costs. Smooth construction materials will deceive the enemy radars that can detect the hard angles of older platforms. Information technologies will give ships, tanks, and aircraft battlespace data that shows potential enemy movements before they occur. A new series of rapid transporters will bring forces to the shorelines of instability. And from safe distances in the air or at sea, smaller crews will program missiles for strategic inland targets. 
   As chair of the Seapower Subcommittee, I had the honor of witnessing firsthand the revolution in capabilities by traveling to the Persian Gulf to visit the sailors of the carrier Enterprise and the guided-missile cruiser U.S.S. Gettysburg and the minesweeper U.S.S. Ardent during the Easter recess. Without exception, the men and women of these ships, forward deployed between Iran and Iraq, demonstrated a solid commitment to defending the interests of their nation in some of the most dangerous waters on the planet. 
   I listened and talked with dozens of sailors and returned to Washington with a fresh understanding of the human dimension of readiness. Only dedicated people can deliver the capabilities needed to project our military power. Far removed from their families and the luxuries of life ashore, the crews of the Enterprise, the Ardent, and the Gettysburg admirably performed their missions of containing the Iraqi military and ensuring the freedom of commerce. 
   The diligence of the crews of these ships makes a visitor forget their youth. From galleys and control rooms to flight decks and bridges, sailors cooperated with professionalism to ensure that our maritime power upheld peace and stability. 
   They reminded me that patriotism hinges on sacrifice, and that Congress can perform no greater service in defense policy than to improve the quality of life for military families. 
   Therefore, I think the legislation before us reinforces the wisdom of additional personnel provisions in both this authorization bill, as well as the legislation that was passed by the Senate that would increase the retirement and the pay for 
   the members of our Armed Forces. The Bill of Rights Act, the pending legislation, as well as the fiscal year 1999 supplemental, will move closer to this goal by authorizing a universal active-duty pay increase of 4.8 percent, the largest since 1982, and giving troops enrolled in the retirement plan the option of drawing pension benefits calculated under the same formula as other personnel who served for at least 20 years. 
   I believe this certainly reinforces the conversations that I have had with a group of senior noncommissioned officers aboard the Enterprise who stressed the need for equity in the Pentagon's compensation and retirement systems. I repeatedly heard that uniformed personnel could not obtain timely care for their families and waited months on end for reimbursement. 
   As a result, I sponsored a provision in this bill permitting TriCare beneficiaries to receive treatments at qualified medical offices if they live more than 50 miles from a DOD health installation. This initiative, coupled with the Bill of Rights Act, directs to the Defense Department to rely on more efficient claims processing procedures to tackle the issue of access to quality treatment that several sailors raised in their encounters with me. 
   I also include a provision in this legislation--of course, it was authored with Senator KENNEDY--that would create a Defense Department task force on domestic violence. This is another issue that has become a serious concern within our Armed Forces. 
   This task force will consist of military representatives, family advocacy program experts, and civilian domestic violence professionals to develop guidelines for a coordinated response to this tragic problem that has grown from 14 reported cases per 1,000 families in 1990 to 22 per 1,000 families by 1998. 
   The second major provision of the Kennedy-Snowe amendment mandates creation of a central departmentwide database to receive information on reported domestic violence cases in the Armed Forces. 
   No military family should endure the trauma, fear, and alienation that flows from acts of domestic violence. I am hopeful that the Kennedy-Snowe amendment will represent a crucial beginning in the process of setting standards and imposing penalties to deter spousal and child abuse in the armed services. 
   I want to highlight a few provisions under this legislation which were within the jurisdiction of my Seapower Subcommittee. I thank Senator KENNEDY, the ranking Democrat of the subcommittee, along with the panel's other members, for their diligent work on this year's legislation. 
   The Seapower Subcommittee held five hearings in our review of the fiscal year 2000 budget request. Our hearings focused on the overarching question of how the Pentagon can sharpen its ability to reinforce U.S. political and economic objectives overseas with an agile maritime fleet. 
   Towards this end, we explored programs designed to maintain the sea lanes vital to international trade. The subcommittee also summoned Navy and Marine Corps witnesses to discuss strategic air and sealift in support of regional commanders in chief, littoral force projection and protection, evolving submarine requirements, and priorities in the realms of research and acquisition. 
   Witnesses before the Seapower Subcommittee testified that the proliferation of weapons and advanced technology caused by 
   the willingness of countries to sell expertise, hardware, and technology present a challenge for the United States to predict potential adversary threats. This trend of proliferation shortens the timeline for an enemy to field an offensive weapon that can disable our forces in any region of concern. 
   For these reasons, research and development in systems designed to counter enemy air, land, and sea-launched missiles, in addition to antiship torpedoes and mines, will enhance the Navy's capacity to deter conflict throughout the littoral areas of the  globe. These coastal zones, within 200 miles of any sea, contain three-quarters of the world's population, 80 percent of the capital cities, and the major corridors of commerce. 
   Subcommittee witnesses expressed concern that traditional threats, as well as nontraditional threats, from hostile countries and international terrorists would attempt to disrupt seagoing trade and military operations. They pointed out that over 50 countries possessed over 150 types of naval mines; over 60 countries have inventories of more than 60 types of torpedoes; over 75 countries have more than 90 types of antiship cruise missiles; and by 2016, 40 to 50 countries will deploy at least one theater ballistic missile. 
   Navy and Marine Corps witnesses testified that their services will function as the force of choice in the 21st century. They based this assessment on compelling demographic facts. Water covers 70 percent of the world's surface, and by the year 2010, over 70 percent of the world's population will live in urban areas within 300 miles of a coastline. 
   An ever-increasing world population--to top 7.5 billion by the year 2015--will only intensify this surge of urbanization and leave new environmental, housing, and health care problems in its wake. 
   Competition among ethnic and religious populations will furthermore make the urbanized littorals ripe for conflict in the 21st century. The Navy and Marine Corps can, therefore, use the sea area as an operating base and a maneuver space without permission from a foreign country. In this context, maritime forces can serve as a first echelon of U.S. military power projection. 
   Force modernization must subsequently remain on schedule since America needs high-technology fleet able to steam at a moment's notice to any point on the planet. Our witnesses, however, cited a number of budgetary and operating tempo developments that compete with core modernization requirements. 
   From 1988 to 1998, the Navy's total obligational authority, in constant 1998 dollars, decreased by 40 percent. 
   Coincident with this decrease, the Navy and Marine Corps have experienced a dramatic increase in forward presence and contingency operations. 
   In the past 50 years, naval expeditionary forces have responded to over 250 crises worldwide. Since 1992 alone, as this ``Commander-in-Chief Requirements'' chart illustrates, naval forces have responded to 77 different contingency operations or threats around the world--that is between 1992 and 1998--while between the years of 1988 and 1991, they only responded to 27 different threats worldwide. So it shows the disparity in the threats between this decade and the previous decade, to show the tremendous pressures that are being placed on our naval and our marine forces. 
   During the cold war, Marines were called upon to respond to a threat on average of once every 15 weeks. Since 1990, the Marines have been responding to a threat once every 5 weeks. That is a threefold increase. So as a result of the naval force structures, as one witness said during the Seapower Subcommittee's first hearing, there is ``no shock absorbency left'' when it comes to our force structures and the demands they are placing on our naval and marine forces. 
   Again, as this chart will illustrate in terms of where we are today on the 300-ship Navy, we are going to have to build, on an annual rate, 8 to 10 ships a year in order to sustain a 300-ship Navy. We are going to decline pretty rapidly. As we are in 1999, we have 315 ships; for the year 2000, 314; by the year 2005, we will be down to 305 ships. In order to sustain 300 ships, we will have to increase the number of ships we are building to 8 to 10 a year from the 6 we are building currently. 
   Based on the testimony, and also my visits to the deployed fleet units, and discussions with the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Army and Air Force officials, the subcommittee reached the following conclusions: 
   First, the Navy and Marine Corps capabilities must remain ahead of the threats designed to disrupt or deny maritime operations on the high seas and in the littorals. To respond to this conclusion, the Seapower portion of this bill adds $213 million to the budget request for research, development, testing, and evaluation. 
   Second, the Navy and Marine Corps future readiness will decline if recapitalization and modernization are deferred. I think again these charts illustrate the problem. So to respond to this challenge, the Seapower portion of this bill adds $1.068 billion to the budget request for procurement. 
   Third, strategic sea and airlift are required to support daily operations overseas, emergent requirements, and sustained military campaigns of a major theater war. The force deployment goals of the 1995 Mobility Requirements Study Bottom-Up Review Update established the strategic lift requirements as those required for one major theater war and, later, to swing that lift to support the second nearly simultaneous MTW. 
   So to respond to this challenge, the bill adds $40 million to the budget request for national defense features in ships. 
   In addition, the full committee approved the budget request for $3 billion for procurement of 15 C-17 aircraft, $70 million for modifications to the C-5 aircraft, $170 million for the C-17 research and development, and $63 million for the C-5 research and development. 
   Fourth, the Navy must build no fewer than 8 ships per year to maintain a force structure of approximately 300 vessels, as I 
   mentioned earlier. Ship designs and technologies must respond to these challenges of both the littorals and the open ocean warfare. 
   Quantity has a quality of its own, especially when naval operations occur at the same time in different geographic regions. The Seapower portion of the bill therefore adds $375 million advanced procurement for the LHD-8 and extends the DDG-51 multiyear procurement authority to include the fiscal years 2002 and 2003 ships. 
   The committee, however, remains concerned with the overall shipbuilding rate included in the administration's budget requests. The topic of ship force structure was discussed more than any other issue in the Seapower hearings. 
   Witnesses stated repeatedly that the current force structure of 324 ships already strains worldwide operations. This problem will only grow, since the projected size of the fleet, as I said, will decrease to 305 platforms in the next 5 years. 
   Unfortunately, the Department of Defense has provided few specifics on the planned size of the Navy force structure beyond the calendar year 2015 and how it intends to address the impending ship shortfall problem beyond lowering acquisition costs and reducing the size of ships' crews. 
   The time has come for the administration to demonstrate an understanding of the ship acquisition problem and to share with Congress a systematic plan to address this serious national security concern. 
   The report accompanying this bill requires the Secretary of Defense to submit, with the fiscal year 2001 budget request, a report that details the Department's long-range shipbuilding plan through fiscal year 2030 and describes the annual funding required to procure 8 to 10 ships a year between fiscal years 2001 and 2020. 
   Finally, attack submarines have reached the limits of sustainable operations. The submarines of the 21st century will generate key strategic and tactical intelligence, deploy surveillance and reconnaissance teams, and enhance the firepower of carrier battle groups. In recognition of these facts, the bill approves the request of $116 million for submarine advanced technology and adds $22 million for the Advanced Deployable System. 
   Finally, the key to reducing the operating costs of ships lies in research and development to design future ships that can operate effectively with smaller crews. Our bill approves well-funded research and development programs for developing new ship designs to reduce overall life-cycle costs. 
   All of these naval programs, as well as the major systems of the other three Services, will require an adequate domestic basing structure for maintenance and deployment. This factor, along with the changing mix of threats to our national security, triggered the two bipartisan Armed Services Committee votes this year against amendments authorizing additional base realignment and closure rounds.  
   The committee first rejected the BRAC amendments because no base closure round yet has yielded the taxpayers any clear or proven savings. To appreciate this point, one only need to consider the conclusion of the leading advocate of BRAC, the Department of Defense. DOD's April 1998 base closure report to Congress stated explicitly that ``no audit trail, single document, or budget account exists for tracking the end use of 
   each dollar saved through BRAC.'' 
   Furthermore, the conflict in Kosovo illustrates how hostilities can strain our ability to project military power in unstable areas of the world. Since this war began in March, the United States has diverted its only aircraft carrier in the Western Pacific, near North Korea, to Serbia's Adriatic Sea basin. We have more than 400 aircraft from airfields across the country now engaged over Kosovo. 
   In the meantime, the Department of Defense has almost depleted the Nation's air-launch precision missile stocks, strained our aerial tanker fleet, and called up 33,000 reservists. Congress and the administration should therefore consider how to improve, rather than phase out, the shore- and land-based systems that sustain our deployed forces. 
   We cannot forget that America's overseas basing infrastructure has declined by more than 40 percent since the end of the cold war. The four previous BRAC rounds have eliminated about 25 percent of domestic military installations. 
   The key challenge of the 21st century force will focus on long-range deployments from American territory to protect interests and allies on short notice. We need a master base plan, still undeveloped, that identifies categories of ports, staging grounds, airfields, depots, and maintenance facilities to meet these strategic requirements. The administration cannot ask Congress to approve more closure commissions in a vacuum about what physical support assets at home the troops of tomorrow will need to complete their missions abroad. 
   This authorization bill advances the goals of shaping the modernized Armed Forces on which Americans will rely to safeguard their interests in a changing and volatile world. 
   I again thank the committee chairman, Senator WARNER, for his leadership, and the ranking member, Senator LEVIN, for his leadership as well in crafting this significant bipartisan legislation. I urge all Senators to support it.

   Ms. SNOWE. I thank the chairman for his comments. I certainly feel privileged to chair the Seapower Subcommittee and to focus on some of the critical challenges facing our naval forces in the future. Having had the opportunity to visit our personnel on the U.S.S. Enterprise, the U.S.S. Gettysburg, and the U.S.S. Ardent, I had a firsthand appreciation of the pressures placed on the men and women in our Armed Forces and the more we need to support them in every way possible. That is why I think the pay and retirement provisions are all necessary, given the demands that are being placed on our naval forces overseas. The deployments are longer and they are more rigorous. It is becoming far more difficult for them when they return to home port because they have to begin retraining. So there is very little time for them to prepare for the future and also the demands that these challenges present in keeping them from their families. We have to recognize that. I think the administration has to recognize that in terms of the number of contingency operations, that, ultimately, is really putting a tremendous strain on all of our armed services.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise regarding the conference report language in the supplemental bill regarding the transfer of emergency Community Development Block Grant funding from HUD to FEMA. 
   January 1998 will long be remembered in the State of Maine because of the extraordinary and historic Ice Storm that crippled the State. The combination of heavy rains and freezing temperatures left much of the State under a thick coat of ice which downed wires, toppled transformers and snapped utility poles in two. At the peak of the storm more than 80 percent of the entire State was literally in the dark. Vice President GORE best summed up the situation during his visit on January 15, 1998, when he said,  ``We've never seen anything like this. This is like a neutron bomb aimed at the power system.'' 
   The response from the federal government to our plight was for the most part remarkable. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Small Business Administration, and the Department of Defense all answered Maine's call for immediate help. In addition, utility workers from up and down the East Coast came to work in freezing temperatures and hazardous situations to kill live wires and free remaining wires from downed trees and poles. These men and women worked side by side with Maine's utility companies around the clock until the lights were back on in every house in the State. 
   I am here today, however, because while the storm brought out the best in people across the State and in many federal agencies, we still have not received the assistance we need from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In fact the lack of help from HUD has surpassed the storm in many people's minds as the truly extraordinary event. 
   To understand fully, one has to know the history. The Stafford Act which provides FEMA's guidelines for assistance covers public power companies. It will reimburse 75 percent of the costs related to a disaster. Because Maine and much of the Northeast have utilities that are investor-owned rather than government-owned, we were ineligible to receive assistance from FEMA for this purpose, despite the fact that, FEMA's own Ice Storm ``Blueprint for Action'' noted that the greatest unmet need from the storm is the cost of utility infrastructure. The ``Blueprint'' also noted that ``(The) HUD Community Development Block Grant Program can supplement other federal assistance in repairing and reconstructing infrastructure, including privately-owned utilities .....'' 
   Utility reimbursement is of great concern to Maine as it was not only the largest unmet need from the Ice Storm, but ratepayers in our State already pay the fourth highest utility costs in the country. Without some federal help, ratepayers would have been called on to cover utility infrastructure repair costs through increased rates. 
   So the Maine Congressional Delegation joined with the delegations from Vermont, New Hampshire and New York to obtain funding in the 1998 Supplemental Appropriations Act to provide money for the CDBG program to help our States complete their recovery from the Ice Storm. Working with Senator BOND, Chairman of the VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator MIKULSKI the Ranking Member; and Appropriations Chairman STEVENS, we secured $260 million in the Senate's 1998 Supplemental. 
   When the Senate considered this legislation, members from the Northeast spoke of the need for, and reasons behind, this additional funding and in a colloquy between Senators BOND and DAMATO, it was noted that $60 million of this funding was meant specifically for the Northeast to help with the recovery costs from the Ice Storm. During the subsequent conference, that amount was dropped to $130 million, as the House version of the bill only contained $20 million for this purpose. 
   The Supplemental was signed into law on May 1, 1998. On November 6, 1998, 11 months after the disaster and six months after the bill had been signed into law, HUD announced that it was allocating approximately half of the $130 million, including $2.2 million for Maine. With an unmet need of more than $70 million, this funding was simply unacceptable and made all the more so because HUD would not or could not explain the rationale behind the numbers. Phone calls were made, meetings were held, letters were sent and still we received no explanation. 
   In the 1999 Omnibus Appropriations bill adopted by Congress at the end of the 105th Congress, $250 million was provided for emergency CDBG money to cover disasters occurring in both FY98 and FY99. Secretary Cuomo told me in a phone conversation on March 2, 1999 that he would use some of this money to allow States dissatisfied with their original allocation to reapply. This discussion occurred a few days before the Senate Appropriations Committee marked up the 1999 Supplemental that included language to transfer the remaining CDBG emergency funding from HUD to FEMA because, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee report,  
   The Committee is concerned over HUD's continuing failure to implement an effective emergency disaster relief program for the ``unmet needs'' of states with Presidentially-declared natural disasters. Instead, the Committee believes that FEMA is the appropriate Federal agency for addressing these unmet disaster needs since FEMA has primary responsibility for assessing and responding to all natural disasters and for administering most primary programs of disaster assistance. 
   In particular, FEMA is urged to review and respond appropriately to the needs of the Northeast for damage resulting from the ice storms of last winter. HUD failed to respond properly to these needs despite congressional concern over the ice damage.  
   On March 5, 1999 I spoke again with Secretary Cuomo when he called to express his 
   concern that he could not publish the notice as OMB said that the Senate Appropriations Committee's actions on March 4 to transfer the money from HUD to FEMA prevented him from doing so. After conversations with OMB, I sent a letter to the Secretary detailing OMB'S response that it was permissible to publish the notice as long as funding was not allocated. 
   On March 10, the Federal Register (p. 11943 to p. 11945) contained a notice from HUD that provided a review for states unhappy with their original funding allocation. Maine began work at once on an application for this funding.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1999. 
   The Coast Guard provides many critical services for our nation. Dedicated Coast Guard personnel save an average of more than 5,000 lives, $2.5 billion in property, and assist more than 100,000 other mariners in distress. Through boater safety programs and maintenance of an extensive network of aids to navigation, the Coast Guard protects thousands of additional people engaged in coastwise trade, commercial fishing activities, or simply enjoying a day of recreation out on our bays, oceans, and waterways. 
   The Coast Guard enforces all federal laws and treaties related to the high seas and U.S. waters. This includes marine resource protection and pollution control. As one of the five armed forces, it provides a critical component of the nation's defense strategy, something weighing heavily on all of our minds lately. 
   Last year, Congress enacted the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1998, which authorized the Coast Guard through Fiscal Year 1999. The bill I am introducing today reauthorizes the Coast Guard for the next two years--Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001. 
   It authorizes both appropriations and personnel levels for these two years. It also contains various provisions that are designed to provide greater flexibility to the Coast Guard on personnel administration; strengthen marine safety provisions; includes sufficient funding to allow for a 4.4 percent pay raise; and other provisions. 
   One provision that deserves particular mention relates to icebreaking services. The President's FY 2000 budget request includes a proposal to decomission 11 WYTL-class harbor tugs. These tugs provide vital icebreaking services throughout the northern states, including my home state of Maine. While I understand that the age of this vessel class may require some action by the agency, I feel it would be premature to decommission these vessels before the Coast Guard has identified a means to rectify any potentially harmful degradation of services. The Coast Guard has identified seven waterways within Maine that would suffer a meaningful degradation of service should these tugs be brought offline now. These waterways provide necessary transport routes for oil tankers, commercial fishing vessels, and cargo ships. The costs would be excessive to the local communities should that means of transport be cut off. As such, the bill I am introducing today includes a measure that would require the Coast Guard to submit a report to Congress before removing these tugs from service that will include an analysis of the use of this class of harbor tugs to perform icebreaking services; the degree to which the decommissioning of each such vessel would result in a degradation of current services; and recommendations to remediate such degradation. 
   As part of its law enforcement mission in 1998, the Coast Guard seized 75 vessels transporting more than 100,000 pounds of illegal narcotics headed for our shores. This bill provides funding to maintain many of the new drug interdiction initiatives of the past few years. The Coast Guard has proven time and again its ability to stem the tide of drugs entering our nation through water routes. 
   Finally, the Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for preventing and responding to major pollution incidents in the coastal zone. It responds to more than 17,000 pollution incidents in the average year. This bill includes a provision that provides the Coast Guard with emergency borrowing authority from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. The measure would enhance the  Coast Guard's ability to effectively respond to major oil spills. 
   Mr. President, this is a good bill that enjoys bipartisan support on the Commerce Committee. I look forward to moving this bill to the Senate floor at the earliest opportunity.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Admiral Bud Nance, chief of staff of the Foreign Relations Committee, who passed away last week after many years of devoted service to the country he loved. 
   As a former member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and someone who had the privilege of knowing and working with Bud, I can honestly say I have not met a finer person. A man deeply devoted to the ideals for which this country stands, he conducted himself with honor and integrity in all that he did. And he had an uncommon humility and kindness that will be remembered by all those fortunate to have met him. 
   With 41 years in the Navy, service under both the Nixon and Reagan Administrations, and a direct role in SALT II talks, Bud had already achieved a lifetime of accomplishments even before he was urged by his longtime friend, Senator HELMS, to assume the role of chief of staff at the Foreign Relations Committee. As with everything else he did, Bud flourished in that position, bringing his invaluable years of experience and knowledge to the Senate. He was a sure and steady hand at the helm of the Committee, and his remarkable spirit has left an indelible mark on all of us. 
   Theodore Roosevelt once said that ``the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena--whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood ..... a leader who knows the great enthusiams, the great devotions and spends himself in a worthy cause .....'' Admiral Bud Nance was just such a man, and today our thoughts are with his wife, Mary, and Bud's entire family as they mourn the passing of their beloved husband, father, and grandfather. We are also thinking of Senator HELMS at this saddest of times, as he grieves for the loss of one of his oldest and dearest friends. 
   Again, I want express my profound sadness on the loss of this great American, who was a patriot in life and whose legacy will never be forgotten by a grateful nation.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Hatch-Craig  amendment to S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act. This amendment provides four important components in the efforts of combating juvenile violence and crime. 
   I also want to thank the Majority Leader, Senator LOTT, Senators HATCH, CRAIG and MCCAIN for listening to my concerns and working with me to ensure the National Instant Check System applies to all sales made at gun shows. 
   This amendment provides for more aggressive prosecution of criminals who use guns to commit crime, enhances penalties on criminals who use guns, increases protection of children from gun violence. Most importantly, this amendment mandates that individuals purchasing weapons at gun shows must undergo a background check through the National Instant Check System. This is the same requirement currently in place for purchases made at gun shows, when buying a weapon from a licenced gun dealer. 
   Mr. President, gun shows are community events, usually held over a weekend at State Fairgrounds, convention centers, or exhibit halls. These shows have been going on for years and attract a wide cross section of gun owners. At the shows, people not only buy, sell, or trade firearms, they also exchange tips on hunting, gunsmithing, and firearm history. 
   By implementing an instant check system at gun shows, law abiding gun buyers can receive their background check within minutes and be able to obtain the firearm they wish to add to their collection. On the other hand, criminals and other people who are not allowed to possess firearms can be identified and arrested for trying to purchase a weapon, in violation of the law. 
   Mr. President, this amendment, of which I am a co-sponsor, provides a good balance between allowing law-abiding citizens to purchase weapons at gun shows without burdensome regulations and preventing criminals from obtaining weapons from individuals at gun shows.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from Hawaii, Senator AKAKA, in introducing the Investment in Women's Health Act. 
   Today we celebrate the 116th birthday of Dr. George Papanicolaou, the physician who developed the Pap smear. In the 50 years since Dr. Papanicolaou first began using this test, the cervical cancer mortality rate has declined by an astonishing 70 percent. There is no question that this test is the most effective cancer screening tool yet developed. The Pap smear can detect abnormalities before they develop into cancer. Having an annual Pap smear is one of the most important things a woman can do to help prevent cervical cancer. 
   Congress has recognized the incomparable contribution of the Pap smear in preventing cervical cancer and nine years ago directed Medicare to begin covering preventive Pap smears. Medicare beneficiaries are eligible for one test every three years, although a more frequent interval is allowed for women at high risk of developing cervical cancer. And through the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress expanded the Pap smear benefit to also include a screening pelvic exam once every 3 years. 
   But the Medicare reimbursement rate is artificially low and does not accurately reflect the true cost of providing this vital test. The current Medicare rate of reimbursement is $7.15, though the mean national cost of the test is twice that amount: $14.60 per test. The bill we introduce today, The Investment in Women's Health Act, will raise the Medicare reimbursement rate for Pap smears to at least $14.60 per test. 
   Women understand the usefulness and life-saving benefit of the Pap smear. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last year that 95 percent of women age 18 years old and over have received a Pap smear at some point in their lives. And 85 percent of women age 18 years and older across the country have received a Pap smear within the last 3 years. 
   Unfortunately, the artificially low reimbursement rate threatens both our country's local clinical laboratories and the health of women across the country. Pathologists are increasingly concerned that low Medicare reimbursement for Pap smears will force them to stop providing the service and to ship the slides to large out-of-state laboratories. Shipping the slides to non-local, large-scale laboratories--``Pap mills''--reduces quality control, brings up continuity of care issues, and puts women at risk of higher rates of ``false positives'' or ``false negatives.'' 
   Providing Pap smears locally facilitates the likelihood of follow-up by a pathologist, comparison of a patient's Pap smear to cervical biopsy, and facilitates better communication and consultation between the patient's pathologist and attending physician or clinician. When Pap smears are shipped out of the local community these vital comparisons are much more difficult to complete and are more prone to inconsistencies and error. 
   Inadequate reimbursement for Pap smears provided through Medicare threatens not only a woman's health but the financial stability of the laboratory as well. If a lab is forced to continue to subsidize Medicare Pap smears they will eventually either stop providing the Medicare service or go out of business--and neither option is acceptable. Finally, local laboratories have a proven track record of providing better service for the patients. A Pap smear is less likely to get lost in a local lab than among the tens of thousands of other tests in a ``Pap mill'' and cytotechnicians have better supervision by a pathologist in smaller laboratories than in large volume operations. 
   The Pap test has contributed immeasurably to the fight against cervical cancer. We cannot risk erasing our advancements in this fight because of low Medicare reimbursement. I urge my colleagues to join us.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Newborn and Infant Hearing Screening and Intervention Act of 1999. This bill is a companion bill to H.R. 1193, introduced in the House by Representative JIM WALSH. I am pleased to be joined again this year by my colleague from Iowa, Senator HARKIN, who has long been a champion of the hearing impaired, and my colleague from Tennessee, Senator FRIST. 
   We usually associate hearing problems with the aging process, and it is true that the largest group of Americans suffering from hearing impairment are those in the 65 to 75 year age range. But at the same time, approximately 1.5 to 3 out of every 1000 children--or as many as 33 children per day--are born with significant hearing problems. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, as many as 12,000 infants are born each year in the United States with some form of hearing impairment. 
   In recent years, scientists have stressed that the first years of a child's life are crucial to their future development. This makes early detection and intervention of hearing loss a necessity if we are to ensure that all our children get the strong start they deserve. Specialists in speech and language development believe that the crucial period of speech and communication in a child's life can begin as early as six months of age. Unfortunately, though the average age of diagnosis of hearing loss is close to three years of age. 
   The ability to hear is a major element of one's ability to read and communicate. To the extent that we can help infants and young children overcome disabilities detected early in life, we will improve their ability to function in society, receive an education, obtain meaningful employment, and enjoy a better quality of life. Without early diagnosis and intervention, these children are behind the learning curve--literally--before they have even started. They should not be denied a strong start in life simply for the lack of a simple screening test. 
   There are many causes of hearing loss, and in many states a newborn child is screened only if the physician is aware of some factor that puts that baby in a risk category. The good news is that over 550 hospitals in 46 states operate universal newborn hearing screening programs. Nine states--Hawaii, Rhode Island, Mississippi, Connecticut, Colorado, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Massachusetts--have passed legislation requiring universal newborn hearing screening. Hawaii, Mississippi, Rhode Island, Utah, and Wyoming have statewide early hearing detection and intervention programs. And scientists across the country are developing and implementing model rural-based infant hearing, screening, follow-up, and intervention programs for children at risk for hearing and language disabilities. 
   The bad news is that, unfortunately, only about 20 percent of the babies in this country are born in hospitals with universal newborn hearing screening programs, and more than 85 percent of all hospitals do not do a hearing screening before sending the baby home. 
   Universal screening is not a new idea. As early as 1965, the Advisory Committee on Education of the Deaf, in a report of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, recommended the development and nationwide implementation of ``universally applied procedures for early identification.'' In 1989, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop used the year 2000 as a goal for identifying 90 percent of children with significant hearing loss before they are one year old. 
   In 1997, an expert panel at the National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders recommended that the first hearing screening be carried out before an infant is three months old in order to ensure that treatment can begin before six months of age. The Panel also recommended that the most comprehensive and effective way of ensuring screening before an infant is six months old is to have newborns screened before they sent home from the hospital. But a 1998 report by the Commission on Education of the Deaf estimated that the average age at which a child with congenital hearing loss was identified in the United States was a 2 1/2 to 3 years old, with many children not being identified until five or six years old. 
   It is time to move beyond the recommendations and achieve the goal of universal screening. In addition to the nine states that require screening, the Bureau of Maternal and Child Health, in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control, is helping 17 states commit to achieving universal hearing screening by the year 2000. This plan will lead to the screening of more than one million newborns a year, but it still leaves more than half the states without universal screening programs. 
   The purpose of the bill I am introducing today is to provide the additional assistance necessary to help all the states in implementing programs to ensure that all our newborns are tested and to ensure that those identified with a hearing impairment get help. Specifically, the bill:

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Smith-Snowe Combined Sewer Overflow Control and Partnership Act of 1999. If enacted, this bill will eliminate or appropriately control combined sewer overflow (CSO) discharges in this country by the year 2010. This legislation will also help ratepayers in at least 53 communities throughout the state of Maine and over 1,000 other communities around the country. Presently, over 43 million people in the U.S. are incurring the high costs of trying to overcome the problem of combined sewer overflows because of the lack of federal statute and funding to meet federal sewage treatment mandates for these CSO communities. 
   Mr. President, CSOs are by far the single largest public works project in the history of almost every CSO community. When the Maine Municipal Association members met with me last month, they informed me of communities where people are facing paying more in sewer rates than they will owe in property taxes. This, to me, is unacceptable. 
   Most, but not all, of the combined sewer systems are located primarily in the Northeast and Great Lakes areas where sewer lines and stormwater collection systems were first constructed in the 1800s and early 1900s. Typically, sewer lines designated to carry raw sewage from urban residential areas and business were laid first. These were followed by stormwater drainage systems designed to collect rainwater during storms to reduce or eliminate urban flooding. In many cases, sewer lines and stormwater conduits were connected into a combined sewer, which served as a single collection system to transport both sewage and stormwater. Eleven states in the two geographic areas of New England and the Great Lakes account for 85 percent of the water-quality problems attributed to CSOs nationwide. 
   Sewer overflow problems arise mainly during wet weather, causing an overload of the systems, and the untreated or partially treated waste water discharges through combined sewer overflow outfalls into receiving waters such as rivers, lakes, estuaries and bays. The CSOs are the last remaining discharges from a point, or known, source  of untreated or partially treated sewage into the nation's waters. 
   The federal government has been long on regulation and short on financial assistance. The CSO problem was first addressed when Congress revisited the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, better known as the Clean Water Act, almost three decades ago. The subsequent Clean Water Act Amendments of 1972 established the fundamental principles and objectives of a national wastewater management policy. To implement these goals, a national program was created to regulate the discharge of pollutant into surface waters, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES. This system required outfalls for industrial process waste and sewage from municipal treatment plants. Individual states were allowed to assume responsibility for the administration of NPDES once their permitting processes were approved by the EPA. 
   Maine and 37 other states operate EPA-approved NPDES permitting programs. The law requires that state water-quality standards be consistent with federal policy, but, if necessary to achieve the act's objectives, states are allowed to impose water-quality standards more stringent than those required by federal regulations. 
   Section 10(a)(4) of the CWA Amendments of 1972 explicitly linked the achievement of national water-quality goals to federal financial assistance for municipalities affected by the new mandate by creating the Construction Grants Program (CGP) that provided subsidies for the construction of publicly owned treatment works. In Section 516(b), the EPA was charged with administering the program, and was required to develop biennial estimates of the cost of construction of all needed publicly owned treatment works in each of the States. 
   In the past, federal funds have paid for as much as 75 percent of the construction costs for water treatment and sewage facilities. In recent years, federal contributions have been limited to low interest loans rather than grants, through a revolving loan fund (SRF), and local ratepayers and taxpayers bear the burden of rehabilitating, upgrading and for operating costs. It is clear that more federal funding assistance is needed so that CSO communities can be given policy and financial tools with which to handle their ongoing CSO problem of sewer overflows into our rivers and bays. 
   The Smith-Snowe CSO bill amends the Clean Water Act and addresses the problems faced by such CSO cities and towns, 45 in my state alone. The purpose of the bill is to move forward with technology-based controls that are the most cost effective and to make sure communities do not put in controls that are not actually needed. The bill seeks to codify the Environmental Protection Agency's rational approach to CSO control, its ``CSO Policy of April, 1994''. Codification is necessary since the implementation of EPA's CSO policy has been inadequate to date. 
   The bill also provides congressional approval of the inclusion of realistic water quality standards compliance schedules for CSO control in permits and other enforceable documents issued as called for in the 1994 EPA Control Policy. 
   Initiation of the water quality standards/designated use review and revision process called for in EPA's Control Policy must also occur before requiring long-term CSO control plan implementation. The guidelines that the EPA is currently developing to assist communities for implementing measures for the control of CSOs are only just that, guidelines, and could potentially be changed after a community has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars following them. CSO communities need certainty, not changing guidelines after costly measures have already been taken. 
   The bill also authorizes federal grant funding assistance for CSO communities to implement long term CSO controls. 
   The problem of CSOs has been a long standing issue Mr. President, for which I cosponsored similar legislation in the House in the 102nd Congress. The CSO problem is not going to go away, but only become a bigger financial burden for our CSO communities. 
   I want to thank my colleagues who have agreed to cosponsor the Smith-Snowe CSO bill and urge those not yet cosponsoring to join us in support of this much needed legislation.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation being introduced by my colleague from Maine, Senator COLLINS, the Homeless Assistance Funding Fairness Act. 
   This bill will set a minimum allocation for state homeless funding by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in an effort to prevent future repeats of a situation that Maine faced this year when HUD denied applications for homeless funding from the Maine State Housing Authority and the city of Portland, Maine's largest city. 
   Maine was one of just four states denied funding this year under HUD homeless programs--and that is a situation that no state should have to endure. HUD took steps to partially rectify this situation since the original announcement, but this legislation will assure minimum funding for every state and assure a fairer allocation of funding in the future. The legislation requires HUD to provide a minimum of 0.5 percent of funding to each state under Title IV of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. 
   Mr. President, it may interest my colleagues to learn a little more about the problem that inspired this legislation. In January, HUD issued grant announcements for its Continuum of Care program--which provides rental assistance for those who are or were recently homeless--but denied applications by the Maine State Housing Authority and by the city of Portland, leaving the state one of only four not to receive funds. 
   The Maine congressional delegation immediately protested the decision to HUD Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo, and I wrote and spoke repeatedly with Secretary Cuomo about the decision--to encourage HUD to work with Maine homeless providers to find an acceptable solution. I also contacted the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and asked committee members to examine the issue as well. 
   HUD officials restored about $1 million in funding to the city of Portland, but refused to restore State homeless funding. In 1998, Maine homeless assistance providers received about $3.5 million from the Continuum of Care Program, and this year the State had requested $1.2 million for renewals and $1.27 million to meet additional needs. MSHA, which coordinates the program, estimates that many individuals with mental illness or substance abuse problems who have been receiving rent subsidies will lose those subsidies over the course of the next six months as a result of HUD's failure to fund Maine programs. This in spite of the ``proven track record'' of Maine homeless programs, including praise by Secretary Cuomo during his visit to Maine in August 1998. 
   Without this homeless assistance, basic subsidized housing and shelter programs suffer, and it is more difficult for the State to provide job training, health care, child care, and other vital services to the victims of homelessness, many of whom are children, battered women, and others in serious need. 
   In 1988, 14,653 people were temporarily housed in Maine's emergency homeless shelters. Alarmingly, young people account for 30 percent of the population staying in Maine's shelters, which is approximately 135 homeless young people every night. Twenty-one percent of these young people are between 5 1/2 with the average age being 13. Meanwhile, Maine earmarks more funding per capita for the elderly, disabled, mentally ill, and poor for services and support programs then the majority of other states, even though it ranks 36th nationwide in per capita income. 
   In closing, I would simply reiterate that Maine was not the only state that was frozen out of the process this year. Without congressional intervention, what state will be next? This makes it all the more important that changes be made to our homeless policy to ensure that no state falls through the cracks. As such, I urge my colleagues to join Senator COLLINS and myself in a strong show of support for this legislation. 
   By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Ms. SNOWE, Mr. WARNER, Mr. VOINOVICH, Ms. COLLINS, Mr. ABRAHAM, Mr. ROBB, Mr. HAGEL, and Mr. LUGAR):

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Senate Joint Resolution not only in support of the reauthorization and modifications for the very successful Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, but also to grant the consent of Congress for the formation of the Southern Dairy Compact. This issue is really a state rights issue more than anything else, Mr. President. Quite simply, it addresses the needs of states in two different areas of the country, one in the North and one in the South, who wish to work together within their regions for two different and totally independent dairy compacts--in the Northeast to continue and modify their current Compact, and in the Southeast where 10 states wish to work closely together--to form a compact for determining fair prices for locally produced supplies of fresh milk. 
   As recently as last September, the Congress sanctioned another interstate compact, one that allows states to set regional prices for a commodity. In passing the Texas Compact for the storage of low-level radioactive waste, the states of Texas, Maine and Vermont were given permission to jointly manage and dispose of their low level waste--and are free to set any price they wish for the disposal of the waste. Congress has now approved ten such compacts involving 45 states. 
   All we are doing here is continuing another states rights activity--dairy compacting, an idea whose time has now come throughout different regions of the country. Currently, New Jersey and Maryland have passed Dairy Compact legislation seeking to join the Northeast Compact. In addition. Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio have expressed interest in joining. A state may join the Compact if they are contiguous to a participating state and Congress approves its entry, and we are asking for Congressional approval to extend this right also to New York, New Jersey, and Maryland. 
   The Northeast Dairy Compact currently encompasses all New England states and builds on the existing Federal milk marketing order program for Class I, or fluid, milk, and only applies to fluid milk sold on grocery store shelves. As you may know, a federal milk marketing order is a regulation that already sets a minimum milk price in different areas around the  country, of which the Northeast region is one, and is voluntarily initiated and approved by a majority of producers in each milk marketing order area, which places requirements on the first buyers or handlers of milk from dairy farmers. 
   Currently, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact allows the New England milk marketing order region to add a small increment to the Federal order price for that region, which is the floor price, so only the consumers and the processors in the New England region pay to support the minimum price to provide for a fairer return to the area's family dairy farms and to protect a way of life important to the people of the Northeast. 
   Mr. President, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has provided the very safety net that we had hoped for when the Compact passed as part of the Freedom to Farm Act, the omnibus farm bill, of 1996. The Dairy Compact has helped farmers maintain a stable price for fluid milk during times of volatile swings in farm milk prices. In the spring and summer months of 1997 and 1998, for instance, when milk prices throughout most U.S. markets dropped at least 20 cents a gallon while consumer prices remained constant, the payments to Northeast Interstate Compact dairy farmers remained above the federal milk marketing prices for Class I fluid milk because of the Dairy Compact--and, I might add, at no expense to the federal government. The costs to operate the Dairy Compact are borne entirely by the farmers and processors of the Compact region. 
   Also, in considering what has happened to the number of dairy farms staying in business since the formation of the Dairy Compact, it is now known that throughout New England, there has been a decline in the loss of dairy farmers since the Compact started. This is a clear demonstration that, with the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, the dairy producers were provided a safety net--and when there has been a rise in the federal milk marketing prices for Class I fluid milk, the Compact has automatically shut itself off from the pricing process. 
   Mr. President, over ninety seven percent of the fluid milk market in New England is self contained within the area, and fluid milk markets are local due to the demand for freshness and because of high transportation costs, so any complaints raised in other areas about unfair competition are a bit disingenuous. In addition, the Compact requires the compact commission to take such action as necessary to ensure that a minimum price set by the commission for the region does not create an incentive for producers to generate additional supplies of milk. No other region should feel threatened by our Northeast Dairy Compact for fluid milk produced and sold mainly at home. 
   It should be noted that, in the farm bill conference in 1996, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture was required to review the dairy compact legislation before implementation to determine if there was ``compelling public interest'' for the Compact within the Compact region. On August 9, 1996, and only after a public comment period, Secretary Glickman authorized the implementation of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, finding that it was indeed in the compelling public interest to do so. 
   In addition, the Agriculture Appropriations Act for FY1998 directed the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to study the economic effects of the Compact and especially its effects on the federal food and nutrition programs, such as the Womens, Infants and Children program. Key findings of the OMB study released in February of 1998, showed that, for the first six months of the Compact, New England retail milk prices were five cents per gallon lower than retail milk prices nationally. Also, the Compact did not add any costs to federal nutrition programs like the WIC program and the school breakfast and lunch programs. The GAO study also stated that the Compact economically benefitted the dairy producers, increasing their income from milk sales by about six percent, with no adverse affects to dairy farmers outside the Compact region. 
   Mr. President, the consumers in the Northeast Compact area, and now other areas around the country, are showing their willingness to pay more for their milk if the additional money is going directly to the dairy farmer. Environmental organizations have also supported dairy compacting as compacts help to preserve dwindling agricultural land and open spaces that help combat urban sprawl. 
   I ask for the support of my colleagues for the reauthorization of the Northeast Compact and the ratification of the Southern Compact.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President I rise today to submit a resolution to raise national awareness of Alpha 1-antitrypsin definiency. I am so pleased to be joined by 15 of my colleagues. Our resolution officially declares May 1999 as ``National Alpha 1 Awareness Month.'' 
   Alpha-1 is a genetic condition that can cause severe early onset emphysema, liver disease in both children and adults, or more rarely, a skin condition called panniculitis. In infants, Alpha-1 causes neonatal cirrhosis of the liver, which is sometimes fatal. In adults, Alpha-1 can lead to pulmonary emphysema and or cirrhosis of the liver. This disease normally strikes young adults in their 30s and 40s. 
   Alpha-1 was first identified in 1963 and is the most common lethal single gene defect in the United States. It is as common as cystic fibrosis but it is neither well known, nor well understood by many physicians, and is virtually unknown to the American public. 
   An estimated 5,000 people have been diagnosed with Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency in the United States and statistical estimates indicate that there should be 80,000 to 100,000 people total in this country. In fact, one in 37 people are Alpha-1 carriers of this genetic defect. A simple blood test can detect Alpha-1 antitrypsin levels and let people know if they are carriers or have this genetic defect. In fact, in 1998, the Maine chapter of the Alpha-1 National Association Support Group screened 105 people for the genetic defect and found 15 carriers. 
   Alpha-one antitrypsin deficiency can be a devastating disease. Symptoms of Alpha-1 are similar to those of other respiratory diseases, and often Alpha-1 emphysema is accompanied by asthma, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The most common indicators of Alpha-1 include worsening shortness of breath, a chronic cough and abnormal liver test results. 
   The good news is that many Alphas can stay healthy into old age, especially if they never smoke, avoid pollution, lung irritants, and do not suffer from frequent lung infections. The bad news is that there are many Alphas who are misdiagnosed for years, and this misdiagnosis can cause additional irreversible lung damage. 
   By declaring May, 1999 as ``National Alpha 1 Awareness Month'' we hope bring the problem of Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency to the attention to the Senate. I urge my colleagues who have not yet joined us on this important issue to add their name to the public call for increased national awareness of this genetic condition.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, tomorrow's vote on the Social Security lock-box legislation will be a defining moment for the Senate. Members will be making an unequivocal statement about how they feel about the Social Security program: Do we truly believe Social Security's monies should be protected and preserved from spending raids? Or are we willing to allow Social Security monies to be treated as a ``piggy bank'' that can be tapped and diverted to other federal programs? 
   I think the answer to these questions should be obvious--and I believe the 99 Senators who voted on March 24 for an amendment calling for adoption of the lockbox provision during the consideration of the Senate's FY 2000 budget resolution have an obligation to uphold the commitment they made to protect Social Security's monies and vote for the lock-box proposal. 
   Every Republican and every Democrat present voted for the substance of this proposal just a few short weeks ago and--accordingly--I hope they will vote to conclude debate tomorrow. The Administration's opposition to this legislation should come as no surprise, especially considering that President Clinton's FY 2000 budget proposal relied heavily on Social Security's surpluses to fund numerous other programs. Specifically, the President's  budget would have raided $158 billion from the Social Security surplus over the coming five years to pay for other programs, while the Republican budget preserves every penny of the Social Security surplus. 
   In light of the President's diversion of Social Security monies to other programs, the members of the Budget Committee--by a nearly unanimous vote of 21 to 1--voted for an amendment I offered during the markup that called on Congress to reject any budget that would spend any portion of Social Security surpluses for any program other than Social Security. Not coincidentally, when the President's budget was later brought to a vote in the Senate, it was resoundingly rejected by a vote of 97 to 2. 
   The bottom line is that the time has come for Congress and the President to stop relying on Social Security's surpluses to fund other government programs. The Social Security lock-box legislation we are now considering provides a hard and fast means of protecting these monies, while providing needed ``safety valves'' for recessions, emergencies, declarations of war, or legislation that strengthens the Social Security program. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to uphold their commitment to this proposal by voting to conclude debate and bring the Social Security lock-box proposal to a Senate vote. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a joint resolution honoring the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) of the United States. 
   This resolution designates September 29, 1999, as Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States Day, and urges the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this important day. September 29, 1999 marks the centennial of the VFW. As veterans of the Spanish American War and the Philippine Insurrection of 1899 and the China Relief Expedition of 1900 returned home, they drew together in order to preserve the ties of comradeship forged in service to their country, forming what we know today as the VFW. 
   Mr. President, when many of us think about war veterans, we think about the tremendous sacrifices these defenders of freedom made to safeguard the democracy we cherish, especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice. My resolution recognizes those contributions and sacrifices. It also recognizes the contributions that VFW members continue to make day-in and day-out in our communities--the youth activities and scholarships programs, the Special Olympics, homeless assistance initiatives, efforts to reach out to fellow veterans in need, national leadership on issues of importance to veterans and all Americans, and others too numerous to mention. Over the last 100 years, members of the VFW have contributed greatly to our nation both in and out of uniform in many ways. 
   I have nothing but the utmost respect for those who have served their country. This is an opportunity to honor the men and women and their families who have served this country with courage, honor and distinction. They answered the call to duty when their country needed them, and this is a small token of our appreciation. 
   The centennial of the founding of the VFW presents all Americans with an opportunity to honor and pay tribute to the more than two million active members of the VFW and to all veterans, as well as to the ideals for which many made the ultimate sacrifice. I urge my colleagues to join me in a strong show of support and an expression of appreciation for the VFW and all veterans. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills that call for the deauthorization and realignment of harbor boundaries in Searsport, Maine and for Carvers Harbor on Vinalhaven Island, Maine. Passage of these bills will allow the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to issue permits to the Maine Department of Transportation for projects that are vital to the economic well being of the town of Searsport and the island of Vinalhaven. 
   The first bill addresses the deauthorization and realignment of the navigation channel in Searsport Harbor so that the existing cargo pier can be replaced. The bill will allow a multimillion dollar improvement to be made to the Mack Point cargo port at the earliest possible date. In addition, a second cargo pier will be rehabilitated. The work will include new dolphin structures, which will encroach upon the existing Federal channel. The navigation project was authorized by the River and Harbor Act of October 23, 1962. 
   The second bill deauthorize and realigns Carvers Harbor in Vinalhaven so as to allow the construction of a new ferry terminal to replace the existing pier facility that is located within the established Army Corps of Engineers anchorage. The deauthorization will allow the ferry terminal project to remain on schedule and occur at the earliest possible date. The year round population of the island is comprised primarily of lobster fishermen and the businesses that support that industry. This navigation project was authorized by the River and Harbor Act of June 3, 1896. 
   Along with my support, both projects have the blessing of the respective towns and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. I am also working with Senator CHAFEE in the hopes of having these two harbor deauthorizations included in the Managers amendment for the Water Resources Development Act, which has already passed out of the Environment and Public Works Committee and is expected to be taken up by the full Senate shortly. 
   I urge the support of my colleagues for these two deauthorizations and I thank the Chair.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the FY2000 budget conference report we are now considering and to urge for its adoption. 
   I would first like to thank the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, PETE DOMENICI, for his unwavering commitment to a balanced budget and fiscally responsible decision-making  over the years. Thanks, in part, to his leadership and efforts, the turbulent waves of annual deficits and mounting debt have been temporarily calmed. And, by maintaining these principles in the House-Senate budget conference report, we may be able to maintain the current budgetary calm for many years in the future. 
   The conference report not only maintains fiscal discipline, but it also ensures that critical priorities are protected and addressed in fiscal year 2000 and beyond. 
   Specifically, the conference report contains the following key provisions: 
   First, it sets-aside every penny of the Social Security surplus, unlike the President's budget proposal. 
   Second, by retaining an amendment I offered to the Senate budget resolution, it provides monies from the on-budget surplus for a new Medicare prescription drug benefit--something that President Clinton failed to include in his own budget proposal after touting the need for this benefit in his State of the Union address. 
   Third, it adheres to the spending levels established just two years ago in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, while increasing funding for critically needed priorities including education and defense. 
   Fourth, it provides tax relief for Americans at a time when the typical family's tax burden exceeds the cost of food, clothing, and shelter combined. And by retaining language from an amendment I offered to the Senate budget resolution, it highlights marriage penalty relief as being one of the forms of tax relief that could be accommodated in any forthcoming tax cut package. When considering that 42 percent of all married couples incurred a marriage tax penalty averaging $1,400 in 1996, I think of no tax cut that would be more appropriate in any upcoming tax package. 
   Collectively, I believe these principles and priorities reflect those of most Americans--especially the protection of Social Security's monies. Accordingly, I believe this conference report deserves broad bipartisan support by the entire Congress. 
   Mr. President, to appreciate the provisions in this conference report, I believe it is appropriate to compare it to the only other major budget proposal on the table: the budget proposal put forth by President Clinton on February 1. In particular, I believe the manner in which these proposals treat the Social Security surplus should be carefully compared. 
   As mentioned, the first priority that is protected in the Republican conference report is Social Security and the annual surpluses it is currently accruing. 
   As my colleagues are aware, the Social Security surplus was responsible for the unified budget surplus of $70 billion we accrued in FY98. In fact, without the Social Security surplus, the federal government actually ran an on-budget deficit of $29 billion last year. 
   By the same token, Social Security's surpluses will account for the bulk of our unified budget surpluses in coming years as well. Specifically, over the coming 5 years, Social Security surpluses will total $769 billion and account for 82 percent of CBO's projected unified surpluses--and over 10 years, they will total $1.7 trillion and account for 69 percent of unified surpluses. 
   To protect Social Security's surpluses, the budget resolution sets the stage for ``lock-box'' legislation that will accomplish what many of us have desired for years: a bonafide means of taking Social Security off-budget. Put simply, this resolution ensures that Social Security surpluses are set aside and not raided to pay for other federal programs. 
   In contrast, President Clinton's budget offers no protection for the Social Security surplus and, in fact, proposes that it be spent on other federal programs in upcoming years. 
   Specifically, over the coming 5 years, the President proposes we take a $158 billion ``bite'' out of Social Security surpluses and spend these monies on other federal programs. That means that, under the President's budget, fully 21 percent of Social Security's upcoming surpluses would be spent on other programs over the next 5 years. 
   Although the President has proposed that we spend a portion of the Social Security surplus on other programs, I was pleased that an overwhelming majority of my Democratic colleagues on the Senate Budget Committee voted for an amendment I offered during markup of the Senate resolution that rejected the President's proposed use of Social Security's surpluses. 
   Specifically, my amendment outlined the fact that the President's budget would spend $40 billion of the Social Security surplus in FY2000; $41 billion in FY01; $24 billion in FY02; $34 billion in FY03; and $20 billion in FY04. Furthermore, the amendment called on Congress to reject any budget proposal that spent Social Security surplus monies on other federal programs. Appropriately, after my amendment was adopted by a vote of 21 to 1, the President's budget proposal--which spends Social Security's surplus monies--was unanimously rejected by the Budget Committee when offered as an amendment later in the markup, and by a vote of 97 to 2 by the full Senate later on the floor. 
   Mr. President, the manner in which Social Security surpluses are treated is but one of the ways in which these two proposals could be compared, but the bottom line is that the House-Senate conference report is simply superior to the Clinton plan. By maintaining fiscal discipline, protecting Social Security surpluses, providing funds for a Medicare prescription drug benefit, and enhancing funding for shared priorities such as education, I believe this conference report deserves strong support by the full Senate. 
   Ultimately, while members from either side of the aisle may disagree with specific provisions in the resolution that has been crafted, the simple fact is that this is a budget framework--or ``blueprint''--that establishes parameters and priorities, but is not the final word on these individual decisions. Rather, specific spending and tax decisions will initially be made in the Appropriations and Finance Committees, and ultimately by members on the floor. 
   Therefore, I urge that my colleagues support this carefully crafted and fiscally responsible FY2000 conference budget report --and work to ensure that the parameters it establishes are used to protect and advance the priorities we share. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I support the CHAFEE amendment that assumes funding of $200 million specifically for the stateside program of the Land and Water Conservation Fund to come out of Function 370. It is my understanding that no specific program in Function 370 has been designated as an offset for the Chafee amendment, nor do I believe that programs such as the Advanced Technology Program be considered as an offset. The ultimate funding decision of course rests with the appropriators, but I wanted to take this opportunity to cast my support for funds for the LWCF stateside program, which has not received any funding since 1995. 
   Up until 1995, LWCF stateside program funds were used in my state to assist communities for planning, acquiring and developing outdoor recreation facilities that would not otherwise have been affordable, especially in the smaller communities in Maine. 
   The LWCF stateside program has funded such local projects in Maine as the community playground in Durham, the Mt. Apatite trails in Auburn, the Dionne Park Playground in Madawaska, the East-West Aroostook Valley trail in Caribou, the Williams Wading Pool in Augusta, multi-purpose fields in St. George, Hampden, Buxton, Calais, and Bradford, the skating rink in Bucksport, and wharf rehabilitation in Greenville. 
   By leveraging state dollars with critical LWCF stateside funds, Maine's communities have been able to enjoy recreational facilities such as neighborhood parks, swimming pools, and ball fields, and also have had the opportunity to conserve certain highly valued lands that the citizens of the state wish to save for outdoor recreational activities for themselves and for generations to come.

   Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I wanted to make a few comments on an amendment that the Senator from Oregon and I have introduced already. It has already been brought up. 
   I wanted to offer a few words of explanation, because we think this is a very important amendment that would expand the reserve fund in the budget resolution for Medicare and the prescription drug benefit program. Specifically, our amendment would allow for new tobacco taxes to be used as an offset for the new Medicare prescription drug benefit that this reserve fund would create. 
   As I stated on the floor yesterday, I believe that one of the most critical items included in this year's Senate budget resolution is the reserve fund for Medicare and prescription drugs. This reserve fund received support from virtually all the members of the committee, both Democrats and most Republicans, which would address the prescription drug benefit program by allowing the use of onbudget surpluses. 
   We know that the Bipartisan Commission did not report out a majority report, but we do know that the Senate Finance Committee will be considering the Commission's recommendations nevertheless. So in this proposal, in the bipartisan resolution, it does include, in the reserve fund in the budget resolution, language that in the event that the Senate Finance Committee reports out a reform package of the Medicare program that extends the solvency of the program, then we would also include a prescription drug benefit program. 
   To the credit of the chairman of the Budget Committee, he proposed, when we were trying to work out exactly how this would be funded, whether or not to use tobacco taxes or other sources of revenue, we decided that the onbudget surplus was one means of supporting a prescription drug benefit program. But we also know that could also be tenuous depending on the surpluses that develop over the next 5 to 10 years. We want to provide certainty to the funding of this prescription drug benefit program. 
   So the Senator from Oregon and I have proposed an amendment that would provide an additional means of funding for this prescription drug benefit program so that we provide the continuity and the stability for funding by raising tobacco taxes in order to fund the program. 
   In fact, the President includes a 55-cent tax increase in his own budget for a tobacco tax increase. He talks about a prescription drug benefit program but does not provide a plan nor does he provide any sources for funding. We think this is an important step forward. 
   I appreciate being able to work with the Senator from Oregon in a bipartisan fashion to address this most critical issue, critical problem that is facing our Nation's senior citizens. Twelve percent of our Nation's elderly account for more than a third of the drug expenditures that occur in this country. Clearly, it is a real problem for seniors. It certainly is the black hole in the Medicare program because of the absence of support for a drug benefit program. 
   We want to provide the means by which it can happen and can happen this year. So the reserve fund in the budget resolution, contrary to what has been said, does provide the means for a prescription drug benefit program. If that reserve fund and that line item was not in the budget resolution, we would have a 60-vote hurdle to bring it to the floor. 
   So it guarantees the prospects of having a prescription drug benefit program with use of onbudget surpluses. We are just adding another option to the funding of that program because we think it is so important. 
   HCFA will say 65 percent of the Nation's elderly who are on Medicare have support of prescription drug benefits through other insurance policies. Well, not exactly. When you start to look at the Medigap policies, the cost of the deductibles and the caps, it is a very expensive proposition, and very few seniors have the option of using it in a way that can help them given the enormous costs that prescription drugs represent to their families. 
   So we realize this is a necessity. That is why we wanted to develop this bipartisan approach on funding, and ultimately the Senator from Oregon and I are going to develop bipartisan legislation to move this process forward. 
   I want to yield to the Senator from Oregon, because I know there is very little time left, to be able to address this issue as well. I think it is important. It makes sense to use tobacco taxes. The Columbia University did a study on this issue. 
   And there is no question that tobacco-related illnesses has cost the Medicare program to a tremendous extent, in fact, more than $34 billion. And 80 percent of the $32 billion in total substance abuse costs in 1994 were as a result of tobacco-related illnesses, as this chart will illustrate right here. So $25 billion alone in 1994. 
   So Mr. President, there is no question that it makes sense to link a tobacco tax increase to financing a prescription drug program when you consider the costs and the impact of tobacco-related illnesses on the Medicare program. And that is only going to get worse in the future. 
   Now I would like to yield to the Senator from Oregon for any comments he would like to make on our amendment.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to commend my colleague, Senator WYDEN, for his leadership on this issue, not only here in the Senate, but as he referred to, during our days in the House of Representatives. I know he has worked considerably on the issues of senior citizens in this country, and in his service on the Aging Committee as well in the House of Representatives. 
   I want to also commend the chairman of the Budget Committee because at a time when I was discussing the idea of creating a reserve fund for the prescription drug benefit program, Senator DOMENICI came up with the idea of including onbudget surpluses of which there is probably more than $132 billion estimated over the next 5 years, and that that could be a potential source for funding for the prescription drug management program. 
   So this amendment is to build on that leadership, to ensure that there will be continuity and funding in the event that those surpluses do not materialize. Also, this is a carrot-and-stick approach because the reserve fund in the budget resolution includes a prescription drug benefit program contingent on a reform package being passed out by the Senate Finance Committee that extends the solvency of the Medicare program. 
   We think that is important, but we don't want to overlook the significance of providing this benefit to senior citizens because it has constituted a crisis in this country for our Nation's elderly, without a doubt. As Senator WYDEN has indicated, it has consumed most of their income when it comes to 
   the cost of prescription drugs. We think it is an appropriate linkage between a tobacco tax increase and the impact on the Medicare program. Again, if you look at this chart, $25 billion is the cost to the Medicare program in 1995 as a result of tobacco-related illnesses. Well, if you take that even further, it represents 14 percent of Medicare costs in that year alone. That is all going to grow exponentially. It will get worse. It could be more than a $400 billion problem over the next 10 to 15 years. 
   So that is why it is important, I think, to look at the source of revenue through a tobacco tax increase, in the event the surpluses don't materialize, but that we have a permanency in terms of coverage. That is what we are attempting to do in this amendment. That is why we think it is so important because to do otherwise is failing to acknowledge the reality of the impact of not having this kind of benefit program currently in the Medicare system. 
   Finally, I should say, Mr. President, that in the reserve fund in the budget resolution we prohibit any transfer of IOUs to the Medicare program. We do not artificially address the Medicare program. We are doing it in a real way, and that is also the case with the prescription drug benefit program. 
   I might also just mention, in talking about Medicare, as one quote that came out of the President's book--the OMB fiscal year 2000 budget--what it said with respect to the President's Medicare proposal is:  
   Trust fund balances are available to finance future benefit payments and other trust fund expenditures--but only in a bookkeeping sense....... They do not consist of real economic assets that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits. Instead, they are claims on the Treasury that, when redeemed, will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the public, or reducing benefits or other expenditures. The existence of large trust fund balances, therefore, does not, by itself, have any impact on the Government's ability to pay benefits.   
   What that means, in a nutshell, is that the President's proposal, contrary to what is suggested on the floor, isn't putting a penny of real money into these programs, and the same is true for the prescription drug benefit program. They talk about the State of the Union Address, but did not propose a plan, did not provide one penny for a prescription drug benefit program. The budget resolution, on a bipartisan basis--21-1--supported the reserve fund I offered with the onbudget surpluses to pay for it. That is a step in the right direction that is going to ensure that the Nation's senior citizens have that benefit. In addition, on this amendment offered by the Senator from Oregon and myself, I should also mention that Senator SMITH from Oregon is a cosponsor.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in contrast to the President's budget, we do have a means by which to create a provision for a prescription drug benefit program in the budget resolution. We created a reserve fund in the Budget Committee that was supported by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, 21 to 1. 
   Mr. President, the reserve fund that is included in the budget resolution for the purposes of financing a prescription drug benefit program was supported overwhelmingly by the members of the committee on a bipartisan basis, a 21-to-1 vote. 
   The amendment I am offering, along with Senator WYDEN, as well as cosponsor Senator SMITH of Oregon, is to expand and create a funding mechanism that will ensure and guarantee the funding of a prescription drug benefit program. We think it is important to ensure that we have this benefit program for our Nation's senior citizens. It is contingent upon a reform package being reported out of the Senate Finance Committee to extend the solvency of the Medicare program. The funding mechanism would be an increase in the tobacco taxes. 
   I think it is an appropriate linkage between Medicare and tobacco taxes. A recent study shows, in fact, that $25 billion was the cost to the Medicare program as a result of tobacco-related illnesses. 
   Mr. President, the amendment I am offering along with my good friends and colleagues from Oregon, Senators WYDEN and GORDON SMITH, would expand the reserve fund that is found in section 209 of the budget resolution. Specifically, our amendment would allow new tobacco taxes to be used as an offset for the new Medicare prescription drug benefit that this reserve fund would create. 
   Mr. President, as I stated on the floor yesterday, I believe that one of the most critical items included in this year's Senate budget resolution is the reserve fund for Medicare and prescription drugs. 
   Put simply, this reserve fund--that was adopted with the support of all 10 Democratic members on the Budget Committee--will provide the Congress with a critically needed opportunity to address an issue that has been highlighted repeatedly of late: the long-term solvency of Medicare and a means to fund a new Medicare prescription drug benefit. 
   In light of the recent disappointing conclusion of deliberations by the Bipartisan Commission on Medicare--where the final vote for a recommendation failed by a singe vote--I can think  of no provision more critical to moving these issues forward in the aftermath of that Commission's work than the reserve fund contained in the Senate budget resolution. 
   Specifically, the reserve fund already contained in the budget resolution will allow for the creation of a new Medicare prescription drug benefit. This reserve fund will be available for any Medicare legislation reported from the Senate Finance Committee that significantly extends the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund in a meaningful and legitimate manner beyond its current insolvency date of 2008. 
   However, to ensure our ability to tap the reserve fund is not unduly restricted or that legislation is not stalled in the Finance Committee due to a particular solvency date not being achieved, the reserve fund intentionally provides no specific target date for extending the program's solvency. Rather, it simply requires that the added solvency be ``significant'' with no gimmicks to simply increase the ``paper balance'' of the trust fund. Specifically, the President's proposal to artificially increase the number of IOUs held by the Medicare Trust Fund would be precluded. 
   Also of critical importance, the reserve fund explicitly provides for the funding of a new Medicare prescription drug benefit that could be funded with a portion of on-budget surpluses that have been set-aside in the Chairman's budget. The on-budget surplus currently set-aside in the budget totals $132 billion over the coming 10 years, so up to this amount of monies could be utilized for the prescription drug benefit. 
   Given the fact that prescription drug coverage proved to be one of the most divisive issues during the Bipartisan Commission's deliberations, this reserve fund will ensure that this critically needed addition to the Medicare program is not blocked from consideration when legislation to strengthen Medicare is considered on the floor. Furthermore, it serves as a much needed ``carrot-and-stick'' for getting Congress and the President to develop a comprehensive plan to strengthen Medicare soon--not put it off until the day of reckoning in 2008 is nearly upon us. 
   Mr. President, there are many issues where members of the Senate may disagree, but there is one stark fact--the fact that the Medicare Part A Trust Fund will be broke within 10 years--which everyone in this room must accept. Therefore, since solutions will likely become draconian the longer we wait to take meaningful steps to strengthen the program, we must not wait any longer to take action to credibly extend the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund and improve the Medicare program overall. 
   As my colleagues are aware, we didn't get a proposal out of the Bipartisan Medicare Commission despite the best efforts of several members of this body. But that ``hung jury'' decision does not mean we can simply ignore the fact that the Medicare program--which is the program more then 38 million elderly Americans rely on for their health care--is going broke. 
   Fortunately, the Senate Finance Committee is already taking action, beginning with a series of hearings that began last week on the Commission's majority-supported proposal, and speculation that a markup of Medicare-related legislation could occur in the not-too-distant future. In addition, the President--who was accused of preventing the Commission from getting the final, crucial vote necessary to report a recommendation--has now said that he will send us his own proposal soon. 
   Mr. President, the reserve fund already included in the Senate budget resolution will facilitate this process by allowing the Congress to take up the President's forthcoming proposal or any other proposal reported by the Senate Finance Committee that credibly addresses Medicare's needs. That, alone, is a critical step forward since we can no longer leave our seniors worrying that our failure to take action will leave them without access to health care. Because when the Trust Fund runs dry there is no health care--none--for many of our nation's senior citizens. 
   Even as the reserve fund will help spur action on legislation to credibly extend the solvency of the Medicare program, it will also allow us to take a critical step in improving and updating the Medicare system: the addition of a meaningful Medicare prescription drug benefit. I believe this addition is, unquestionably, the most significant we could make to Medicare as we seek to strengthen the system. 
   Mr. President, the need for this new benefit could not be more clear. When Medicare was created in 1965 it followed the private health insurance model of the time--inpatient health care. Today, thirty-four years later, it is sadly out of date and it is time to bring Medicare ``back to the future'' by providing our seniors with prescription drug coverage. 
   The lack of a prescription drug coverage benefit is the biggest hole--a black hole really--in the Medicare system. HCFA will tell you that up to 65 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have drug coverage from other sources. But that number simply doesn't tell the whole story. 
   Specifically, fourteen percent of Medicare beneficiaries get drug coverage from one of the three Medigap policies that cover drugs. Two of these policies require a $250 deductible and then only cover 50 percent of the cost of the drug with a $1,250 cap. Needless to say, you can run up against that cap pretty fast with today's drug prices. 
   The third policy provides a cap of $3,000 but the premium ranges anywhere from $1,699 to $3,171 depending on where you live. That is a lot of money for someone living on a fixed income. 
   An estimated 8 percent get drug coverage from participating in Medicare HMOs and another 16 percent receive coverage from Medicaid. Of course to do that, they must be very low-income to begin with and may have to spend a great deal out of pocket for their drugs--what we commonly refer to as spending down--before they are eligible in a given year for coverage. Finally there are those lucky enough--29 percent--to have employer sponsored drug coverage through their retiree program. 
   Mr. President, drug coverage should be part and parcel of the Medicare system, not a patchwork system where some get coverage and some don't. Prescription drug coverage shouldn't be a ``fringe benefit'' available only to those wealthy enough or poor enough to obtain coverage--it should be part and parcel of the Medicare system that will see today's seniors, and tomorrow's into the 21st Century. 
   In light of this glaring need for prescription drug coverage, I will be working with senior citizens groups and health care experts over the coming weeks to develop bipartisan legislation with Senator WYDEN and others that will provide Medicare recipients with a comprehensive Medicare prescription drug coverage benefit that could be included in any forthcoming package to strengthen Medicare. 
   The focus of my proposal will be to provide senior citizens with actual coverage for prescription drugs. Put simply, even if we attempt to control the prices of drugs that are needed by senior citizens, that does not guarantee many of these individuals will be able to afford those prices. That's why a new benefit is so critical. 
   Although the details of my prescription drug coverage proposal will be developed over the coming weeks, there are several broad principles that I anticipate will be included in the Snowe-Wyden package: 
   First, this package will not be part of Medicare Part A, and therefore will have no direct impact on the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund. Like my colleagues, I am gravely concerned about the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund and believe that issue must be addressed in a comprehensive, bipartisan manner. Therefore, I believe it would be irresponsible to propose a new benefit in the Trust Fund that would further jeopardize its solvency in future years, and will propose that my new benefit package be outside the Trust Fund accordingly. 
   Second, while the details of our legislation will ultimately be crafted during bipartisan negotiations with interested groups and health care experts, the drug benefit package will be comprehensive and ensure that all seniors have prescription drug coverage. 
   Third, while the cost of this proposal will ultimately be determined by the benefit package that is crafted, our proposal will be fully-offset. While my colleagues are aware that the cost of  this coverage varies widely depending on the size and scope of the benefit, I believe it would be irresponsible to create any new benefit without paying for it. Accordingly, the primary offset for our package will be an increase in the tobacco tax. 
   As my colleagues are aware, President Clinton's FY 2000 budget proposal included a 55-cent per pack increase in the cost of cigarettes and an acceleration of the 15-cent per pack increase contained in the 1997 Balanced Budget Agreement. The Joint Tax Committee estimates that the combined revenues of these two proposals would be $36 billion over 5 years, and $70 billion over 10 years. 
   Interestingly, instead of applying these new revenues to Medicare or a new prescription drug benefit, the President proposes that these tobacco tax revenues be used to offset increases in discretionary spending. Because tax increases are not allowed to offset discretionary spending under the Budget Act, these improper offsets contribute to the President's budget being in violation of the spending limits agreed to just two years ago by $30 billion in FY 2000. 
   At the same time, the President's budget also fails to provide a single penny for a prescription drug benefit--or even a mechanism to provide monies for such a benefit--after touting the need for prescription drug coverage in the State of the Union address. 
   In light of this deficiency in the President's budget, the bipartisan proposal I will be crafting with Senator WYDEN will not only create a fully-funded prescription drug benefit, but it will also utilize the proposed tax increase for tobacco contained in the President's budget. Ultimately, it is my hope that the President will recognize that these monies would be best spent on Medicare, and will support our effort accordingly. 
   Mr. President, the rationale for linking tobacco taxes and Medicare is clear. As outlined in a study by Columbia University, smoking-related illnesses cost the Medicare program $25.5 billion in 1994 alone--a full 14 percent of Medicare's costs in that year. 
   In fact, as the chart behind me indicates, of the various forms of substance abuse that affect the Medicare program, tobacco-related illnesses accounted for 80% of the $32 billion in total substance abuse costs in 1994. Therefore, dedicating tobacco revenues to Medicare will allow the program to recapture some of the monies it is losing to tobacco. 
   In particular, the proposal I will be developing with Senator WYDEN will demonstrate how new tobacco monies could be shifted to Medicare and then targeted to the new prescription drug benefit for seniors. 
   To accommodate the proposal we will be crafting--and the tobacco offset it will contain in particular--the amendment I am offering today will ensure that tobacco tax revenues are among the funding options provided for in the new reserve fund for prescription drugs. 
   While I am pleased that remaining on-budget surpluses are already an allowable offset in the reserve fund, I believe it is only appropriate that tobacco taxes also be an allowed offset. Not only because this offset be used in the prescription drug package I will be developing with Senator WYDEN, but because of the direct link between tobacco and the Medicare program. 
   As mentioned, a study by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University found that the cost of tobacco-related illnesses on the Medicare program totaled $25.5 billion in 1994, or 14% of the total expenditures of the Medicare program. 
   Assuming this percent holds as true today as it did five years ago--and there is no reason to assume otherwise--the impact of tobacco on Medicare is astounding. With CBO projecting Medicare expenditures of $220 billion in the current fiscal year, tobacco-related health care expenses would total upward of $30.8 billion in 1999 alone using the 14 percent assumption. Over the coming years, these numbers will only escalate: 
   $32.5 billion in 2000. 
   $34.7 billion in 2001. 
   $36 billion in 2002. 
   And $39.5 billion in 2003. 
   In fact, if tobacco-related illnesses continue to cost the Medicare program 14 percent of its total expenditures, these expenses will total $62.6 billion in the year 2009. All told, tobacco-related illnesses would cost the Medicare program $486 billion from 1999 to 2009! 
   Mr. President, in light of the impact of tobacco on the Medicare program, I can think of no reason why new tobacco revenues should not be returned to the Medicare program and used to fund a new prescription drug benefit. Along with our efforts to keep the program solvent well beyond 2008, this new benefit is arguably the most pressing need of our nation's senior citizens in the Medicare program. By linking the two issues in the reserve fund I have created, we can and should do both. 
   Mr. President, while I know that many of my colleagues may not support a tobacco tax increase, I urge that they seriously consider the impact of tobacco-related illnesses on Medicare. My amendment is not an effort to simply pass a tobacco tax for the sake of doing it. Rather, it's about recouping a limited portion of the monies tobacco costs the Medicare program every year, and devoting these monies to a program within Medicare that benefits senior citizens. 
   The bottom line is that the reserve fund already included in the budget will help facilitate the consideration of Medicare legislation by laying the groundwork for a new Medicare prescription drug benefit that may not otherwise be available. While it would already allow remaining on-budget surpluses to be used for this new benefit, the amendment I am offering today will ensure that another funding source is also available. 
   Ultimately, the true benefit of adopting my amendment is that it will ensure a new Medicare prescription drug benefit that utilizes tobacco revenues can be offered with only a simple majority vote being required for its adoption. Without this provision, a point of order would lie against such a proposal, and 60 votes would be required to waive the point of order. While not an impossible hurdle, it nevertheless raises the bar on an offset that I believe is wholly appropriate for the issue at hand. 
   Again, I do not expect that all of my colleagues will support the prescription drug benefit bill that Senator WYDEN and I will be crafting. But I would hope that my colleagues would see the legitimate link between Medicare and tobacco, and will at least vote today to allow this offset to be considered without a supermajority vote in the future. 
   The reserve fund already contained in the budget resolution is a critical step in the right direction that may ultimately ensure legislation to genuinely strengthen Medicare will move in the Congress. And the amendment we are offering will simply bring one more legitimate, related offset into the mix of available options as that package is crafted in the Congress. 
   Mr. President, I believe the cost of Medicare prescription drugs constitutes a crisis for our senior citizens. While the President expressed support for such a benefit in the State of the Union, he failed to deliver anything for it in his budget proposal, just as he seemingly failed to assist the Commission in doing their job: sending this Congress a bipartisan Medicare reform proposal. 
   Despite the President's lack of courage on these issues--or willingness to put substance behind his State of the Union rhetoric--I believe it is critical that we make it possible to strengthen and improve Medicare in the Congress. The reserve fund already contained in the budget may be our best hope to repair and improve the Medicare program. It will allow it to be one of our finest accomplishments in the 106th Congress--not a political punching bag that delivers nothing of value to our deliberations or to our nation's elderly. And the amendment we are offering today will only make the reserve fund better. 
   Therefore, I urge that my colleagues support our amendment, and work to improve the Medicare ``enabling'' reserve fund already contained in the budget.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today marks a dramatic turning point for the Senate. Because, although Senators THURMOND, HOLLINGS, BYRD, and a handful of others were members of this body the last time the Federal Government ran a unified budget surplus in 1969, no member of the Senate has even been involved in the crafting of a budget resolution under these all too unique fiscal circumstances. 
   Furthermore, the consideration of this budget resolution is not only a significant moment for the Senate, but for more than a generation of Americans who never lived in a time without federal budget deficits. 
   Mr. President, in light of the unified surpluses we are now enjoying--and the on-budget surpluses we are projected to soon enjoy--I would like to thank the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, PETE DOMENICI, for his unwavering commitment to a balanced budget and fiscally responsible decision-making over the years. Thanks, in part, to his leadership and efforts, the turbulent waves of annual deficits and mounting debts have been temporarily calmed. And, if we are willing to adhere to these principles in this year's budget resolution and others yet to come, we may be able to maintain the current budgetary calm for many years in the future. 
   Mr. President, the budget resolution reported by the Senate Budget Committee--and that we are now considering on the floor--not only maintains fiscal discipline, but it also ensures that critical priorities are protected and addressed in fiscal year 2000 and beyond. 
   Specifically, the Senate budget resolution contains the following key provisions: 
   First, it protects every penny of the Social Security surplus in upcoming years by devoting it solely to reducing publicly-held debt. 
   Second, through an amendment I offered in the Budget Committee markup, it provides monies from the on-budget surplus for a new Medicare prescription drug benefit--something that President Clinton failed to include in his own budget proposal after touting the need for this benefit in his State of the Union address. 
   Third, it adheres to the spending levels established just two years ago in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, while increasing funding for critically needed priroties including education and defense. 
   Fourth, it provides tax relief for Americans at a time when the typical family's tax burden exceeds the cost of food, clothing, and shelter combined. And as a result of another amendment I offered during markup, it places marriage penalty relief as a top priority in any tax cut package that is ultimately crafted. When considering that 42 percent of all married couples incurred a marriage tax penalty averaging $1,400 in 1996, I think of no tax cut that would be more appropriate in any upcoming tax package. 
   Collectively, I believe these principles and priorities reflect those of most Americans--especially the protection of Social Security's monies. Accordingly, I believe this resolution deserves broad bipartisan support in the Senate and, ultimately, by the entire Congress. 
   Mr. President, to truly appreciate what is contained in this budget resolution, I believe it is appropriate to compare it with the only other major proposal on the table: the budget proposal put forth by President Clinton on February 1. 
   As mentioned, the first priority that is protected in the Senate budget resolution is Social Security and the annual surpluses it is currently accruing. 
   As my colleagues are aware, the Social Security surplus was responsible for the unified budget surplus of $70 billion we accrued in FY98. In fact, without the Social Security surplus, the federal government actually ran an on-budget deficit of $29 billion last year. 
   By the same token, Social Security's surpluses will account for the bulk of our unified budget surpluses in coming years as well. Specifically, over the coming 5 years, Social Security surpluses will total $769 billion and account for 82 percent of CBO's projected unified surpluses--and over 10 years, they will total $1.7 trillion and account for 69 percent of unified surpluses. 
   To protect Social Security's surpluses, the Senate budget resolution sets the stage for ``lock-box'' legislation that will accomplish what many of us have desired for years: a bonafide means of taking Social Security off-budget. Put simply, this resolution ensures that Social Security surpluses will no longer be raided and used to fund other government programs in any upcoming year. Instead, every dollar of Social Security's current and projected surpluses will be set aside and used to bury-down publicly held debt. 
   In contrast, President Clinton's budget offers no protection for the Social Security surplus and, in fact, would spend it on other federal programs in upcoming years. 
   Specifically, as the chart behind me indicates over the coming five years, the President proposes we take a $158 billion ``bite'' out of Social Security surpluses and spend these monies on other federal programs. That means that, under the President's budget, fully 21 percent of Social Security's upcoming surpluses would be spent on other programs over the next five years. 
   Although the President has proposed that we spend a portion of the Social Security surplus on other programs, I was pleased that an overwhelming majority of my Democratic colleagues on the Senate Budget Committee voted for an amendment I offered during markup that rejected the President's proposed use of Social Security's surpluses. 
   Specifically, my amendment outlined that fact that the President's budget would spend $40 billion of the Social Security surplus in FY2000; $41 billion in FY01; $24 billion in FY02; $34 billion in FY03; and $20 billion in FY04. Furthermore, the amendment called on Congress to reject any budget proposal that spent Social Security surplus monies on other federal programs. Appropriately, after my amendment was adopted by a vote of 21 to 1, the President's budget proposal--which spends Social Security's surplus monies--was unanimously rejected by the Committee when offered as an amendment later in the markup. 
   Mr. President, not only does the President's budget propose that we spend Social Security's money at the same time as he expresses a desire to save the program, but he also fails to achieve the goals he laid out in the State of the Union address regarding the utilization of the unified surplus. 
   First, it's worth nothing that--based on that goals he laid out in the State of the Union address--the President apparently double-counts the surplus and proposes that we spend 151 percent of the surplus over the coming 15 years! That's 51 percent than you or I could spend, Mr. President, and 51 percent more than would ever exist. 
   The next chart--taken from the February 1 article in Newsweek--shows how this ``double counting'' would occur. As you can see, the President proposed that we spend $500 billion for the new Universal Savings Accounts, $500 billion for other federal spending, $700 billion for Medicare, and $2.8 trillion for Social Security. In total, these  five items would run $4.5 trillion--the total projected surplus over the 15 year period. 
   However, what the President forgot to mention is that $2.3 trillion of this amount is already Social Security's money because it is the total of the annual Social Security surpluses that will accrue over the coming 15 years. As a result, the true total of the Clinton proposals would be $6.8 trillion--which is $2.3 trillion more than the surpluses we would accrue over the same period of time! 
   Setting aside the questionable math of the President's proposals, it's also worth noting that there is a significant difference between how the President portrays his proposals, and what they actually accomplish. 
   Specifically, as my next chart indicates, there is a gap between the ``rhetoric'' and the ``reality'' of the President's plan. In fact, in light of this gap, I believe the President's budget should have earned an Oscar for ``Best Actor'' during Sunday's Academy Award presentation! 
   As we can see on this chart, the President claimed that his budget would give 62 percent of the unified surplus to Social Security, 15 percent to Medicare, 12 percent to new Universal Savings Accounts (USAs), and 11 percent to new spending. 
   However, in reviewing CBO's analysis of the President's budget--and by removing the rhetoric from the various proposals and identifying them for what they truly are--it's clear that the ``reality'' of the President's budget is far different from how it has been presented. 
   Specifically, instead of devoting a combined 77 percent of the unified surplus to Medicare and Social Security--65 percent to Social Security and 12 percent to Medicare respectively--the truth of the matter is that the President is simply proposing that we artificially increase the number of IOUs held by the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds. 
   Furthermore, we find that the President's goal to set-aside 77 percent of the unified surplus will not even be met. Specifically, over the coming five years, only 65 percent of the unified surplus would be set aside--and that is only achieved if we assume that the President's proposal to have Social Security monies invested in the stock market is ultimately used for the same purpose. 
   Also, the new Universal Savings Accounts (USAs) proposed by the President are just another name for a tax cut--and would utilize 11 percent of the surplus accordingly. As I mentioned earlier, I believe reducing the marriage penalty should be the top priority of any tax cut package, and already had an amendment included in the budget resolution accordingly. 
   Finally, over the coming five years, the President would actually spend 24 percent of the surplus on other federal programs--far above the 11 percent target that he laid out to the American people. 
   Mr. President, as mentioned, for all the talk about devoting 62 percent of the surplus to Social Security and 15 percent to Medicare, the President really is proposing that we simply increase the number of IOUs held by the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds to make them more solvent on paper. 
   Not only does this accounting scheme give the false impression that saving these critically needed programs can occur without lifting a ``fiscal finger,'' but it could also lead to a false sense of complacency that will lead to true reforms being put off until it's too late. If that happens, the changes that will need to be made to these programs will need to be draconian--and all because we chose to give the public the false belief that nothing needed to be done to legitimately strengthen these programs today. 
   Of note, the President's own budget highlights the futility of simply increasing trust fund balances without true reforms, and discredits his accounting scheme accordingly. On page 337 of the President's ``Analytical Perspectives'' book for the FY 2000 budget, we read  
   (Trust Fund) balances are available to finance future benefit payments and other trust fund expenditures--but only in a bookkeeping sense ..... They do not consist of real economic assets that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits. Instead, they are claims on the Treasury that, when redeemed, will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the public, or reducing benefits or other expenditures. The existence of large trust fund balances, therefore, does not, by itself, have any impact on the Government's ability to pay benefits.  
   So, what does this mean? In a nutshell, the President isn't putting a penny of real money into these programs--he's simply increasing the number of IOUs held by the Trust Funds and hoping that someone figures out how to pay them back with real money in the future. There's absolutely no commitment of a single dollar from the surplus to these programs today. 
   As I said during the Budget Committee markup this past week, the President should win a Pulitzer prize for fiction by claiming that this plan somehow ``saves'' Medicare! 
   In contrast, the Senate budget resolution contains a mechanism and money to truly strengthen and improve Medicare. Specifically, an amendment I offered during the Committee markup--that was subsequently adopted by a bipartisan vote of 21 to 1--would allow a portion of remaining on-budget surpluses to be used for the creation of a new Medicare prescription drug benefit. As my colleagues are aware, the need for such a benefit was one of the key sticking points in the discussions of the Bipartisan Medicare Commission--so my provision ensures that this critically needed benefit can be funded. 
   Yet even as it allows for the creation of a new prescription drug benefit, it also will encourage the development of a comprehensive plan to truly save Medicare without accounting gimmicks. Specifically, to access the on-budget surplus to pay for this new benefit, my provision requires that the Senate consider legislation that will ``significantly increase the solvency'' of the Medicare Trust Fund without artificially extending it in the manner prescribed by the President. While this provision in no way endorses one type of reform over another, it provides tantalizing ``carrot'' for Congress and the President if they are willing to sit down and legitimately work to strengthen Medicare. 
   Mr. President, now that we've separated the rhetoric from the reality of the President's budget, it's possible to do an honest comparison of the President's budget proposal and the Senate budget resolution we are now considering. 
   As my next chart indicates, the Senate budget resolution handily beats the President's budget at reducing publicly-held debt over the coming five years. In fact, by walling-off the Social Security surplus, the Republican plan would ensure that 82 percent of the unified surplus is used for debt reduction, versus 65 percent in the President's plan. 
   Why is the President's debt reduction so much lower? In a nutshell, because of the magnitude of his new spending proposals. While the Senate budget resolution exercises fiscal austerity by only using 18 percent of the surplus over the next five years for purposes other than debt reduction, the President uses 35 percent of the surplus for other purposes--the vast majority of which is increased spending. 
   Mr. President, the bottom line is that whether you compare these budgets based on reality or on rhetoric, the Senate budget resolution is superior to the Clinton plan, especially in terms of protecting Social Security's money. 
   As a result, I hope that the partisan attacks against the Senate budget resolution will end. 
   Mr. President, by maintaining fiscal discipline, protecting Social Security surpluses, buying down debt, providing funds for a Medicare prescription drug benefit, and enhancing funding for shared priorities such as education, I believe the Senate budget resolution deserves strong support by the full Senate. 
   Ultimately, while members from either side of the aisle may disagree with specific provisions in the resolution that has been crafted, the simple fact is that this is a budget framework--or ``blueprint''--that establishes parameters and priorities, but is not the final word on these individual decisions. Rather, specific spending and tax decisions will initially be made in the Appropriations and Finance Committees, and ultimately by members on the floor. 
   Therefore, I am hopeful that amendments offered to this framework do not  harm the broad and reasoned parameters that have been set, and that keep in mind that--unlike the President's proposal--the budget resolution should not be about rhetoric, but about fiscal reality.

   Mr. SNOWE. I support the Chafee amendment that assumes funding of $200 million specifically for the stateside program of the Land and Water Conservation Fund to come out of Function 370. It is my understanding that no specific program in Function 370 has been designated as an offset for the Chafee amendment. The ultimate funding decision of course rests with the appropriators, but I wanted to take this opportunity to cast my support for funds for the LWCF stateside program, which has not received any funding since 1995. 
   Up until 1995, LWCF stateside program funds were used in my state to assist communities for planning, acquiring and developing outdoor recreation facilities that would not otherwise have been affordable, especially in the smaller communities in Maine. 
   The LWCF stateside program has funded such local projects in Maine as the community playground in Durham, the Mt. Apatite trails in Auburn, the Dionne Park Playground in Madawaska, the East-West Aroostook Valley trail in Caribou, the Williams Wading Pool in Augusta, multi-purpose fields in St. George, Hampden, Buxton, Calais, and Bradford, the skating rink in Bucksport, and wharf rehabilitation in Greenville. 
   By leveraging state dollars with critical LWCF stateside funds, Maine's communities have been able to enjoy recreational facilities such as neighborhood parks, swimming pools, and ball fields, and also have had the opportunity to conserve certain highly valued lands that the citizens of the state wish to save for outdoor recreational activities for themselves and for generations to come. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 1999. I am pleased that Senator MCCAIN, Chairman of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, is joining me as a cosponsor in this effort to protect, sustain, and restore the health of coral reef ecosystems. 
   Coral reefs are among the world's most biologically diverse and productive ecosystems. Reefs serve as essential habitat for many marine organisms, enhancing commercial fisheries and stimulating tourism. They provide protection to coastal areas from storm surges and erosion, and offer many untold potential benefits such as new pharmaceuticals, some of which are presently being identified, developed, and tested. Unfortunately, coral reef ecosystems are in decline. 
   In 1998, coral reefs around the world appear to have suffered the most extensive and severe bleaching damage and subsequent mortality in modern times. Reefs in at least 60 countries were affected, and in some areas, more than 70 percent of the corals died off. These impacts have been attributed to the warmest ocean temperatures in 600 years. In addition to these impacts, however, it is estimated that 58 percent of the world's reefs are threatened by human activity such as inappropriate coastal development, destructive fishing practices, and other forms of overexploitation. 
   As a result of these stressors, coral reef habitat has been damaged and destroyed. Diseases of coral and reef-based organisms are expanding rapidly. Most of the diseases being tracked have only recently been discovered and are not widely understood. These serious problems highlight the need for more research to unravel the complex interactive effects between natural and human-induced stressors on coral reefs, and for more conservation and management activities. 
   The United States is not immune to these problems. Large coral reef systems exist in Florida, Hawaii, Texas, and various U.S. territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific. These reefs produce significant economic benefits for surrounding communities. In Florida, for example, the reefs contribute approximately 1.6 billion dollars annually to the state economy. But despite these clear benefits, U.S. reefs suffer from some of the same problems that affect reefs in other parts of the world. 
   Mr. President, this bill authorizes $3,800,000 in each of fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002 for a Coral Reef Conservation Program in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to provide conservation and research grants to states, U.S. territories, and qualified non-governmental institutions. Eligible conservation projects will focus on the promotion of sustainable development and work to ensure the effective, long-term conservation of coral reefs. Potential research projects will address use conflicts and develop sound scientific information on the condition of and threats to coral reef ecosystems. 
   The bill also authorizes NOAA to enter into an agreement with a qualified non-governmental organization to create a trust fund that will match private contributions to federal contributions and provide additional funding for worthy conservation and research projects. Through this mechanism, federal dollars can be used to leverage more dollars from the private sector for grants. 
   In addition, this bill authorizes $200,000 for each of fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002 for emergency assistance, which would be be provided through grants to address unforeseen or disaster-related problems pertaining to coral reefs. 
   Based on early reports, the repercussions of the 1998 mass bleaching and mortality events will be far-reaching in time and economic impact. This development, along with the continuing pressures from other sources, demonstrates the need for an increase in the effort to protect our coral reefs. The legislation I am introducing today provides a reasonable, cooperative vehicle to address these concerns.

   Ms. SNOWE. No. Actually less, I say to the chairman. Mr. President, I want to speak on one facet of this issue, and I will speak again later. I thank the chairman. I appreciate his yielding me this time. 
   I had intended to address the entire issue of the budget resolution as a member of the Budget Committee, because I think this was an extraordinary process in the Budget Committee. I want to commend the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, for doing an outstanding job, and for his exceptional leadership in balancing the many issues that came before the Budget Committee in crafting a budget that strengthens and improves some areas of the budget, preserves the Social Security surplus, and also addresses an issue that the debate is now apparently focusing on, and that is, of course, the issue of Medicare. 
   The reason I decided to take to the floor at this time is because I thought it was important to talk about the issue of the Medicare prescription drug benefit in the budget resolution. First of all, I was somewhat surprised to hear the tenor of the debate that has occurred on the floor with respect to a particular provision--the reserve fund for the Medicare prescription drug benefit program that is included in the budget resolution. 
   I should point out that it was the reserve fund that will provide for the assurance and the guarantee that if we get a Medicare reform package, we will also be able to fund a prescription drug benefit program. Thanks to the 
   chairman of the Budget Committee, who was willing to agree to use the onbudget surpluses as a way to preserve the prescription drug benefit program. I had offered an amendment in the committee that provided for a reserve fund for the prescription drug benefit program so that we would not have to have the 60-vote hurdle on the floor of the Senate in order to provide funding for that program. The very fact that we have a reserve fund in this current budget resolution allows for a prescription drug benefit program and  gives all the more certainty that is going to occur. 
   We include language that that prescription drug benefit program is also contingent on a reform package that would advance the solvency of the Medicare program. I think we all agree that is of necessity, given the fact that the Part A program is going to go bankrupt by the year 2008. Given the fact that we now have a reserve fund for the prescription drug benefit program in this budget resolution, I think it will give confidence and will serve as a catalyst for reform of the Medicare program. 
   But what is also important here in this debate this evening--that is why I decided to take to the floor tonight at this time, I say to my colleagues and to the Senator from Oregon, Senator WYDEN--is to restore some bipartisanship and stability to this debate on this particular issue. The fact is my amendment which created the reserve fund for the prescription drug benefit program and Medicare garnered the support of all of the Democrats and all of the Republicans on the committee. It received a bipartisan vote of 21 to 1 in the Budget Committee--almost unanimous support for this provision. It received bipartisan support for this new Medicare prescription drug benefit, if legislation that reforms the Medicare program is reported out of the Senate Finance Committee. 
   Crafting that reserve fund ensures that there will be a prescription drug benefit program of some kind using the onbudget surpluses. 
   But what is important here this evening is to underscore the fact that it received overwhelming bipartisan support in the committee, because we recognize that there is a glaring need for prescription drug coverage in the Medicare package in the Medicare benefit program. Senator WYDEN and I will be working with senior citizens groups and health care experts over the coming weeks to develop bipartisan legislation to try to see what we can do to ensure that coverage is provided. But currently it is important for Members to understand that there is a reserve fund in this budget resolution for that very purpose. 
   I am somewhat surprised to hear the statements that have been made here on the floor of the Senate suggesting that somehow there is no coverage for a prescription drug program, that there is no way that there is any money for Medicare or the drug benefit program when nothing could be further from the truth. The fact is that was one of the issues in the Budget Committee that received overwhelming bipartisan support. That is the way we want to keep it. Senator WYDEN and I will be working to do just that, because we know that it is absolutely imperative that we provide this benefit to the senior citizens of this country. 
   Medicare currently does not provide that benefit. Yet, 12 percent of the elderly in this country are the ones who spend more than a third of all of the costs of prescription drugs in 
   this country. So, therefore, we need to provide some kind of comprehensive package and benefit program for our senior citizens on how we do that. We plan to work on it over the weeks and months ahead. 
   But I do think it is important for Members to realize that there is a reserve fund for this purpose in this budget. It is not IOUs, as in the President's plan, I might add. In fact, as part of my amendment, it prohibits the transfer of these IOUs to the Medicare trust fund as proposed by the President. So they can't allow a transfer. That is an artificial benefit to the Medicare program. It doesn't essentially do anything to the Medicare program. I think we all recognize that. And, therefore, there is a prohibition against the transfer of IOUs to the trust fund, because it is not going to do anything to enhance the solvency of the Medicare trust fund. In fact, to the contrary. 
   We are going to try to do everything that we can, not only to use the onbudget surpluses, but any other additional funding that could be available to ensure that there will be permanent funding of the prescription drug benefit program in the future. We think it is absolutely essential. We think it is a priority. That is why it is in this budget resolution. And thanks to the leadership of the chairman of the Budget Committee, it happens to be there. 
   I hope Members will in no way denigrate what is in the committee resolution, because, if this provision wasn't in the budget resolution, we would have no way of assuring that there would be funding of the prescription drug benefit program that we addressed in the Medicare reform in this session of the Congress. 
   Mr. President, I hope that we understand exactly what is in this budget resolution. 
   I hope we do not make this a partisan debate. Many of us have worked across the aisle to ensure that we maintain bipartisanship when it comes to the reforming of the Medicare program. We hope we can preserve that approach. We will continue to do everything that we can to ensure that is the case. That is why I am pleased to have been able to work with Senator WYDEN to see how we can further develop initiatives to ensure that prescription drug benefit program does get funded in this budget and in this reform effort of the Medicare program in the future. 
   I want to make sure Members understand. If this reserve fund was not in the budget resolution, which was supported on a bipartisan basis, there would be absolutely nothing for prescription drugs. Because the President did not provide anything for prescription drugs. There was not one penny that was provided for, as far as this benefit is concerned, in his budget; not even a plan. So there was no mechanism and this reserve fund establishes this mechanism. It was supported by almost everybody on the Senate Budget Committee. 
   Now I will be pleased to yield to my colleague from Oregon, Senator WYDEN.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in honor of Women's History Month, today I am introducing legislation to create an Advisory Committee for the National Museum of Women's History. I am pleased to be joined by 17 of my colleagues: Senators HUTCHISON, MURRAY, MIKULSKI, BOXER, COLLINS, ROCKEFELLER, REID, BIDEN, AKAKA, KERRY (MA), ASHCROFT, DODD, DURBIN, TORRICELLI, INOUYE, LEIBERMAN, and SARBANES. 
   For far too long, women have contributed to history, but have largely been forgotten in our history books, in our monuments, and in our museums. It is long past time that the roles women have played be removed from the shadows of indifference and given a place where they can shine. 
   The bill we are introducing today will create a 26 member Advisory Committee to look at the following three issues and report back to Congress concerning (1) identification of a site for the museum in the District of Columbia; (2) development of a business plan to allow the creation and maintenance of the museum to be done solely with private contributions and 3) assistance with the collection and program of the museum. 
   It is important to note that this bill does not commit Congress to spending any money for this museum. The Committee's report will tell us the feasibility of funding the museum privately. And I believe that the Museum's Board has shown that they have the ability to do just that. 
   The concept for the National Museum of Women's History (NMWH) was created back in 1996. Since that time, the Board of Directors, lead by President Karen Staser, has worked tirelessly to build support and interest for this project. And judging by the fact that they have raised more than $10.5 million for the project, lent their support to the moving of the Suffragette statute from the crypt to the Rotunda, and raised $85,000 for that effort, I'd say they are well on their way to success. 
   They have also spent a lot of time answering the question ``why do we need a women's museum when we have the SMITHsonian.'' The first answer to that comes from Edith Mayo, Curator Emeritus of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, who notes that since 1963 only two exhibits--two--were dedicated to the role of women in history. 
   The fact is, in the story of America's success, the chapter on women's contributions has largely been left on the editing room floor. Here's what I mean: Many of us know that women fought and got the vote in 1920, with the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. But how many know that Wyoming gave women the right to vote in 1869, 51 years earlier, 
   and that by 1900 Utah, Colorado and Idaho had granted women the right to vote? Or that the suffragette movement took 72 years to meet its goal? And few know that the women of Utah sewed dresses made from silk for the Suffragettes on their cross country tour. 
   History is filled with other little known but significant milestones: like the first woman elected to the United States Senate was Hattie Wyatt Caraway from Louisiana in 1932. That Margaret Chase Smith, from my home state of Maine, was the first woman elected to the US Senate in her own right in 1948, and in 1962 became the first women to run for the US Presidency in the primaries of a major political party. Or that the first female cabinet member was Frances Perkins, Secretary of Labor for FDR. 
   How many people know that Margaret Reha Seddon was the first US woman to achieve the full rank of astronaut, and flew her first space mission aboard the Space Shuttle ``Discovery'' in 1985, twenty three years after the distinguished former Senator from the State of Ohio, John Glenn completed his historic first flight in space? 
   And I can guarantee you more people know the last person to hit over .400 in baseball--Ted Williams--than can name the first woman elected to Congress--Jeannette Rankin of Montana, who was elected in 1916, four years before ratification of the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote. 
   Hardly household names. But they should be. And with a place to showcase their accomplishments, perhaps one day they will take their rightful place beside America's greatest minds, visionary leaders, and groundbreaking figures. But until then, we have a long way to go. 
   Whatever period of history you chose--women played a role. Sybil Ludington, a 16-year-old, rode through parts of New York and Connecticut in April of 1777 to warn that the Redcoats were coming. Sacajawea, the Shoshone Indian guide, helped escort Lewis and Clark on their 8000 mile expedition. Rosa Parks, Jo Ann Robinson and Myrlie Evers played important roles in the civil rights movement in the 50's and 60's. And as we move into the 21st century, the role of women--who now make up 52 percent of the population--will continue to be integral to the future success of this country. 
   In fact the real question about the building of a women's museum is not so much where it will be built--although that remains to be explored. And it's not even who will pay for it--as I've said, it will be done entirely with private funds. The real question when it comes to a museum dedicated to women's history is, where will they put it all! 
   I would argue that we have a solemn responsibility to teach our children, and ourselves, about our rich past--and that includes the myriad contributions of women, in all fields and every endeavor. These women can serve as role models and inspire our youth. They can teach us about our past and guide us into our future. They can even prompt young women to consider a career in public service--as Senator Smith of Maine did for me. 
   Instead, today in America, more young women probably know the names of the latest super models then the names of the female members of this Administration's Cabinet. That is why we need a National Museum of Women's History, that is why I am proud to sponsor this legislation, and that is why I hope that my colleagues will join us in supporting the creation of this Advisory Committee as a first step toward writing the forgotten chapters of the history of our nation.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise as an enthusiastic co-sponsor of the Robb amendment to the fiscal year 1999 emergency supplemental appropriations bill. 
   By giving the Secretary of Defense the discretionary authority to compensate the families of the 20 victims of the tragic Marine Corps aircraft accident near Cavalese, Italy last Winter, Congress would close a moral gap between the United States and millions of grieving citizens in our allied countries. 
   The victims of the Cavalese accident came from six European countries, and the depth of this tragedy has led Secretary Cohen to appoint a panel under the leadership of retired Adm. Joseph Prueher to determine whether faulty training, mapping, or equipment malfunctions contributed to the plane's severing of a ski resort cable that led to the 20 innocent deaths. 
   Depending on the findings of the Prueher Commission, the judgment of Secretary Cohen, and the outcome of ongoing U.S. military litigation regarding the Cavalese incident, our amendment gives the Pentagon the flexibility to provide direct cash payments of up to $2 million per victim to the families of the deceased. 
   Under the Status of Forces Agreement, or SOFA, between the United States and each of its NATO Allies, we have already repaid the $60,000-per-victim amount given to the families by the Italian Government. In addition, the administration has agreed to furnish up to 75 percent of any wrongful death civil suit damages awarded to the families by the Italian courts. 
   But SOFA culpability applies only to the negligent acts of U.S. military personnel operating on the territory of an allied nation. The agreement does not apply to reckless activities that occur on U.S. territory but contribute to the causes of an accident overseas. 
   These possible activities in the Cavalese case, such as reliance on an insufficiently detailed map, a potentially malfunctioning aircraft altimeter, or inadequate pilot training, remain unresolved. But if conclusive findings show that developments on American soil had a relationship with the tragedy of Cavalese, SOFA would prohibit the United States from offering any further compensation to the families of the victims. In the meantime, the Italian litigation could end  inconclusively and continue for several years. 
   Beyond our moral obligation on this matter, Mr. President, we have strong legislative precedents for the Robb amendment. The fiscal year 1999 Defense appropriations bill set aside $20 million for the property damage that the military plane caused at the resort. 
   In addition, the Senate unanimously adopted a resolution last summer calling for the United States to resolve the claims of the Cavalese victims ``as quickly and fairly as possible.'' 
   Finally, this new funding would require no offsets, and the Congressional Budget Office has certified the Robb amendment as revenue-neutral. 
   Congress, Mr. President, acted wisely last year in compensating the Italians for the physical damage done at the ski resort. It should take similar action today to provide the Defense Department with legal authority for the compensation of the families who lost their loved ones in this tragedy. 
   I therefore urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment on a strong bipartisan basis.

On November 6, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that it was giving Maine $2.1 million to address $80 million in unmet needs as reported by FEMA to HUD. Needless to say, this amount was wholly unacceptable, and I have been working with HUD to try and address this very serious situation, which has left Maine unable to fully address the costs of the disaster.

   Ms. SNOWE. At one point in Maine more than 80 percent of the people in the State were without power. In fact, as Vice President Gore explained it, during a visit to Maine on January 15, 1998 `` We've never seen anything like this. This is like a neutron bomb aimed at the power system.'' We asked for your assistance in obtaining money for the CDBG program because it would allow States to use the money for utility infrastructure costs, Maine's largest unmet need according to both FEMA, who listed it as first in their February 1998, ``Blueprint for Action" and the Governor. With the transfer of the funding, will FEMA be able to provide funding for a State, like Maine, which wants to use the money to address the damage to the utility infrastructure in order to keep the utility rates--which are already the fourth highest in the country--from increasing to cover the storm costs?

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 257, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999. I am also honored to serve as an original cosponsor of this bill since it makes a straightforward but vital statement of policy regarding the core mission of the Defense Department to protect the United States from an accidental or deliberate ballistic missile attack. 
   Our bill this year, introduced on a bipartisan basis once again by the distinguished Senators from Mississippi and Hawaii, establishes a guideline without dictating its implementation. The so-called Cochran-Inouye measure simply urges the United States to deploy ``as soon as it is technologically possible'' a national missile defense system. 
   Why should Congress pass a sentence-long policy endorsing the deployment of national missile defenses? We float in an ocean of evidence that documents the emerging threat of a multistage ballistic missile attack against the United States. 
   Last summer, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld led a distinguished bipartisan panel in finding that North Korea and Iran, thanks to the support of Chinese and Russian technicians, could hit the far western territories of the United States with a multistage rocket by 2003. Iraq, the commission also informed us, could obtain this capability in a decade. 
   Several months before the completion of the Rumsfeld Report, the Air  Force released an updated ballistic missile threat assessment noting that the number of countries producing land-attack cruise missiles will increase from two to nine early in the next decade. 
   A 1995 National Intelligence Estimate cautioned that about 25 countries could threaten U.S. territory in less than 14 years if they acquired launch and satellite capabilities from the sky or seas. 
   Two years later, the CIA Director testified that Iran could have a medium-range ballistic missile by 2007. The following year, India and Pakistan exploded more powerful nuclear devices, and a North Korean multistage rocket soared over Japan. 
   The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service informs us that 21 countries overall possess or have ready access to chemical warheads. Another 10 nations harbor or seek inventories of biological weapons. 
   And among all of these states, only four lack the ballistic missiles to fire these terrifying munitions. Several more countries without weapons of mass destruction, such as Afghanistan, Algeria, Belarus, Bulgaria, Ukraine, and Yemen, nevertheless have the launchers to deliver them far beyond their borders. 
   Senators COCHRAN and INOUYE wisely recognize this real and expanding security threat while leaving the scientific and budgetary issues involved with the deployment of missile defensive hardware to the technicians of the Pentagon who have devoted their careers to this cause. 
   But the Congress as a whole must take responsibility for framing priorities of policy, and no priority could loom larger than the protection of our homeland. And on this fundamental front, supporters of the Cochran-Inouye bill have extensive reinforcements. 
   The first reinforcement comes from the President of the United States. A 1994 Executive order declared that nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons proliferation poses an ``unusual and extraordinary threat'' to our national security. 
   Another reinforcement comes from the President's deputies. Echoing the main theme of a bill still opposed by the administration, General Joseph Ralston told the Senate Armed Services Committee last summer that the Pentagon would field a national missile defense system as soon as ``technologically practical.'' 
   In this fiscal year 2000 budget submission statement increasing missile defense accounts by $6.6 billion over 5 years, Secretary Cohen concluded that such programs remained ``critical to a broader strategy seeking to prevent, reduce, deter, and defend against weapons of mass destruction.'' 
   If the Secretary of Defense tells Congress that curbing the capacity of rogue governments to assault the United States is a ``broad'' security ``strategy,'' who can doubt that the administration already has a policy of making a missile defense system operational sooner rather than later? 
   While this evidence of proliferation mounts by the month, our colleagues from the minority have blocked the Senate from exercising its majority will on the pending legislation because they believe that it would undermine the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union. 
   But this bill addresses the prospect of a destructive weapons attack at any time of any intensity from any source. It primarily reflects the Second and Third World missile launch capabilities of tomorrow, not just the cold war arsenals of yesterday. 
   These capabilities also do not always discriminate on the basis of nationality. Russia, just as unpredictably as America, could one day fall under the threat of attack from a rogue state. 
   So instead of rejecting a fundamental statement of national defense, we should modernize the ABM Treaty in partnership with Moscow to ensure that both countries enjoy adequate protection against an accidental or deliberate ballistic missile strike. 
   As the President's Acting Under Secretary of State for Arms Control told a Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee nearly 2 years ago, ``the determinant of our national missile defense program ..... is going to be what the threat requires.'' And the Threat, Mr. President, requires both the United States and Russia to prepare workable defensive networks. 
   At the same time that we build safeguards against attack, we must support the thirty-year negotiating process, pursued by administrations of both parties, of reducing and eliminating the prime agents of attack: long-range nuclear weapons. 
   For this reason, I was pleased to join Senator LANDRIEU in sponsoring an amendment to S. 257 reinforcing the United States arms control process with Russia. Despite Moscow's economic difficulties, a demoralized Russian Strategic Rocket Forces Command still maintains thousands of nuclear warheads subject to an accidental launch and the black markets of the Third World. 
   Our amendment, endorsed on a rollcall vote by 99 Senators, simply reaffirms the ``policy of the United States to seek continued negotiated reductions in Russian nuclear forces.'' 
   As a result, S. 257 now provides America with the best defense: a twin policy to deflect a short-notice missile strike against our homeland and to redouble our efforts at reducing the size and lethality of the world's two largest nuclear arms inventories. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I want to highlight the relationship between an affordable and robust national missile defense system and our military modernization agenda. 
   We pursue modernization to harmonize technology development with anticipated security threats. Missile defense programs embody this process since the president and his experts have diagnosed an evolving but real threat in ballistic arms proliferation. 
   Modernization objectives require us to build new systems against a new ballistic missile threat that is less graphic than the one posed by the Soviet Union, but just as menacing to our strategic interests and economic vitality. 
   In this light, Mr. President, a national missile defense system will bring the United States to the threshold of defense modernization. The Cochran-Inouye bill fully acknowledges that the architecture, components, and the budget for this program, like any other one scrutinized by Congress, must pass the test of practicality without jeopardizing other important priorities such as the Pentagon's planned increase in procurement spending to $60 billion by 2001. 
   Beyond this responsibility, however, we have the obligation to reconcile public policy with the evidence of arms proliferation. 
   Let's listen to the president, his analysts, his Defense Secretary, and his scientists. 
   Let's awaken to an uncertain world rumbling with launchers, warheads, and satellites whose range and power grow by the year. 
   And let's understand that the treaties of yesterday fail to help us shield the country against the potential attacks of tomorrow. 
   The statement of policy proposed by the Cochran-Inouye bill would represent a compelling step by Congress to counter the growing ballistic missile threat to America's most precious assets: her land and her people. I therefore urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of the National Missile Defense Act of 1999.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, during the consideration of S. 280, the Education Flexibility (Ed-Flex) Partnership Act of 1999, several new education proposals have been advanced by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. In particular, an issue that has received prominent attention is an amendment that would authorize federal monies for the hiring of 100,000 new teachers. 
   Like my colleagues, I am strongly committed to improving K-12 education and ensuring that the unique needs of our nation's schools are addressed. While the federal government provides only a fraction of our nation's total K-12 education spending, the amount that it does provide is critical to ensuring that our nation's children receive the quality education that they need and deserve. 
   Mr. President, as I look at the various challenges and issues facing our nation's schools, it is clear that every state and every community has different needs, even if some of these  needs are fairly pervasive. While one community may feel that its greatest need is the hiring of more teachers, another may feel that buying new textbooks or purchasing computers for the classroom may be the most pressing need. 
   Over the years, various federal education programs have been created to assist state and local governments in addressing their disparate needs, including programs that are designed to address issues that demand national oversight. For instance, more than 20 years ago, the federal government appropriately demanded that individuals with disabilities receive a quality education, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) was enacted accordingly. 
   Unfortunately, even as the federal government appropriately mandated that disabled children be educated at the local level, it has continued to fall woefully short in fulfilling its promised commitment to cover 40 percent of the associated cost. In fact, as several of my colleagues have emphasized, the federal government only funds approximately 10 percent of the cost today--and that paltry percent has only been achieved through Republican-led efforts over the past three years to increase funding for IDEA by 85 percent! 
   As a result of the ongoing federal shortfall, state and local governments are not only forced to cover the 60 percent share that was agreed to--but they also pick-up the missing 30 percent federal share. 
   Mr. President, this broken promise on the part of the federal government must not continue. Not only does it represent a failure on the part of the federal government to meet an important obligation to our nation's disabled children, but it also forces states and communities to divert their scarce resources for this unfunded mandate--resources that could otherwise be used to address a wide variety of local needs, including the hiring of new teachers. 
   To demonstrate the impact of this unfunded mandate, consider that in my home state of Maine, the federal government currently provides approximately $20 million for the education of the disabled, while the state and local governments are forced to shoulder more than $200 million of the cost. Therefore, if the federal government were to fulfill its 40 percent commitment, an additional $60 million would flow to the state. 
   That's $60 million now spent by Maine's state and local governments to cover a federal commitment--$60 million that would otherwise be freed-up to address distinct and pressing local needs. Sixty million dollars. 
   Needless to say, this shortfall has not been overlooked by officials at the state or local level. During a recent meeting with representatives of the Maine Municipal Association, local officials emphasized to me the need for the federal government to fulfill its commitment to fund 40 percent of the cost of educating the disabled because of the substantial budgetary impact it is having on their communities. 
   And during the recent gathering of the National Governors Association (NGA), the Governor of Maine, Angus King, interrupted President Clinton during his presentation on education issues to hammer home the need for special education funding. As quoted in a March 1, 1999, article in the Portland Press Herald, Governor King ``raised his hand and interrupted'' the President saying:  
   Mr. President, I'm bringing you a report from Franklin, Maine, and a lot of other places in Maine. What I'm telling you is that if you want to do something for schools in Maine, then fund special education and we can hire our own teachers and build our own schools.  
   Mr. President, I don't believe the thoughts and comments by the Governor of Maine are unique to our state. This is a national problem that requires federal action. Paying ``lip-service'' to this funding commitment is no longer enough. We cannot simply brush off the comments of governors and local leaders by expressing support for the full-funding of education for the disabled and not achieving it--rather, it's time to actually deliver on the promise made more than 20 years ago. 
   For this reason, I believe Congress should ensure that the federal share of education for the disabled is fully-funded before new programs are created. Not only will this ensure that a long-standing federal promise will finally be met, but it will also ensure that distinct local needs--which may include the hiring of new teachers--can be readily addressed. 
   During the upcoming reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education (ESEA) Act, there will be countless opportunities to reform and improve federal education programs that are intended to address distinct needs. But the time to create truly new federal education programs--and to devote federal resources to these new proposals--should not occur until we have met our outstanding federal obligation to disabled children and to the states and communities that educate them. 
   Mr. President, the time to fully-fund the federal share of education for the disabled is now. I urge that my colleagues vote to ensure that any new K-12 education monies be used to meet this commitment, and to finally fulfill a federal promise made to state and local governments more than 20 years ago.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues Senators JEFFORDS, FRIST, and HAGEL in introducing the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act. I first introduced this legislation in the 104th Congress, in conjunction with Representative LOUISE SLAUGHTER in the House. Since then I have worked extensively with many of my colleagues to ensure that this legislation effectively addresses the need for protections against genetic discrimination in the health insurance industry. This bill builds on and improves the language included in the Patients' Bill of Rights--Plus (S. 300). 
   Progress in the field of genetics is accelerating at a breathtaking pace. Who could have predicted 20 years ago that scientists could accurately identify the genes associated with cystic fibrosis, cancer, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases? Today scientists can, and as a result doctors are increasingly better able to identify predispositions to certain diseases based on the results of genetic testing. These results mean that doctors are better able to successfully treat and manage many diseases. Scientific advances hold tremendous promise for the approximately 15 million people affected by the over 4,000 currently-known genetic disorders, and the millions more who are carriers of genetic diseases who may pass them on to their children. In fact, just this month scientists reported that one of the genes implicated in advanced breast cancer is also related to the final stages of prostate cancer. Because science progresses my legislation has not remained static and it represents the best of genetic advancements and the most comprehensive definitions of genetic issues. I have been working hard with experts in the genetics field, Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee Senator JIM JEFFORDS, Senator BILL FRIST, and Senator CHUCK HAGEL to improve upon the language included in the Patients' Bill of Rights--Plus. Today's bill is the result of an enormous amount of time and effort, and I want to thank my three colleagues for their willingness to devote so much of their attention to this important issue. 
   Unfortunately as our knowledge of genetics and genetic predisposition to disease has increased, so has the potential for discrimination in health insurance based on genetic information. In addition to the potentially devastating consequences health insurance denials based on genetic information can have on American families, the fear of discrimination has equally harmful consequences for consumers and for scientific research. But genetics still isn't an exact science. We all must remember that prediction does not mean certainty. For example, the Alzheimer's gene has less than a 35 percent prediction certainty. Science has not yet progressed to the point where it can tell us definitely and without doubt what will happen if a mutation is found and it is this uncertainty that makes our legislation so very, very important. 
   As a legislator who has worked for many years on the issue of breast cancer, and as a woman with a history of breast cancer in her family, I continue to be amazed and delighted with the treatment advances based on the discoveries of two genes related to breast cancer--BRCA1 and BRCA2. Keep in mind that women who inherit mutated forms of either gene have an 85 percent risk of developing breast cancer in their lifetime, and a 50 percent risk of developing ovarian cancer. Not very good odds. 
   Although there is no known treatment to ensure that women who carry the mutated gene do not develop breast cancer, genetic testing makes it possible for carriers of these mutated genes to take extra precautions such as mammograms, self-examinations, and even enrollment in research studies in order to detect cancer at its earliest stages. Many women who might take extra precautions if they knew they had the breast cancer gene may not seek testing because they fear losing their health insurance. And what are the implications when women are afraid of having a genetic test--or testing their daughters? 
   The implications are simply devastating. One of my constituents from Hampden, Maine put it best:  
   I'm a third generation [breast cancer] survivor and as of last October I have nine immediate women in my family that have been diagnosed with breast cancer *.*.*. I want my daughters to be able to live a normal life and not worry about breast cancer. I want to have the BRCA test [for breast cancer] done but because of the insurance risk for my daughters' future I don't dare.  
   Nine women in Bonnie Lee Tucker's family have breast cancer, yet the fear of discrimination was so strong that she would forgo testing that could potentially save her own or her daughters' lives. 
   Patients like Bonnie Lee Tucker may be unwilling to disclose information about their genetic status to their physicians out of fear, hindering treatment or preventive efforts. And though it could save her life or the life of one of her daughters she is unwilling to participate in potentially ground-breaking research trials because she does not want to reveal information about their genetic status and is afraid of losing her health insurance. Bonnie Lee Tucker should not have to bet her life and the life of her daughter this way. 
   Americans should not live in fear of knowing the truth about their health status. They should not be afraid that critical health information could be misused. They should not be forced to choose between insurance coverage and critical health information that can help inform their decisions. They should not fear disclosing their genetic status to their doctors. And they should not fear participating in medical research. 
   We must ensure that people who are insured for the very first time, or who become insured after a long period of being uninsured, do not face genetic discrimination. We must ensure that people are not charged exorbitant premiums based on such information. We must ensure that insurance companies cannot discriminate against individuals who have requested or received genetic services. We must ensure that insurance companies cannot release a person's genetic information without their prior written consent. And we must ensure that health insurance companies cannot carve out covered services because of an inherited genetic disorder. Our bill does just that. 
   As the Senate moves forward with the Patients' Bill of Rights--Plus we must focus on this important issue and should act as quickly as possible to put a halt to the unfair practice of discriminating on the basis of genetic information, and to ensure that safeguards are in place to protect the privacy of genetic information.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the efforts of my colleague Senator CHAFEE for the Credit for Voluntary Early Action Act he has introduced that will encourage the reduction of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The concept of this bill is a creative step toward awarding those industries who take early actions to reduce their overall emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, which are thought to be causing changes in climate around the globe. 
   The bill would set up a domestic program that gives companies certain credits for the voluntary actions they take for reducing the amount of greenhouse gases they emit into the air. These credits could then be used in meeting future reductions, or could be sold to other companies to help with their own reductions. Strong incentives would also be provided for those companies developing innovative technologies that will help reduce the buildup of atmospheric greenhouse gases. 
   The Chafee bill clearly puts us at the starting line in the 106th Congress for addressing the continuous domestic buildup of greenhouse gases. I do feel the bill needs to take a further step in the race to make our planet more environmentally and economically friendly, however. We need to establish domestic credits for carbon sequestration that will help reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, and thereby help to address the complex issue of climate change. I plan to continue to work with Senator CHAFEE to take that next step. 
   Maine is one of the country's most heavily forested states, with much of its land devoted to forests, and so has much to offer towards the reduction of carbon in our atmosphere. The State's forestlands have been a large key to our quality of life and economic prosperity. These forests absorb and store carbon from the atmosphere, allowing the significant sequestration of carbon, serving as carbon ``sinks''. 
   Because of continuous improvements made in forest management practices and through extensive tree replanting programs, forests all over the country continue to sequester significant amounts of carbon. Through active forest management and reforestation, through both natural and artificial regeneration, the private forests, both industrial and non-industrial, are helping to decrease carbon dioxide emissions that are occurring both from natural processes and human activities into the atmosphere. 
   The addition of credits for greenhouse gas reductions for forestry-related carbon sequestration activities should be a part of the voluntary credits system the bill proposes so as to allow the owners of the forests of today--and tomorrow--to voluntarily participate and receive credits for carbon sequestration. This should not be difficult to do since the U.S. Forest Service already follows a carbon stock methodology that is used by the Environmental Protection Agency to document the nation's carbon dioxide emissions and inventories for carbon storage. 
   I realize that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been tasked to prepare a special report that is expected out next year that may help define appropriate definitions and accounting rules for carbon sinks. In the meantime, I do not believe it will be helpful to leave the issue of carbon sequestration unacknowledged in any domestic program--and to cause  losers along with winners in the process. We are all in a race against an uncertainty that no one can afford to lose. 
   As I mentioned, I believe that the goals of the Chafee bill are admirable and will allow for a dialogue to begin, hopefully on the science as opposed to the politics, for what can be done domestically within the global climate change debate. I hope to be included as a part of that dialogue and urge that those who speak to carbon sequestration credits be heard through the public hearings process or by amending the bill in a way that will not only encourage sustainable forest management, but also stimulate incentives for maintaining healthy forests. The discussion on the importance of carbon sequestration within our terrestrial ecosystems--long a large component of the climate change debate--must continue.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, with the passing of Morris K. Udall on December 12, 1998, there is a little less humor, and humanity in the world. 
   On that day, the nation lost a remarkable man of unyielding warmth and uncompromising ethics--and an individual who increased the stock of public service by adhering to the very highest principles of leadership. Mo Udall exemplified all that is noble about our field of endeavor, and I was honored to serve with him in the House of Representatives. He was a man of stature in every sense in the world, and his legacy still looms large on America's political landscape. I admired him as a colleague and a person. 
   Mo Udall was truly an American original, a son of the great Southwest who seemed at home wherever he was. He had a natural way with people--maybe because he had a way of making everyone feel important, feel like they had something to contribute. His faith  in people was genuine and unwavering, as was his belief in the power of government to be a positive force in the lives of those he served. 
   I always had a sense that Mo was someone who truly enjoyed what he did, and felt privileged to be doing it. It saddened me deeply when I last saw Mo, in the grips of a cruel and unforgiving disease. But that disease, while it deprived Mo of so much of the life he'd always known, never managed to wrest from him his dignity. And my sadness was tempered by the notion that this was a man who could look back on his life's work and feel that it stood for something. That it had truly made a difference. And I think that all of us in public service would like to be able to say that when all our votes have been cast and our tenure in this great institution has passed into history, in that regard, we should all be as fortunate as Morris K. Udall. 
   Similarly, we can all take lessons from his extraordinary life. He brought good cheer and laughter to a process that needs humor like an engine needs oil--without it, the wheels of government seize up; political discourse overheats. Indeed, as Mo himself once wrote, ``In times of national strife, humor can bring a diverse society closer together *.*.* In times of national tragedy, disappointment, or defeat, political humor can assuage the nation's grief, sadness or anger, and thus make bearable that which must be borne.'' 
   Of course, while Mo never took himself too seriously, he understood full well the gravity of his work. Again, to use Mo's own words, ``*.*.* the business of government is serious business, and in politics, as in any other endeavor, wisecracks are no substitute for substance.'' 
   Certainly, there was no lack of substance in Mo Udall's record, as even a cursory review of his accomplishments would reveal. Deeply committed to environmental issues, he worked toward a healthier world for future generations. Determined to erase the divisions among us, he helped champion civil rights. Weary of abuse in our nation's elections, he fought for campaign finance reform. Respectful of the natural beauty with which we've been blessed, he introduced legislation to protect our nation's most precious resources. 
   And mindful of the solemn responsibility we have to those who first occupied these lands, he was a trusted friend to native Americans. In fact, Mo was chairman of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs when I fought for federal recognition of the Aroostook Band of Micmac Indians in northern Maine--and I will forever appreciate all of his wise guidance, input, and assistance. 
   Throughout it all, and despite his deeply held beliefs, Mo Udall never viewed ``bipartisanship'' as a four letter word. He knew that reaching out will always be more effective than digging in. That's not to say Mo Udall wasn't proud to be a Democrat--indeed, he was fiercely proud of his political affiliation--but at the end of the day, he always favored progress over party, civility over shrillness, and solutions over sound bites. He was more interested in fixing problems than scoring political points, and that made him a winner in the eyes of his constituents as well as a hero to all those who see public service as a worthy pursuit. 
   In closing, let me just say that, for all of Mo's accomplishments, perhaps time will prove this last one to be his greatest. For Mo Udall was living proof that there are good people in politics. At a time when cynicism about government is considered intellectually chic, Mo Udall reminds us all that integrity and hard work never go out of style. If the reputation of an institution is like the balance in a bank account--the sum of its credits and debits--then Mo Udall made more than his share of deposits over his 30 years in Congress. And he never withdrew a dime. 
   Today, Congress is the richer for it, public service is the richer for it, and the American people are the richer for it.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act, of which I am an original cosponsor. 
   I would like to begin by thanking Senator BOND, who serves as Chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, for his leadership on this important issue. As a member of the Small Business Committee and a Senator from a state where virtually all the businesses are small businesses, I strongly believe that assisting small businesses prepare for the Year 2000 must be a top priority. 
   So many aspects of our lives are influenced by computers. I believe the Y2K computer glitch is an issue of such importance that it demands decisive action on our part, because any delay at this point will make this problem exponentially more difficult to solve. 
   The bill before us today authorizes loan guarantees for small businesses to help with Y2K compliance. Loan guarantees will permit small businesses to assess their computers' Y2K compatibility, identify changes to assure compatibility, and finance purchase or repair of computer equipment and software to ensure that is compatible with Y2K. The loans will also allow small businesses to hire third party consultants to support their efforts. 
   Maine has an historical record of self-reliance and small business enterprise, and I am extremely supportive of the role the federal government can play in promoting small business growth and development. Small businesses are increasingly essential to America's prosperity, and they should and will play a vital role in any effort to revitalize our communities if we help them enter the 21st Century in a strong position. 
   As we all know, this problem stems from a simple glitch--how the more than 200 million computers in the United States store the date within their internal clocks. 
   Some computers and software may not run or start if the internal clock fails to recognize ``00'' as a proper year. The computer can continue waiting for you to enter what it thinks is a correct date and prevent you from accessing your records until you have done so. Without access to your records, you will be unable to track your inventory, sales, or even your bank accounts. 
   I began to wonder what the effects would be on small business when the Commerce Committee held a hearing on the issue last year. And after questioning officials, specifically Deputy Secretary of Commerce Robert Mallett, it became evident that many small businesses simply didn't have the kind of time and resources that many larger business may have at their disposal to fix this potentially serious problem. 
   At the Maine forums I sponsored last year as a member of both the Commerce and Small Business Committees, I worked to educate small businesses on the Y2K threat, and it was a learning experience for me as well. 
   The impact of Y2K on the small business community could be devastating. According to a National Federation of Independent Business and Wells Fargo Bank study, 82 percent of small businesses are at risk. 
   Fortunately, it doesn't have to be that way. With the benefit of foresight and proper planning, we can diffuse this ticking time bomb and ensure that the business of the nation continues on without a hitch--or a glitch. 
   From a technical standpoint, the necessary corrections are not difficult to make. However, determining that there's a problem, finding people qualified to fix the problem, and crafting a solution to fit the individual needs of different computers and programs poses significant challenges. 
   We must put ourselves in the position that a small business or entrepreneur is in. Consider that this problem effects more than just your business. By checking your system you are only halfway to solving the problem. You must also take time to ensure your supplier, distributer, banker, and accountant are also ``cured'' of the Year 2000 problem. 
   For example, if you manufacture a product on deadline, you'll want to make sure your computers will be able to keep track of your delivery schedule, inventory, and accounts receivable and payable. If your system fails to do this, the consequences could be debilitating for a business. 
   But think about this: suppose your suppliers aren't compatible, and their system crashes. You may not receive the raw materials you need to get your product to market on time--devastating if you're in a ``just in time'' delivery schedule with your supplier. And  what happens when your shipper's computers go down for the count? 
   That is why it is so important that we take steps to fix the problem now. The year 2000 is almost upon us, and each day that goes by trades away valuable time. 
   For the vast majority of businesses, there are five simple steps toward compliance. First, awareness of the problem. Second, assessing which systems could be affected and prioritizing their conversion or replacement. Third, renovating or replacing computer systems. Fourth, validating or testing the computer systems. And fifth, implementing the systems. 
   The bill before us today will help small business address these steps, and I urge my colleagues to join in an overwhelming show of support for our nation's small businesses by voting for this important legislation. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to bring my colleagues attention to the celebration of National TRIO Day which took place on Saturday, February 28. National TRIO Day--which was created by a concurrent resolution during the 99th Congress--is celebrated every year on the last Saturday of February, and serves as a day of recognition for the Federal TRIO Programs. 
   As my colleagues are aware, the TRIO Programs actually consist of several educational programs: Talent Search; Upward Bound; Upward Bound Math/Science; Veterans Upward Bound; Student Support Services; Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program; and Educational Opportunity Centers. These programs, established over 30 years ago, provide services to low-income students and help them overcome a variety of barriers to obtaining a higher education, including class, social, and cultural barriers. 
   Currently, 2,000 colleges, universities and community agencies sponsor TRIO Programs, and more than 780,000 low-income middle school, high school, and adult students benefit from the services of these programs. By lifting students out of poverty, these students can pursue their highest aspirations and achieve the American dream, even as our nation is collectively lifted to new heights. 
   Mr. President, there are 15 TRIO Programs in my home State of Maine that serve 6,000 aspiring students each year. I know that these programs work because I have seen and heard of the tangible impact the programs have had--and continue to have--on individuals in Maine. 
   The impact of the TRIO Programs speaks for itself when considering that TRIO graduates can be found in every occupation one can think of, including doctors, lawyers, astronauts, television reporters, actors, state senators, and even Members of Congress. In fact, two of our colleagues in the House of Representatives--Congressman HENRY BONILLA and Congressman ALBERT R. WYNN--are graduates of the TRIO Programs. 
   In closing, as we celebrate National TRIO Day, I would like to encourage my colleagues to learn more about the TRIO Programs in their respective states, and see for themselves the impact the programs have had--and continue to have--on their constituents. Ensuring that all of our nation's students who desire a higher education are able to attain it is a goal that I think we can all agree on--and TRIO makes it possible.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to welcome Father Peter Chrisafideis to the United States Senate this morning, and to thank Dr. Ogilvie for graciously extending his hospitality to him. 
   Allowing guest chaplains to open the United States Senate with prayer helps to highlight the important role that clergy of different faiths play throughout the United States--from the largest cities to the smallest towns. It is a statement that we are a nation of men and women for whom spiritual guidance and fulfillment is a vital part of daily life. Our country's spiritual leaders play an indispensable role in helping us to forge a sense of community, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of them for their service. 
   For me personally, growing up, the Greek Orthodox religion was a constant and important presence in my life. My father was a Greek immigrant; my mother, the daughter of immigrants. So, ever since my early childhood, Greek Orthodox religious traditions have been at the center of my upbringing, and have helped shape my beliefs and my life. 
   Father Peter, as he is referred to by his congregation, has been a part of that tradition for me, serving formerly at Holy Trinity Church in Lewiston, Maine, where I am a member of the congregation. In fact, while it's hard for me to believe it could have been that long ago, Father Peter officiated at my own wedding almost exactly ten years ago. And he must have done a great job, because we are still going strong and looking forward to the next ten years! 
   Today, Father Peter leads the congregation of the St. George Greek Orthodox Church, where he serves the spiritual needs of Greek-Americans in the greater Bangor community. In addition, he has served a number of parishes outside the State of Maine throughout the years, helping members of the Church to nourish their beliefs and come to know their faith. 
   I again want to thank Father Peter for his service to the Church, as well as his personal friendship and support. And I want to extend my appreciation once more not only to Dr. Ogilvie, but to all of the nation's spiritual leaders for the tremendous inspiration and wise guidance they provide in helping people to live happier, better, and more fulfilling lives.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my friend and colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, to introduce the ``Surplus Protection Act of 1999''--legislation that will reform the budget process by tightening the manner in which emergency spending legislation is considered in the Senate. Not only will these reforms ensure that there is greater accountability in the emergency spending process, but they will also ensure that the unified budget surplus we now enjoy will be protected from spending raids that are designed to circumvent the normal budget process--and that could undercut our ability to utilize the surplus for strengthening Social Security. 
   Mr. President, as my colleagues are aware, last year the federal government enjoyed its first balanced budget since 1969. To be precise, the federal government actually achieved a unified budget surplus of $70 billion in fiscal year 1998. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), this surplus will not be a one time occurrence; rather, unified budget surpluses will continue to accrue during the next 10 years if CBO's projections for economic growth, federal revenues, and federal spending hold true. 
   While the surplus is welcome news after decades of annual deficits and burgeoning debt, we must never forget how easily this valuable national asset can be squandered if we fail to be vigilant in protecting it. For too long, the federal government treated the budget like a credit card with an unlimited spending limit, and such bad habits--even if broken for a few years--can quickly return, especially when there is a surplus just burning a hole in the pocket of Congress and the President! 
   Therefore, in an effort to ensure the surplus is protected from future spending raids, we are offering legislation today that will crack down on arguably the most insidious manner in which budgetary spending limits and protections can be circumvented: the emergency spending designation. In light of the $21.4 billion in emergency spending that was contained in last year's omnibus bill, the need to provide safeguards against the abuse of this provision--and the squandering of the surplus--could not be more clear. 
   Mr. President, the emergency spending designation was created for a very important reason. If a sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and temporary event occurs, the strict spending limits imposed in the budget resolution can be exceeded through the designation of that event as an ``emergency.'' This exception is understandable when considering that the hands of Congress and the Administration should not be tied when the pressing needs of our nation override the need for strict budget discipline. 
   For instance, recent earthquakes in California, floods in the Midwest, hurricanes in the South, and ice storms in the Northeast--which were devastating to my home state of Maine--are all examples of natural disasters that warranted the emergency designation because they were completely unexpected and unforseen, and could not have been addressed in a timely manner through the regular budget process. By the same token, the tragic bombing in Oklahoma City is an example of an unexpected and unforeseeable event that also warranted emergency treatment. 
   Yet even as the emergency designation is necessary and warranted for these and other unexpected disasters, it can also be used as a major loophole by those who wish to circumvent the normal budget or legislative process. Rather than restricting the use of the emergency designation to only those bills or items that are truly unforseen and urgent, some may use this designation to either fund programs or projects that are debatable as to their emergency nature, while others may use emergency bills to push through unrelated legislation or spending programs without the normal level of scrutiny provided in the normal legislative process. 
   For example, the omnibus bill adopted at the close of the 105th Congress contained $21.4 billion in emergency spending that came directly out of the surplus. While some of the provisions in that package undoubtedly deserved the emergency designation, several items were either debatably an ``emergency'' or were an outright effort to circumvent the regular budget 
   process. Specifically, the $2 billion in emergency funding for our three-year-old mission in Bosnia was hardly unexpected and should have been included in the President's budget at the beginning of the year. It should not have be designated an ``emergency'' simply to avoid the budget caps that ensure fiscal restraint. 
   Ultimately, regardless of the manner in which the emergency designation can be misused--whether it is to fund a military operation that has been ongoing for years, or to fast-track a piece of legislation that has no relationship to the emergency in question--it is a practice that we must stop. 
   The legislation we are offering today will do just that. Specifically, the bill establishes three new rules to ensure that bills or individual provisions receiving the emergency designation are subject to careful--but reasonable--scrutiny.  
   The first provision--which is patterned after the ``Byrd Rule'' that applies to reconciliation bills--will ensure that non-emergency items will not be attached to emergency spending bills by creating a point of order for striking these provisions. Simply put, because emergency spending bills are often put on a ``fast-track'' to ensure rapid consideration, we should not allow non-emergency spending or legislative riders to be attached to these bills in an effort to avoid the normal, deliberative legislative process. To waive this restriction, an affirmative vote by three-fifths of the members of the Senate would be required--a level that will be easily achieved for a true emergency. 
   The second provision--which is also patterned after the Byrd Rule--will ensure that the validity of any item that is designated as an emergency--in either an emergency spending bill or a non-emergency bill--can be challenged by the members of the Senate. The bottom line is that just because an item placed in a bill is given the emergency designation does not mean it deserves that designation--and this point of order will ensure that members agree that the designation is warranted. 
   As outlined earlier, the omnibus bill adopted at the close of the 105th Congress contained a variety of provisions that were debatable ``emergencies''--in particular, the funding for troops in Bosnia, because this cost was hardly unforeseen, sudden, or temporary. This point of order will ensure that such provisions do not avoid budget scrutiny, and that the surplus is protected for Social Security accordingly. 
   The final provision will ensure that any legislation that contains emergency spending will require a three-fifths vote for final passage. Because members may feel compelled to act quickly on bills that contain even a single item designated as an emergency, this provision will ensure that such bills do not slide through the regular legislative process without full consideration and without more than simple majority support. While the previous two points of order will prevent improper abuse of the emergency designation, this requirement will serve as a final safeguard in the process. 
   Mr. President, the bottom line is that although the emergency designation is a vitally important means of ensuring the unexpected needs of our nation can be addressed, it can also become a loophole that subverts budget discipline, drains our new-found surplus, and potentially impacts our ability to strengthen the Social Security program. But with proper safeguards put in place, we can ensure that this potential loophole is closed while still ensuring legitimate emergencies are addressed. 
   The legislation I am offering today along with Senator GRAHAM provides such thoughtful and reasonable safeguards, so I urge that my colleagues support the ``Surplus Protection Act of 1999.''

   Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I am honored to serve as an original co-sponsor of the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999 in the name of the hundreds of thousands of men and women trained to deter, fight, and win our wars. 
   I also thank Senators WARNER, ALLARD, LEVIN, and CLELAND for their bipartisan support of the legislation's universal 4.8 percent pay raise and thrift savings proposals as well as the constructive amendments on G.I. bill reform incorporated in the committee-reported version of the bill. 
   The Bill of Rights Act legalizes the concept that military personnel should receive the same retirement benefits based not on the arbitrary factor of when they joined, but on the timeless standard of willingness to sacrifice. 
   It is notable, therefore, that the Senate's opening legislation of the year increases soldier pay for the first time in a generation and strips away the layers of unfairness in a military retirement system based solely on the date of entry rather than the length of service. Unilke the current arrangement, which is more generous to active duty personnel who started working before 1986, our proposal of benefits and bonuses offers the same retirement package to all men and women in uniform who build a military career of at least 20 years. 
   Today, we also commit ourselves to a comprehensive pay raise of 4.8 percent--the largest since 1982--that narrows the gap between military and civilian salaries. 
   We commit ourselves, as Secretary Cohen did last month in recommending salary increases for noncommissioned and mid-grade commissioned officers, to retention and promotion bonuses that reward the skills of 21st century war fighters. 
   We commit ourselves for the first time ever to making long-term savings plans available to uniformed service members so that they can build a foundation for family security. 
   We commit ourselves to increases the monthly G.I. benefit for Service people who serve at least for 2 years while eliminating the punitive $1,200 entry fee for young men and women who want to take advantage of a college education under this historic program. 
   And we commit ourselves to financial independence for the junior enlisted ranks by making available a special subsistence allowance of $180 per month as an alternative to food stamp subsidies. This provision will remove from the welfare rolls an estimated 11,900 military personnel in the lowest pay grades. 
   Beginning last September and continuing through the new year, the committee constructed a public record of the financial and operational strains that our military people have endured in recent times. 
   We found that the total value of the Army's retirement package had eroded by 25 percent since 1986. We also found that inadequate pay left the Navy short of 7,000 sailors, the Air Force short of 2,000 pilots, and the Marine Corps short of combat engineers by a threshold of 30 percent. 
   Last month, General Henry Shelton, the nation's senior official in uniform, told the Armed Services Committee that ``reforming military retirement remains the Joint Chiefs highest priority.'' 
   Echoing General Shelton, the Air Force Chief of Staff told the committee that ``restoring the retirement system as a retention incentive is our top priority.'' 
   The Commandant of the Marine Corps told the committee that ``unit commanders routinely cite dissatisfaction with.......retirement.......as one of the foremost reasons for separation.'' 
   And the Chief of Naval Operations told the Committee that ``pay and retirement benefits rank among our sailors' top dissatisfiers.'' 
   As the chairwoman of the Armed Services Seapower Subcommittee, I must report that inadequate pay has directly strained our maritime Special Operations forces--famously known as the Navy SEALS. 
   The SEALS conduct vital intelligence-gathering and enemy infiltration activities in advance of, or as an alternative to, higher risk conventional military campaigns. Intense training schedules and exciting missions have traditionally held SEAL recruitment and retention levels traditionally exceed those for most other naval components by between 20 and 30 percent. 
   But today, the SEAL re-enlistment rate exceeds that for the rest of the Service by only 2 percent. The SEALS now face an overall shortfall of 300 men, and the senior enlisted member of  the organization told the San Diego Tribune last week that while morale was still high, the pay was too low. 
   Beyond the SEALS, Mr. President, the Navy struggles with skilled personnel shortages throughout the Service. Thirty-five percent of naval aviators elect to take retention bonuses while the Pentagon's goal in this area stands at 50 percent. Enlisted retention overall has decreased 6 to 8 percent below normal requirements. 
   Finally, the most acute turnover rates faced by our sailors come from the ranks of those who lead them: the mid-level officers who command our surface ships and submarines. 
   The Bill of Rights Act responds in an aggressive way to these disturbing developments. With this law, we declare that while Congress cannot equalize the financial benefits of all Armed Services and private sector jobs, it can devise compensation plans upholding the value of military careers regardless of the state of the economy. 
   It's fair to ask, Mr. President, why the Joint Chiefs did not identify problems like a ballistic missile strike from North Korea or Iraq's chemical weapons as more serious threats to military preparedness than pay levels or retirement benefits. 
   The answer rests with a fundamental but overlooked fact: only people can deliver the capabilities to protect America and her interests overseas. We must therefore ensure that the military's pay and retirement policies provide strong retention incentives to skilled and motivated troops. 
   Military strength not only comes from adequate spending on technology and hardware. It also comes from compensation packages that inspire officers and enlisted personnel alike to remain in service with fair pay and to anticipate a secure retirement with a fair pension. 
   Because the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999 recognizes the critical human dimension of defense preparedness, I urge the Senate's enthusiastic support for this bill. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, now that we have come to the end of the process required by the Constitution, I feel we have arrived at an appropriate time to consider a measure required by the President's conduct. 
   I rise in support of censure because while I do not find that the President's behavior constitutes high crimes and misdemeanors requiring removal, I do believe that it compels us to record for history our recognition of the damage we all acknowledge he has inflicted upon the Office of the Presidency and the Nation. 
   Acquittal must not be the last word. And while I have felt that it would have been more appropriate for the Senate to issue findings of fact in the impeachment case against the President, I am now prepared to support censure so that there is no mixed message for posterity about what the Senate thinks of the President's actions. 
   As I said yesterday, the President's behavior is indefensible, and I for one have no interest in seeing another shameless ``Rose Garden Jubilee'' after today's vote by the Court of Impeachment. Acquittal is not exoneration. Nothing we do here today in any way absolves the President's responsibility for the harm he has inflicted--and the President must know this. 
   Indeed, this has been a sordid chapter in the history of the Presidency, and it deserves to be closed with a stern warning and a strongly worded rebuke that will leave no doubt to future generations that this process was not simply much ado about nothing. It was, in fact, about something very important--the sanctity of public service. 
   That's why I worked with Senators FEINSTEIN and BENNETT to include language expressing the will of this Senate that this resolution not be revoked by a future Congress. I also want to thank them for their willingness to include language that makes clear the Senate believes the President should be treated like any other citizen facing criminal allegations once he leaves office in 23 months. 
   The fact is, even while this body has acquitted the President on Articles of Impeachment, the framers provided for an additional remedy for his conduct in standard criminal court. Why? Because they had known a country where some men were above the law, and some below. And they were determined to create a nation where the level of justice served was not proportional to a person's pocketbook, social rank or political power. 
   I believe acquittal, though the proper outcome, by itself could present a  skewed picture of the Senate's findings, and runs the risk that the President will claim exoneration for his actions. Such a claim, evidence of which is already apparent, is quite simply and obviously, wrong. 
   The President may not have committed high crimes and misdemeanors, but what he has done--in my mind including unlawfully influencing a potential witness--deserves a formal rebuke by the Senate. Censure would be an appropriate and constitutionally permissible way to do this. 
   For a President who from the very beginning promised the most ethical administration any of us would ever see, censure would be a well-deserved legacy of a promise broken and a Presidency sullied. I will vote for this censure motion and I urge my colleagues to do likewise. 
   Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished colleagues, let me begin by expressing my appreciation to the Chief Justice for his wisdom, for his infinite patience, and for conferring upon this body the judicial temperament envisioned by the Framers. 
   I would also like to commend both the Senate majority and minority leaders for upholding the dignity of this body, by preserving judiciousness and fairness, and maintaining bipartisanship and civility. 
   Colleagues, we have arrived at a juncture in our public lives that will largely define our place before the judgment of history, and I think it will be said that justice and the Constitution were well served. 
   Indeed, the consequences of our decision are manifest in the words of Alexander Hamilton, who wrote of ``the awful discretion which a court of impeachment must necessarily have, to doom to honor or to infamy the most confidential and the most distinguished characters of the community.'' 
   Those words should weigh heavily upon us. But while the gravity of our task is humbling, the genius of our Constitution is ennobling; for we deliberate not under the imposing shadow cast by the exceptional men who framed this Nation, but in the illuminating light of their wisdom. 
   Impeachment was designed by the Framers to be a circuitbreaker to protect the Republic, when ``checks and balances'' would not contain the darker vagaries of human nature. Impeachment empowers the Senate--under the most extraordinary of circumstances--to step outside its legislative role, reach into the executive branch, and remove a popularly elected President. 
   Impeachment was not, however, devised as an adjunct or independent arm of prosecution. It is not for the U.S. Senate to find solely whether the President committed statutory violations. 
   Rather, we have a larger question--whether there is evidence that persuades us, in my view beyond a reasonable doubt, that the President's offenses constitute high crimes and misdemeanors that require his removal. 
   Here is the precise point of our challenge--to give particular meaning to the elusive phrase, ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' This task is critical, because impeachment is not so much a definition, as it is a judgment in a particular case--a judgment based not upon an exact or universal moral standard--but upon a contemporary and historical assessment of interest and need. 
   ``High crimes and misdemeanors'' speak to offenses that go to the heart of matters of governance, social authority, and institutional power--offenses that, in Hamilton's words, ``relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.'' 
   And these crimes must be of such magnitude that the American people need protection, not by the traditional means of civil or criminal law--but by the extraordinary act of removing their duly elected President. 
   For removal is not intended simply to be a remedy; it is intended to be the remedy. The only remedy by which the people--whose core interests are meaningfully threatened by the President's conduct--can be effectively protected. 
   This, to me, is what President Woodrow Wilson meant when he referred to ``nothing short of the grossest offenses against the plain law of the land.'' This, to me, is what Framer George Mason meant when he emphasized ``great and dangerous offenses.'' 
   So in determining whether this President has committed a ``great and dangerous offense'' requiring removal, we must first weigh all of the credible evidence to identify which acts were actually committed. Then, we must assess the gravity or degree of the misconduct. This process requires that we review the acts from their origin, and the circumstances in their totality. 
   The allegations in article I do not paint a pretty picture. Indeed, we are all struggling with having to reconcile the President's lowly conduct with the Constitution's high standards. And we should all be concerned with the minimal threshold that he has set, and the poor example he has created for leadership in this country. 
   The President himself admits he gave evasive and incomplete testimony. He admits he worked hard to evade the truth. He admits he misled advisers, Congress, and the Nation. And he looked all of America in the eye--wagging his finger in mock moral indignation when he did it. 
   The fact is, the truth is not our servant. The truth does not exist to be summoned only when expedient. And I find his attempts to contort the truth profoundly disturbing. A President should inspire our most noble aspirations. Unfortunately, he has fueled our darkest cynicisms. 
   And I resent the ordeal he has put this country through--and we should make no mistake about it--whatever else may be said, we are here today because of the President's actions. I resent the shadow he has cast on what should be--and I feel still is--an honorable profession; public service. And I think all of us who take our oaths to heart should resent it. 
   Finally, as a woman who has fought long and hard for sexual harassment laws, I resent that the President has undermined our progress. No matter how consensual this relationship was, it involved a man in a position of tremendous power, with authority over a 21-year-old female subordinate, in the workplace--and not just any workplace. He has shaken the principles of these laws to their core and it saddens me deeply. 
   But as I work my way through my distaste, my dismay, and my disappointment, I return to the discipline that the Constitution imposes upon us as triers of fact. My job here is to review the evidence, and to measure that evidence against my standard of proof, and the constitutional standard of high crimes and misdemeanors. 
   So let's look at the evidence. Article I does not go to perjury about the underlying relationship--that charge was dismissed by the House. Instead, the article before us alleges perjury based on statements about statements about conduct. Unfortunately, what this comes down to is a case of ``perjury once removed''--an inherently tenuous charge. 
   As triers of fact, we are asked under article I not to find whether the President lied, but whether he committed the specifically defined act of perjury. Here, the law is clear that there must be proof that an untruth was told; that it was told willfully; and that it was told about a subject matter material to the case. These are the hard rules of the statute. 
   In this instance, article I alleges perjury in statements the President made explaining the nature and details of the relationship. Significantly, the underlying subject matter of most of these statements was ruled irrelevant and inadmissable in the underlying civil case that was itself dismissed and settled. To me, these facts undermine the materiality of these statements. 
   Article I also alleges perjury in the President's statements explaining his concealment of that relationship. Here, I find insufficient evidence of the requisite untruth and the requisite intent. Given, again, that we are talking here about ``perjury once removed,'' I cannot conclude that the President is guilty on article I. 
   As I look at article II, I have similar concerns and conflicts. Are there any among us who can look at the disturbing pattern that has been laid out for us and not be deeply troubled? 
   Just look at the allegations. The President may have influenced the filing of an affidavit. The President may have initiated the concealment of potential evidence. And the President may have accelerated a job search, in hopes of influencing a witness. 
   But for all of this, there is only circumstantial evidence. Despite a 64,000  page record and countless hours of argument and testimony, there is no direct evidence supporting any of these allegations. 
   To the contrary, where there is direct evidence, the testimony is against the allegations. Indeed, not one witness with firsthand knowledge has come forward since the beginning of this matter to corroborate the charges. So, while I can draw inferences from the evidence, I cannot draw conclusions beyond a reasonable doubt. 
   The Framers clearly prescribed caution when measuring high crimes, and such caution is all the more important when a case rests on purely circumstantial evidence. Mindful of this caution, I still find that one allegation stands out from the rest; the President's attempt to influence the potential testimony of his personal assistant. 
   Let's look at the facts. In the President's civil deposition, the President suggested, at least three times, that the attorneys should ask questions of his personal assistant. At the end of the deposition, the judge reminded him of the confidentiality order not to discuss the testimony with others. 
   Within 2 1/2 hours, the President called his personal assistant to arrange a rare Sunday meeting. At that meeting, the President disclosed to her the contents of his deposition. In a manner that all but reveals the President's motives, he included in his discussion with her false statements about the circumstances of his relationship. Indeed, she would later testify that she believed the President sought her agreement with those statements he was posing. 
   Consider this critical exchange in the testimony of the President's assistant: 
   She was asked, ``Would it be fair to say then--based on the way he stated it and the demeanor he was using at the time he stated it to you--that he wished you to agree to that statement?'' The President's assistant nodded. She was then asked, ``And you're nodding your head yes, is that correct?'' And she answered, ``That's correct.'' 
   And he again violated the gag order when he revisited these statements with her several days later. 
   As an experienced lawyer, the President knew that, by the force of his own testimony, he made his assistant a potential witness. 
   As a former State attorney general, the President knew he was violating the confidentiality order when he spoke with her. 
   As a defendant who repeatedly named his assistant, the President knew that his assistant would be subpoenaed. 
   And she was subpoenaed just 3 days later. But even if she hadn't, the President did not need absolute or direct knowledge that his assistant would testify. Under the law of obstruction, which, unlike perjury, does not expressly require materiality, he only had to know that she could offer relevant facts. 
   Make no mistake about it, I find the President's behavior deplorable and indefensible. 
   If I were a supporter, I would abandon him. If I were a newspaper editor, I would denounce him. If I were an historian, I would condemn him. If I were a criminal prosecutor, I would charge him. If I were a grand juror, I would indict him. And if I were a juror in a standard criminal case, I would convict him of attempting to unlawfully influence a potential witness under title 18 of the United States Code. 
   However, I stand here today as a U.S. Senator, in an impeachment trial, with but one decision--does the President's misconduct, even if deplorable, represent such an egregious and immediate threat to the very structure of our Government that the Constitution requires his removal? 
   To answer this broad question, we need to ask several finer questions. 
   Do the people believe that their liberties are so threatened that he should not serve his remaining 23 months? Is the President's violation on par with treason and bribery? What are the inescapable and unprecedented effects of removing a duly elected President? And can the President's wrongdoing be more effectively remedied by criminal prosecution, in a standard court of law, after he leaves office? 
   These are the questions which drive our consideration of the ``gravity'' and ``degree'' of the President's conduct. To this end, I return to the words of another Maine Senator, William Pitt Fessenden, who during the Andrew Johnson trial said that removal must ``be exercised with extreme caution'' and in ``extreme cases.'' It must, he said, ``address itself to the country and the civilized world as a measure justly called for by the gravity of the crime.......'' 
   In this case, I understand how reasonable minds could differ, for I have struggled long and hard with my own decision. 
   But the Constitution tempers our passion and measures our judgment. And the Constitution requires each of us to determine not just whether the President violated a statute. For had the Framers intended the offenses charged in this case to require removal in any and all circumstances, they would have specifically included them in the impeachment provisions of the Constitution. 
   Because they did not, we are compelled to ask ourselves whether the nature and circumstances of his conduct are such that we have no choice but to inflict upon him what one of the House managers called ``the political equivalent of the death penalty.'' 
   If I could conclude that this President's conduct is of that nature, I would vote to remove him. Because if there is one thing I've learned throughout my 25 years in elective office, it is that the really tough decisions leave us with but one choice--doing what we know to be right and true. 
   In this instance, among the seven allegations charged in article II, I have only been persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the President committed one of them. After due consideration of all the factual circumstances relating to this one finding, and the constitutional dictates and implications of this matter as a whole, I am persuaded that the President's wrongdoing can and should be effectively addressed by the additional remedy expressly provided by the Framers in the Constitution--namely, trial before a standard criminal court. And I am further persuaded that future Presidents, and future generations can be effectively deterred from such wrongdoing by this impeachment and a potential prosecution. 
   The President's behavior has damaged the Office of the Presidency, the Nation, and everyone involved in this matter. There are only two potential victims left--the Senate and the Constitution--and I am firmly resolved to allow neither to join the ranks of the aggrieved. 
   From the day I swore my oath of impartiality, I determined that the only way I could approach this case was to ask myself one question, ``if I were the deciding vote in this case, could I remove this President under these circumstances?'' The answer, I have concluded, is ``no''--and therefore, I will vote against both articles of impeachment. 
   Mr. Chief Justice, I came to this process with an open notebook and an open mind, determined to honor my oath to do impartial justice and serve the best interests of the Presidency, the American people, and the Nation. I stand confident that in doing so, my manner has been impartial, and my judgment has been measured. Therefore, in my mind and in my heart, I believe to a moral certainty that my verdict is just. 
   As men and women of honor, that is the highest expectation to which we can aspire. For we are writing history with indelible ink, but imperfect pens. 
   In the end, when future generations dust off the record of what we have done here, may they say we validated the Framers' faith in the Senate. May they say we reached within ourselves to discover our most noble intentions. And may they say we achieved a conclusion worthy not just of our time, but of all time.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished colleagues, let me begin by expressing my appreciation to the Chief Justice for his wisdom, for his infinite patience, and for conferring upon this body the judicial temperament envisioned by the Framers. 
   I would also like to commend both the Senate majority and minority leaders for upholding the dignity of this body, by preserving judiciousness and fairness, and maintaining bipartisanship and civility. 
   Colleagues, we have arrived at a juncture in our public lives that will largely define our place before the judgment of history, and I think it will be said that justice and the Constitution were well served. 
   Indeed, the consequences of our decision are manifest in the words of Alexander Hamilton, who wrote of ``the awful discretion which a court of impeachment must necessarily have, to doom to honor or to infamy the most confidential and the most distinguished characters of the community.'' 
   Those words should weigh heavily upon us. But while the gravity of our task is humbling, the genius of our Constitution is ennobling; for we deliberate not under the imposing shadow cast by the exceptional men who framed this Nation, but in the illuminating light of their wisdom. 
   Impeachment was designed by the Framers to be a circuitbreaker to protect the Republic, when ``checks and balances'' would not contain the darker vagaries of human nature. Impeachment empowers the Senate--under the most extraordinary of circumstances--to step outside its legislative role, reach into the executive branch, and remove a popularly elected President. 
   Impeachment was not, however, devised as an adjunct or independent arm of prosecution. It is not for the U.S. Senate to find solely whether the President committed statutory violations. 
   Rather, we have a larger question--whether there is evidence that persuades us, in my view beyond a reasonable doubt, that the President's offenses constitute high crimes and misdemeanors that require his removal. 
   Here is the precise point of our challenge--to give particular meaning to the elusive phrase, ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' This task is critical, because impeachment is not so much a definition, as it is a judgment in a particular case--a judgment based not upon an exact or universal moral standard--but upon a contemporary and historical assessment of interest and need. 
   ``High crimes and misdemeanors'' speak to offenses that go to the heart of matters of governance, social authority, and institutional power--offenses that, in Hamilton's words, ``relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.'' 
   And these crimes must be of such magnitude that the American people need protection, not by the traditional means of civil or criminal law--but by the extraordinary act of removing their duly elected President. 
   For removal is not intended simply to be a remedy; it is intended to be the remedy. The only remedy by which the people--whose core interests are meaningfully threatened by the President's conduct--can be effectively protected. 
   This, to me, is what President Woodrow Wilson meant when he referred to ``nothing short of the grossest offenses against the plain law of the land.'' This, to me, is what Framer George Mason meant when he emphasized ``great and dangerous offenses.'' 
   So in determining whether this President has committed a ``great and dangerous offense'' requiring removal, we must first weigh all of the credible evidence to identify which acts were actually committed. Then, we must assess the gravity or degree of the misconduct. This process requires that we review the acts from their origin, and the circumstances in their totality. 
   The allegations in article I do not paint a pretty picture. Indeed, we are all struggling with having to reconcile the President's lowly conduct with the Constitution's high standards. And we should all be concerned with the minimal threshold that he has set, and the poor example he has created for leadership in this country. 
   The President himself admits he gave evasive and incomplete testimony. He admits he worked hard to evade the truth. He admits he misled advisers, Congress, and the Nation. And he looked all of America in the eye--wagging his finger in mock moral indignation when he did it. 
   The fact is, the truth is not our servant. The truth does not exist to be summoned only when expedient. And I find his attempts to contort the truth profoundly disturbing. A President should inspire our most noble aspirations. Unfortunately, he has fueled our darkest cynicisms. 
   And I resent the ordeal he has put this country through--and we should make no mistake about it--whatever else may be said, we are here today because of the President's actions. I resent the shadow he has cast on what should be--and I feel still is--an honorable profession; public service. And I  think all of us who take our oaths to heart should resent it. 
   Finally, as a woman who has fought long and hard for sexual harassment laws, I resent that the President has undermined our progress. No matter how consensual this relationship was, it involved a man in a position of tremendous power, with authority over a 21-year-old female subordinate, in the workplace--and not just any workplace. He has shaken the principles of these laws to their core and it saddens me deeply. 
   But as I work my way through my distaste, my dismay, and my disappointment, I return to the discipline that the Constitution imposes upon us as triers of fact. My job here is to review the evidence, and to measure that evidence against my standard of proof, and the constitutional standard of high crimes and misdemeanors. 
   So let's look at the evidence. Article I does not go to perjury about the underlying relationship--that charge was dismissed by the House. Instead, the article before us alleges perjury based on statements about statements about conduct. Unfortunately, what this comes down to is a case of ``perjury once removed''--an inherently tenuous charge.

Here, the law is clear that there must be proof that an untruth was told; that it was told willfully; and that it was told about a subject matter material to the case.

Significantly, the underlying subject matter of most of these statements was ruled irrelevant and inadmissable in the underlying civil case that was itself dismissed and settled. To me, these facts undermine the materiality of these statements. 
   Article I also alleges perjury in the President's statements explaining his concealment of that relationship. Here, I find insufficient evidence of the requisite untruth and the requisite intent. Given, again, that we are talking here about ``perjury once removed,'' I cannot conclude that the President is guilty on article I.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which will establish a mandatory minimum sentence for State crimes involving the use of a firearm. This bill also imposes work requirements for prisoners and prohibits the government from providing such amenities as televisions, stereos, or other amenities in the cell of any inmate. 
   As a staunch supporter of the 2nd Amendment, I believe laws are needed to punish criminals, without imposing on a law-abiding person's right to own a firearm. This legislation would not apply to individuals who use a firearm in self-defense. It applies only to criminals who are convicted of committing a crime of violence which is punishable for a year in jail. Because it is not illegal to defend oneself, individuals who use firearms in self-defense are not subject to the provisions of this bill, nor would they be incarcerated for a year or more for properly defending themselves. This bill states clearly that the sentences apply only after a criminal is convicted of a crime. As such, this bill poses absolutely no threat to individuals who use firearms legally, including as a means to defend themselves. 
   The most important domestic function of the Federal government is the protection of the personal security of individual Americans through the enactment and enforcement of laws against criminal behavior. Tough Federal laws, such as mandatory minimum prison sentences for violent crimes committed with a firearm and truth-in-sentencing, would serve as deterrents to persons who might be disposed to commit violent crimes. 
   It is also important to keep in mind, the penalties of this bill apply only after a criminal has been convicted, they are not available to a prosecutor until after the state investigation has been completed and the case is closed. Therefore, federal law enforcement agencies are given no role in the state's investigation and no authority in state jurisdictions. This prevents Federal  Agencies from imposing itself on the jurisdictions of the states. In addition, my bill clearly states that the bill is not intended to supplant the efforts of states to curtail violent crime and that the Attorney General must given ``due deference'' to state and local prosecutors in their work. 
   This legislation is also needed to ensure prisons remain punitive and do not digress further into vacation locations. With passage of this legislation, the Attorney General will implement and enforce regulations mandating prison work for all able-bodied inmates in Federal correctional institutions. These regulations will also prohibit the Federal Government from providing televisions, radios, stereos, and other similar amenities in the cell of any inmate. 
   I would encourage my colleagues, who are serious about combating crime, to join me as a co-sponsor of this important legislation.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am submitting a concurrent resolution which calls for a United States effort to end the restrictions on the freedoms and violations of the human rights of the enclaved people in the occupied portion of Cyprus. I have introduced this legislation in the past, and I regret that these concerns are still with us. 
   Mr. President, I am aware that developments on Cyprus are not known to most Americans. Yet if I were to tell them that a small nation has had part of its land illegally occupied by a neighboring state for over 23 years, I know they would be both shocked and outraged. 
   The 23 years since the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus have seen the end of the cold war, the collapse of the USSR, free elections in South Africa and a reunited Germany. Yet while the line through the heart of Berlin is gone, the line through the heart of Cyprus remains. 
   Over two decades ago, Turkey's brutal invasion drove more than 200,000 Cypriots from their homes. Turkey still controls about one-third of the island of Cyprus and maintains about 30,000 troops there. However, there remains, in northern Cyprus, a small remnant of 497 enclaved Greek-Cypriots. The reason they are referred to as the enclaved of Cyprus is that during the fighting in 1974 they mostly resided in remote enclaves and therefore were not able to flee the fighting and thus were not immediately expelled. 
   Mr. President, I believe that this resolution is important in serving to bring to the attention of the American people and the world community, the hardships and restrictions endured by these enclaved individuals. 
   In 1975, representatives of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities agreed that the Greek-Cypriots in the northern part of the island were to be given every help to lead a normal life. Twenty-two years later this is still not the case. 
   The presence of the Turkish-Cypriot police in the lives of the enclaved Greek-Cypriots is constant, and there are restrictions on land travel. Other human rights restrictions and deprivations include: Restrictions on private telephones; Restrictions on hand-carried mail and newspapers; Difficulties in receiving full educational opportunities; Restricted access to and religious use of the monastery at Apostolos Andreas; A requirement that enclaved males aged 18-50 must report once a week to those in control; and A lack of investigation with regard to harassment, beating, rape and murder. 
   Mr. President, this situation calls out for justice. By bringing these human rights violations to the attention of the American people, it is my hope, that we can bring the plight of these people to the World's attention. My resolution urges the President to undertake efforts to end the restrictions on the freedoms and human rights of the enclaved people. I will remain actively involved in this issue  until their rights and freedoms are restored. 
   This is the least we can do for these people. While this resolution addresses the plight of the enclaved people of Cyprus, work must not cease on efforts to bring about a withdrawal of Turkish forces and a restoration of Cyprus' sovereignty over the entire island with the full respect of the rights of all Cypriots. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

    Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution in support of veterans suffering from Alzheimer's disease. 
   When I first came to Congress 20 years ago, not a single piece of legislation devoted to Alzheimer's disease had even been introduced. We have come a long way since then, as today Alzheimer's is a household word. It is also the most expensive uninsured illness in America. That is why I recently introduced legislation to allow families to deduct the cost of home care and adult day and respite care provided to a family member suffering from Alzheimer's disease. 
   The resolution I am submitting today is targeted to the challenges faced by veterans suffering from Alzheimer's disease and their families. I worked closely with the Maine Department of the Veterans of Foreign Wars [VFW] of the United States on this approach, after learning of the prevalence of this disorder in the veterans population in Maine and nationwide, and the need to improve treatment regimes. 
   The resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that in authorizing veterans medical facility projects, such as nursing homes, Congress should authorize projects for facilities in urban and rural areas specifically designed to treat veterans with Alzheimer's disease and conducting research into the disorder. 
   The resolution also expresses support for innovation in the methods used by VA personnel in treating veterans with Alzheimer's disease, and encourages the sharing of information on Alzheimer's disease among VA facilities and health care personnel. 
   Facilities authorized under this bill would provide a model for existing VA nursing homes that treat Alzheimer's disease and future homes dedicated exclusively to the treatment of Alzheimer's. These specially designed homes will formulate new protocols for the treatment of this devastating condition. 
   Currently, veterans homes have an average of 30 percent Alzheimer's patients. Serious questions have been raised concerning whether it is appropriate to treat this disorder in the traditional nursing home setting. Yet, the VA does not operate any facilities exclusively targeted at Alzheimer's disease, and the VA budget for construction funds for veterans nursing homes does not authorize construction of any unique long-term care projects. Authorizing the VA to explore new ways of treating Alzheimer's disease will enable the Department, which administers one of the largest health care networks in the country, to prepare for the future, when the aging of the veterans population is expected to hinder the ability of traditional veterans homes to care for Alzheimer's patients. 
   One of the most important components of this resolution is that a demonstration facility authorized by Congress will give the VA the freedom to design new and more effective protocols for treating Alzheimer's patients--including new approaches to care, administration, staffing, quality assurance, and other issues. Facilities are currently forced to comply with existing long-term care regulations, laws, building codes, and traditional medical models, which are often not compatible with the unique needs of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease. 
   Advances made by facilities designed specifically to treat veterans with Alzheimer's will ultimately benefit all those who suffer with this disorder. Therefore, Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to give the administration an incentive for developing a more coherent foreign policy by pooling the defense, diplomatic, intelligence, and economic resources of the federal government. 
   I have labeled this bill the Prevention and Deterrence of International Conflict Act--``PREDICT''--because the Clinton Administration failed or willfully suspended its ability to anticipate a string of foreign calamities last year. 
   The 1998 calendar of global surprises for the United States revealed the continuing challenge to this administration of analyzing evidence adequately for the President to act against the aggressive military actions of India, Pakistan, North Korea, Yugoslavia, and Iraq. 
   Although we had satellite images and early warning signs, the second series of nuclear explosions by India in May eluded the detection of the intelligence authorities. 
   Although we had the campaign pledges of India's Prime Minister to expand the country's nuclear program, no one took them as an omen of action. 
   Although we had differing agency assessments of whether the export of commercial satellite technologies posed the risk of improving China's military communications capabilities, the president never saw them. 
   Although Pentagon officials told the Senate Armed Services Committee on August 24, 1998 that the intelligence community could detect in advance any launching of a multiple-stage rocket by North Korea, they professed surprise as a Taepo Dong missile soared over Japan seven days later. 
   And although we had indicators that the simmering conflict in Kosovo could unravel into a major Balkan security crisis, we did not know who led or supplied the provincial insurgency movement. 
   Furthermore, before finally approving military action against Iraq last month, the White House had lurched towards two previous strikes only to call off the missiles after Saddam Hussein opened his seven-year old script to repeat the hollow lines that he would cooperate with the U.N. on his own terms in his own time. 
   These examples highlight a pattern of fragmentation in the decision-making apparatus of the Executive Branch. Information that could tilt the course of a crisis too often remains hidden or undiscovered in the flow of advice to the White House. 
   Beyond this disjointed process of making policy, the other critical issue tying together these episodes of tension centers on the threat of weapons  proliferation fueled by unresolved civil conflicts or the ambitions of regional tyrants. 
   The uncertain political status of the territory of Kashmir, for example, served as a convenient excuse for Indian officials to justify their nuclear testing last Spring. At the same time, the Pakistanis cited national prestige and the need to stabilize the governing coalition, rather than any threat of attack, in explaining their nuclear response to India's provocation. 
   In both of these cases, political judgments overshadowed sober considerations of whether the two nations posed immediate military risks to one another. 
   Yet China's hunger for technology, Mr. President, derives less from an ongoing civil conflict than it does from a military establishment eager to develop the precision capabilities used by the United States during the Persian Gulf War. 
   These capabilities, in turn, will gradually advance Beijing's quest to displace the United States and Japan as the dominant Asia-Pacific power. 
   The PREDICT bill, therefore, brings together the broad range of foreign policy experts throughout the government into one Federal Task Force on Regional Threats to International Security. The Federal Task Force would include representatives of the Departments of State, Defense, and Commerce, as well as military and foreign intelligence organizations, to advise the president in three categories: 
   How the United States can foster diplomatic resolutions of regional disputes that increase the risk of weapons proliferation; 
   Trade and investment programs to promote the market-based development of countries that pursue or possess weapons of mass destruction; 
   And the implementation of intelligence analysis procedures to ensure that the president has all of the data necessary before he makes any decision regarding this category of arms. 
   The President must establish the Task Force no later than 60 days after the effective date of the law, and the panel's authority would expire on October 1, 2001 unless an executive order or an act of Congress renews the operating charter. 
   PREDICT, therefore, outlines a clear and comprehensive process for foreign policy development without prejudging what steps the President should take. He must create the Task Force. He must consider the information that it presents, and he must determine whether to accept it. After two years, both the administration and Congress can judge the record of the Task Force to decide whether it should continue to function. 
   What this legislation proposes that does not exist is an integrated advisory body to analyze the military, diplomatic, and economic options available to the president for controlling regional conflicts and the spread of weapons of mass destruction. 
   Further more, the Task Force deliberately includes intelligence representatives so that policy options reflect the most updated information on the intentions of foreign leaders and the capabilities of their armed forces. 
   A comprehensive perspective remains central to the execution of prudent foreign policies. The administration needs to harness the talent and expertise of the federal government to ensure that the regional civil, military, and political disputes fostering weapons proliferation do not present a sustained threat to international security. For this compelling reason, I urge Congress to renew America's national security organizations by passing the PREDICT Act.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation I introduced late in the 105th Congress to address a serious health concern for veterans--specifically the health threat posed by the Hepatitis C virus. 
   The legislation I am introducing today would make Hepatitis C a service-connected condition so that veterans suffering from this virus can be treated by the VA. The bill will establish a presumption of service connection for veterans with Hepatitis C, meaning that the Department of Veterans Affairs will assume that this condition was incurred or aggravated in military service, provided that certain conditions are met. 
   Under this legislation, veterans who received a transfusion of blood during a period of service before December 31, 1992; veterans who were exposed to blood during a period of service; veterans who underwent hemodyalisis during a period of service; veterans diagnosed with unexplained liver disease during a period of service; veterans with an unexplained liver dysfunction value or test; or veterans working in a health care occupation during service, will be eligible for treatment for this condition at VA facilities. 
   I have reviewed medical research that suggests many veterans were exposed to Hepatitis C in service and are now suffering from liver and other diseases caused by exposure to the virus. I am troubled that many ``Hepatitis C veterans'' are not being treated by the VA because they can't prove the virus was service connected, despite the fact that Hepatitis C was little known and could not be tested for until recently. 
   Mr. President, we are learning that those who served in Vietnam and other conflicts, tend to have higher than average rates of Hepatitis C. In fact, VA data shows that 20 percent of its inpatient population is infected with the Hepatitis C virus, and some studies have found that 10 percent of otherwise healthy Vietnam Veterans are Hepatitis C positive. 
   Hepatitis C was not isolated until 1989, and the test for the virus has only been available since 1990. Hepatitis C is a hidden infection with few symptoms. However, most of those infected with the virus will develop serious liver disease 10 to 30 years after contracting it. For many of those infected, Hepatitis C can lead to liver failure, transplants, liver cancer, and death. 
   And yet, most people who have Hepatitis C don't even know it--and often do not get treatment until it's too late. Only five percent of the estimated four million Americans with Hepatitis C know they have it, yet with new treatments, some estimates indicate that 50 percent may have the virus eradicated. 
   Vietnam Veterans in particular are just now starting to learn that they have liver disease caused by Hepatitis C. Early detection and treatment may help head off serious liver disease for many of them. However, many veterans with Hepatitis C will not be treated by the VA because they must meet a standard that is virtually impossible to meet in order to establish a service connection for their condition--this in spite of the fact that we now know that many Vietnam-era and other veterans got this disease serving their country. 
   Many of my colleagues may be interested to know how veterans were exposed to this virus. Many veterans received blood transfusions while in Vietnam. This is one of the most common ways Hepatitis C is transmitted. Medical transmission of the virus through needles and other medical equipment is also possible in combat. Medical care providers in the services were likely at increased risk as well, and may have, in turn, posed a risk to the service members they treated. 
   Researchers have discovered that Hepatitis C was widespread in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam war, and that some blood sent from the U.S. was also infected with the virus. Researchers and veterans organizations, including the Vietnam Veterans of America, with whom I worked closely to prepare this legislation, believe that many veterans were infected after being injured in combat and getting a transfusion or from working as a medic around combat injuries. 
   The Hepatitis C infected veteran is essentially in a catch 22 situation: the VA will not introduce any flexibility into their established service connection requirements--and many veterans cannot prove that they contracted Hepatitis C in combat because the science to detect it did not until recently. Without legislative authority to treat these veterans, thousands of veterans infected with Hepatitis C in service will not get the VA health care testing or treatment they need. 
   Mr. President, I believe the government will actually save money in the long run by testing and treating this infection early on. The 
   alternative is  much more costly treatment of end-stage liver disease and the associated complications, or other disorders.s 
   Some will argue that further epidemiologic data is needed to resolve or prove the issue of service connection. I agree that we have our work cut out for us, and further study is required. However, there is already a substantial body of research on the relationship between Hepatitis C and military service. While further research is being conducted, we should not ask those who have already sacrificed so much for this country to wait--perhaps for years--for the treatment they deserve. 
   Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, well respected both within and outside of the medical profession, has said, ``In some studies of veterans entering the Department of Veterans Affairs health facilities, half of the veterans have tested positive for HCV. Some of these veterans may have left the military with HCV infection, while others may have developed it after their military service. In any event, we need to detect and treat HCV infection if we are to head off very high rates of liver disease and liver transplant in VA facilities over the next decade. I believe this effort should include HCV testing as part of the discharge physical in the military, and entrance screening for veterans entering the VA health system.'' 
   Veterans have already fought their share of battles--these men and women who sacrificed in war so that others could live in peace shouldn't have to fight again for the benefits and respect they have earned. 
   We still have a long way to go before we know how best to confront this deadly virus. A comprehensive policy to confront such a monumental challenge cannot be written overnight. It will require the long-term commitment of Congress and the Administration to a serious effort to address this health concern. 
   I hope this legislation will be a constructive step in this effort, and I look forward to working with the Veterans Affairs Committee, the VA-HUD appropriators, Vietnam Veterans of America, and others to meet this emerging challenge.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that will restore an important benefit for our nation's veterans--disability compensation benefits for those with tobacco-related illnesses or disabilities. 
   The President's budget proposal for FY99 restricted disability compensation benefits for tobacco-related illnesses, such as lung cancer. I might ask, once we start restricting service-related disabilities treated through the VA, where does it end? I am very concerned that the VA will become a target for further erosions of veterans benefits. The VA is already having difficulty making good on its promise to provide essential benefits to veterans. What benefit will be repealed next? 
   Some may argue that military personnel made the decision to smoke. Nobody forced them. But this ignores that fact that these choices were facilitated, and perhaps even encouraged, by the inclusion of free cigarettes in individual supply kits and discounts on tobacco products. Many military personnel may have smoked for the first time while on active duty. 
   That is why I have fought to restore veterans disability compensation for tobacco-related illnesses and disability--because I believe that Congress circumvented the process and undermined fairness when it repealed this benefit to fund the ISTEA legislation. 
   Mr. President, there should have been a full airing of this issue before we voted to rescind the benefit. There was little debate on the Senate floor on this matter. This is not how those brave Americans who sacrificed for freedom should be treated by the government they fought to preserve. 
   During the Senate's consideration of the FY99 Budget Resolution, I opposed efforts to repeal the benefit and voted for an amendment to sustain it. In addition, I supported an amendment submitted by Senator MCCAIN to the tobacco bill providing $600 million over five years to veterans for smoking-related diseases and health care. Finally, during the Senate's consideration of the FY99 VA-HUD Appropriations Act, I supported an amendment to restore the benefit. Unfortunately, this amendment was rejected 54-40. I continue to believe we should debate the matter fully, we should have a vote, and we should pass legislation that will right this wrong. 
   We must not ignore the fact that the military has been one of the largest distributors of tobacco products for decades. The military glamorized the use of tobacco and distributed free cigarettes during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. We cannot turn a blind eye to this lethal legacy. We must not turn our backs on those who continue to suffer the consequences of their service. That is why I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this effort, and restore this important benefit.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce on behalf of myself and Mr. JEFFORDS the Advancing Truth and Accountability in Campaign Communications Act of 1999, or ATACC, which represents an effort to attack the problem of stealth advocacy advertising in federal elections and shine the spotlight of disclosure on those who would attempt to fly under the radar screen of our campaign finance laws. 
   Before I begin, I want to thank and commend Senator JEFFORDS for all his valuable input and hard work in helping to craft this legislation, which was originally introduced as an amendment last year to the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill. And I want to thank Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD themselves, who encouraged our efforts. 
   In the past several elections, we've seen a proliferation of advertisements over the airwaves which cloak themselves in the innocuous guise of ``issue advocacy'', or voter education. The sponsors of these ads would have us believe that they are performing a public service by running these ads, and do not intend for them to affect the outcome of federal elections. They claim that because they do not use words like ``vote for'', or ``vote against'', they are exempt from federal campaign finance laws. They even argue that no one has the right simply to know who is sponsoring the ads. 
   And yet, these ads say things like: ``Mr. X promised he'd be different. But he's just another Washington politician. Why during the last year alone, he has taken over $260,000 from corporate special interest groups........But is he listening to us anymore?'' 
   I defy anyone to argue, with a straight face, that that message is anything other than a blatant attempt to influence a federal election. And yet, under current law, any person, labor union, or corporation, has a right to run such ads without even disclosing the most basic information, such as who they are, or how much they are spending. And that is just plain wrong. 
   During the 1996 elections, the Annenberg Public Policy Center estimates that anywhere between $135 million and $150 million was spent by third party groups not associated with candidates' campaigns on such radio and television ads. I say ``estimates'' because we really don't know for sure. There is no official record kept, nor is anyone required to submit the kind of information needed to keep such records. 
   And lest there be any doubt of the real intent of these ads, the Annenburg Report found that nearly 87 percent of them mentioned a candidate for office by name, and over 41 percent were seen by the public as ``pure attack'' ads--that's the highest percentage recorded among a group that also included Presidential ads, debates, free-time segments accorded candidates, and news programs. 
   If anything, not surprisingly, the problem got worse in the 1997-1998 election cycle. The Annenberg Center has completed their study of this time period, and has determined that issue ad spending in the last cycle doubled the amount spent in 1995 through 1996--to total between $275 and $340 million. Of those ads, over 53 percent mentioned candidates by name during the cycle--a number which rose to over 80 percent in the final two months. Further, 51.5 percent of issue ads aired after September 1, 1998, were pure attack ads in terms of their content. At least 77 groups ran broadcast issue ads in 1997 and 1998. 
   As Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute has stated, ``(These are) conservative number(s), since there is no disclosure of (these) media buys or other spending.'' To put this in perspective, 1998 was the first billion dollar election--meaning that about a quarter of the money spent was on what I call ``stealth advocacy'' advertising. One quarter of all the money spent--which the Annenberg Center estimates is roughly equivalent to what candidates themselves spent on their own campaigns--was unaccounted for, unreportable and unregulated in any fashion. And, as Norm Ornstein has pointed out, 1998 was an ``off-year'', and ``without campaign reform, we can probably look forward to the $2 billion or $3 billion election in 2000, with a half-billion of it disguised as issue advocacy.'' 
   Let me explain how this bill will get to the core of this problem; how it works; and why it is much more likely to pass court muster than previous attempts to get at this issue. 
   The premise of this bill was developed in consultation with noted constitutional scholars and reformers such as Norm Ornstein; Josh Rosenkrantz, Director of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU; and others. The approach is a straightforward, two tiered one that only applies to advertisements that constitute the most blatant form of electioneering. 
   It only applies to ads run on radio or television, 30 days before a primary and 60 days before a general election, that identify a federal candidate. And only if over $10,000 is spent on such ads in a year. What is required is disclosure of the ads' sponsor and major donors, and a prohibition on the direct or indirect use of corporation or union money to fund the ads. 
   We called this new category ``electioneering ads''. They are the only communications addressed, and we define them very narrowly and carefully. 
   If the ad is not run on television or radio; if the ad is not aired within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election, if the ad doesn't mention a candidate's name or otherwise identify him clearly, if it isn't targeted at the candidate's electorate, or if a group hasn't spent more than $10,000 in that year on these ads, then it is not an electioneering ad. 
   If it is an item appearing in a news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through a broadcast station, it is also not an electioneering ad. Plain and simple. 
   If one does run an electioneering ad, two things happen. First, the sponsor must disclose the amount spent and the identity of contributors who donated more than $500 to the group since January 1 of the previous year. Right now, candidates have to disclose campaign contributions over $200. Second, the ad cannot be paid for by funds from a business corporation or labor union--only voluntary contributions. 
   The clear, narrow wording of the bill is important because it passes two critical First Amendment doctrines that were at the heart of the Supreme Court's landmark Buckley versus Valeo decision: vagueness and overbreadth. The rules of this provision are clear. And the requirements are strictly limited to ads run near an election that identify a candidate--ads plainly intended to convince voters to vote for or against a particular candidate. 
   Nothing in this bill restricts the right of any group to engage in issue advocacy. 
   For example, the following ad--which was actually run in 1996--would be completely unaffected by this bill. The text of the ad--which is a pure issue ad in the true sense of the term--says, ``This election year, America's children need your vote. Our public schools are our children's ticket to the future. But education has become just another target for attack by politicians who want huge cuts in education programs. They're making the wrong choices. Our children deserve leaders who will strengthen public education, not attack it. They deserve the best education we can give them. So this year, vote as if your children's future depends on it. It does.'' 
   That is not an electioneering ad, and that conclusion is not simply based on perception. It is based on the fact that it does not meet the clearly delineated criteria put forth in our bill, and therefore, exists completely outside the realm of this legislation. 
   For that matter, nothing prohibits groups from running electioneering ads, either. Let me be clear on this: if this bill becomes law, any group running issues ads today can still run issue ads in the future, with no restrictions on content. And any group running electioneering ads can still run those ads in the future, again with absolutely zero restrictions on content.  
   The argument that will no doubt be leveled by opponents to this approach--those advocates of secrecy who do not want the public to know who is financing these ads, and for how much--is that it is inconsistent with the First Amendment of the Constitution. This is simply not so, and that's not just my opinion. Constitutional scholars from Stanford Law to Georgia Law to Loyola Law to Vanderbilt Law have endorsed the approach of this bill. 
   The fact is, the only restrictions in the bill--namely, the use of union and corporation treasury money to pay for electioneering ads--are rooted in well-established case law that has long allowed for the regulation of the use of such money for electioneering purposes. Further, the threshold for disclosure is more than double what it is for candidates who receive contributions, and absolutely no disclosure is required whatsoever from any person or entity which spends less than $10,000. And it bears repeating that nothing in this bill affects any printed communications in any way, shape, or form--so voter guides are completely outside the universe of communications that are covered by this measure. 
   Mr. President, ATACC is a sensible, reasonable approach to attacking a burgeoning segment of electioneering that is making a mockery of our campaign finance system. I would ask my colleagues, how can anyone not be for disclosure? How can anyone say that less information for the public leads to better elections? Don't the American people have the right to know who is paying for these stealth advocacy ads, and how much? 
   Apparently, the majority of the Senate thought so. Last year, when this measure was approved as an amendment and incorporated into the McCain-Feingold legislation, the bill garnered 52 votes--bringing the majority of the Senate on board. Unfortunately, the will of the majority did not ultimately prevail, as we were unable to break the sixty votes necessary to end a threatened filibuster and institute real, fair and meaningful reform in the way in which American elections are financed. 
   But we have heard before that it can't be done, only to see the House of Representatives do it. Today, we have new members of this body--members who have seen first hand the effects these electioneering ads are having on campaigns and elections in this country, and I invite them to join with Senators JEFFORDS and I in supporting this bill. I would say to them that we, as candidates and Senators, are accountable to the people. We're required to file disclosure reports as candidates. PACs are required to disclose. But hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on these ads without one dime being reported. Not one dime. 
   Mr. President, I come to this debate as a veteran supporter of campaign finance reform. As someone who has served on Capitol Hill for twenty years, I understand the realities, and I know that there are concerns on both sides of the aisle that whatever measure we may ultimately pass, it must be fair, equitable, and constitutional. 
   This bill passes all three of these tests. And it represents one, significant step we might take to ensure that the first elections of the next century--the next millennium--are more open, more fair, and more representative of the will of the individual. That's what this bill is really all about, Mr. President. It's about putting elections back into the hands of individuals by letting them have the facts they need to make informed decisions, and by ensuring that electioneering ads are paid for by voluntary, individual contributions. 
   That's all, Mr. President. No plot to subvert the First Amendment. No scheme to silence any group or person. No plan to control what anyone says or when they say it. Just an honest, constitutionally sound attempt to bring some honesty and accountability back into electioneering advertising, and return some sense of confidence to the American people that their elections belong to them. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this sensible, incremental approach, and join in the fight to attack secrecy and promote honesty in campaign advertising.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation designed to help America's small business. This legislation will assist small businesses by requiring an estimate of the cost of a bill on small businesses before Congress enacts the legislation, and by creating an Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Small Business. 
   Small business is the driving force behind our economy, and in order to create jobs--both in my home State of Maine and across the Nation--we must encourage small businesses expansion. 
   Nationwide, an estimated 13 to 16 million small businesses represent over 99 percent of all employers. They also employ 52 percent of the workers, and 38 percent of workers in high-tech occupations. Small businesses account for virtually all of the net new jobs, and 51 percent of private sector output. 
   In my home State of Maine, of the 36,660 businesses with employees in 1997, 97.6 percent of the businesses were small businesses. Maine also boasts an estimated 71,000 self-employed persons. In terms of job growth, small businesses are credited with all of the net new jobs in a survey of job growth from 1992 to 1996. 
   Small businesses are the most successful tool we have for job creation. They provide a substantial majority of the initial job opportunities in this country, and are the original--and finest--job training program. Unfortunately, as much as small businesses help our own economy--and the Federal Government--by creating jobs and building economic growth, government often gets in the way. Instead of assisting small business, Government too often frustrates small business efforts. 
   Federal regulations create more than 1 billion hours of paperwork for small businesses each year, according to the Small Business Administration. Moreover, because of the size of some of the largest American corporations, U.S. commerce officials too often devote a 
   disproportionate amount of time to the needs and jobs in corporate America rather than in small businesses. 
   My legislation will address two problems facing our Nation's small businesses, and I hope it will both encourage small business expansion and fuel job creation. 
   One, this legislation will require a cost analysis legislative proposals before new requirements are passed on to small businesses. Too often, Congress approves well-intended legislation that shifts the costs of programs to small businesses. This proposal will help ensure that these unintended consequences are not passed along to small businesses. 
   According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, small business owners spend at least 1 billion hours a year filling out government paperwork, at an annual cost that exceeds $100 billion. Before we place yet another obstacle in the path of small business job creation, we should understand the costs our proposals will impose on small businesses. 
   This bill will require the Director of the Congressional Budget Office to prepare for each committee an analysis of the costs to small businesses that would be incurred in carrying out provisions contained in new legislation. This cost analysis will include an estimate of costs incurred in carrying out the bill or resolution for a 4-year period, as well as an estimate of the portion of these costs that would be borne by small businesses. This provision will allow us to fully consider the impact of  our actions on small businesses--and through careful planning, we may succeed in avoiding unintended costs. 
   Two, this legislation will direct the U.S. Trade Representative to establish a position of Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Small Business. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is overburdened, and too often overlooks the needs of small business. The new Assistant U.S. Trade Representative will promote exports by small businesses and work to remove foreign impediments to these exports. 
   Mr. President, I am convinced that this legislation will truly assist small businesses, resulting not only in additional entrepreneurial opportunities but also in new jobs. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am submitting two pieces of legislation to address some of the most critical issues affecting our relations with the United Nations--the U.S. arrearage in financial contributions to the United Nations, and sharing of intelligence information with the U.N. 
   The first bill, the United Nations Reform Act is a bill that I have been working on for several years beginning in my former capacity as chair of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on International Operations. With the United Nations now entering its second half-century, the question being raised is not whether the United Nations can continue its growth for another 50 years, but whether it can survive as an important international institution in the short term. 
   I believe we must genuinely restore a bipartisan consensus on the United Nations within Congress and among the American people. That is the intent of this legislation, which sets reasonable and achievable reform criteria for the United Nations, linked to a 5-year repayment plan for the arrearages that have build up on the U.N. system. 
   The plan would set up a five-step/five-year process under which the President would each year have to certify that specific reform guideposts have been met at the United Nations, permitting payment each year of one-fifth of outstanding U.S. arrearages. 
   In the first year, the President would have to certify that a hard freeze zero nominal growth budget at the United Nations had been maintained and that budgetary transparency at the world body had been enhanced through opening up the United Nations to member State auditing and fully funding the new U.N. inspector general office. 
   In the second year, the President would have to certify that U.S. representation had been restored to a key U.N. budgetary oversight body the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions [ACABQ]. 
   In the third year, the President would have to certify that a long-standing U.N. peacekeeping reform goal had been achieved. This reform would ensure that the United States receives full credit or reimbursement for the very substantial logistical and in-kind support our military provides to assessed U.N. peacekeeping missions. 
   In the fourth year, the President would have to certify that a significant reform in the United Nations' budget process had been achieved. This reform would be to divide the U.N. regular budget into an assessed core budget and a voluntary program budget. The source of much of the United Nations' problems stems from the fact that the United Nations' assessed budget is increasingly used for development programs and other activities that should not be included in our mandatory dues for membership. This reform can be achieved without a revision in the U.N. Charter. 
   Finally, in the fifth year the President would have to certify that a major U.N. consolidation plan has been approved and implemented. 
   This plan must entail a significant reduction in staff and an elimination of the rampant duplication, overlap, and lack of coordination that exists throughout the U.N. system. 
   Clearly, there is an urgent need to turn around the United Nations' dangerous slide into constant crisis, which could ultimately threaten the organization's usefulness as an important tool for addressing world problems. I am convinced that this can only be achieved through the kind of bold reform agenda that is set forth in this legislation. 
   Mr. President, I believe it is useful for us to look back on the original purpose of the United Nations, as it was envisioned 51 years ago. The United Nations was created from the ashes of World War II, with the hope of avoiding future world-wide conflagrations through international cooperation. The main focus for this mission was the Security Council, the only entity empowered under the U.N. Charger to act on the great questions of world peace. The General Assembly was intended to be a forum for debate on any issue that any nation wanted to bring before the assembled nations of the world. The U.N. Secretariat was to be a small professional staff needed to support the activities of the Security Council and General Assembly.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for their support in the last Congress for my legislation on behalf of the towns of Tremont and East Boothbay, Maine, which passed the Senate in the 105th Congress. S. 1531 sought to deauthorize certain portions of the navigational project for Bass Harbor, and S. 1532 sought to deauthorize the final portions of East Boothbay Harbor. 
   I also want to thank my colleagues for their support and Senate passage of the reauthorization of the Water Resources Development Act of 1998, or WRDA, which not only included these two stand alone bills, but also contained legislation that deauthorized the Federal Navigation Project area within the limits of Boothbay Harbor's inner harbor. The town's representatives had voted unanimously to request this deauthorization of the FNP area. 
   Also, WRDA was amended on the floor to add language that would allow for the dredging of Wells Harbor. After many contentious years, this important federal project is set to go forward because a historic Memorandum of Agreement was reached amongst the town of Wells, the Save our Shores Wells coalition, the Wells Chamber of Commerce and the Maine Audubon Society. 
   Bass Harbor has the greatest concentration of fishing boats on Mt. Desert Island and all mooring spaces are currently full, with a long waiting list to obtain future moorings. When the townspeople approached the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to obtain a permit for expansion, they were told that no improvements could be made until the federal project area boundary was moved to the proper location by legislative action. I am happy to do this on their behalf. The Selectmen, Town Manager, and Harbor Committee will not be working with the Corps and the State in anticipation of having the harbor dredged, which last occurred in 1966, so that they may make space available for more and larger boats. 
   The bill for East Boothbay Harbor deauthorize the remainder of the federal navigational project at Boothbay Harbor. The current marina owners purchased the former shipbuilding yard in East Boothbay in 1993 and have since turned it into a full service marina. In the process of getting all the permits together for further economic development, the marina discovered that parts of the harbor, while no longer used as such, were still deemed a federal navigation project created back in 1913, when mine sweepers and other ships were being built there for World War I. Because part of the federal navigation project is still considered active, the Corps told the town that nothing could be done in the water until the entire area was deauthorized. My bill takes care of this final deauthorization, the rest of which was accomplished in the last reauthorization of the Water Resources Development Act, but the coordinates were ultimately found to be inaccurate. 
   This legislation, with the assistance of the Corps, addresses that small section still requiring deauthorization. 
   The Town of Boothbay Harbor, Maine has requested legislation be enacted that will deauthorize the Federal Navigation Project area within the limits of Boothbay Harbor's inner harbor. To this end, I am introducing a bill, drafted with the assistance of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and approved unanimously by the town's representatives. 
   I am also introducing legislation to address the dredging of Wells Harbor, which will deepen and maintain the harbor and, at the same time, protect an important federal wildlife refuge. The language, which was also included in the Senate passed WRDA of 1998, gives the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) the authority to proceed with the project. The dredging of this federal project, contentious since 1988 because of concerns from environmental groups, is now set to go forward because of a historic Memorandum of Agreement that has been reached amongst the community and town officials, and the Maine Audubon Society. Interestingly, approximately 185,000 cubic yards of the sand to be dredged will be used to nourish adjacent eroding beaches in the town of Wells, so the project is a win-win situation for all concerned. 
   My stand alone bill, which will also once again be incorporated into WRDA, will allow the Corps to conduct maintenance dredging in Wells Harbor based on a design capacity for the harbor of 150 vessels, of which approximately 10 percent are commercial fishing boats. A small craft fleet of 150 is the original congressionally authorized design capacity for the harbor, and was a crucial part of the Agreement. 
   In addition, all parties to the settlement have agreed to a modification of the federal project, requiring Congressional action, that would realign and redesignate the existing federal channel, anchorage, and realign with the harbor settling basin, so as to maximize the use of the natural channels in the harbor for navigation and anchorage purposes. This will eliminate the impact of dredging on the intertidal  sand bar, which is considered to be the geologically stabilizing force for the estuary. The language, drafted with Corps assistance, will create a new settling basin in the outer harbor, relocate the inner harbor channel to the east side of the harbor, and redesignate portions of the current channel and settling basin as anchorage. 
   The State of Maine issued water quality certification and coastal zone management consistency in November of 1998, conditioned on the project modifications in my legislation and that were passed by the Senate in the WRDA of 1998. 
   Another critical component of the Agreement for all the parties is the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's request, also supported by the Maine Audubon Society, that the Corps expand the area covered by the bathymetric survey work that it will already be conducting as part of the monitoring program for the harbor. The State and the parties have agreed that the additional survey will provide important and useful information about the erosional impacts of dredging in the harbor. I have asked the Corps to make a good faith effort to honor this request. 
   Again, I congratulate the parties in the state for what I realize is a fragile Agreement and wish to help bring this long standing matter to the best conclusion possible both for the economy of the town of Wells and the environment of the harbor, the Rachael Carson Wildlife Refuge nearby and the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve, in which the harbor lies. 
   I want to thank Senator CHAFEE and his Environment and Public Works Committee for their work for successful Senate passage for these bills in the last Congress. When passed again by the Senate and by the House--and signed into law--the legislation will allow the Maine towns involved to get on with much needed harbor economic development and dredging. 
   I once again thank my colleagues and ask for their continued support for passage of these bills, and I especially want to urge the House to also move forward on WRDA reauthorization. One project in one district in one state should not hold up the passage of this important legislation as was the situation last year. This legislation will help the economy of small towns in Maine--and many other lotions around the country--who desperately need harbor reauthorization or dredging.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, I rise today to introduce the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1999. We supported this bill in the 105th Congress when it was championed by my friend, the Senator from New York, Mr. DAMATO, and we are reaffirming our support for this important issue by reintroducing this bill today. Last year we did make some progress on this bill as one piece--requiring insurance companies to cover reconstructive surgery was included in the final Omnibus spending bill enacted into law last October. 
   This bill is about doing what's best for women facing the crisis of a cancer diagnosis and a potential mastectomy. Because right now some women are  being denied the best health care available. That is simply not acceptable in a country of such vast medical resources. 
   This year, millions of Americans will face the possibility of a cancer diagnosis, and 180,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Our bill provides women with breast cancer and all Americans facing a cancer diagnosis with some basic protections. 
   First, it ensures that doctors are not pressured by health plans to release mastectomy patients before it is medically appropriate. Currently, some insurers have guidelines recommending that mastectomies be performed on an outpatient basis. A mastectomy is a very complicated surgical procedure and complications can arise as a result. Sending a woman home immediately after the surgery is not always the right thing to do. They may not have the information they need nor, more importantly, the care. We want to make sure--and this bill will--that the decisions are made in the context of the medical well being of the patient as opposed to being made by an insurance company bureaucrat. 
   This decision must be returned to physicians and their patients. The physical scars left by a mastectomy can be complicated and difficult to care for, and often require supervision. Women prematurely released may not have the information they need, and some dangerous complications can arise hours after the operation. And all of this is happening in context of the intense emotional trauma that comes with losing part or all of a breast. 
   Finally, all Americans who face the possibility of a cancer diagnosis must be able to make informed decisions about appropriate medical care. To do that, they need access to all the information available. Our bill requires insurance companies to pay full coverage for secondary consultations with a specialist whenever any cancer has been diagnosed or a treatment recommended. This will reduce senseless deaths resulting from false diagnoses and empower individuals to seek the most appropriate available treatment. 
   Women with breast cancer and all Americans facing a cancer diagnosis cannot wait any longer. I would urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill in order to provide the protections granted under this bill now.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will address a serious need of America's workers: the need to receive training that will prepare individuals for the workplace of the 21st Century. My legislation, entitled the ``Working American Training Voucher Act,'' would provide $1,000 training vouchers to 1 million working men and women who typically have little or no access to employer-provided training. 
   Mr. President, many Federal programs focus on the needs of those whose challenges and difficulties are most easily recognized and tangible. When we see a hungry child, an unemployed adult, or an impoverished senior citizen, we justifiably want to reach out and do what we can to help. Indeed, I am proud to be an active voice for those whose challenges and pains we can sometimes only imagine. However, it is oftentimes difficult to recognize the needs of those whose challenges are less tangible, whose concerns are less evident, or whose sense of insecurity about the future is known only by the individual and their family. 
   It is this difficulty that confronts many American workers today. In the face of increasing global competition, many workers wonder if the job they have today will be there for them tomorrow. They are concerned that the advent of new technologies is making their skills and talents less useful for their current employers which, in turn, makes them feel more vulnerable and expendable. And they wonder if the skills they posses today are even marketable if they are ``down-sized'' or otherwise put out of work. 
   Unfortunately, these types of concerns and anxieties of oftentimes do not show on the surface, so it can be difficult for others to recognize or address them. It is too easy for many to assume that because a man or woman is already holding down a job, all is well and his or her future is secure. After all, how bad can it be if you're punching a time clock and getting a paycheck? Unfortunately, such a view is not only shortsighted, it is also misguided and could prove disastrous. 
   We should not wait until a worker has been laid-off from their job, or a company shuts its doors and shutters its windows, to take steps to help the American worker. Rather, we should take steps to ensure that our nation's workforce is confident of their future and feels prepared to address the changes that tomorrow will bring. Not only does this help the individual, but I think we would all agree that the best way to reduce the impact and cost of unemployment is to take steps to keep those who are already employed on-the-job! 
   Admittedly, many policies and decisions play an integral role in creating a vibrant job market. The tax burden we place on businesses, the trade agreements we sign with foreign governments, and the regulatory load we place on employers all have a significant impact on our economy's ability to produce and sustain good jobs. However, for the individual, many of these policies seem too ``macro'' to have an impact on their own employment prospects. In fact, an individual may not even recognize the direct impact these broader policies have on their job from day to day. 
   There is, however, one issue that truly strikes at the heart of how an individual feels about the future: the degree to which he or she knows that their skills match the needs of their current employer or other prospective employers in the marketplace. Without this knowledge, it does not matter to an individual if the unemployment rate is as low as economists consider the ``natural rate of unemployment'' or if the newspapers tell him or her that the economy couldn't be better. The simple fact is that unless an individual personally feels that their skills are up-to-date and marketable, there will never be a complete sense of security on the job from one day to the next. 
   And that's what the legislation I am introducing today is all about. The ``Working American Training Voucher Act'' addresses the needs of the average American worker--the individual who has a job today, but doesn't know if he or she has the skills needed for the jobs of tomorrow. The person who's collecting a paycheck now, but is concerned that the rapidly changing work environment may put an end to that soon. 
   Mr. President, we all know new technologies and new products are entering the workplace at an unprecedented rate and the changes these 
   technologies bring are substantial. Few professions and few jobs have gone untouched by these changes--and even fewer will be immune from change in the future. Indeed, just as computers have changed the face of manufacturing, they have also changed the world of art and design. Even labor intensive tasks at assembly shops have taken on a high-tech flair thanks to new techologies. 
   For an individual who understands these technologies or receives training in their use, these changes present exciting new opportunities that improve performance and ultimately give one a sense of assurance that their skills are in demand. But for those who do not understand these technologies or do not receive training in their use, these technologies are nothing more than a threat and a cause for anxiety. 
   Regrettably, even as the demand for training at all levels in the workplace continues to grow because of these changing techologies, the United States has historically lagged far behind our global competitors in training workers. In fact, a study by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment concluded: ``When measured by international standards, most American workers are not well trained.'' 
   While some U.S. companies devote a substantial amount of money to training, many of our global competitors spend considerably more. A study by the American Society for Training and Development highlighted this point when it found that U.S. companies spend--in the aggregate--approximately 1.4 percent of their payroll on training, while a number of our competitor nations actually require companies to spend 2 to 4 percent! While I would not espouse a mandatory training budget for any business, I believe  we can and should seek to improve the availability of training for our nation's workers--and especially for those who need it most but are least likely to receive it. And that's precisely who the ``Working American Training Voucher'' is designed to reach. 
   Mr. President, the ``Working American Training Voucher'' would provide access to critically needed training for workers at businesses with 200 or fewer employees. Why is it targeted to workers in small businesses? Quite simply, because these are the individuals who are the least likely to receive--or be offered--employer-provided training. The same report by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment summarized the plight of employees at small businesses quite succinctly: ``Many (employees) in smaller firms receive no formal training.'' 
   A 1997 report--completed by Professor Craig Olson at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and presented to the Senate Manufacturing Task Force during the 105th Congress--looked at the difference between the likelihood an individual would receive training and the level of educational achievement he or she attained, or the field he or she chose to enter. Dr. Olson's study found that individuals with a bachelor's or master's degree had a 50 percent chance of receiving training in the past year, while individuals with a high school diploma had only a 17 percent chance. Those who dropped-out of high school fared even worse: their odds of receiving training were only 5 percent. 
   When viewed by occupation, individuals who worked in production- or service-related jobs had only a 16 percent and 18 percent chance of receiving training respectively, while those in management had a 50 percent chance. When considering that only one in four American workers received training in the past 12 months, these odds don't bode well for many employees at small businesses whose educational attainment and occupations fall in the categories that are the least likely to receive training. 
   One might understandably ask: Why is it that small businesses often provide so little training? The answer: cost. Small businesses are quite often unable to afford the cost of sending an employee to a training program. When your business is just trying to make ends meet, it's impossible to send an employee to a training class that costs the business both money and time away from work. 
   Mr. President, the ``Working American Training Voucher'' is designed to address this problem in a straightforward and efficient way. These vouchers-valued at up to $1,000 each--would be made available to employees at small business through the existing job training system that is already in place as a result of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). As my colleagues in the Senate know, state and local governments--joined by the private sector--have primary responsibility for the development, 
   management, and administration of job training programs in the JTPA, so no new distribution network would be necessary to conduct this voucher program. 
   The only major requirement for receiving a voucher would be that the employee and employer must agree on the specific training that will be purchased with the voucher. This will ensure that the training will be targeted specifically to the needs of the individual and the business--money would not be spent on generic training programs that teach skills that are of little, if any, use in a particular field or job. Furthermore, such an agreement will ensure that workers are actively engaged in pursuing training that will help their careers, even as employers will be urging employees to undertake training that will help the business. 
   Last year, JTPA programs were re-crafted and consolidated as part of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998--a law that greatly improved the delivery of federal job training monies. Specifically, up until the passage of the WIA, there was virtually no federal money for workers that are already employed. But with WIA's enactment, we are beginning to place some much needed attention on the needs of incumbent workers, and the ``Working American Training Voucher Act'' will vastly expand access to training for those who need it most. 
   Mr. President, I believe that as we prepare our workforce for the next century, we should be encouraging workers to develop new skills that will improve their longevity in their current jobs even as they gain confidence that their skills will be needed in the future. Not only will these new skills increase the confidence and performance of the individual worker, but they will also improve the productivity of the business who employs them. And we all know that if we improve a business' productivity and output, that business is more likely to survive and thrive--which means that this voucher may ultimately assist in preserving businesses and jobs in the long run. 
   Furthermore, better skills and training will ensure that individuals are able to rapidly transition to new jobs in the unfortunate event their current job is lost for reasons beyond their control. Regardless of how favorable the tax code is made or how many burdensome regulations we remove, we will never be able to guarantee an individual that his or her job will be around forever. But we can provide a worker with access to training that will keep his or her skills up-to-date and marketable no matter what the future holds. 
   Mr. President, the ``Working American Training Voucher'' would be a tangible, concrete, and definable program that would address a core issue facing American workers. It will ensure that those who typically have the least access to training will be able to acquire the skills needed for their current jobs, while improving their jobs in the future. It is targeted to those who are most in need of assistance, and will ensure that we no longer wait until an individual is out of work to provide help. 
   The Federal government often promises the American people many things, but we can never offer peace of mind to a worker who doesn't know if his or her skills are adequate to keep them employed. Let's take a step in the right direction and at least ensure that those who have a job will not lose it due to a lack of access to training and new skills. Let's pass the ``Working American Training Voucher Act.''

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing two bills which build on progress made in the 105th Congress in the difficult and challenging fight against breast cancer. 
   Our challenge was summed up by one breast cancer advocate when she stated, simply and eloquently, ``We must make our voices heard, because it is our lives.'' Indeed, breast cancer continues to claim the lives of our mothers, sisters, daughters, and wives. With about 1 in 8 women at risk for developing breast cancer, there is scarcely a family in America unaffected by the disease. 
   By the end of this year alone, over 178,000 women will have been diagnosed with breast cancer. Over 43,500 will have died. And with each life stolen, our nation is weakened immeasurably. 
   We took an important step forward in the last Congress to combat this deadly foe. In the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act, Congress included language based on a bill I introduced with the Senator from California, Senator FEINSTEIN, to create a ``one-stop shopping information service'' for individuals with life-threatening diseases looking to obtain information about privately and publicly funded clinical trials. This service provides information describing the purpose of the trial, eligibility criteria and the location. It gives individuals, their families and physicians an 800 number to call to obtain the latest information about these trials--trials that could save a loved ones life and trials that could help put us a step closer to our ultimate goal--finding a cure. 
   Much remains to be done before we conquer breast cancer, so today I am reintroducing a bill, the Improved Patient Access to Clinical Studies Act of 1999, to prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage for services provided to individuals participating in clinical trials, if those services would otherwise be covered by the plan. This bill would also prevent health plans from discriminating against enrollees who choose to participate in clinical trials. 
   This bill has a two-fold purpose. First, it will ensure that many patients who could benefit from these potentially life-saving investigational treatments but currently do not have access to them because their insurance will not cover the associated costs. Second, without reimbursement for these services, our researchers' ability to conduct important research is impeded as it reduces the number of patients who seek to participate in clinical trials. 
   The second bill will give breast cancer advocates a voice in the National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) research decision-making. The Consumer Involvement in Breast Cancer Research Act urges NIH to follow the Department of Defense's lead and include lay breast cancer advocates in breast cancer research decision-making. 
   The involvement of these breast cancer advocates at DOD has helped foster new and innovative breast cancer research funding designs and research projects. While maintaining the highest level of quality assurance through peer review, breast cancer advocates have helped to ensure that all breast cancer research reflects the experiences and wisdom of the individuals who have lived with the disease, as well as the scientific community. 
   I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting these two bills which will help those suffering from breast cancer and their families as well as our researchers who are seeking the cure for this devastating disease.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would establish a Northern Border States Council on United States-Canada trade. 
   The purpose of this Council is to oversee cross-border trade with our Nation's largest trading partner--an action that I believe is long overdue. The Council will serve as an early warning system to alert State and Federal trade officials to problems in cross-border traffic and trade. The Council will enable the United States to more effectively administer trade policy with Canada by applying the wealth of insight, knowledge and expertise of people who reside not only in my State of Maine, but also in the other eleven northern border States as well, on this critical policy issue. 
   Within the U.S. Government we already have the Department of Commerce and a U.S. Trade Representative, both Federal entities, responsible for our larger, national U.S. trade interests. But the facts is that too often such entities fail to give full consideration to the interests of the 12 northern States that share a border with Canada, the longest demilitarized border between two nations anywhere in the world. The Northern Border States Council will provide State trade officials with a mechanism to share information about cross-border traffic and trade. The Council will then advise the Congress, the President, the U.S. Trade Representative, the Secretary of Commerce, and other Federal and State trade officials on United States-Canada trade policies, and problems. 
   Canada is our largest and most important trading partner. Canada is by far the top purchaser of U.S. export goods and services, as it is the largest source of U.S. imports. In 1997, for instance, Canada imported over $151.7 million worth of U.S. goods. With an economy one-tenth the size of our own, Canada's economic health depends on maintaining close trade ties with the United States. While Canada accounts for about one-fifth of U.S. exports and imports, the United States is the source of two-thirds of Canada's imports and provides the market with fully three-quarters of all of Canada's exports. 
   The United States and Canada have the largest bilateral trade relationship in the world, a relationship that is remarkable not only for its strength and general health, but also for the intensity of the trade and border problems that do frequently develop--as we have seen this past year with actual farmer border blockades in some border states because of the unfairness of agricultural trade policies. Over the last decade, Canada and the United States have signed two major trade agreements--the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement in 1989, and the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, in 1993. Notwithstanding these trade accords, numerous disagreements have caused trade negotiators to shuttle back and forth between Washington and Ottawa, most recently for solutions to problems for grain trade, wheat imports, animal trade, and joint cooperation on Biotechnology. I might add at recent negotiations, there was still no movement towards solutions for the potato industry, but I have been promised by the USDA that it is now the top priority for discussion. 
   Most of the more well-known trade disputes with Canada have involved agricultural commodities such as durum wheat, peanut butter, dairy products, and poultry products, and these disputes, of course, have impacted more than just the 12 northern border States. 
   Each and every day, however, an enormous quantity of trade and traffic crosses the United States-Canada border. These are literally thousands of businesses, large and small, that rely  on this cross-border traffic and trade for their livelihood. 
   My own State of Maine has had a long-running dispute with Canada over that nation's unfair policies in support of its potato industry, and I know that the upper mid-west and the western states have problems as well. Specifically, Canada protects its domestic potato growers from United States competition through a system of nontariff trade barriers, such as setting container size limitations and a prohibition on bulk shipments from the United States. 
   This bulk import prohibition effectively blocks United States potato imports into Canada and was one topic of discussion during an International Trade Commission investigations hearing on April 30, 1997, where I testified on behalf 
   of the Maine potato growers. The ITC followed up with a report stating that Canadian regulations do restrict imports to bulk shipments of fresh potatoes for processing or repacking, and that the U.S. maintains no such restrictions. These bulk shipment restrictions continue, and, at the same time, Canada also artificially enhances the competitiveness of its product through domestic subsidies for its potato growers. 
   Another trade dispute with Canada, specifically with the province of New Brunswick, originally served as the inspiration for this legislation. In July 1993, Canadian federal customs officials began stopping Canadians returning from Maine and collecting from them the 11-percent New Brunswick Provincial Sales Tax [PST] on goods purchased in Maine. Canadian Customs Officers had already been collecting the Canadian federal sales tax all across the United States-Canada border. The collection of the New Brunswick PST was specifically targeted against goods purchased in Maine--not on goods purchased in any of the other provinces bordering New Brunswick. 
   After months of imploring the U.S. Trade Representative to do something about the imposition of the unfairly administered tax, then Ambassador Kantor agreed that the New Brunswick PST was a violation of NAFTA, and that the United States would include the PST issue in the NAFTA dispute settlement process. But despite this explicit assurance, the issue was not, in fact, brought before NAFTA's dispute settlement process, prompting Congress in 1996, to include an amendment I offered to immigration reform legislation calling for the U.S. Trade Representative to take this action without further delay. But, it took three years for a resolution, and even then, the resolution was not crafted by the USTR. 
   Throughout the early months of the PST dispute, we in the state of Maine had enormous difficulty convincing our Federal trade officials that the PST was in fact an international trade dispute that warranted their attention and action. We had no way of knowing, whether problems similar to the PST dispute existed elsewhere along the United States-Canada border, or whether it was a more localized problem. If a body like the Northern Border States Council had existed when the collection of the PST began, it could have immediately started investigating the issue to determine its impact and would have made recommendations as to how to deal with it. 
   The long-standing pattern of unsuccessful negotiations is alarming, with no solution on the horizon from the federal entities in charge, as the industry in Maine and other states in the U.S. continues to strive to stay competitive despite the trade barriers thrown up against their potatoes. 
   In short, the Northern Border States Council will serve as the eyes and ears of our States that share a border with Canada, and who are most vulnerable to fluctuations in cross-border trade and traffic. The Council will be a tool for Federal and State trade officials to use in monitoring their cross-border trade. It will help insure that national trade policy regarding America's largest trading partner will be developed and implemented with an eye towards the unique opportunities and burdens present to the northern border states. 
   The Northern Border States Council will be an advisory body, not a regulatory one. Its fundamental purpose will be to determine the nature and cause of cross-border trade issues or disputes, and to recommend how to resolve them. 
   The duties and responsibilities of the Council will include, but not be limited to, providing advice and policy recommendations on such matters as taxation and the regulation of cross-border wholesale and retail trade in goods and services; taxation, regulation and subsidization of food, agricultural, energy, and forest-products commodities; and the potential for Federal and State/provincial laws and regulations, including customs and immigration regulations, to act as nontariff barriers to trade. 
   As an advisory body, the Council will review and comment on all Federal and/or State reports, studies, and practices concerning United States-Canada trade, with particular emphasis on all reports from the dispute settlement panels established under NAFTA. These Council reviews will be conducted upon the request of the United States Trade Representative, the Secretary of Commerce, a Member of Congress from any Council State, or the Governor of a Council State. 
   If the Council determines that the origin of a cross-border trade dispute resides with Canada, the Council would determine, to the best of its ability, if the source of the dispute in the Canadian Federal Government or a Canadian Provencal government. 
   The goal of this legislation is not to create another Federal trade bureaucracy. The Council will be made up of individuals nominated by the Governors and approved by the Secretary of Commerce. Each northern border State will have two members on the Council. The Council members will be unpaid, and serve as 2-year term. 
   The Northern Border States Council on United States-Canada Trade will not solve all of our trade problems with Canada. But it will ensure that the voices and views of our northern border States are heard in Washington by our Federal trade officials. For too long their voices have been ignored, and the northern border States have had to suffer severe economic consequences at various times because of it. This legislation will bring our States into their rightful position as full partners for issues that affect cross-border trade and traffic with our country's largest trading partner. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to give agricultural producers, including potato producers, some important and badly needed new tools for combating injurious increases in imports from foreign countries. 
   The Trade Act of 1974 contains provisions that permit U.S. industries to seek relief from serious injury caused by increased quantities of imports. In practice, however, it has been very difficult for many U.S. industries to actually secure action under the Act to remedy this kind of injury. 
   The ineffectiveness of the Act results from some of the specific language in the statute. Specifically, the law requires the International Trade Commission, when evaluating a petition for relief from injury, to consider whether the injury affects the entire U.S. industry, or a segment of an industry located in a ``major geographic area'' of the U.S. whose production constitutes a ``substantial portion'' of the total domestic injury. This language has been interpreted by the ITC to mean that all or nearly all of the U.S. industry must be seriously injured by the imports before it can qualify for any relief. 
   Thus, if an important segment of an industry is being severely injured by imports that compete directly with that segment, the businesses who comprise this portion of the industry do not have much recourse--even though the industry segment in question may employ thousands of Americans and generate billions of dollars annually for the U.S. economy. In other words, our current trade laws leave large segments of an industry that serve particular regions and markets, or have  other distinguishing features, practically helpless in the face of sharp and damaging import surges. 
   In addition, even if large industry subdivisions could qualify for assistance, the time frames under the Trade Act for expedited, or provisional, relief for agricultural products are too long to respond in time to prevent or adequately remedy injury caused by increasing imports. At a minimum, three months must elapse before any relief can be provided, irrespective of the damage that American businesses may suffer during that time. And three months is an absolute minimum. In reality, it could take substantially longer to provide expedited relief. 
   Mr. President, when it comes to agricultural products, the problems in U.S. trade law that I have described remain acute. Due to their perishable nature, many agricultural products cannot be inventoried until imports subside or the ITC grants relief--if the industry is so fortunate--many months or even years later. And most agricultural producers, who are heavily dependent on credit each year to produce and sell a crop, cannot wait that long. They need assistance in the short-term, while the injury is occurring, if they are going to survive an import surge. 
   Also, because crops are grown during particular seasons and serve specific markets related to production in those growing seasons, the agricultural industry is more prone to segmentation. Finally, many of the agricultural industry entities that would have to file a petition for relief under the Trade Act are really grower groups that do not necessarily have the financial wherewithal to spend millions of dollars researching, filing, and pursuing a petition before the ITC. 
   The bill that I have introduced today is designed to empower America's agricultural producers to seek and obtain effective remedies for damaging import surges. It will make the Trade Act more user friendly for American businesses. Unlike the current law, which sets criteria for ITC consideration that are impossible to meet and that do not reflect the realities of today's industry, my bill establishes more useful criteria. It permits the ITC to consider the impacts of import surges on an important segment of an agricultural industry when determining whether a domestic industry has been injured by imports. This segment is defined as a portion of the domestic industry located in a specific geographic area whose collective production constitutes a significant portion of the entire domestic industry. The ITC would also be required to consider whether this segment primarily serves the domestic market in the specific geographic area, and whether substantial imports are entering the area. 
   Rather than rely solely on an industry petition to initiate an ITC review of whether provisional, or expedited, relief deserves to be granted, my bill would 
   permit the United States Trade Representative or the Congress, via a resolution, to request such review. 
   Because the time frames in the present law for considering and providing provisional relief are so long that the damage from imports can already be done well before a decision by the ITC is ever issued, this bill would shorten the time frame for provisional relief determinations by the ITC by allowing the commission to waive, in certain circumstances, the act's requirement that imports be monitored by the USTR for at least 90 days. 
   And, finally, the bill expands the list of agricultural products eligible for provisional relief to include any potato product, including processed potato products. Under current law, only perishable agricultural products and citrus products are eligible to apply for expedited relief determinations. But this narrow eligibility list unreasonably excludes important U.S. agribusinesses, such as our frozen french fry producers, from the expedited remedies available in the Trade Act. 
   For too long, American agriculture has been trying to combat sophisticated foreign competition with the equivalent of sticks and stones. My bill strengthens the position of American agricultural producers in the competitive arena, and will help provide effective remedies for agricultural producers, and provide effective deterrents to the depredations of their competitors from other countries. I hope other senators with a interest in fair play for our domestic agricultural producers will join me I cosponsoring this important legislation.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, long term care is an issue that continues to tug at Congress and this country. In 1995 the federal and state governments spent $23 billion on long term care and another $21 billion for home care. And it is estimated that those in need of long-term care will grow from 7.3 million today to 10-14 million by 2020--potentially a doubling of those in need. 
   The appropriate care for an individual should be an issue that is made by that individual and their loved ones. But we all know the truth is that in many cases it comes down to the financial realities of the family. For many people, remaining at home is their choice. It allows them to remain with their loved ones in familiar surroundings. We need to do more to assist these people and their families if this is their choice. 
   Toward that end I am reintroducing a bill that provides a tax credit for families caring for a relative who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. When I first came to Congress 20 years ago, not a single piece of legislation devoted to Alzheimer's disease had even been introduced. We have come along way since then, as today `Alzheimer's' is a household word. It is also the most expensive uninsured illness in America. Alzheimer's will consume more of our national wealth-approximately $1.75 trillion--than all other illnesses except cancer and heart disease. And the number of those affected by this disease is rising and will continue to rise dramatically, from 4 million today to over 14 million by the middle of the 21st century. 
   As staggering as these numbers are, they pale in comparison to the emotional costs this disease places on the family. We can help lessen that cost by providing some relief to Alzheimer's patients and their families. My bill would allow families to deduct the cost of home care and adult day and respite care provided to a dependent suffering from Alzheimer's disease. 
   My second bill will strengthen the dependent care tax credit and restore Congress' original intent to provide the greatest benefit of the tax credit to low-income taxpayers. This bill expands the dependent care tax credit, makes it applicable for respite care expenses and makes it refundable.  
   As more and more women enter the workforce combined with the aging of our population, we are continuing to see an increased need for both child and elder care. Expenses incurred for this care can place a large burden on a family's finances. The cost of full time child care can range from $4,000 to $10,000. The cost of nursing home care is in excess of $40,000 a year. Managing these costs is difficult for many families, but is exceptionally burdensome for those in lower income brackets. 
   In 1976, the dependent care tax credit was created to help low- and moderate-income families alleviate the burden of employment-related dependent care. We haven't changed the DCTC since it was created 23 years and in fact, in the 1986 Tax Reform Act we indexed all the basic provisions of the tax code that determine tax liability except for DCTC. We need to make the credit relevant by updating it to reflect today's world. My legislation will do that by indexing the credit to inflation and making it refundable so that those who do not reach the tax thresholds will still received assistance. It also raises the DCTC sliding scale from 30 to 50 percent of work-related dependent care expenditures for families earning $15,000 or less. The scale would then be reduced by 1 percentage point for each additional $1,000 more of income, down to a credit of 20 percent for persons earning $45,000 or more. 
   In order to assist those who care for loved ones at home, the bill also expands the definition of dependent care to include respite care, thereby offering relief from this additional expense. A respite care credit would be allowed for up to $1,200 for one qualifying dependent care and $2,400 for two qualifying dependents. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting these two bills that will provide assistance to families that wish to provide long term care to their loved ones at home.

   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to improve the retirement security of women. Even with the increasing number of women entering the workforce, only 39 percent of part-time and full-time working women are covered by a pension plan. 
   While women have come a long way, even now a woman makes only 75 cents for every dollar a man makes--and older women are payed even less: 66 cents for every dollar earned by a 55-year-old man. In addition, as we all know, women have spent more time outside the workforce because they have spent more time inside the household raising families. These two factors help explain why older women are twice as likely as older men to be poor or near poor; with nearly 40 percent of older women who live alone live in or near poverty. 
   This bill makes a number of changes in current pension law including: helping to ensure that pension benefits earned during a marriage are considered and divided fairly in the event of divorce; closing loopholes in the civil service and railroad retirement laws that have resulted in the loss of pension benefits for widows and ex-spouses of beneficiaries in such plans and increases the amount of information available by establishing a pension ``hotline'' at the Department of Labor.
