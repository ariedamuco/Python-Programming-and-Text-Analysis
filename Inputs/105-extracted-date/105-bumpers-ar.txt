Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 1693, the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998. Let me begin by acknowledging the work of the sponsor of this legislation, Senator Thomas. As the chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Historic Preservation and Recreation, he has been willing to compromise and work with all involved parties, including Secretary Babbit, my friend and colleague Senator Bennett, Congressmen George Miller and Don Young in an effort to enact a meaningful and comprehensive bill for our national parks. It has been a pleasure to work with him on this important legislation and I am very pleased that this bill will pass before I leave the Senate this year. I would also like to particularly thank Senator Bennett, who has once again been very helpful and constructive in developing a bill that can garner such broad bipartisan support, as I believe this bill has. 
Although this is a comprehensive bill that makes a number of positive changes in the way national parks are managed, for me, the most significant provisions are found in title IV--the National Park Service Concessions Management Improvement Act. 
Mr. President, for almost 19 years I have worked to reform the concessions policies of the National Park Service to increase competition, provide better services, and to ensure a better return for the American public. Over the past two decades, we have held dozens of hearings, and we've debated this issue in markups and on the Senate floor. 
As you know, during the 103d Congress Senator Bennett and I sponsored a bill which passed the Senate by a vote of 90-9, and passed in the House of Representatives with only minor changes by a vote of 368-30. Despite the overwhelming vote margins, we were unable to pass a final bill before the Congress adjourned. Given the magnitude of those votes, it is very frustrating to be here once again debating park concession reform. 
While I support passage of this bill and believe it will enhance the Park Service's ability to better manage our National Park System, the bill before us today is a true compromise worked out between Senator Thomas and myself in the Senate and with Congressmen Miller, Don Young, and Jim Hansen in the House. Each of us gave something up in order to get a bill passed. The bill--particularly the concession title--does not contain all of the policy changes that I would like to see made. However, passage of this bill will finally allow the Park Service to have meaningful competition for park concession contracts. 
Most importantly, the bill will repeal the 1965 Concession Policy Act--a 30-year-old anachronism--including its most anticompetitive provision, the granting to incumbent concessioners of a preferential right to renew their contract by simply matching the terms and conditions of a superior offer. 
Other important provisions in the concession reform title include: Maintaining existing statutory protections for outfitter and guide contracts and small contracts with less than $500,000 in annual gross revenue; a prohibition against giving any concessioner a preferential right to provide new or additional services; and language linking the value of facilities built by a concessioner to actual construction costs, adjusted for inflation, rather than the `sound value' possessory interest allowed under current law. 
During the consideration of this bill in the House, possessory interest was the most contentious issue to be resolved. While Senator Thomas and I had 
agreed on a formulation in the Senate passed bill that satisfied us, come in the House, particularly the ranking Democrat on the Resources Committee, George Miller, preferred the approach taken in the bill I mentioned earlier that passed the Senate in 1993. Under that formulation, a concessioner's possessory interest would be depreciated over time on a straight line basis. While I too prefer this approach, it is clear that the concessioners are adamantly opposed to this method of calculating possessory interest. More importantly, a major change to this key provision would put at risk the agreement we have reached to eliminate the preferential right of renewal, by far the most anticompetitive provision in the existing law. 
After lengthy discussions between Congressman Miller, Secretary Babbitt, Senator Thomas, and others, another compromise has been agreed to that gives both sides some of what they want. As passed the House, the legislation provides that the Secretary is to value possessory interest as described in the bill for 9 years. At the end of year 7, the Secretary is to send Congress a report on the concessions program in general and, in particular, how this new method of calculating possessory interest has worked. Congress can examine the report and make legislative changes if necessary based on the track record of the previous 7 years. Then, at the end of the 9th year, if no changes in the law have been made, the Secretary will have the discretion, under certain limited circumstances, to require concessioners to use other methods of valuing possessory interest, including but not limited to, straight line depreciation. I think this is a reasonable compromise and very much appreciate the hard work on the part of all parties in working it out. 
While the concession title has been of particular interest to me, the bill before us today includes several other titles which I believe will greatly enhance the Park Service's management authorities. The bill includes directives for the Park Service to improve career development and training for its employees and to establish a strong scientific research program in national parks. It codifies criteria for the Park Service to use in evaluating areas proposed for addition to the National Park System. I must say that I very much regret the decision of the House to remove the provisions contained in the Senate bill that gave the Park Service much needed authority to collect and retain fees for commercial filming activities in national park units, and which would have extended the Recreational Fee Demonstration Progam for park fees for another 6 years. These provisions were included in the Senate bill to help get badly needed money directly to the parks--something that everyone says they want to do. Deleting these provisions that would have provided literally hundreds of millions of dollars to the parks over the next 5 or 6 years will not help restore our badly deteriorating parks and public lands. 
The bill before us today will allow the Park Service to develop and market annual park admission passports to increase public awareness about parks and to raise new revenues. There are a few other titles included in the bill, but those are the most significant provisions. 
Mr. President, the concession reform provisions in this bill are a great step forward for the National Park Service and the taxpayers. I strongly support these and the other provisions in this legislation, and I hope my colleagues will join me in helping to pass this bill. 
In closing, I want to thank several people who worked very hard on this legislation, in particular title IV related to park concessions. David Brooks and Tom Williams on the Energy Committee Democratic staff have worked with me for years on this issue and I appreciate their efforts very much. Jim O'Toole and Gary Ellsworth of the majority staff have been very helpful to me on this and 
other bills and I thank them both for their help and cooperation. Dan Naatz on Senator Thomas' staff and Tim Stewart with Senator Bennett were crucial to Senate negotiations on this bill and provided constructive and substantive input on a number of occasions. Finally, John Leshy, Destry Jarvis, and Lars Hanslin in the Interior Department deserve much of the credit for putting together the final compromise on possessory interest that got this bill moving again in the House. Along with John Lawrence and Rick Healy of the Democratic staff on the House Resources Committee, these gentlemen worked tirelessly to put the finishing touches on a very delicate compromise. I very much appreciate their dedication to this effort and their willingness to go the extra mile to get this bill passed.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield just a moment for me to say: I want that to be my legacy, Senator. You couldn't have done anything that would please me more. I have had a few accolades in my 24 years in the Senate. I have had several things named after me. But I can tell you that what you did in that Energy and Water Committee gives me unbelievable satisfaction. The reason I sponsored that legislation and fought so hard for it several years ago is because I wanted my children and my grandchildren to know what my values were. I was trying to save something for them. 
I thank you very much.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak, for what may be the last time, on the floor of the Senate. It is a very bittersweet time for me, after 24 years, most of which have been spent at this very desk. I might say at this moment that I have been blessed by having Senator Kennedy as my seatmate these many years, and before him Senator Gore--both truly outstanding men. 
In order to deliver a speech such as I am about to deliver, Mr. President, I do not think there is anything wrong with listing some of the defining moments in my life, because this speech is really more for the benefit of my children and grandchildren than it is for my colleagues or the people of America. 
First of all, I was blessed by my parents. I remind my brother from time to time that everybody was not so lucky in choosing their parents as he and I were. And that really is the reason that I stand here as one of 1,843 men and women ever to serve in the U.S. Senate. We were taught when we were children that when we died we were `going to Franklin Roosevelt'. And the reason we were taught that is because we were very poor. Most people do not realize that the South, from 1865 until about the time Franklin Roosevelt became President, was still living almost as a conquered nation. National politicians paid very little attention to the South. 
In our household, we were poor during the Great Depression. And I might say, the Great Depression is certainly one of the most important defining moments of my life. But it was during the Great Depression that Franklin Roosevelt began to provide all kinds of things for people in the South that they had previously thought unthinkable. 
We didn't have indoor plumbing. We didn't have running water. We didn't have paved streets. We didn't have much of anything. The people in our community died of typhoid fever in the summertime because the outhouse was just a few steps away from the well from which we drew our drinking water. Then Franklin Roosevelt began to provide immunizations for children against smallpox and typhoid. It was free. We got those shots at school. 
We had then what we called hobos or tramps; today we call them homeless people. My mother always saved a few scraps after breakfast knowing that some tramp was going to knock on the back door and ask for food. That was back before welfare came into existence. So we were very poor. 
I remember when I was 12 years old my father heard that Franklin Roosevelt was coming to Arkansas. He was a great believer in America and the political system and public service. He wanted my brother and me to see Franklin Roosevelt. So we drove over a gravel road 20 miles to Booneville, AR, and when the train on the Rock Island line pulled in, Franklin Roosevelt came out on the back platform, obviously being held up by a couple of Secret Service men. I tugged on my father's arm and I said, `Dad, what's wrong with him?' He said, `I will tell you later.' On the way home, he told us that Franklin Roosevelt had contracted polio when he was 37 years old, he couldn't walk, and he carried 12 pounds of steel braces on his legs. 
Then he told my brother and me that if Franklin Roosevelt could become President and couldn't even walk, there was no reason why my brother and I, with strong minds and bodies, couldn't become President, too. I never took my eye off that goal until many, many years later. 
In the following year, my father was president of the Arkansas Retail Hardware Association. They gave our family $300 to go to Los Angeles to the national convention. I can remember the big party at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles in 1937. I had never stepped on a carpet before in my life, and the Biltmore was filled with thick carpet. We just loved it. We didn't stay at the Biltmore. We were staying at the $2-a-night cabin. 
But the night of the big party, everybody was in tuxedos and long dresses, except my parents. And all the children were dressed in tuxedos, too, even in that Depression year of 1937. But I can remember my brother and I had on long pants and white shirts, no tie, no coat. We were terribly embarrassed. My father sensed that, and so the next day he told us that he knew we were embarrassed but he reminded us that the most important thing was that we were clean, our clothes were clean, our bodies were clean, and the kind of clothes you wore really were not all that important. He made it OK. 
When I was 15 years old, I had a high school English and literature teacher named Miss Doll. Every member of the U.S. Senate has been influenced by a college professor or high school teacher, maybe a preacher or somebody else. She was my influence. 
I remember my mother, who had a tendency--not to denigrate my mother--to not build our self-esteem. My father was working against that, trying to teach us self-esteem, not ego, but esteem. 
We were reading Beowulf in English, a great piece of literature. We would read a paragraph and discuss it. One time it came my time to read. I started reading, and all of a sudden--I read about 2 pages and Miss Doll still hadn't stopped me--I looked up and she was standing there. She looked at me and she looked at the class and she said, `Doesn't he read beautifully?' `Doesn't he have a nice voice?' And she said, `And wouldn't it be tragic if he didn't use that talent.' At first I thought she was making fun of me, but she did more for my self-esteem in 10 seconds than anybody, except my father, ever did. Some of my political detractors think she overdid it. 
And then just out of high school, but only after 6 months at the University of Arkansas, I went into the Marine Corps. World War II was raging. It was a terrifying time. I fully expected to be killed in that war. The Marines were taking terrible casualties in the South Pacific. Happily, I survived that. The best part of it was when I got home there was a caring, generous, compassionate Federal Government, waiting with the GI bill. 
While my father would have stolen to make sure we had a good education, my brother went to Harvard Law School and I went to the University of Arkansas and later Northwestern University Law School--both expensive schools my father could never afford. I studied political science and law. The reason I did that is because my father wanted me to go into public service. He wanted me and my brother to be politicians. He may be the last man who ever lived who encouraged his sons to go into politics. 
In my first year in law school, he and my mother were killed in a car wreck. They were tragically killed by a drunken driver. Neither of them had ever had a drink in their life. That is what made it so bizarre. The big disappointment of my life was that my father didn't live to see me Governor or Senator. 
The next defining moment of my life is when our children were born--first Brent, then Bill and then Brooke. 
The next defining moment was when I was practicing law in a little town of 1,200 people and decided to run for Governor. The day I filed, a poll was taken statewide. It was the last day of the filing deadline. I found that of the eight Democrats in the primary, I had 1-percent name recognition. It was probably the most foolhardy thing I had ever done in my life. But I was trying to keep faith with my father, and I believe strongly in our country and I believe in public service. 
The next defining moment in my life was shortly after I was elected Governor I got an invitation to go to Kansas City to speak at a Truman Day dinner. I told them I couldn't go, the legislature was in session. I just assumed those legislators would screw the dome off the capital if I left town. They came back and said, `If you will agree to do this, we will let you spend an hour with President and Mrs. Truman,' 
and that was more than I could resist. So I went and spent that hour with President Truman and he asked me how I liked being Governor. I said, `I don't like it, it's a real pressure cooker. I am just a country lawyer. This is all new to me and the press is driving me crazy.' 
I was telling him what a terrible job being Governor of Arkansas was, and it suddenly dawned on me I was talking to a man who had to make the decision to drop the atomic bomb that ended World War II. And so I shut up. And then he told me, as I left, `Son, while you are looking at the ceiling every night in the Governor's mansion, wondering what you are going to do, remember one thing: The people elected you to do what you think is right and that is all they expect out of you. They have busy lives. So, remember, always tell people the truth; they can handle it.' 
That didn't sound like very profound advice to me at the time. But indeed it was. I have thought about it every day of my life since then. 
Secondly, he said, `When you are debating in your own mind the issues that you have to confront, you think about this: Get the best advice you can get on both sides of the issue, make up your mind which one is right, and then you do it. That is all the people of the State expect of you--to do what you think is right.' 
So when I drove off the mansion grounds 4 years later, coming to the Senate, as I told my Democratic colleagues the other night, most of whom know this, I came here with the full intention of running for President. I had a very successful 4 years as Governor. I thought the world was my oyster and I fully intended, as I say, to run. The reason I didn't run is because after I had been here for a year, I realized that this whole apparatus was much more complex than I thought it was. 
I told my children, if I had three lives to live, at the end of the last one, I would look back prior to 10 years at the end of it and realize how dumb I was. I was so smart when I graduated from high school, I could hardly bear it. When I got out of law school, the problem was compounded. When I drove off the mansion grounds, I was quite sure I was ready to be king of the world. 
The other night I told Senator Sarbanes I really regret that I have not been as effective a legislator as I should have been. He said, `Everybody feels that way.' What I was really saying, I suppose, is I wish I had known then what I know now. In my dying breath I will look back and think about, really, how I was not as smart this Saturday afternoon as I thought I was. That is what a living, learning experience is. 
So I chose not to run for President. By the time I felt that I was qualified to be President, I decided that it demanded a price that I was not willing to pay. Not to be purely apocalyptic about our future, because I am not, I must say, in all candor, partisanship has reached a point in this country, and the demands for political money have become so great--two very insidious things--that good men and women are opting out of public service, and not to enter public service. Money is corrupting the political process and it threatens our very democracy. 
Since I announced that I would not run last year, I confess to you, Mr. President and colleagues, that I have voted in ways that I would not have if I were running. I think of the few times when I would have had to worry about what kind of a 30-second spot that vote would generate. 
I have cast my share of courageous votes since I have been here, as Harry Truman admonished me to do. I have always tried to use simple tests as to how I voted; How would my children and grandchildren judge me? Did it make me stronger or the Nation stronger? Did it do any irreversible damage to the environment? Is it fair to the less fortunate among us? Does it comport with the thrust of our Constitution, the greatest document ever conceived by the mind of man? Or does it simply make me stronger politically because it satisfies the political whims of the moment? Or does it simply keep the political money supply flowing? 
Speaking of courageous votes, I voted for the Panama Canal Treaties in 1978 and, in all fairness, in 1980, had I had a strong opponent, I would not be standing here right now. I lucked out. But I can tell you, people were absolutely livid about my vote on the Panama Canal Treaties--a fabricated political issue. I ask the American people and my colleagues, who today has been inconvenienced by the Panama Canal Treaties? Is this country any weaker? The truth is that it is stronger. Our relationship with Panama is much stronger. It was the Quemoy and Matsu issue of 1978. 
Incidentally, Henry Bellmon of Oklahoma voted against the Panama Canal Treaties and made a minute-and-a-half speech in doing it, while the rest of us were pontificating for hours trying to justify our positions. He announced he would not run again because, coming from the conservative State of Oklahoma, he knew he didn't have a prayer of being reelected, so hot was that issue. 
When I voted against Ronald Reagan's prayer in school amendment--the only southern Senator to do so, my opponent tried to take advantage of it. But the American people and the people of my State--once you explained what was involved to them, where the school prayers would be written or adopted by the school board and required saying in the schools--came to understand the perils of the amendment. I always tell youngsters, and college groups particularly, when you think about that, you tell me which country that has an official state religion you want to live in. 
Mr. President, one of the greatest moments of my life was when I was Governor and a man came into my office wanting me to talk to the highway department about a late penalty they were going to assess him for being 60 days late in completing a highway job. To shorten the story, I said, `If I do this for you, how do I explain to the next guy who walks in the door why I can't do it for him? I don't want to start down that road.' After a long conversation, when he started to walk out after I told him I could not, under any circumstances, comply with the request, he said, `Governor, that's the reason I voted for you.' 
This institution is a great place. It is supposed to be the deliberative body. The Founding Fathers intended the lower House, the House of Representatives, to be the House of the people. They expected this place to be the deliberative body. It is a curious thing--and the minority leader here knows this--every amendment, every bill that comes up, we immediately start trying to figure out, how stringently can we limit the debate on this issue? There are times when that is fully justified, and there are times when only if you fully air something do the Senate Members really come here well enough informed to vote on it. 
We are still the oldest democracy on Earth. We are still living under the oldest Constitution on Earth, and without men and women of goodwill being willing to offer themselves for service, there is absolutely no assurance that that will always be. Thomas Jefferson said, `The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.' He was not just talking about military vigilance. We are still woefully inadequate in this country in the field of education. If I were the President of the United States and I were looking at a $70 billion surplus, I would make sure the first thing we did was to pass a bill that said no child in this Nation shall be deprived of a college education for lack of money. Look at all the statistics where we rank among the developed nations in education. And look at the state of health care. 
It is good for those who can afford it. And 45 million who have no health insurance and no health care do the best they can. 
Mr. President, I have been richly blessed in my life, as I said, mostly by devoted parents, and good Methodist Sunday school teaching. My mother wanted me to be a Methodist preacher and my father wanted me to be a politician. Think about growing up with that pressure. I am personally blessed with a great family. If I died tomorrow, the people of Arkansas would take note of it, and there would be headlines in all of the papers in the State. But if Betty died tomorrow the people of our State would grieve. She has founded two organizations. 
When Ronald Reagan announced to this country that we might just fire one across the Soviet Union's bow to get their attention, he terrified her. She and a group of congressional wives met around my kitchen table for about 6 months. Finally, I came home one night, and she said, `We are forming an organization. And we feel so strongly about it that we are going to put `peace' in the name. We are going to call it Peace Links'. Ultimately, she had almost 250 congressional wives conscripted into that organization. 
I told her `you are going to get your husband beat.' We are from a conservative State. People in Arkansas believe in a strong defense. People across this Nation believe in a strong defense. She said, `You men are going to get my children killed.' 
She had already spent all of her public life, from the time I was Governor until this day trying to immunize all of the children in this country. And I am not going to go through all of the successes that she has had, which have been staggering. 
The Western Hemisphere is free of polio. Africa will be free of polio by the year 2002. Asia will be free of polio by the year 2004. And measles is next. 
I tell you, she deserves a lot of credit for the virtual elimination of childhood diseases in this country. She went to see President Carter when he first came to power. She said, `I tell you something you can do that will have a lasting effect on the health of this Nation, and it will help you a lot when you run again.' He put Joe Califano at her disposal. And today she and Rosalynn Carter have an organization called `Every Child By Two.' She is still going at it--peace and children. 
I have three beautiful children, and six beautiful, healthy grandchildren. I have been blessed with exceptional staff members, most of whom are more than staff members. They are very good friends. I have been blessed with the support of the people of my State in winning almost every election by 60 percent or more of the vote. I was much more liberal than my constituents. I like to believe that they respected me because they knew what I stood for is what I believed instead of what was politically expedient at any given time. But, for whatever reason, I will always be grateful to them. 
Our State does not deserve to have been torn apart for the past 6 years. I know so many innocent people who have been destroyed, financially and mentally, by a criminal justice system gone awry. You would have to go back to the Salem witchcraft trials to find anything comparable. 
I do not, nor does any Senator, condone the President's conduct. Call it whatever you want--reprehensible, indefensible, unconscionable. Call it anything you want. But most of us take pride in President Clinton's Presidency. And the American people are still saying they like him. But completely aside from that, as I say, I weep sometimes for the unfair treatment to my State, and so many innocent people in it. 
I have been blessed by unbelievable friendships of colleagues. Those friendships will probably wane. It is almost impossible to maintain a relationship with a colleague once you leave here. That is really tragic. But I am realistic. And I know that is what it will be. I know we will have a difficult time having the same kind of relationship, if any at all. But I want them to know that I value their friendship. I value my service with them. I have served with some truly great men and women. And, as Senator Byrd likes to say, only 1,843 men and women have ever been so privileged to serve in this body. 
I am already nostalgic about this Chamber--24 years in this Chamber, the Cloakroom, the hearing rooms, the Capitol itself. For 24 years, the first 20 of which I went home almost every weekend and came back on Sunday night, I never failed, as we flew by the Washington Monument, to get goose bumps. And I hope I never do. So, colleagues, I thank you for being my friend. To the people of my State, I thank you for allowing me to serve here. 
I want to teach, in order to teach children that politics is a noble profession. My father said it long before Bobby Kennedy did. It is a noble calling. And the minute it becomes what so many people think it is, who do you think suffers? All of us do. So I want to inspire this oncoming generation, as my father did me, to get involved in the political process and public service. You have a duty and a responsibility. 
So, to the U.S. Senate, to all of my colleagues, God bless and Godspeed. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.

 Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, my experiences with disasters this year--in addition to the unforgettable destruction of Hurricane Andrew in 1992--have motivated me to re-evaluate the policies and programs that are implemented to ease the pain and economic loss caused by disasters. First, we must recognize that we cannot prevent severe weather events. In fact, it seems that as we approach the millennium, the Nation is experiencing severe weather more frequently--and more intensely--than ever before. Second, as our population grows, our coastal and riverfront communities have greatly expanded, placing an even higher number of citizens at risk from floods and hurricanes. Finally, expanded requirements for housing and residential structures have increased both the number and value of property developments in high-risk areas. 
Taken together, these facts clearly demonstrate that we will continue to experience losses from natural disaster. Therefore, we must act now to limit these inevitable losses through a proactive, nationwide loss prevention and mitigation initiative. We cannot continue to respond to repeat disasters in the same locations in an endless cycle of damage-repair-damage-repair. 
It is for these reasons, Mr. President, that Senator Inhofe and myself introduced the Disaster Mitigation Act of 1998. Our legislation focuses the energies of Federal, State, and local governments on disaster mitigation, shifting the Nation's efforts toward preventative--rather than responsive--actions, in order to prepare our citizens for disasters now and in the future. 
I worked very closely with Senator Inhofe to develop this bipartisan legislation, which has been reported out of the Environment and Public Works Committee. This legislation will more comprehensively and efficiently address the threats we face from disasters of all types. The bill is composed of two titles: Title I seeks to reduce the impact of disasters by authorizing a `pre-disaster mitigation' program; Title II seeks to streamline the current disaster assistance programs to save administrative costs, and to simplify these programs for the benefit of States, local communities, and individual disaster victims. 
To address the problems associated with the damage-repair-damage-repair cycle, the legislation places its primary emphasis on comprehensive pre-disaster mitigation. This bill will authorize a five-year pre-disaster mitigation program, funded at $35 million per year, to be administered by Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. The pre-disaster mitigation program will change the focus of our efforts, at all levels of government, to preventative--rather than responsive--actions in planning for disasters. Such a change in ideology is critical to reducing the short- and long-term costs of natural disasters. It will 
encourage both the public and the private sector, as well as individual citizens, to take responsibility for the threats they face by adopting the concept of disaster mitigation into their everyday lives. Just like energy conservation, recycling, and the widespread use of seat belts, disaster mitigation should become a concept that all citizens incorporate into their day-to-day existence. 
Since 1993, under the leadership of Director James Lee Witt, FEMA has truly changed its way of doing business. In the past five years, FEMA has become more responsive to disaster victims and State and local governments, and has `reinvented' itself by choosing to focus its energy on mitigating, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from the effects of natural hazards. FEMA has already taken an important first step in advocating pre-disaster mitigation by establishing `Project Impact,' their new mitigation initiative, in local communities throughout the nation. I am proud to say that Deerfield Beach, Florida, was the first community to be chosen as a participant in Project Impact. By authorizing the conduct of Project Impact for five years in this legislation, we will definitively endorse both the program and Director Witt's leadership, and we expect that the initiative will produce measurable results in reducing the costs of disaster in the future. 
Mr. President, this legislation is the result of coordination and cooperation with FEMA, the National Association of Emergency Management, the National League of Cities, representatives of the private and voluntary sectors, and numerous other state and local governmental organizations. I strongly believe that this legislation represents a historic change in the nation's efforts to prevent the effects of natural disasters. By taking proactive steps to implement mitigation now, we will reduce the damage, pain, and suffering from disasters in the future that have become all too familiar to us from the disasters we have faced in the recent past. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support Senator Inhofe and myself by joining with us in our efforts to protect the citizens of the U.S. from disasters now and in the future. I ask the Senators who have most recently been affected by Hurricane Georges, as well as the many Senators whose constituents have been impacted by catastrophic disasters over the past several years, to support this legislation and ensure its passage before the end of this session.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, not to be the skunk at the lawn party, but that reminds me of a story I feel like I have to share with you. Recently, in the caucus, Senator Daschle announced the birthdays of three Senators that would occur in the ensuing week. He named them, and John Glenn was one of them, and I forget the other two. Barbara Mikulski was one. Everybody applauded, and I turned to Senator Torricelli and said, `Isn't it strange that we applaud birthdays in this country?' He said, `It is an American anachronism that we applaud the march toward death.'

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, there are few Senators in the U.S. Senate for whom I have ever held a higher esteem than my good friend Bob Bennett. Therefore, several months ago, when I put a hold on this Utah land exchange, which was divinely desired by the Governor and the Interior Department, which is a rare instance--would that all land exchanges had this kind of support--I went to Senator Bennett and I told him privately--and he will agree to this--I told him privately, `Bob, if push comes to shove'--I am not going to go into the details of why I put a hold on it. We all do these things around here occasionally. I never liked it, but sometimes we have to do things to protect ourselves. 
I told Senator Bennett privately, `At the right time, I will take my hold off this bill.' I said, `I want you to know I would never allow something this popular and well received to go down and'----

Mr. BUMPERS. I must say, his determination--his fierce determination--to get this bill passed was reflected in the fact that he asked me every day for 6 months when I was going to take my hold off. This morning, I was very happy to tell him that my reason for putting the hold on in the first place had been resolved. One of the happiest days of my life was the day I could take that hold off to accommodate the Senator and Senator Hatch. I know he has been actively involved in this also. 
I just wanted to say that, Mr. President. I thank the leader very much for yielding the time.

 Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, there are fewer than 800 days left before we reach the goal of eliminating polio throughout the world by the end of the year 2000. That victory will mark the second time in history we have been able to eradicate an infectious disease. The first was the eradication of smallpox, a disease that claimed millions of lives through the centuries. As recently as the 1950's, smallpox was killing over 2 million people each year, despite the fact that an effective vaccine for the disease had been in use since 1796. Smallpox eradication began in 1967. The campaign required 11 years to complete and cost nearly $300 million--$200 million from countries with endemic smallpox and an additional $100 million from international donors. The U.S. was the largest international contributor with a total investment of $32 million. And that investment has repaid itself many times over. Beyond the humanitarian benefits of eliminating this vicious killer, we have enjoyed tremendous economic benefits. The U.S. alone has recouped the equivalent of its entire investment every 26 days since the disease was eradicated. 
The polio effort began in 1988 when the World Health Assembly endorsed the program and set the year 2000 as the target date for global eradication. Thus far, the campaign has been a dramatic success story. Today, four out of every five of the world's children receive polio vaccine. Over the past ten years, polio cases have been reduced by over 90 percent and today more than 150 nations report no polio. All countries in the Western Hemisphere have been polio-free since 1991, and all countries in Europe and the Western Pacific Region--including China, Vietnam and Cambodia--have been polio free for one or more years. 
In my view, the program's achievements are the result of a model public-private partnership. Rotary International began working on immunization programs in the early 1980's and when the World Health Assembly endorsed the polio eradication program in 1988, Rotary became the primary private-sector partner in the campaign. We estimate that Rotary International will have contributed $450 million by the end of the year 2000--the largest private contribution to a public health initiative in history. 
In a combined effort with the health ministries in each country, Rotary, UNICEF, WHO and CDC have mobilized thousands of volunteers to recruit, educate, transport and vaccinate children in a mass campaign strategy. The scope of the program is enormous. In 1997 alone, more than 450 million children in 80 countries were vaccinated against polio through the use of mass campaigns. And the partners have enjoyed unparalleled success in densely populated areas where the risk of disease has been high. During India's first campaign in 1996, more than 87 million children were vaccinated by 100,000 volunteers over a three-day period. 
The last frontier for the program is Africa, where the polio campaign faces formidable challenges. Efforts there have been hindered by poverty, civil conflicts and logistical problems in vaccine delivery. Even with these barriers, the program has enjoyed significant success in many areas of the continent. National Immunization Days have been conducted in over 35 African countries and have put a real dent in the number of polio cases. 
Experts in the field, including my wife Betty who participated in a mass campaign in West Africa earlier this year, have all returned with the same message--We can win the war against polio and Africa can put us over the top by the year 2000, but only if we intensify our efforts in Africa over the next two years. This means more funding from all the donors and more logistical support for programs that are conducted in countries racked by civil conflict and supply shortages. 
As was the case with smallpox, the rewards will far exceed the costs. The U.S. alone will reap annual savings of over $230 million and worldwide savings will exceed $1.5 billion each year. More importantly, we will have conquered a disease responsible for crippling millions of children over our history. Finally, we will have set the stage for our next campaign--the eradication of measles. Regional efforts to eliminate measles have already begun and an international effort is on the horizon. Historically, measles has killed more children than any other infectious disease. Even today, it is responsible for one out of every 10 deaths in children under age 5. Many leaders in the public health field believe that we should begin planning an international strategy over the next two years so that resources can be easily shifted from the polio effort to a measles campaign once polio is eradicated. 
I would like to conclude by paraphrasing the testimony of several witnesses at a recent Appropriations Committee hearing on measles and polio eradication. We live in a time when government and politicians are the targets of great criticism. At the same time, there are few instances of social justice by groups other than government. No social club, no church group, no other organization represents all of us. Only government does that. 
Our immunization successes in this country have resulted from government at its best--government was an aim to protect every child individually and society collectively. It is the product of politics at its best. 
Likewise, while the U.S. effort to support smallpox eradication, polio eradication, child health and child immunization is a consequence of enlightened self interest, it also expresses our understanding, as Americans, of a responsibility to the world and to the future. It is the U.S. government at its very best.

Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the distinguished manager very much. 
Mr. President, this is really a strange scenario for me. I have fought for years to allow States to do exactly what the Supreme Court, in the Quill decision, said we had the right to do, and that was to allow States to make mail order houses collect sales taxes on merchandise being shipped into our respective States. That is what the Supreme Court said. We would not be overturning the Quill decision. We would simply be taking advantage of what the Supreme Court said we had a right to do: Remove the interstate commerce clause as a burden and allow the States, 45 of whom have sales taxes on merchandise from out of State--allow those States who have passed those laws to implement them. They cannot be implemented. We are saying we do not care what kind of laws you pass at the State level, we are not going to allow you to implement them. 
Last week we once again killed my amendment to allow states to mandate that remote sellers collect the taxes they ought to. Yesterday, the Senate decided that we cannot even make Internet sellers alert consumers to the fact that there is a sales tax in the State. We cannot even tell them to alert people to the fact that somebody may knock on their door from their state revenue department and try to collect the unpaid use tax. Think about that. Mr. President, 45 States have a sales tax and we voted yesterday not to even require Internet sellers to tell consumers there may be a tax on their purchases. 
Now we come here today saying we cannot even study it. My God, how far are we going to go?

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, my time left in the Senate is very brief. I have--I don't know--3, 4, at the most 5 days left of active duty on the Senate floor. I read a story in the paper this morning that gives me some satisfaction at least about some of the things I have done since I came here. 
As I have said on the floor many times, there isn't anything as gratifying to a Senator as being able to stand on the floor and say, `I told you so.' 
When I first came here, I had read a story in some science magazine about two young physicists at the University of California at Irvine who had developed a theory that chlorofluorocarbons--a gas, normally found in aerosols and freon, which we use in our air conditioners and refrigerators--that these chlorofluorocarbons that we sprayed on our hair in the morning were wafting up into the stratosphere over a period of 12 to 15 years and destroying the ozone layer. 
Before I came to the Senate, I thought `ozone' was a town in Johnson County, AR, which indeed it is. As a matter of fact I spoke at the high school graduation at Ozone last year. Nevertheless, this theory about something we were doing rather mindlessly that had almost cataclysmic consequences for the future intrigued me. 
I had been put on the Space Committee when I came here. I did not ask for the Space Committee--it was a spacey committee. We abolished it a couple years after I came here, but I asked the chairman, Senator Moss of Utah, if I could hold some hearings on this theory and invite some atmospheric scientists to come in and testify. And he said, `I have no objection to that.' Just ad hoc hearings. I certainly was not chairman of the subcommittee or anything else. I had just gotten here. He said, `I don't mind you doing that, but you need to get a Republican to sit with you in these hearings.' So I recruited my good friend, Senator Domenici, from New Mexico. 
Senator Domenici and I held nine hearings over a period of about 6 months. We had the best atmospheric scientists in the United States coming in and testifying--Dr. Rowland and Dr. Molina. 
In those hearings, we probably had an average of 15 people in the audience. We had a television camera show up only once. When we finished, Senator Domenici did not feel quite as strongly as I did about abolishing the manufacturing of CFCs immediately, and so Senator Packwood and I took it on and brought it to the floor of the Senate to abolish the manufacturing of CFCs. 
The chemical lobbyists in that lobby, through that door, were so thick I could hardly get to the floor to vote. And as I recall, we got a whopping 33 votes. I was arguing that if we were to cut off all manufacturing of CFCs right now, we still had 12 to 15 years of damage coming because that is how long it took from the time you sprayed your hair the morning we voted for it to get there and start destroying ozone. 
You know all the arguments: This is untested; unproved; and we need to `study' it. That is the way you kill things around here--study it. And so that is the end of the story in 1975. 
In 1985, the National Academy of Sciences, who we had assigned to do the study--10 years later--discovered that there was a developing hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica. And almost every year since then that ozone hole has grown bigger and bigger and bigger. We have phased out the manufacturing of CFCs--we do not use it anymore to spray our hair with; and we have substitutes for air-conditioning and refrigeration. Nevertheless, if you saw the Post this morning, the current estimates are that the ozone hole is deeper and wider than it has ever been, and has been growing almost every year since 1975 when we first discovered it. 
The good news is, while scientists were shocked by the size of the ozone hole in their current study, they still believe that it can be stabilized by the year 2050. Well, let's hope so, because if it isn't, we can anticipate 300,000 additional cases of skin cancer. 
I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.

Mr. BUMPERS. The ozone layer protects us from the ultraviolet rays of the Sun. The hole that we have already caused is going to cause thousands and thousands of cases of skin cancer before we even begin to stabilize the ozone layer. 
Mr. President, I tell that little story with some satisfaction, because I daresay there are not many Senators who fought as many losing battles in the U.S. Senate as I have. So the only reason I tell that story is to let people know that sometimes when you cast unpopular votes you will be proven right. A lot of Senators get beat before they ever get a chance to be proven right. 
I voted against more constitutional amendments than any Senator in the U.S. Senate. I am proud of every one of them. Rest assured, if they bring the flag desecration amendment up again, I will be happy to vote against that, too, for reasons I will not belabor now. 
I see my good friend from Nevada wanting to speak. And I want to follow him on the matter pending before the Senate. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I agree mostly with what the Senator from Nebraska said. I prefer a 2-year moratorium. 
As the Senator from Nebraska stated, earlier this year, we passed a bill to reform the Internal Revenue Service. That legislation arose from the IRS Commission, which had a mere 15 statutory months to take a top to bottom look at, and make recommendations on, how to restructure the IRS. The entire commission process plus the legislating process resulted in a bill the President signed in just a shade over two years. 
The point I am trying to make is this: Fair taxation of the Internet is not more complicated than restructuring the IRS. The bill to which the two amendments presently pending are offered, is a bill that provides a 2-year moratorium. Two years is enough. To allow any more time would do nothing but prove that the U.S. Senate is knuckling under to the Internet industry. 
I see my good friend from Florida on the floor. He and I were both Governors. The Governors signed off on 2 years and now here is a letter saying they hope we will compromise on 3 years. `Do not adopt,' they say, `the 4 year moratorium. Accept the compromise of 3 years.' 
I can tell you, Senator, if I were still Governor of my State, I would be squealing like a pig under a gate. Here a significant percentage of the State's entire tax base is being eroded, literally destroyed, by remote sellers, and the Internet industry and the Governors say let's compromise at 3 years. We are willing not to tax the Internet for a 3-year period. Think about that. In 3 years' time the estimates are that sales over the Internet will be $300 billion. We know that catalog sales right now are in excess of $100 billion. 
The States are saying they are willing to forgo their right to tax the Internet for 3 years. If there were no catalog sales, if there were no Internet, $400 billion worth of goods would be sold by Main Street merchants in America on which they would pay a 4, 5, 6, or 7 percent sales tax to support their community schools, their fire departments, their police departments, their landfills, paving their streets and everything else that cities have to do. 
Yes, if I were still Governor, trying to raise teachers' salaries, trying to making better schools, trying to increase the size of the police department and reduce crime in my community, if I were charged with the responsibility as mayor or Governor and had the responsibility of our children, our environment, all of those things, 
I would never sit still. I would never sit still for allowing these people to escape taxation. It has been a mystery to me for 7 years, as I have fought to try to give the States the right--not the mandate, but the right--to make remote sellers collect sales taxes. There are only 7,500 of them. The bill I offered would only affect 675 of them. We exempted everybody that did less than $3 million in business a year. I have been soundly defeated each time I have tried to correct this problem. And as I leave the U.S. Senate after 24 years, it is a mystery to me. Why do people vote to allow the tax bases in their States to be eroded when their Governors and their mayors and local officials are scrounging for money to improve schools and everything else? 
My State has a sales and use tax on all mail-order sales coming into my State. Do you know how much we collect on it? Zero. Do you know why? Because the tax is on the purchaser. I promise you there is not 1 in 10,000 people in the State of Arkansas that even know that the tax exists. Of course, they don't pay it. Literally millions of dollars of goods come into my State every year on which not one cent of tax is collected, even though it is owed. But it is owed by the person who bought the merchandise, and he or she doesn't even know the tax exists. 
When we try to say to the States--Senator Graham, Senator Dorgan and myself--that we are going to help you, we want to honor what you are trying to do, they have all championed my bill. They haven't been very effective, but the Governors and mayors have all championed my legislation every year I have offered it. But the U.S. Senators sit up here, with all their arrogance, and say to their legislatures, Governors and mayors: We don't care what you want, we will decide what you get. For 7 years, so far, and much longer than that, we have said you get nothing. We are not going to let you tax mail-order sales. So quit talking about it. You might as well quit talking about it. I think 30 or 35 votes is my high-water mark in trying to address what I consider a terrible problem. 
The Presiding Officer heard me talk a while ago about how the first thing I did when I came here was to try to stop the manufacturing of CFCs that are destroying our ozone. We all know the ozone is being systematically destroyed, but back then we had to study it. It was just a theory. As I said, the best way to kill something in the U.S. Senate is to say let's study it. If you want to never hear of something again, get an amendment adopted that says, no, you can't do that anymore, you have to study it. 
That is what we are doing here. We are saying to the mayors and Governors and legislatures of our respective States--45 of the 50 States already have a tax, but it is on the consumer and nobody knows it, and they are desperate. The reason I mention that again is because I will be sitting down in Arkansas, or someplace, a few years from now and this thing will crescendo and will reach a level where the Senate won't have any choice but to deal with it and to give the States that right, because if they don't their schools are going to start crumbling, their police departments are going to go to pot, as are their fire departments. 
Did you see in the paper this morning where Amazon.com's stock is selling for over $100 a share, and they haven't made a nickel profit yet? It is estimated they are selling two-thirds of all the books sold over the Internet, and their sales are growing exponentially. I have a lot of friends that never buy a book from a local bookstore anymore. They buy it over the Internet. Not only do they get a little discount, they pay no sales tax on it. So this morning's paper says Amazon.com has become so terrific and so powerful that a publishing house is buying Barnes & Noble's on-line system. They have a third and Amazon.com has two-thirds. The publishing house knows that they are going to be put out of business if they don't get with the program, because Amazon.com is going to be selling all the books in the country. So they are buying Barnes & Noble's on-line book service. 
That is good for the consumers, but it is terrible for State and local government. Yesterday afternoon, I offered an amendment to say at least make the Internet state that the merchandise you buy may be subject to local taxation. You think about that. Senator Dorgan voted with me, Senator Graham voted with me, and we got 27 votes. They don't even want the people to know that there is a sales tax on which the purchaser is liable. 
Then, this morning, we finally won a little battle. There was an amendment here that I could not believe that said you can't study this issue. Think of that. Normally you use studies to kill things. This morning, we get an amendment saying you can't even study it. I am telling you, I don't know what the Internet and these mail-order catalog houses have on the Senate, but it must be something. Larry Flynt ought to be offering a million dollars to find out the answer to that one. So here we are standing around debating an issue, the merits of which are not even in question. Everybody knows that we ought not to be giving a free ride to the to people who are selling merchandise by the hundreds of billions of dollars over the Internet and eroding the tax base of almost every State in the Nation. I am for computers; I am for technology, but I am not for allowing them to destroy the tax base of the states.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, my good friend, has been a steadfast ally with me in this battle for many, many years, because the State of North Dakota took this case to the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court said we are reversing ourselves in previous decisions. If the Congress wants to give the right to the States to collect this tax, they can now do it. But Congress has to do it. Congress has steadfastly refused to do what the Supreme Court told them they had the authority to do. 
I will be sitting down in Arkansas fishing 3 years from now, and I assume that is probably the number of years we are going to adopt in a few minutes. I am not going to vote for it. I am not going to vote for 4 years. I am not going to vote for the bill either. It has a 2-year moratorium. As far as I am concerned, that is enough. 
But having said that, I will be down there fishing. I will be watching C-SPAN. I will smile to myself when somebody gets up as though it is the most original idea that was ever created, and says, `Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk that would create a commission to study taxation of the Internet. We have had 3 years to study it, but we are really not quite finished and we don't know what havoc this is going to create. We need to get the National Academy of Sciences, the Council of Economic Advisers, or the GAO. We need somebody to study this a while longer.' They will buy it again. I can tell you that 3 years from now the makeup of this place will not change that much. They will buy it again, and we will extend it again. But just like the ozone layer, the time will come when everybody knows that you can't do it anymore, because the States and the cities can't afford to let this go any longer. They are barely making ends meet the way it is. That is the way it goes. If you do not learn anything in 24 years here, you will learn the way the game is played. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to take a firm stand on an issue that I felt strongly about for so many years. As I say, I don't intend to vote for a second-degree amendment which would take it to 4 years. I don't intend to vote for the second-degree amendment that will take us to 3 years. The bill, as it came out of committee and came to this floor provided for a 2-year study. That is too long. They don't need 2 years. I am going to vote for the bill because 2 years is much too long anyway. 
I don't believe there ought to be a tax exemption for anybody who is competing with Main Street merchants. 
Let me add one further thing. The Senator from North Dakota piqued my memory on this. Outside of being the entire Charleston South Franklin County Bar Association, I was also a Main Street merchant. I can tell you even then, 40 years ago, my biggest competitor was the catalog. I detested it. I was a Main Street merchant having to organize the Christmas parade, be president of the Chamber of Commerce, and trying to attract industry into town so we could create a few jobs. I paid sales tax on every dime I sold, all of which went for the schools of our State and our city, which went to the police department, which went to the fire department, which went to help us pave our streets, take care of our landfill, dispose of our garbage. 
Those are the things that Main Street merchants do in this country. We are saying to them and the National Federation of Independent Businesses--NFIB. I don't want to get started on them. As far as I am concerned, they represent big business, and not small business. But I think they are for this bill. It is the most damaging thing to Main Street merchants I can imagine. I know. I used to be one. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Over the past several years, the Congress has funded water quality grants through three separate items with in the CSREES Special Grants Program, including the two the Senator from North Dakota mentions. The fiscal year 1999 appropriations bill which Senator Cochran and I reported to the Senate earlier this year included a total of $2,897,000 for these activities. This amount includes funds at last year's level for the North Dakota program and the balance directed to the undesignated water quality item. The House included the third water quality grant and provided a total of $3,389,000 for all water quality special grants. 
The conferees recognized the need to strengthen our cooperative research activities for water quality, in a manner similar to the treatment of food safety and other priority research areas, and decided to consolidate and increase the funding level for water quality through the CSREES Special Grants Program. Accordingly, all funding for water quality research was moved to a single item and in recognition of the excellent record of the North Dakota program, language was included in the Statement of Managers explaining that the North Dakota program should continue to secure funding through that item.

Mr. BUMPERS. Yes, I am. I understand the North Dakota program, developed through the Red River Water Management Consortium (RRWMC) is doing important work to help understand the occurrence, transport, and fate of agricultural chemicals in the Northern Great Plains region. I believe it is also noteworthy that the RRWMC is a basin-wide water management group, comprised of a number of government and industry stakeholders throughout the water basin and has included partners from municipalities, agricultural industries, county governments, resource conservation and development organizations, and public utilities. Cooperation and coordination of all these groups is vital and the network established in North Dakota should serve as an excellent model for other parts of the United States where water contamination, especially from agricultural runoff, posses a real or potential threat to the environment and public health.

Mr. BUMPERS. Yes, I believe they are. The CSREES water quality programs are intended to help investigate the impacts of non-point source pollution and recognize the public's concern about the possible risks to the environment resulting from the use of agricultural chemicals. Therefore, the purpose of the RRWMC's activities are clearly consistent with the goals of the agency's water quality research mission. Further, I understand that the RRWMC has been able to leverage non-federal funds on a ratio of about two to one. Given current budget constraints, this accomplishment is to be commended especially in recognition of the fact that the CSREES water quality grant has received nearly $48 million in appropriations since 1990 and has only been able to leverage approximately $1 million per year during that time. The record of RRWMC in leveraging non-federal funds is, therefore, all the more impressive and worthy of these federal dollars. In view of the important ongoing work of the RRWMC on the important issues of water quality protection, their cooperative relationships with a wide variety of stakeholders, and their ability to leverage non-federal resources, I believe the conferees would agree that RRWMC should be able to secure funding of, at least, last year's level in the coming fiscal year.

Mr. President, I join my friend and colleague, Senator Cochran, in bringing to the floor the conference report to accompany H.R. 4101, the fiscal year 1999 appropriations bill for agriculture, rural development and related agencies. This is the last annual agriculture appropriations bill which I will jointly author with my friend from Mississippi, and I regret to report that the progress this year has not been as smooth as in years past. Last year, my fellow conferees were able to conclude the business of the committee on conference in approximately 5 minutes. By contrast, it took us 5 days this year and I fear, at this late date, all hurdles toward enactment are not fully cleared. In fact, I, along with all Senate Democrat members of the conference committee who attached our signatures to the official conference papers, did so with an exception to one of the titles included in the conference report. 
Aside from the one area still in disagreement, the conference report before us is as good a product as was possible under the budgetary constraints we faced. We include in this measure nearly $52 million in new spending for food safety. This figure is well below the budget request, but represents a good increase in spending for the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration to help ensure that our Nation's food supplies remain the safest in the world. 
The conference report also provides adequate levels for the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Program, including an increase for the WIC Farmers Market Program of up to $15 million. Overall, the USDA food assistance programs remain the single largest component of this conference report, totaling $36 billion in new spending. 
Rural development is another key element of this conference report. Included is more than $4.25 billion in rural housing program levels and nearly $725 million in budget authority for the Rural Community Advancement Program, which includes the water and wastewater program. I have seen firsthand the benefits these programs bring to rural areas in my State and I am glad we were able to achieve these levels for the coming year. Also, the conference report includes a special recognition for the needs of the Lower Mississippi River Delta, an often overlooked region of our Nation that has long deserved our special attention. I have worked for many years to improve conditions in this region and I am happy to have included special consideration for the delta in this measure. 
Agricultural research continues to receive the attention of our subcommittee. The level of spending for the Agricultural Research Service in this conference report is higher than either the House or Senate levels prior to conference. In addition, we were able to increase the levels of funding for basic formula research for our Nation's 1862, 1890, and 1994 institutions. Funding for these institutions has been frozen for far too long, and this conference report provides a 7 percent increase above last year. Enhanced agricultural research is a commitment the Congress has made to our farmers and consumers and this conference report lies up to that commitment. 
I would be most remissed if I didn't pause to give credit, to my friend, Senator Cochran, for facing the grim budgetary challenge we faced this year. Our allocation was well below what was available for fiscal year 1998 and going into conference we had to adjust our numbers downward toward the lower House allocation. Our task was made even more difficult by the assumed enactment of hundreds of millions of dollars in user fees that looked good on paper but only served to raise faint expectations beyond what was possible. This conference report includes a general provision that will, hopefully, forestall the use of projected user fees in next year's budget and keep everyone working within a budgetary framework more closely associated with the realities we all must face. 
Given my years of work on this subcommittee, and my close friendship with Senator Cochran, I am greatly saddened by my reluctance to give 
unequivocal support for all matters contained in this conference report. As we began conference deliberations with the House, the President made it clear that two items under discussion were of such importance that their inclusion in the conference report would result in a veto. I must admit that I never thought the agriculture appropriations bill would ever be the target of a Presidential veto. In fact, the agriculture appropriations bill is usually approved by the Senate 100 to 0. I remind my colleagues that a few years go when much of the Federal Government faced a shutdown from failed appropriations bills, the agencies funded under this bill were among the few not included in that Governmental debacle. Such has been the history of the agriculture appropriations process during my tenure and it saddens me to think that I might be leaving the Senate with that possibility lurking as strongly as it does today. 
One of the items which drew the attention of the President was a provision in the House bill that placed a limitation on the Food and Drug Administration's funding for any testing, development, or approval of the drug RU-486, a chemical used to induce an abortion. Leaving for a moment the argument that science is better left to scientists than politicians, the inclusion of the abortion debate in the agriculture appropriations bill was a most unfortunate attempt to drag this bill down with one of the most divisive and politically charged issues of our time. I am very pleased to report that the Senate conferees made it crystal clear that the Senate was not going to allow the issue of abortion to infect the agriculture appropriations bill with the same paralysis that has inflicted other subcommittees. If the Senate had not held firm, a very bad precedent would have been set and all agriculture appropriations bills in the future would become the venue for, and be held hostage by, an issue best reserved for other forums. 
The other item of Presidential disapproval is tied to the levels of assistance for farmers and ranchers who are facing the most pressing financial times in recent years, maybe ever. It is on this point that I had to part with my friend Senator Cochran and express an opinion that our measure falls short of meeting current needs. 
The conference report includes provisions put forward by the majority party that strives to bring relief to farmers and ranchers who are suffering from lost crops and low prices. However, my concern is with the manner in which the assistance is to be provided. In order to help farmers suffering from low prices, the conference report would simply allow for additional `Freedom to Farm' payments to go to all producers who hold a Agricultural Market Transition Act contract. The fallacy with this approach is that it does not target the additional funds to people who are suffering from either crop failure or fallen prices. Instead, it makes funds available to landlords who may have received cash rent for their lands, suffered no loss at all, and in many instances never even faced a risk of loss in the first place. 
We have to recognize that many, though not all, farmers across America are suffering. Most are suffering from losses this year, but some from losses over several years. Some farmers have a crop to harvest, but low prices preclude any chance of a profit. The purpose of the Democratic alternative for disaster assistance is to make sure the relief payments go to those in need. 
I have heard from farmers in my State who have lost everything this year. They tell me that this year is worse than the crop failures of 1980, which was the worst year since the Great Depression. The Democratic alternative provides more relief, 100 percent more in fact, for farmers in my State and I feel we should not turn our backs on the one segment of the national economy that has not been surging into double digit profits on Wall Street. The President has indicated he will veto this bill if additional farm relief is not added. Congress needs to act swiftly to amend the shortfall in this bill and send to the President a package that truly meets the needs of farmers and ranchers. 
Mr. President, this brings me to the close of my last annual agriculture appropriations bill on the floor of the Senate. I want to once more thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Cochran, for his years of friendship on and off this subcommittee. I also want to thank all other members for their cooperation over the years. 
Mr. President, I say in closing that this is a very complex matter, this matter of disaster relief. The only disagreement on this side and the other side of the aisle is over the disaster provisions. As I say, they are both fairly complicated, and I am hoping that if the President vetoes the bill, as he has promised to do, we will be able to work out something--maybe not everything the President wanted, maybe more than others wanted--and that we will be able to reach a compromise that will actually take care of farmers. 
My fear is that, this being what I consider probably the worst year in the history for agriculture since the Great Depression, that the proposal in the bill is not adequate to save an awful lot of farmers who deserve saving. So I am hoping if the President does veto the bill, we can come back and hammer out an agreement that will save a lot more farmers. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. Forty-five States have sales and use taxes on sales of merchandise coming into their State from another State. The problem is, they can't collect it because the people who are buying the merchandise don't know that there is a sales tax on the goods coming in. I think Maine collects about $1 million, and that is probably as much as any State collects. 
People are always getting rude surprises. All of a sudden somebody knocks on the door and they say, `We saw where you just bought $50,000 worth of furniture from North Carolina. You owe sales tax.' They say, `The ad said no sales tax.' `I don't care what the ad says. There is a North Carolina sales tax on merchandise brought in from out of State.' 
My amendment says on Internet sales, if you sell into a State, you must notify people with a short notice that simply says, `This merchandise may be subject to a sales or use tax in your State.' You could be subject to a civil penalty or a criminal penalty--something like 100 bucks. If you want to check, you should check with your local revenue department to determine whether or not your State has a tax. 
I want every Member in this body to ask this question: Why would you vote against this when your legislature has specifically provided that sale of goods from across the State lines are taxable? If you say they are not taxable, you are flying right into the face of the will of the people in your State who said they should be. 
All I am saying, people should not be misled and should be told that when they buy this merchandise it may be subject to a sales or use tax. It is just that simple. Why wouldn't you? If your State is one of the 45 States that have a tax, why would you not want a company selling goods on the Internet--not mail-order houses on the Internet--why would you not want to tell the customer he may be subject to it, instead of him getting a rude surprise and some auditor knocking on his door? 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. BUMPERS. The reason there is an objection is because the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from Oregon do not come from the 45 States that have sales taxes. 
They are opposed to this because their State is not one of the 45 States that do have a sales or use tax. Secondly, the unanimous consent agreement limits amendments to relevant amendments. If you put mail-order catalog sales in, it is not relevant. That is the reason I confined it to the Internet and asked consent to extend it. That is the reason they objected. They don't have to face a legislature or people back home who passed a sales or use tax on Internet sales coming in from out of State, because their States don't have a sales or use tax. My State does have that use tax, and we would like to collect it. Your revenue departments and your Governors would like to collect it, too. 
All I am saying is, Internet sales simply ought to state a simple thing--that the goods you are buying could be subject to a use or sales tax in your State; if you want to know whether it does or not, contact your local revenue department. What is wrong with that? Who can oppose that? The taxes have already been passed by the legislature. It is just that they can't collect it unless they stand at the border and intercept every piece of merchandise that comes through the mail or on the highway. They can't do it. 
So all I am saying is, if these 45 States have seen fit to levy taxes on out-of-State sales to make the playing field a little more level with the main street merchants, we ought to give them such help as we can. I am saying they ought to at least advise these people that these purchases might be subject to a use or sales tax. 
Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time if everybody else is, and we will go to a vote.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, when Senator Cochran and I reported the fiscal year 1999 appropriations bill for agriculture, rural development and related agencies to the Senate earlier this year, our recommendation included maintaining the studies and evaluations activities for USDA's food programs with the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). This recommendation was consistent with the President's budget request. 
The studies and evaluations activities are important for a number of reasons. These activities enable better program management of the several domestic feeding programs administered through USDA. We should remember that USDA's nutrition programs comprise the lions' share of the USDA budget and are often all that stands between many of our people and abject hunger. Because of the long-term health implications associated with a healthy, nutritious diet, it is absolutely vital that program administrators have access to relevant and updated information regarding nutrition and program delivery.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I would like to note the importance of coordinating the research agenda for the food program studies and evaluations between USDA's research and nutrition subcabinet officers. I cannot understate the importance of these two branches of USDA continuing to work together, as they have done this year, to ensure that FNS' research agenda meets the needs of program managers to have adequate information to guide their program decisions.

Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator from Iowa is correct. While the conference report does not allow for the transfer of title of the facility to USDA, and the Statement of Managers includes language limiting the use of funds for operational costs, that limitation does not apply to the allocation of funds pursuant to normal ARS scientist assignments. The Statement of Managers includes direction that an increase of $2 million for ARS research at Ames, Iowa, is included as reflected in the accompanying table. That table indicates an increase of $1 million for the National Animal Disease Center and an additional $1 million for Livestock Management. The latter amount is available for use at the National Swine Research Center consistent with normal ARS personnel funding allocations.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me say, and I would be remiss if I did not say it at this point, I think, one of the things I will miss deeply when I leave the U.S. Senate will be the excellent relationship I have had with the chairman of this committee. He has been, probably, much more generous to me through the years that he was chairman than I was to him when I was chairman. But I want the whole Senate to know of my deep admiration for him. I want the whole country to know it. He is a consummate gentleman. He is a man of impeccable integrity. He is accommodating to a fault to his colleagues. And one of the things I will miss is his counsel, advice and common sense. 
He is the personification of what public service should be. I have been most honored to serve with him and I will cherish his friendship always. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first, let me thank my very good friend, my distinguished colleague from the great State of Oregon, Mr. Wyden, for his very kind and gracious comments. He talked about how he is going to miss me. Rest assured, wherever I am, if he will just raise the window, he can probably hear me. 
But on a more serious note, I consider Senator Wyden to be one of the finest additions to the U.S. Senate in my 24-year tenure here. He is truly becoming a great Senator, but more than anything else he has great values. Great values are the first thing you have to have to be a good Senator. So while I am prepared to leave at the end of this year, Senator Wyden is one of the Senators I will certainly miss. 
Let me just start off by saying, this amendment deals with the rights of States to require mail-order catalog houses to collect sales taxes on merchandise shipped into their States. 
L.L. Bean, which does over $1 billion a year, ships a lot of merchandise into my State of Arkansas, as does Lands' End, as does 6,000 or 7,000 other mail-order catalog houses; and they do not pay one cent of tax to the State of Arkansas. They do not pay one cent of tax to any State. And I will tell you why. 
In 1967, the Supreme Court said, in the National Bellas Hess v. Department of Revenue case, that States may not require mail-order catalog houses to collect use taxes for them because it violates the due process clause in the Constitution, No. 1, and, No. 2, it violates the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution--finis, end of story. 
In 1992, as mail-order catalogs sales began to mushroom in this country, and States could see that their tax base was being eroded--incidentally, we depend on the sales tax in our State for 50 percent of our educational funds--being eroded by this constant stream of catalogs coming into people's homes every day through the mailbox--I have been checking; I have been averaging between 5 and 10 a day for the past year--North Dakota said, `Enough is enough.' So they brought a lawsuit that resulted in the Quill decision in 1992. 
They tried to get the Supreme Court to reverse the Bellas Hess decision that prohibited States from making mail-order houses collect sales tax. It is called a use tax. It is the same thing, but if it comes from out of State we call it a use tax. And the Supreme Court, in a very rare remarkable case of sanity, said, `We hereby reverse the National Bellas Hess case to the extent that we hold that the requirement of a State to make mail-order houses collect sales taxes on goods coming into their States no longer--no longer--violates the due process clause. However, we are not removing our objection to the fact that we believe the State's right to tax mail-order houses still is a violation of the interstate commerce clause.' Now because the Commerce Clause grants Congress exclusive authority over interstate commerce, Congress may, if it chooses, grant the states the authority to require out-of-state tax collection. 
So here we are on October 2, 1998, about my sixth year to try to do something about this patently unfair proposition, asking Congress, please, do not impose a tax. My amendment does not impose a tax on anybody; it does not require the States to impose a tax on anybody. It simply does what the Supreme Court said in 1992 we had a right to do, and that is to give the States the right to require out-of-state sellers to collect sales tax on any goods they ship into that State. And what is wrong with that? 
You know, in 1995, I offered this amendment to the unfunded mandates bill, stood right here where I am standing now, made the same speech I am making today. You remember the distinguished Senator from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, offered the unfunded mandates bill. I never saw as many tears shed in the U.S. Senate in my life as I saw during that debate--crocodile tears, of course--for those poor States and counties and municipalities that the Government was always imposing mandates on. We passed laws, and we said to the States and the counties and the cities, `You have got to do this; you must do that.' And it was costing the States `gazillions.' They said, `Let's get that old, mean Federal Government off the backs of the States and local governments. And in the future, any time Congress passes a law that mandates that the States and local governments do anything, we will make a computation of what it is going to cost the States to comply with it, and we will send them the money.' I did not vote for that. I did not vote for it for a lot of reasons. I am not here to debate that one all over again. That is a done deal. 
But the interesting thing is, when I offered this amendment on the unfunded mandates bill, I said, `Here is a mandate that you're imposing on the States by doing nothing. If you're so concerned about the States and local governments, why don't you help them with the biggest unfunded mandate of all?' It is about $4 billion a year we impose on the States by saying, you cannot collect taxes on anybody but the poor old sucker on Main Street who collects the tax on every sale, every bag of groceries, every refrigerator, every automobile, if he happens to live in your hometown or your State. 
Yes, I was a Main Street merchant as well as a jackleg lawyer. I had a hardware, furniture and appliance store. And the catalog houses were my biggest competitors, not the guy down the street--the catalog sales. I was President of the Chamber of Commerce. 
I arranged for the annual banquet. I was in charge of the Christmas parade. I was on the school board. I did all of those things to make my town a decent place to raise my children. And I made everybody who bought a dollar's worth of goods pay 3, 4 or 5 cents in sales taxes. It went to teachers' salaries. It went to law enforcement, police officers, and to sweep the streets. It went to test the purity of the water we drank. That is what we depended on, the sales tax. But only, of course, if you happen to live there. 
Now, think about the fact that mail-order houses in this country are selling over $100 billion worth of goods through the mail. There are a few who collect this tax. Do you know why? Because they know it is right. Ask Senator Bennett from Utah, a big stockholder and one of the original finders of a big mail-order house called Franklin Quest about collecting use taxes. Don't take my word for it. Ask Senator Bennett what they did. I will tell you and let him ratify it. They sat around the table and said, `Shall we or shall we not collect sales taxes for the States in which we sell merchandise?' He said they discussed it and they concluded that, as good citizens, they should. And they did. I said, `Bob, when I was chairing the Small Business Committee and held hearings on this subject, they always talked about how complicated and difficult it was because there are 7,000 taxing jurisdictions in this country.' He said, `Don't be fooled by that. Every month we push a computer button and it is done. It isn't complicated at all.' 
Now, 7 or 8 years ago when I started this, that was the principal debate--`It is so complicated. It is just so much paperwork, we can't do it.' You rarely hear that argument anymore, since Senator Bennett came and since I have enlightened this body about what he said. He is immensely respected here. 
The NFIB--I don't know where they are now--in 1995, they said only about 35 percent of their people wanted Congress to take this action. I was getting ready to say something unkind, but I won't pursue that any further. 
I simply want to say to my colleagues, where do you think this country is headed? The underlying bill is to give all sales on the Internet a free ride. The bill before the Senate is a 2-year moratorium. There will be amendments offered here to extend the moratorium to 3 or 5 years. 
Listen to this, colleagues, because as I say, I am not lambasting Senator Wyden's bill on Internet taxes. I am simply fortifying the argument I want to make on remote sales. That is, right now in 1997 Internet sales were roughly $8 billion. It is now estimated that by the year 2002 Internet sales will be $300 billion. You can buy an automobile on the Internet, no sales tax; you can buy a refrigerator; you can buy your furniture; you can buy anything you want on the Internet. 
Now, if we are looking at Internet sales of $300 billion a year by the year 2002, what will they be at the end of 5 years and how much revenue will the States have lost? I ask my colleagues, why in the name of God will you go back home and tell the chamber of commerce your heart is in the right place, you are for small business, you are for Main Street merchants, and turn right around and put them at a hopeless, competitive disadvantage? Why? Why should I organize the Christmas parade, pay my taxes to go to the schools, taxes for law enforcement, the fire department, while other people ship 4 million tons of catalogs into the States for them to dispose of? 
Ask any mayor, any Governor, what is their biggest headache? Almost invariably, it will come back, `We need more money.' Secondly, `Our biggest headache is the landfill.' Not only do states have to dispose of 4 million tons of catalogs, they also have to handle the boxes and the crates that the merchandise comes in. How can the catalog people tell us, `We don't cause a burden. We are no burden to the local jurisdictions. Why do you want to tax us? We don't send our children to school in Charleston, AR. Why should we pay sales taxes?' 
I will tell you precisely why they should. Because the revenue base of the States and local jurisdictions of this country is being eroded to the point where it will wind up being about half of what it is right now or less. Let me ask you a better question: Why shouldn't they pay a sales tax and compete with the people who live in those communities that have to pay taxes? It is a mystery to me. 
I don't take on these causes that I continue to lose for the fun of it. I take them on because I feel strongly about them. In 1995, the Senator from Maine, Mr. Cohen--who is now Secretary of Defense--and I got into a debate here. They said the Finance Committee had not even held a hearing. Of course, the Finance Committee hadn't held a hearing, the chairman of the Finance Committee doesn't favor this bill. 
Do you know something else? Somebody else said, let's study this. That is always the way out, `Let's study it.' For 7 years on the mining laws, they said we need to study this. We have been studying the mining laws since 1872, and the law is still fully intact, just as crass, just as base, just as unfair now as it was in 1872, and we are still studying it. 
We will study this some more. Somebody will make the suggestion, `We have to study this. We don't know what the full impact of it is.' 
Let me shift gears a moment to another item, and this is always shocking to anybody you tell it to. Unhappily, most things said on the U.S. Senate floor don't get any higher than the dome here. Nobody hears it. Forty-five States in this country have a use tax. Arkansas has one. It says to L.L. Bean, if you ship merchandise into Arkansas, the person you sell it to is liable for the Arkansas use tax. 
It is the same thing as a sales tax. In my State, it is 5 percent. 
How many people in Arkansas do you think realize that when they buy something from a remote seller, they are responsible for that use tax? Maybe about 1 in 200,000. Nobody knows it. Yet, 45 States have it. Just 10 to 15 States--I forget which number--but it was 10 in 1995; so it is maybe 15 or 20 by now--have laws that say you must report on your State income tax whether or not you bought anything from out of State. 
Now, the State of Maine does something that is really unique and, in my opinion, patently unconstitutional. If you live in Maine, when you fill out your income tax return, there is a line that says, `Did you buy anything from out of State?' You put in `yes' or `no,' and if the answer is yes, you put the amount down. 
Let's assume you bought some furniture for $1,000. I don't know what the sales tax is in Maine, but if it is 5 percent, you are liable for $50. `Please multiply 5 percent times the amount you bought.' And so everybody kind of routinely ignores that because they don't want to pay it and they don't have to admit that they bought anything from out of State. 
So do you know what else Maine does? They say that if this line is empty and you don't report having bought anything out of State from a mail-order house, please multiply .0366 times whatever your income is. If you make $30,000 a year, you put $11 on that line. 
As I say, in my opinion, that is powerfully unconstitutionally. That is a tax that nobody ought to have to pay, and it is the wrong way to do it. A lot of people get rude awakenings. One couple from Florida went up to North Carolina because they saw this big catalog saying, `Buy your furniture at the factory in North Carolina and pay no sales tax.' Not many people do this anymore. When I started in on this issue years ago, it was very common. Or, `Buy your tile or your linoleum for your kitchen from'--such-and-such--`no sales tax.' 
So this couple went from Florida to North Carolina and bought $25,000 to $35,000 worth of furniture. Later on, the North Carolina furniture company is audited and they find that they have sold this couple in Florida, as well as couples in a lot of other places, $25,000 worth of furniture. They notify Florida, and Florida calls these people up and say, `You owe us $1,000,' or whatever it is. Now, that is a rude awakening, isn't it? You thought you bought something that was tax free and you find out, to your regret, that you didn't. 
Well, Mr. President, I have just been handed a note that the majority leader wants to have a vote. Frankly, I don't like being interrupted in the middle of a debate. It is nothing but a bed check vote. But the majority leader apparently wants the floor by 10:30 and they want me to yield the floor. I got a note that I was going to yield so that Senator Leahy and somebody else could talk about a judicial nomination. I don't see Senator Leahy here. I don't see Senator Hatch here. Neither one of them is half as entertaining as I am either. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues of a very simple fact. Don't vote against this amendment because you want to go home and tell your constituents that it imposes a new tax. It does not. For all of you people, when we talked about unfunded mandates, who talked endlessly about States rights, this is a classic States rights issue. If you vote against my amendment, you are saying to the States: We don't trust you; we are not going to let you collect new taxes on remote sales; we are going to stand by while your tax base is eroded, while you try to raise property taxes in order to pay for schools, 
but we simply cannot trust you and, therefore, we are not going to give you the authority. 
I am telling you--I do not know how I can say it more dramatically, more graphically--as a former Main Street merchant, I can tell you it is patently unfair to make the people of my State and your States make Main Street merchants collect sales tax on every single dime they take in, but if you want to move just across the State line and ship it back into the State, you can do it and not charge any sales tax. 
I had a cousin who bought a fur coat in New York. The clerk said, `You sound like you're southern.' She said, `I am. I'm from Little Rock.' The clerk said, `Why don't you let us mail this coat to you? That way you won't have to pay this $100 or $300'--whatever it was--`in sales tax.' She said, `Fine. Just mail it to me.' That is the kind of thing that is going on, and it is going to continue to go on. 
On your desk, in about 10 minutes, you will find the list of people in this country who strongly favor the Bumpers amendment. You know who they are? They are the Governors; they are the mayors; they are the city councils; they are a whole host of Main Street merchant organizations. Look at it before you vote, and figure out what you are going to say to them the next time you address their organizations on why you didn't vote for this amendment. Tell the Governors why their tax base is being eroded. 
Mr. President, we exempt in this bill--listen carefully--we exempt every mail-order house in the United States that does less than $3 million a year. That exempts about 89% of the mail-order companies in the United States. My amendment would make the States put in a 1-800 number so any mail-order house that is confused can call the State and find out what that State's rule is. We have a blended rate so that the mail-order house only has to collect one rate and the States will distribute it between the cities and the counties. We have done everything in the world to make this as easy as possible for everybody. 
Mr. President, here is an article from the New York Times this morning. There is a copy of the article on every member's desk. This article make all the arguments that I have made here this morning. 
Let me tell you one other argument they make that I have not made, and that is that people who buy on the Internet are the wealthiest people in the country. They are the ones who are doing most of the buying, because they have Internet access. So if I am a wealthy person, I have a computer in my home, and I am on-line, this sales tax loophole favors me. The guy making $6 to $10 an hour does not have a computer in his house. He does not know what is available on the Internet. It is another way of discriminating against those who have the least. 
Mr. President, I am really sorry that we are in such a rush. I know a lot of people want to catch planes, and I am sympathetic to that. I have been in that situation myself. But I want to say, No. 1, please read the New York Times article; please look at the list of people that will be on your desk in about 5 minutes who support this amendment; and, finally, if you are going to vote against this amendment, please figure out what you are going to say to the mayors and the Governors who have the responsibility of keeping the schools open, who have the responsibility of funding the fire departments, who have the responsibility of funding the police departments, keeping the streets clean, keeping the landfills in compliance with EPA rules, and all the other things that cost `gazillions' of dollars across the country. Ask them why they are not allowed to collect a little tax to at least help pay the landfill for covering up 4 million tons of catalogs a year, if nothing else. 
So, Mr. President, I know everybody is in a hurry. And I guess I have said about all I need to say. I see Senator Dorgan on the floor who wants to speak and who has time allocated. So, Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have lost this amendment several times. 
As you have heard me say previously, this is the seventh or eighth year that I have offered this proposal. Every year the specious, absolutely false arguments are made that people don't want any more taxes and that this is a new tax. This is nothing more than a continuation of the unfunded mandates bill we passed here in 1995. 
All my amendment does is say to the States, as the Supreme Court in 1992 said, if Congress gives the States authority to tax sales by mail-order catalog houses, the States may take the opportunity to make them pay it. 
You are talking about the Chamber of Commerce types who go to work at 8 o'clock in Little Rock, AR, in Allentown, PA, and Nashville, TN, and work all day long and collect sales taxes on every dime of every merchant on all the merchandise they sell; 
and some guy has a big warehouse across the State line and can ship that same merchandise into Tennessee, Arkansas and Pennsylvania without even collecting a sales tax. The Governors and the mayors and the municipalities, the council of shopping centers, the council of State governments, why do you think they are for this? Because we are saying, if you want to. If you don't want to, fine, don't do it. But we are saying you now have the right that the Supreme Court gave you to require these people who fill your landfills with catalogs to make them collect a tax just like Main Street merchants do. 
Why do you think they are for it? Because they see their tax base disappearing with Internet sales and mail-order sales. 
I ask every Member of this body before you cast your vote, ask yourself this question: What is going to happen to this country when the schools start closing because the tax base is gone? One of the biggest problems mayors have right now is with their police forces, their fire departments. Community schools are strapped. And all we are saying is if you want to collect a sales tax on out-of-State sales, you can. But this bill doesn't mandate it, doesn't require it. It simply gives you the right, and that is the reason all these organizations are for it. That is the reason the New York Times is for it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is a very difficult, a very difficult undertaking for me for a number of reasons. No. 1, my profound and unrestrained respect for the two Senators from Alaska who obviously feel very strongly about the issue. It gives me no pleasure to be on the other side. 
I sit as ranking member on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee where Senator Murkowski is chairman. I have been on Appropriations for 22 years where Senator Stevens is chairman. They are no different from any other Senators of the U.S. Senate who, when they have a problem, have no hesitancy about doing everything they can to solve it for their people. That is what we are all here for, to serve our people. So it is with considerable regret that I find myself feeling compelled, however, to oppose the amendment and the bill. 
Let me say, also, that lack of health care is not just peculiar to Alaska. I grew up in a community of 851 souls where we sometimes had one doctor but most of the time we had none. My mother and father moved from a mountaintop farm into this little community of 851 people because my brother, who died before I was born--and who obviously, being firstborn, was the apple of my mother's eye--but we moved because he died for lack of any medical care. That was a long time ago. But my mother told me many times that she told my father, `We are moving off this mountaintop. I am not going to live here and watch my babies die, one at a time, for lack of medical care.' 
I grew up with that story, so I grew up always trying to improve medical care in my little hometown. Finally, after I went back there to practice law, we were able to obtain one doctor. We built him a clinic. We fed him, we did everything in the world he asked us to do, and then he was killed in a car wreck, and there we were, left without a doctor again. It was only 30 minutes from a hospital, but if you are having a heart attack, that is too long. If you are having a massive heart attack, 30 minutes is too long. 
So, as I say, I grew up knowing what it was like not to have any medical care. We seldom had a doctor in our hometown. I can remember--and I have said this on the floor before--that growing up during the Depression was a tough enough time. You know, that is one of the reasons I have always been an unabashed social liberal, and the reason I must say I resent so many people who use the term `liberal' as a denigrating term. 
I often want to say, what is it about liberalism that you hate? Which one of these programs that are considered liberal--for example, Medicare--would you repeal today? Or REA? Student loans? Or Pell grants? Or the ability to know that you are drinking pure and clean water? Or the ability to know that you are eating food that has been prepared under the most sanitary conditions? The list goes on and on and on and on of those things that were all considered liberal at the time. 
But you couldn't get anybody to go back to the poll tax system in the South. And I remember people in my State thought that was the end of the world as we knew it, when people were allowed to vote free, didn't have to pay a dollar for a poll tax. 
Five black women came into my office 2 years ago, each one having been a victim of cancer of the breast. And I sat literally weeping with those five women, some of whom were going to make it and some of whom were not--but who said that they did not go to the doctor when they first felt the lump because they knew the doctor would either turn them down or tell them that they had no medical insurance. What if they did have cancer, they knew they were not going to be cared for. That was in 1996. This is not when I was a child during the Depression. This was 2 years ago. They were there to lobby me on behalf of a program they didn't need to lobby me on. I was already for it. 
But here these people were, 50 to 100 miles from Memphis and the finest hospitals in America--and I will not give you the name of the town they came from or where they had been denied health care. All I am saying is a lot of people are denied health care because of race. Others are denied health care because they don't have any insurance--45 million of them. They are not necessarily denied health care simply because they don't have insurance, but oftentimes that is the case. 
Just as an aside, not particularly applicable to this debate, I remember every summer when people died of typhoid fever in my hometown because the outhouse was just about 20 steps away from the water well and we did not make the connection. But, you know, another one of those old liberal programs was free vaccinations. When I was in school we got smallpox, typhoid and I forget the other shot. We always got those at the school--free. The county health nurse administered the shots. That is what some people called the good old days. They weren't good old days to me. 
Will Rogers once said, `The good old days ain't what they used to be, and they never was.' 
Well, one of the most difficult things I faced as Governor of my State was a highly charged issue of whether or not Lee County, AR, the third poorest county in America, would get an OEO grant. Some of you are old enough to remember the Office of Economic Opportunity, another one of those liberal programs that I remember President Nixon put a man in charge, specifically, to dismantle it. But there was a $1 million grant for a clinic in Lee County, AR, as I said, one of the poorest counties in America. It was designed to provide health care for African Americans who had no place to go, and it became a black/white issue. They got the money if I, as Governor, signed off on it, and they didn't get the money if I didn't sign off on it. 
The first thing you know, a little violence broke out and I had to send about 15 to 20 State Troopers into that town for about 4 or 5 days to restore and maintain the peace. 
Those were very trying times. That sounds anachronistic today, but that has been a short 27 years ago. 
I did something that I knew was right that was very troublesome. I signed the grant and, if you pardon the expression, all hell broke loose in that town. It was the county seat. 
To shorten the story, today it is the primary health care center for everybody in that county. 
An organization in New York about 2 weeks ago gave that clinic a $50,000 mobile van in order to keep people from coming in all the time. The clinic will take the van around a three-county area. They will let people know when it is coming. They will immunize children and so on. Betty, who is not only `secretary of peace,' but also has been very active, she and Mrs. Carter, in immunizing all the children in this country, went down for the presentation of this van to that same clinic that got the $1 million grant 27 years ago. Now, as I say, it is the primary health care center for the entire county, black and white. 
I say those things to preface my remarks about this issue. There isn't any question, nor does anybody I know of who opposes the amendment and the bill--there isn't any question about the problem. Certainly the two Senators from Alaska understand these things in Alaska, so far as they are concerned, much better than I do. I understand, being a southerner from a relatively poor State, that a lot of people are deprived of health care for totally different reasons, and that is the reason I prefaced my remarks. 
Here we are talking about a 30-mile road which, incidentally, as I understand it, will cost in the vicinity of $25 million to $30 million, and 8 of the 11 miles that go through the national wildlife refuge is through a wilderness area. As the senior Senator from Alaska said, the State of Alaska has some 40 million acres of wilderness areas, so what on Earth are you talking about? Eight miles through a wilderness area? It just sounds like such an infinitesimal problem, who can possibly object? Who especially could object after hearing the two Senators from Alaska describe some of the people who died for lack of medical care. 
The problem I have with it is the bill assumes that the road is the only solution. If I believed it was the only solution, I would be a cosponsor of the amendment. But there is another imperative involved in it, and the Senator from Montana, who has performed yeoman service on this amendment today, has already pointed it out. And that is, building a road through wilderness in Alaska, no matter how short or how long, will be the first time in this Nation that we have deliberately authorized building a road through a wilderness area. Once you start down that road, nobody knows where it is going to end. 
I can tell you that probably 9 out of 10 people in my State, if you just present it to them as health care for people, they say, `I don't understand the Government and the wilderness; that wilderness stuff never made much sense to me anyway.' 
It makes a lot of sense to me for a simple reason, and I had to come to the U.S. Senate before I really honed my conscience and my awareness of the fact that God just gave us one planet. He didn't say go ahead and throw all the greenhouse gases you can into the atmosphere or chlorofluorocarbons to destroy the ozone layer and I will give you another one after you destroy the ozone layer and after you bring on global warming, with all the disastrous consequences. When you get through mining all the land and leaving all those wonderful environmental disasters, God didn't say, `I'll give you another one and give you a second chance to see if you can do better next time.' 
No, we only get one, and when you do irreversible damage to this planet, you are destroying your children's and your grandchildren's heritage and their future, and you do it mindlessly while standing on the floor of the U.S. Senate talking about education and health care and everything else to indicate how much you love your children. When it gets to something as arcane as building a road through a wilderness, who cares? But when you combine thousands of those little `who cares?' projects, the first thing you know, you have done a tremendous amount of damage. 
My staff gave me a thick briefing book, and I went through a good portion of it, but I guess I finally have to say the precedent worries me a lot. Once you start this, where do you stop? We have never done it before, and we ought not to start now. 
No. 2, there are a lot of alternatives that even the State of Alaska is now studying. The Transportation Department of Alaska is studying what some of the options are to solving this problem, which ones would be the best, most affordable, et cetera. The State of Alaska has taken no position on this, at least that is my understanding. 
Why are we not talking about establishing some medical facilities in King Cove? Why are we not talking about the use of Hovercraft? Senator Stevens got a provision put in the transportation bill for $142 million for new ferries in Alaska, and he got a provision put in the transportation bill to build a causeway to solve the very problem we are talking about here today. I don't know what happened with that. I understand there was some dissension in the ranks over there about the advisability of a causeway. I don't know. That even might be one of the solutions to this. 
There is an Indian Health Service in King Cove. We appropriate money every year in the Interior appropriations bill, in 1996 to the tune of $380,000 to that facility. Before we spend $30 million to build a road, why not just put $1 million into the health service facility? Why not take the $30 million and put it in a trust fund and build a hospital, and then invite doctors up there and pay them $200,000, $300,000 a year to live there? That would be infinitely better than spending $27 million to $30 million on this road, 87 to 94 percent of which Uncle Sugar will pick up the tab.

Mr. BUMPERS. But I also understand the Federal share of that will be somewhere between 87 and 94 percent. 
You think with that kind of money and what you can do--if you just take the Federal share, cut Alaska out, take the 87 percent of whatever it is going to cost to build the road and establish a trust fund. I promise you, you will have doctors, you will have doctors and anybody you want, with the income from such a trust fund. 
But getting back to where I was a moment ago, you can improve the medical facilities there. You can consider Hovercraft. Hovercraft is not dependent on fog. You do not have to worry about fog conditions. A Hovercraft is one of the alternatives that the state is studying. Sometimes the waves may be too volatile to use Hovercraft. That is why a combination of various alternatives may be necessary. 
There is a man in Alaska named Dr. Peter Mjos who has written a letter. Dr. Mjos apparently is head of the Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage. It is a family practice center. He says: 
I've been asked, as the Eastern Aleutian Tribes Medical Director, to comment on the proposed King Cove to Cold Bay road. The primary concern which has been raised is that of safely evacuating individuals with medical emergencies. 
Several concerns come to mind. On the surface, so to speak, a road would appear to be the safest and easiest option, however, the safety issue surrounding medi-vacs arises primarily because of the extremely hazardous meteorologic conditions which occur during an emergency. While flying is obviously potentially hazardous-- 
And listen to this-- 
The proposed road in an Aleutian storm or blizzard could be [just] as equally as hazardous when one considers nearly zero visibility, nonexistence of other traffic over a [long] distance of very isolated country, and, of course, the ever-present winter dangers of avalanches. 
What Dr. Mjos is saying is that a road is not a 100-percent solution either. There will be times when you will not be able to use the road--a lot of ice, a lot of snow, avalanches in Alaska. He goes on to say: 
Of much greater expediency, then, I would strongly recommend several measures which would first, markedly decrease the number of medi-vacs and second, would probably be more reliable in the event of emergencies necessitating medi-vacs. 
Foremost would be the implementation of a state of the art telemedicine system. 
My chief of staff here in Washington told me one time about her father when he was a young man suffered a head injury. And they took him to Fort Smith, AR, which was about 50 or 60 miles away. There were no neurosurgeons in Fort Smith, AR, so a family doctor there--or maybe he was a general surgeon; I do not know--they got a doctor in Oklahoma City on the phone, and this surgeon in Fort Smith held the phone up to his ear, and they operated on her father according to the way this neurosurgeon in Oklahoma City was telling him to do it. 
Telemedicine is a lot more advanced than that today, but I use that just as an illustration to say sometimes telemedicine works. 
Another option which would circumvent the hazards of avalanches and isolated highway transportation would be that of a state of the art ferry system which could operate in virtually any climatic weather conditions. This would of course obviate a drive on, drive off ferry with adequate protection from unruly seas. 
This is from a doctor who is the Eastern Aleutian Tribes Medical Director. 
Here is a letter from Myron P. Naneng, Sr., who is President of the Association of Village Council Presidents. He is writing to Chairman Don Young over in the House. 
Dear Chairman Young: After careful examination of H.R. 2259-- 
Essentially the same bill we are debating here-- the King Cove Health and Safety Act of 1997, the Association of Village Council Presidents, Inc. Waterfowl Conservation Committee would like to request to be put on the record of opposing such legislation. The bill provides for a transfer of land interests in order to facilitate surface transportation between the cities of Cold Bay and King Cove. 
Although we empathize with the community of King Cove's difficulty with safe air transportation to Anchorage, we find that the proposed road would seriously interfere in our endeavors to resuscitate our migratory bird populations. . . 
And he goes on. 
Mr. President, I offer these things simply because the Senator from Alaska is correct. I have never been to Cold Bay or King Cove, either one. But apparently people who live there and who know the situation have been, and they oppose it. 
One of the most interesting things I have run across is this. No. 1--the Senator from Montana has already covered this, and at the expense of being repetitious--Penn Air, the primary aircarrier between King Cove and Cold Bay, makes 1,800 one-way flights between King Cove and Cold Bay each year. That is 900 round trips. You divide that by 365, and that is about 2 1/3 round trips a day that Pen Air makes between King Cove and Cold Bay. 
Listen to this. Incidentally, three Pen Air flights have resulted in accidents in 20 years. Little Rock, AK, does not have a safety record that compares with that. There were 20 medevacs from King Cove between January 1996 and June 1997. That is roughly a year and a half--20 medevacs. There was a delay for 5 of the 20; and of the 5 that were delayed, 4 of them were delayed by no more than 4 hours; and the 5th was successfully completed the next day. 
You hear a lot about 11 fatalities between 1981 and 1997; 11 fatalities in that 16-year period. Six of the fatalities were the result of a plane that was en route from Kodiak that crashed into the mountain. 
I am going to tell you, flying around Alaska is no fun, under the best of conditions. When I was in Alaska they kept me scared to death--the bush pilots. We are talking about a 16-year period; 11 fatalities, and 6 of those from a plane that crashed coming from Kodiak, coming from an island the opposite side of King Cove from Cold Bay. A road between King Cove and Cold Bay would not have prevented that. 
Another incident where one person was killed--this takes care of 7 of the 11 over a 16-year period--was by a pilot who flew within a complete whiteout condition after being warned not to do it. 
Mr. President, I am not sure of the statistics involving who died and how trying to get from King Cove to Cold Bay. 
I want to say to my friend from Alaska that after all the studies are done and it is determined that there is nothing else that is even feasible except building this road, then I will rethink my position. I don't blame the two Senators from Alaska for trying to honor the request of the people in their State on this. 
One thing that has not been talked about is helicopters. You can buy a regular ambulance helicopter for $4.7 million brand new; you can buy one used for $1.5 million. They can always operate safer, and more often, than fixed-wing aircraft in bad weather. They are used consistently by North Slope Borough Search and Rescue. 
I won't belabor this any further except to say we have studies ongoing by the Department of Transportation in Alaska. We ought to at least show them the courtesy of letting them report, and then make up our mind after we have seen a detailed study. We should not precipitously, here on the floor of the Senate, build the first road in a wilderness in the history of the country without at least giving it more than a passing thought. 
I would be willing to accept the amendment of the Senator from Alaska and we can just vote up or down on the bill if that is agreeable with him, if it is agreeable with some of my colleagues. I don't know how strongly my good friend from Massachusetts feels, and I will be happy to yield to him in a moment. 
Finally, in my opinion--I have been wrong before in my opinions, but this one is, I think, fairly safe--in my opinion, this bill will be vetoed. I don't know of anything, other than the Republican tax bill, that the President feels more strongly about than this bill. The most current information is that if it were presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend he veto the bill. This is one of those bills, if you present it, it looks like you are being terribly cruel, until you examine it very carefully and see all of the information. I urge the President to veto the bill. It will be a very tough bill to veto. I don't know whether we can uphold the veto or not. I don't know how many votes we will get here this afternoon. He is absolutely determined to veto this bill. 
It is a legitimate thing to talk about, and I hope that the studies will show some alternate method of alleviating the problem other than building a road through the wilderness for the first time. 
I yield the Senator from Massachusetts such time as he may consume within the limits I have left. How much time do I have remaining?

<TEXT>
Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Virginia for making that request. I will be very brief. 
First, I compliment the Senator from Virginia. I came here to speak on another subject, but his remarks on what is the current topic about military readiness were very topical and timely. He made one very salient point that needs to be reinforced, and I would just like to lend my support because, as you know, I will not be here next year, and I regret it for a number of reasons, but one of the reasons is because I won't be here for the debate about just how bad off our Defense Department is on readiness, No. 1. No. 2, the question keeps coming back to me on why, if $270 billion, which is this year's defense budget--or maybe that is the amount we appropriated for next year, $270 billion--if that isn't enough when you consider the fact that that is more than all the defense expenditures of the rest of the world and twice as much as China and Russia and the so-called seven or eight rogue nations, you have to ask yourself, what are we doing with that $270 billion? 
When you add NATO to it, NATO and the United States combined spend well over twice as much as the rest of the world combined. 
I wish I was going to be here for this so-called readiness debate. I have watched this thing happen about five times since I have been here, where we go along and all of a sudden the Defense Department comes over and says, `Our readiness is declining; our ability to meet the contingencies that we see are something we are not going to be able to meet with our existing manpower.' 
It makes me wonder, because then Senators begin to hear from their constituents back home that the Joint Chiefs have said we are woefully inadequate in this department, woefully inadequate in that department. And among other things, General Shelton pointed out yesterday in the Armed Services Committee that one of the reasons they feel like their readiness is slipping is because they have things imposed on them to the tune of about $4 billion or $5 billion this year they didn't ask for. 
When you consider the fact that our retention rate of pilots is 27 percent, and we are in the process of building about 700 new F-18s and 339 F-22s, you have to ask yourself, Who is going to fly those planes? If we can't compete with commercial airlines, then we ought to raise the salaries of our pilots. 
It is absolutely unconscionable that we spend the amount of money that we do--hundreds of thousands of dollars--training pilots only to watch the commercial airlines take them away from us once they have been trained. The only way you are going to overcome that is to change the salaries of pilots so you can retain them. 
I am like Senator Robb, I will have more to say on this subject later. 
I really came over to give another brief statement. 
This is the eighth year I have been trying to kill the space station. Everybody knows that. I only have about 6 more days to speak my mind in the U.S. Senate. 
I know that everybody is going to be extremely rhapsodic and excited to hear the good news, and that is, since I stood on the floor about 6 months ago and tried to kill the space station once again, the cost of it has only gone up $8.3 billion. We are now headed into the second $100 billion for the space station. You have to bear in mind that that is only if the Russians are ready, for example, with a service module by April of 1999, and even NASA itself says they are not likely to be ready until the fall of 1999. 
When I tell you that we are soaring past the $25 billion mark right now, and we will probably be at $30 billion by April of next year as best we can project, and you understand that the Russians are not going to be ready with a service module by next April as anticipated, and if it is next fall, just keep adding a billion here and a billion there. 
Mr. President, all I can do is to tell my children and grandchildren I did my best to stop this thing before it got completely out of control, and I failed miserably. I never received more than 35 votes, maybe 40 at one time. 
I have to admit, it is extremely gratifying to come over here and tell you, `I told you so.' There is just nothing politicians like better than to be proven right. 
I will be down in Arkansas watching C-SPAN occasionally. Senator Pryor tells me he is so happy now he doesn't even watch C-SPAN anymore. He says sometimes it just ruins his whole day. I will be down there and probably watching C-SPAN as I watch the cost of the space station soar from $100 billion--it is about $104 billion right now--right on up to $150 billion and watch the U.S. Senate put their imprimatur on it and say, `Sic 'em, tiger; go at it, and we'll just keep spending the money.' 
It doesn't make any difference. I can tell you right now it does not matter what the space station winds up costing; we are going to build it. Nobody can tell you why, but we are going to. 
I will have a little more to say on this the first opportunity tomorrow or Friday. 
I yield the floor, and I assume we will stand in recess.

Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I want to speak for just a few minutes on what the House did last Saturday in announcing that they had passed an $80 billion tax cut. To tell you the truth, I take a lot of ribbing around here about the length of this cord. And to really say everything I need to say and want to say about what the House did Saturday would take another 10 feet on this cord, 
because I really think it is one of the most irresponsible acts--knowingly irresponsible acts--I have ever seen since I have been in the Senate. To add insult to injury, I heard a young Congressman Saturday evening on the news saying, `After all, the Republicans created this surplus. They ought to have some say so about how it is going to be used.' 
I have heard hyperbole in my day, but I think that exceeds anything I have ever heard in my life, because it was in 1993, on the floor of the U.S. Senate, where we had to bring the Vice President of the United States over to pass a bill that President Clinton had submitted to us under which he promised would result in balanced budget. When he ran for President in 1992, he didn't promise a balanced budget. What he promised was that he would reduce the annual deficit by 50 percent during his first 4 years in office. 
Bear in mind that the 2 years before President Clinton took office, under President Bush--and you can go back as far as 1981--the deficits started running totally out of control, as every economist in the Nation said they would, after we cut taxes and increased spending in 1981 as a part of the Reagan revolution. 
By the time George Bush finished his term, if I am not mistaken, the last two deficits for 1991 and 1992 were about $250 billion to $300 billion a year. It was frightening. I am just 1 of 100 Senators here, but I can tell you, I had decided that the place was utterly out of control. 
So when the President promised the American people he would cut the annual deficits in half and submitted what was called OBRA 93, the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, it did, in fact, raise taxes and it cut spending by an equal amount. We were supposed to raise taxes by $250 billion and cut spending by $250 billion for an impact over the ensuing 5 years of a reduction of the deficit by $500 billion. 
The people of the country, shortly thereafter, became rather excited about it. The bond daddies in New York City, who pretty much determine economic policy in this country, were excited, too. After all, they said, maybe these clowns really are serious for a change. 
I will tell you how serious it was. As I said, when we tallied up the vote, it was 50 ayes and 50 nays. Vice President Gore sat in the Chair of the Presiding Officer, which is his constitutional duty, and untied the vote. So the Clinton bill, OBRA 93, passed 51 to 50 without one single Republican vote. Not one. It had come from the House of Representatives to us where it had passed the House of Representatives without one--without one--single Republican vote. The bill passed the entire Congress, House and Senate, without one Republican vote on either side, and this young House Member stood up on the floor of the House on Saturday and announced to the world, `After all, the Republicans created this surplus.' 
When President Clinton became President and we passed that bill, OBRA 93, in August of 1993, we made it retroactive. Not fair. It really wasn't fair. I didn't like it myself, but I voted for it. A lot of fairly wealthy people--and I have a few wealthy friends, my brother one of them, and he practically threatened to cut me out of his will because we made it retroactive. 
What happened as a result of making it retroactive? I will tell you precisely what happened. Instead of the projected $290 billion deficit for 1994, it turned out to be $254 billion, $36 billion less than had been anticipated, $36 billion less than each of the 2 preceding years of the Bush administration. The projections for 1994 had been $290 billion to $300 billion. That year, it turned out to be $207 billion, and people began to get excited about the deficit suddenly going down for a change. People's confidence level rose. The unemployment rate began to go down. When people have confidence, they spend money. The economy began to really soar, and the more it soared, the more taxes people paid. 
When 1995 rolled around, it went from--it wasn't $290 
billion, as had been predicted the preceding 4 years. It was down to $154 billion in 1995. People were really getting excited. These are sort of round figures. I am not sure of the precise figures, but they are close enough. 
In 1996, the deficit went to $107 billion, and in 1997, $22 billion. By this time, the whole country is absolutely incredulous. They cannot believe that a country that had shown every sign of taking leave of its senses had suddenly come to its senses, and the deficit, which was $300 billion a year as far as the eye could see the day Bill Clinton was inaugurated, was suddenly $22 billion last year. 
Right now, 3 days from now, on Thursday of this week we feel--OMB and the Congressional Budget Office feel--that the surplus could run between $50 billion and $63 billion. It is the first time in 30 years, and the only reason we did it 30 years ago was because Lyndon Johnson dumped the Social Security trust fund into the budget, and the Social Security trust fund caused us to have a surplus in 1969. We haven't had one since until this year, which hopefully will materialize on Thursday. And this young House Member says the Republicans created this surplus, that they have some rights about what to do with it. They have some rights, of course, but I cannot tell you how offended I am by that when the 1993 bill is the very thing that cost the Democrats control of Congress. 
Two of the finest Senators I have ever known in my life, good friends, lost their seats because they voted for that bill. The House Members were swept out totally because of that bill. I have said on the floor before and I will repeat it, if that is what it took--no matter how traumatic it is to me that the Democrats lost control and still don't have control of Congress--that it was not too big a price to pay to get our fiscal house in order. And here are the Republicans, again, at the same old stand with the same old economic policy saying, `We've got to cut taxes.' 
What is the tax cut? It is the same old tax cut: 53 percent of it goes to the wealthiest 15 percent of the people in America. If I were rich, I would be a Republican, too. No, I wouldn't. My father would be whirling in his grave if I did a thing like that. 
Well, let me give you the bad news. The bad news is, the surplus is not real. It is not a certifiable surplus. Do you know why? Because we still use Social Security in the budget. If we had truth in budgeting around here, where all the trust funds--the Social Security trust fund, the highway trust fund, the airport trust fund, the pension funds--if all of those funds were taken out of the budget, not only would we not be looking at a surplus, we would be looking at a very healthy deficit. 
And so as rhapsodic and euphoric as most people are about what we call a surplus for the first time in 30 years, it is not a surplus. There is $100 billion in the budget this year that is money right out of the Social Security trust fund. You take the $100 billion Social Security trust fund out, and you have a healthy $40- to--I don't know what the figure is--somewhere $40-plus billion deficit. 
This is no time--we know that Social Security under the present system is going to be totally bankrupt in about the year 2029; and by the year 2013, we are going to be paying out more every year than we take in, which is a far cry from a $100 billion surplus we are getting a year now. I think the Social Security trust fund in about the year 2013 will have over $3 trillion in it--$3 trillion. You think about all that money, but by the year 2029 it will be dead broke, it will be on a pay-as-you-go basis. We will be taking in money one day and paying it out the next. There will be no trust fund. 
So when the President said, `Social Security first,' he meant that. 
What does `Social Security first' mean? It means that you do not pay for tax cuts with Social Security trust funds. Right now, if we raid the surplus, we are raiding the Social Security trust fund. 
As I said in the beginning, I need about 10 more feet of cord on this thing to say everything I want to say. I just do not speak well unless I have an opportunity to walk up and down this aisle. All I want to say to my brethren on the other side --good friends, people whom I like--and I am not in the business of giving Republicans political advice; they have been doing reasonably well without me. But I will say this: They should know--and they do know it, and I think they had a few defectors over in the House the other day who said, `I'm not about to go home and face people and tell them that I have just voted for a tax cut for the wealthiest people in America and I did it out of the Social Security trust fund.' I would love to run against somebody who voted that way. I would do my very best to hammer them into the ground, because it is an honest accusation and it is pointing out to the American people what irresponsible conduct this Congress is capable of engaging in. 
So I do not think it is any secret to the Speaker of the House or any of the House Republicans who voted for it. And, quite frankly, I do not think it is going anywhere in the U.S. Senate. And in the unlikely chance it should also pass the Senate, I do not think there is a chance in the world that President Clinton--I do not care how weak he is or how weak he is perceived to be, I can almost give you an ironclad promise he will veto that bill. And I promise you, the veto will not be overridden. 
While President Clinton has been a friend of mine for 25 years--I guess longer than anybody in the Senate--he is a friend of mine, I do not deny that, has been; we come from the same State; we share the same political friends at home. I do not have any doubt about his absolute commitment on things like this. I am trusting him completely when he says he will veto the bill, and, as I say, I am going to do everything that I can to make sure it never reaches his desk. 
Having said that, let me say one final thing. Madam President, in 1981, Ronald Reagan said he would balance the budget by 1984. Ray Thornton--a former Member of the House, told me his 81-year-old father-in-law said one day somebody told him, `Ronald Reagan is going to balance the budget by spending more money and cutting taxes'--take in less and spend more. He said, `What a dynamite idea. I wonder why nobody ever thought of that before.' 
The day Ronald Reagan held up his hand and was inaugurated, the national debt was $1 trillion; and 8 years later when he left, it was $3.2 trillion. He managed to triple it in 8 years. But you know something? I voted with the President in 1981, not quite the way he suggested, but I voted for the spending cuts that he proposed and against the tax cuts. Fritz Hollings and Bill Bradley and I were the only three Senators who voted that way, and we would have balanced the budget in 1984 if everybody had voted that way. But, as you know, everybody did not vote that way. 
So what happened was, we wound up doubling defense spending within 4 years after Ronald Reagan was elected President--doubled it within 4 years. That was back when we found out, after throwing all that money at the Pentagon, they we were paying $7,000 for toilet seats and $7,000 for coffee makers--the same thing everybody does when you throw that much money at them. 
Madam President, I have said about all I want to say except, I will be lying prostrate at the end of this cord in this aisleway the day that tax cut passes here. I plead with my colleagues, let's do something completely apart from politics. Let's not do something that is as irresponsible as that is. Nobody, I guess, ever lost an election by voting for a tax cut. 
People here are getting pretty apprehensive about voting against a so-called marriage penalty. The one thing you never hear is that many married people already have a bonus. There is a marriage penalty for some, but many married people are a lot better off filing joint returns than they are filing as single persons. 
I would not mind addressing the problem of what the House did the other day which, I think, amounts to an average of $240 a year. That is about $20 a month. Well, that is not beanbag for some people, but it is not enough to rape and pillage the Social Security trust fund for when those very people we are trying to help are also concerned about that Social Security trust fund being viable when they get to 65 years of age. And you ask them, `Would you rather be assured that the Social Security trust fund will be there for you when you retire or would you rather have a $20-a-month tax cut?' Talk about no-brainers. 
Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I rise today to once again address an issue that I have addressed a number of times here in the U.S. Senate. It deals with mail-order catalog sales. Everybody within earshot of my voice knows what I am talking about because when they come home at night and pick their mail up, they will find mail-order catalogs. At my house, the average is about 6 to 10 mail-order catalogs on a daily basis. You can buy anything under the shining sun. If you save all of those catalogs, sooner or later you will get one to offer you every product that can be bought in any retail house in America. 
Now, I have two reasons for my strong feelings about this. No. 1, I was a small town Main Street merchant, as well as a practicing lawyer. Most people don't know it, but I was the only lawyer in town--you are listening to the whole South Franklin Bar Association right now--in a little town of 1,200 to 1,500 people. 
When I got out of law school, I knew I wouldn't be able to make a living practicing law so I bought back a business that my father had owned before he and my mother were tragically killed in an automobile accident. I was in law school in Chicago at the time, and 3 years later when I got out of law school, I had no intention of going back to the small town. I had left Arkansas to go to Chicago law school because I didn't think Arkansas was nearly big enough for me. But because of that and the fact that Mrs. Bumpers' family all lived in this little town, we went home and I bought the hardware, furniture and appliance business that my father had owned, hoping that it would sustain me while I built my law practice. 
Believe you me, I needed a lot of sustaining while I was building a law practice. People would walk into my office and say, `Aren't you sort of a lawyer?' And I would have to grudgingly admit yes, that is exactly what I was--`sort of a lawyer.' 
So I speak today as a former retail merchant in a little country town in Arkansas called Charleston. But I also speak as the former Governor of Arkansas where in 1971 I had to raise the income tax because we felt that the sales tax, which is a regressive tax, was already about as high as we could make it. 
That was quite an undertaking because some of the wealthy people in my State, many years before, had seen to it that the constitution of Arkansas provided that any tax other than a sales tax would require a 75-percent vote of both houses of the legislature. You think about that. If you wanted to raise the sales tax, which affects working people and poor people more than anybody else, it would only require a 51-percent majority; but if you wanted to raise the income tax, which hit the wealthy people, it required a 75-percent vote. I remember it took nine votes in the Arkansas State Senate before we passed an income tax bill. That bill, which raised the marginal rate from 4 to 7 percent, is the thing that made my State--I don't say this to boast, but every economist and every political scientist will tell you that it is the one thing that made Arkansas fairly stable economically thereafter. 
Do you know something? While it is a very volatile thing, I got a lot of hate mail when I was championing it, but I got about 65 percent of the vote next time I ran, which shows that people are not dumb, if you go to them and explain your actions. You can always trust the American people to do the right thing. Winston Churchill once said, `You can always depend on the American people to do the right thing once they have explored all the other possibilities.' 
The truth of the matter is, when you talk sense to the American people, they respond sensibly. So this problem of mail-order catalog houses is simply this: If you wanted to come into my store and buy a $500 refrigerator, the tax on that was 5 percent, or $25. If you want to order that refrigerator from a mail-order catalog house in another State, there is no $25 tax, no tax of any kind. If you want to buy almost anything under the shining sun, from a toboggan to hunting boots, you can find a mail-order catalog that sells those items. A lot of these companies will tell you in their advertising that there is no sales tax. They tell you `no sales tax,' even though, actually, 45 of the 50 States in this country have what is called a `use tax,' and that applies to out-of-State purchases. 
Do you know what the problem with that is? You might say, well, what are you up there shouting and shooting your mouth off about if there is already a use tax in 45 out of 50 States. I will tell you why. It is very simple. The tax is on the purchaser, not the seller. So if I buy that refrigerator and they said `no sales tax,' that is a deception. 
Arkansas has a use tax, which is a tax on anything brought into the State. But the only problem is, it is on me and I don't even know the tax exists. I promise you--I don't know how many people are within earshot of what I am saying, but I guarantee you that precious few of them know there is a use tax on anything they buy from a mail-order catalog house. They don't know it, so they don't pay it. 
Maine has become so frustrated that they have a provision in their income tax return requiring them to multiply .004 or .0004, by your adjusted gross income and send it in. That is to make up for anything you bought out of a mail-order catalog, whether you bought anything or not. I said, in 1995--the last time I offered this amendment--that I think it is very suspect, from a constitutional standpoint, to tax people on mail-order sales when you didn't buy anything. Yet, Maine has been doing that. 
A lot of people--for example, Indiana--do a little auditing from time to time. Ten thousand people in Indiana--and 1994 is the latest figures we have--paid some kind of a use tax for buying stuff from mail-order houses in another State. But what they collect is just nothing. In 1994--again, the last year we have figures for--if mail-order catalog houses in this country had collected sales taxes on all the merchandise they sold into these States, they would have paid the States, counties and the cities in the neighborhood of $3 billion. My guess would be that 4 years later, that is in the vicinity of $4 billion-plus, because retail sales have skyrocketed since 1994. 
But, look, in 1994--as I say, the last time I debated this subject was in 1995--in 1994, my State lost $19.6 million, California lost $482 million, Illinois lost $233 million. That is the reason the National Governors' Conference, National Conference of Mayors, and the National Association of Municipalities favor my amendment. I have a list of the various organizations that support my amendment.

Mr. BUMPERS. Senator Graham and I are going to offer this amendment, if we get a chance, on this bill. 
What brought all of this about? Well, first of all, it was about 1967, the Supreme Court, in a decision commonly referred to as the National Bellas Hess case, a big mail-order house. I forget where they are located. The Supreme Court said: You States, you cities, and you counties may not charge a use tax on mail-order sales coming into your State from another State unless that mail-order house has a physical presence in your State. Eddie Bauer used to be just a mail-order house. Now Eddie Bauer has outlets in just about every State in the Nation. 
For example, if you order something out of the Eddie Bauer catalog and you are a Maryland resident, they will charge you sales tax. You can't buy it without paying the sales tax because they have a physical presence in Maryland. But most of these people like Lands' End and L.L. Bean don't have a physical presence in your State and they don't collect sales taxes. But the Supreme Court said in the National Bellas Hess case, you can't charge sales tax or use tax on mail-order sales because it violates the due process clause, and it is a violation of the interstate commerce clause. That sounds like the end of the story. 
However, in 1992, the State of North Dakota challenged the Bellas Hess decision. They went to the Supreme Court and said we think the case was wrongly decided, and lo and behold, the Supreme Court agreed with them on 50 percent of it. They said it was no longer a violation of the due process clause for a State to require a mail-order house in another State to collect sales taxes for them. 
But the Court found that there was still a violation of the interstate commerce clause. The Supreme Court throughout its history has been very, very zealous in making sure that we didn't pass any laws, or that no State passed a law, that interfered with interstate commerce. 
In that decision 25 years later, Quill versus North Dakota, the Supreme Court said requiring companies to collect use taxes was still a violation of the interstate commerce clause unless Congress gives the states permission to collect these taxes. So that is what I am attempting to do. 
Senator Wyden is a dear friend, and one of the finest men to ever serve in the U.S. Senate, in my humble opinion. However, his bill prevents the states from passing any taxes on the Internet for a two year period. My amendment would not exempt the Internet. My amendment would make it possible for the states to require out-of-state companies to collect use taxes whether the products were sold over the Internet or via mail order catalog. 
I chaired the Small Business Committee for a long time. I made speeches about being a small businessman a lot of times on the floor of the Senate. But you tell me, is it fair for a Main Street merchant to collect sales taxes on every single thing he sells, from a loaf of bread on up, to support the fire department, to support the police, to support the local schools, to support everything under the shining sun in that community, that county, that State--is it fair for a Main Street merchant who is there with the people, contributing to everything that comes down the pike--is it fair to make him collect the sales tax, but his competitors, who are selling $300-plus billion worth of things over the Internet by the year 2002 and over $100 billion a year on mail-order sales, not collect a dime? 
I stand corrected. There are a very, very few who do charge sales taxes, just because they are good citizens. 
Let me digress a moment to tell you who one of those good citizens is--none other than our distinguished Senator from Utah, Senator Bennett. 
Senator Bennett and some of his colleagues a few years ago started an office supply business. He told me that as they sat around discussing various aspects of that business and how they were going to form it, and so on, the question came up: What are we going to do about sales taxes? He said they talked about it and they concluded that they would be a lot better citizens and would feel a lot better about it if they just voluntarily collected taxes on all of the office equipment that they sold. 
Incidentally, this business has some retail outlets here in Washington and in Maryland. They would now be required to collect the sales tax because they simply have a physical presence. But they did it long before they were a physical presence; at one time they were a pure mail-order house. 
Senator Bennett joined the Small Business Committee when I was chairman of that committee. In a hearing one day, he said, `Don't let them tell you how complex this is and how difficult it would be for them to collect taxes in every State for every State municipality and every county in the country.' Senator Bennett says it is the easiest thing in the world. At the end of the month, they push a button on their computer and the checks go out. 
One thing Senator Graham and I would do would be to give companies the option of collecting a blended rate which covers all state and local taxes. By giving the companies this option, we can reduce the burden on remote sellers when local sales taxes vary within a state. 
But the point I am trying to make is, Senator Bennett told me it is not complicated to collect use taxes. When the debate begins on this amendment, if and when it ever does, I hope my colleagues will take stock of the fact that one of their own colleagues says that is a bogus, specious argument. 
Madam President, sometimes these mail-order houses say, `Well, we don't ask for any services. We don't need police protection. We don't need fire protection. Our kids don't go to school in your State. So why should we be penalized and be required to pay taxes when we are not a burden in your community and in your State?' 
With these mail-order catalogs, one of the biggest problems States and municipalities particularly have is disposing of the waste in their landfills. You ask them: What is one of the biggest problems you have in your landfills and operating your landfills? They will tell you it is the unbelievable, staggering tonnage of mail-order catalogs. If I throw 10 of them a day away, multiply that by the people of this country who get those things every day, then call your mayors back home and ask them why they are for the Bumpers-Graham proposal. I will tell you exactly why they are for it. They are for it because they have to dispose of that stuff. They are for it because they don't believe it is right to penalize Main Street merchants by making them collect all the taxes and these people mailing things through the mail every day are getting a free ride. 
Back to Senator Wyden. As I said a moment ago, I don't know of any Senator--certainly not many Senators in the Senate--for whom I have as much respect as I have for Senator Wyden. But I don't agree with his bill either. When you consider the fact that I have been fighting the battle for years--this losing battle, I might add--for years I have been fighting that losing battle with mail-order houses, which have increased their sales to well over $100 billion a year, and the States are getting whacked, because they are not collecting the taxes on it. But I say that is just a pittance compared to Internet sales and what they are going to be 3 years from now. 
According to an article in Time magazine--the most comprehensive article I have read was in Time magazine dealing with this very subject of Internet sales. You can buy an automobile on the Internet. You can buy tapes. You can buy movies. You can buy anything on the Internet. 
Amazon Books I don't think has ever made a dime, and their stock is just shooting through the roof. What do you think about Main Street bookstores in the country that are paying taxes for the books they sell in Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia, but not Amazon? 
And Amazon sales are soaring. 
But the final point I want to make is that sales of merchandise over the Internet, that you would otherwise buy from a Main Street merchant, are calculated by the year 2002, no later than 2003, to be $300 billion. Now, 5 percent of that in sales taxes, which is about the average, is $15 billion a year that the States are not collecting--$15 billion in taxes that the Main Street merchant is not getting, and it is a travesty. 
You should never say on the Senate floor, `I don't think my amendment is going to pass.' Considering the fact that in 1995 I did not get one single Republican vote, I think it is fair to say I probably `ain't' going to pick up a bunch of them next time. But you know something. Somebody asked me one time, `Why are you quitting? Why are you not running again?' And I said, `Because I have tackled too many losing causes. I don't enjoy it. I don't enjoy losing anymore than Notre Dame enjoys losing a football game, and the few victories I get and I have had in the Senate are simply not enough to offset the trauma of the many losses I have sustained.' 
And that is not to denigrate anybody. We are all independent here. We think freely. We are supposed to be representing our constituents back home. And I guess most people just look at this differently. 
So I may not win this one either, in fact I probably won't. And that does not dampen my enthusiasm for what I am talking about, nor does it dampen the meritorious nature of what I consider a meritorious cause. I am going back to the beginning because I used to be a small town merchant. I had to compete with big companies. I had to compete with mail-order houses even back then, in the 1950s and 1960s. And I did not enjoy a minute of it. I was on the school board. I was president of the chamber of commerce. I was chairman of the annual banquet of the chamber. I was chairman of the Christmas parade. I did all of those things. And yet I had to compete with people who did not have any of those responsibilities and did not contribute one red cent to my hometown or my home State. And yet for some reason or other, as meritorious as it seems to sound right now, I don't know how other people justify their vote against this when, as I say, the mayors, the Governors, the city councilmen, municipalities, everybody under the shining Sun charged with the responsibility of making their hometown and their home State function, favors mine and Senator Graham's amendment. 
Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for yielding to me. 
Mr. President, just to put this thing in perspective, I call on all of my colleagues to recall the number of times they have appeared before their local chamber of commerce and Rotary Clubs and told them that, once they get to the U.S. Senate, or even the House of Representatives, it is going to be a new day. They are going to protect the people's rights. They are going to take care of their money. We have pledged: `I will treat your property and your money as though it were my own.' 
I have made that speech, and I daresay 99 other Senators have made it as well. So I say, we have to ask ourselves, are we fulfilling our commitment and our solemn vow to the people back home? Ask yourself this question: If you had an oil well, and you discovered that your lessee was selling your oil to an affiliate or a wholly-owned subsidiary, and they were selling it at a price considerably less than published spot prices of that oil--would that be acceptable to you as a private landowner? Let's assume your lessee is selling your oil to an affiliate for $12 a barrel, but the spot price of that oil is $14 a barrel--if you were the royalty owner, wouldn't you question that? Would you tolerate it? 
I read a story in USA Today from which I quote: 
States, native American tribes and landowners are suing for the full, open-market price fees, and a few oil companies have begun to cut settlement deals from Alabama to New Mexico, rather than face trial. According to the Watchdog Project on government oversight, there is more than $2 billion in uncollected Federal royalties at open-market prices, and the total grows by $1 million every week. 
When you vote against Senator Boxer's amendment, are you keeping faith with the people back home who own this oil? It does not belong to the U.S. Senate, it belongs to the taxpayers of America. When the Secretary of the Interior signs a lease with Exxon, Mobil, or whoever, the lessees agree to pay a royalty, usually 12.5 percent, on the oil they take from the Federal land. However, having agreed to that, they now are not paying that. While I appreciate that oil prices are currently low, that does not provide justification to cheat the taxpayers of America out of the fair royalty on their oil. 
If this case did not have any merit, why did Mobil recently settle with the U.S. Government for $45 million on this very issue? They have essentially agreed to the very same thing Senator Boxer is saying they owe. Why are Native Americans suing for royalties? Why are States collecting big, big settlements with the oil companies? Precisely for the very reason Senator Boxer brought this amendment up. All she is saying is let's collect on the lease for what the oil brings, not for some fictitious price created by selling to yourself, by selling to an affiliate. If you are going to treat the taxpayers' money as though it were your own, ask yourself what would you do? Why, you wouldn't tolerate this for 10 seconds, would you, if you found out that the oil company that had the lease on your land had been selling oil to a wholly-owned affiliate at $2 under the spot price for which they could have sold it? 
This reminds me of a coal case. We found out that Ohio Power Company, a utility company in Ohio, had been buying coal from one of its wholly owned affiliates for 100 percent more than they could have bought it on the open market. You talk about a cozy relationship. This was a slightly different situation, but I am just telling you, these things happen. So, if you vote against Senator Boxer's amendment, don't go home and tell people how you are treating their property as if it was your own, because you wouldn't tolerate it for a second. 
Mr. President, the Minerals Management Service is the agency we depend on to manage royalties on Federal lands leased for oil and gas. We expect them to get the most for it they can get. Congress has set the royalties on oil here. We say the Secretary of the Interior cannot lease it for less than 12.5 percent, and then say to the Minerals Management Service, `But if you catch the oil companies pulling shenanigans, don't do anything about it'? If Senator Boxer's amendment fails, that is what we are saying. 
So I regret that the price of oil is low, and the Senator from Texas has made that point a number of times; oil prices are low. Most of you know I have spent 9 years trying to make the Federal Government make the hard rock mining companies pay royalty on the land we give them for $2.50 an acre. I faced it. I am leaving here at the end of this year. I don't know what will happen after that, but I can tell you one thing, I tried for 9 years. I stood where I have been standing right now for 9 years and squealed like a pig under a gate, saying the same thing I am saying now: You are cheating the American taxpayers. 
You think about us giving away 3.2 million acres of land in this country for the last 130 years for $2.50 an acre, land that had billions and billions of dollars of minerals under it, and what did the taxpayers get back? They got 557,000 abandoned mine sites that are going to cost them $70 billion to reclaim. Royalties? Zip. Nothing. Not a dime. I lose it every year, and the people who vote against me go back to the Chamber of Commerce and say, `Oh, I'll treat your property just as though it were my own.' If you believe that is the truth, you ought to be in a mental institution. If that is your idea of treating property the way you would treat it if it were your own, you need a guardian. The situation here is essentially the same thing. 
The other day when I tried to raise another issue, just an environmental issue on how we are going to mine these hard rock minerals, I lost. I got 40 votes. I knew I was going to lose. The same people who voted against me will go back home and say they are environmentalists, even though they do not want the Interior Department to regulate how we mine and how we reclaim the land after we mine. I just got killed on it, 58 to 40. As I say, I am leaving, so the other side won. I know a couple of people here who I think will take it on, and it will be in capable hands, but I forewarn you: `It ain't an easy battle.' That is the most egregious case I have ever run across in my life--billions in gold and palladium and silver taken off the land over the years and taxpayers don't get a nickel for it. All they get is a big environmental Superfund site. 
Mr. President, in this case I will plead with my colleagues, the States favor this. I understand Wyoming has kicked the traces over, but the rest of them favor this amendment, and they are cutting deals with the oil companies right now. Senator Hutchison said no, the United States is not going to cut a deal; if the Indian tribes and the States want to, that is their business, but oil prices are low, and we are just not going to bother with it. 
Gold prices are low, too, and I know that. 
Mr. President, I will close by simply reminding my colleagues that I have heard in the last 24 hours that one of the principal candidates planning to run for President says he is reconsidering because he doesn't know whether he wants to subject his family to what goes on up here. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.

Mr. BUMPERS. He says he doesn't want to subject his family to the kind of things to which politicians are being subjected. There are two sides to that story, and I understand that. 
When I ran for Governor 28 years ago--I won the Democratic primary almost 28 years ago today--I had a slogan: `Let's get our State together.' We had been bickering and nothing was happening in the State. I said, `Let's get our State together,' and when I was Governor, I called people together, Republicans and Democrats, and we worked well together. We had 4 great years, if you will pardon a self-serving statement. 
I always said politics is a noble profession. My father said it a long time before Jack Kennedy did. He believed it. He served in the legislature. He wanted his two sons to go into politics. How long has it been since a parent has said they want their son or daughter to go into politics? 
In any event, he didn't say all politicians are noble, he said public service is an honorable, noble profession. I have always believed that. I think it still is. I think what a tragedy it is that the country is in the situation it is right now and the effect that has on people and their willingness to serve and their wanting to serve as I did. I think about us voting on things here where it is obvious to me--I don't want to seem arrogant about this, but this is not even a debatable amendment about what is fair and what is right. We all know what it is. So I plead with you, do your duty. I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just say to what few colleagues may be listening, in 1976, the Secretary of the Interior was charged with the responsibility of making sure that people who mine on Federal lands belonging to the taxpayers of America, not cause undue degradation of the land. 
In 1981, the Secretary promulgated regulations to determine how mining would take place. It was obvious after that that the gold mining companies were using cyanide--cyanide--to mine gold. We have had three unmitigated disasters since 1981. We have cyanide running in the rivers and streams and our underground water supplies of this country. 
In 1991, Secretary Lujan tried to change the rules so we could take care of that, as well as other things that needed to be taken care of. 
In 1993, everybody said, `No, let's wait; we're going to get a new bill.' Nothing happened. 
In 1997, Secretary Babbitt started to promulgate rules to try to take care of underground leeching of cyanide poisoning, as well as a whole host of other things. Senator Reid got an amendment put on last year that said every Governor in the West would have to sign off on that. We finally compromised by saying the Secretary would have to consult with Governors of the West, which he did and which they certified that he did. 
This year, they come in and say, `No, let's don't do it yet; let's have the National Academy of Sciences study it.' 
It takes 27 months, 27 more months under this amendment to get these rules promulgated, carefully orchestrated to go past the year 2000 and, hopefully, to get a Secretary of the Interior to their liking so we can continue to pollute the rivers and streams of underground aquifers of this country with cyanide poisoning. 
People of this country have a right to expect something better than that, and all I am doing is striking this so that the Secretary can go ahead and issue the rules on November 17. If the Congress doesn't like them, let them change them. But for God's sake, let's keep faith with the American people and say we are going to do something about Summitville, CO, 1992. The bond was insufficient. They took bankruptcy. Zortman-Landusky, MT, 1998; Gilt Edge, SD, 1998.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, since I have been in the Senate, I have come to the floor--and I would not want to miss my last opportunity before I leave the Senate--to express my strong, strong support of the National Endowment for the Arts. 
We talk a lot in this country about how uncivil we have become; how uncivil our children have become. During the same time--I am not making the correlation--the National Endowment for the Arts' funding has gone down about 50 percent. I think it was close to $200 million when I came here. 
I can tell you an experience I had when I was overseas waiting to come home after the war, and was bored to death. I have told this story before. But it is worth repeating. I saw a sign up on the bulletin board one day: `Would you like to learn about Shakespeare? Come to such and such a room tonight.' So about six people just like me, bored stiff, waiting to get home, went over. It turned out that a Harvard dramatist--a drama coach from Harvard--had put up the sign. 
He began to tell us about Shakespeare. He began to tell us about Hamlet. He had a tape recorder. In those days I had never seen a tape recorder. I remember. He said, `Listen to this.' He spoke into his tape recorder and he proceeded to deliver Hamlet's speech to the players. It was a magnificent thing. It was the most mellifluous voice I had ever experienced. He played it back on his tape recorder. I was just stunned. It was just so beautiful. He handed us the tape recorder, and he said, `We are going to have each one of you do the same thing.' I remember. I was about the second one. He handed us the script. I cannot tell you how embarrassed I was. I went ahead, and read `Speak the speech, I pray.' I read the whole speech. I still remember it. I will not repeat it here. Then he turned the tape recorder on, and it came back. It was pure `Arkansas redneck.' 
I made up my mind right then that I did not want to sound like that the rest of my life. To be brutally frank with you, if it had not been for the experience I had with that drama coach for all of those nights--about six nights--I daresay I might not be standing on the floor of the Senate today. It was just a happenstance, just an opportunity. 
Every time we give a child that kind of an opportunity, we are always a stronger, better, more civilized nation. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, my colleagues will be greatly relieved with my departure at the end of this year because they won't have to listen to this debate anymore. They may have to listen to it again, but not from me. 
This amendment arises from a situation which really began last year, Madam President. In order to set the stage for it, I direct my colleagues' attention to this chart here. But before doing so, let me just say that we had what I thought was a solemn agreement last year on this same issue. I won't say it was a handshake contract, but last year the Interior appropriations bill contained a provision that was added in the committee markup, which said the Secretary of the Interior may not promulgate new regulations for the mining of hard rock minerals on Federal lands until every Governor of 11 Western States had individually agreed to it. 
In 1976 we passed FLPMA, an acronym for Federal Lands Policy Management Act, it was my second year in the Senate when we passed that, but I was very active in the negotiations and passage of that bill. It was a comprehensive bill that determined how all Bureau of Land Management lands would be handled. In it we said that the Secretary of the Interior is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that on Bureau lands, no unnecessary and undue degradation would occur. 
Now, as my friend, the Governor of Florida, Lawton Chiles, who used to be our colleague, used to say on this floor, `The mother tongue is English.' You cannot say it any better in English than to say the Secretary is hereby charged with the responsibility for making certain that there is no undue, unnecessary degradation of Federal lands. 
We have about 450 million acres of Federal lands, and an awful lot of it is eligible to be mined for various hardrock minerals, notably gold, platinum, silver, zinc, lead, you name it. So in 1980, the Secretary issued regulations to comply with FLPMA and in 1981 they were finalized and went into effect. Everybody applauded and said it is wonderful. Now we have regulations in place that will govern mining companies. 
What brought these regulations about? It was the first time we had ever tried to regulate mining on Federal lands. Why did we do it? Because at that very moment, there were 557,000 abandoned mines in this country. Who do you think had been left with the pleasure of cleaning up those 557,000 abandoned mines? You guessed it--`Uncle Sucker.' The cleanup costs, according to the Mineral Policy Center, for those 557,000 mine sites is calculated to be between $32.7 billion and $71.5 billion. Within the 557,000 abandoned mines, 59 of those are now Superfund sites. We don't put things on the Superfund list just for fun. That is a big-time environmental disaster. In addition to 59 Superfund sites, we have 12,000 miles of rivers that have been polluted by mining waste, and we have 2,000 national park sites in need of reclamation. 
Now, think of that. We have 2,000 mine sites within the national parks that have to be reclaimed. And because it took the Nation too long to wake up to the environmental damage that was being done by mining in this country, this damage had already occurred when we passed FLPMA in 1976 saying the Secretary will promulgate regulations to make sure that not only this comes to an end, but that it never happens again. So we gave the Secretary regulatory authority. 
In 1981, those rules went into effect. Let me make one point, and I will make it more than once in this debate. The mining of gold in this country is done nowadays primarily with the use of cyanide. Cyanide is a lethal chemical. 
Now, Madam President, in 1991, George Bush was President, a conservative Republican administration. Because this new technique of mining with cyanide had gone into effect and there were several mines which had caused cyanide to leak into the streams and rivers around it and into the underground water supply, the environmentalists were squealing like pigs under a gate. 
So, in 1991, the Bush administration, through Secretary Lujan, came out with a study to develop new regulations to take care of these new environmental problems. But because in 1993 we were trying to reform the whole mining law, everybody said, `Well, we have got this whole law we are going to reform,' so the Interior Department decided to suspend the work on revising the regulations. Unfortunately, in 1994, the Western Senators were able to kill the mining law reform legislation that was pending in Congress. 
As a result, last year, Bruce Babbitt, the all-time favorite whipping boy of the West, said he, as Secretary of the Interior, was going to honor FLPMA as it was written, and that is to make sure there is no unnecessary and undue degradation of the public lands. So he reinitiated the process begun in the Bush Administration to revise the mining regulations in order to attempt to prevent environmental disasters, such as the leak of cyanide into the rivers, streams and underground water supplies. So Senator Reid of Nevada, in the appropriations subcommittee last year added a provision which would have prohibited the Secretary from promulgating these rules unless all of the Western Governors consented. 
The provision, as it was drafted, was patently clear. It simply meant that each Western Governors had veto power over the revised regulations. That was, obviously, a little too much, even for some of my friends in the West, to stomach. 
So Senator Reid and I worked together in good faith and mutual friendship and respect on both sides. We amended that language to say that the Secretary will consult with all the Governors of the West. After he has done so, he will certify to the Congress that he has consulted with all of the Western Governors. He maintained that he had already done that, but they disagreed with that. So we required consultation in the amendment. That is the path we adopted last year. 
We also put a time schedule in there so that the Secretary could continue to work on the regulations, and he could promulgate the regulations after November 15. The deal was done. It will be done after the election. Nobody will be hurt politically. The only thing wrong with that is this year--1998--when the bill comes out of the appropriations subcommittee, the deal was reneged upon. 
What is the new requirement? The new provision states that the Secretary could not promulgate these regulations until the National Academy of Sciences has studied it for 27 months. Next year, it will be the National Institutes of Health. God knows, the next year it will probably be the National Organization for Women--anything to keep these regulations from going into effect. 
Make no mistake about what we are talking about. Everybody understands it. Under the provision that is in the bill this year, which I am proposing with this amendment to strike, guess what the timetable is. It will now take 27 months for the National Academy of Sciences to study it and to report it and the Secretary to consider it and do whatever he is going to do--27 more months, over 2 years, of continuing to sock the taxpayers of America with the foibles of the mining industry. I will come back to some of those foibles in just a moment and tell the American taxpayers what they are paying for right now. 
Why 27 months? You know, if you are a U.S. Senator, and if you paid any attention at all--you don't have to have a picture drawn for you--27 months takes us past the year 2000. So we go past the election in the year 2000, and all of my friends who are going to come in here and vote against my proposal today hopefully will elect a President of a different persuasion who will bring James Watt back as our Secretary of the Interior. 
That is the politics of the issue. It is not pleasant to talk about things like that on the floor of the Senate. But there isn't a single Senator here today who is going to vote who doesn't understand precisely what it is about. Every Senator who votes against my amendment is going to know in spades that he is voting to continue to allow mining companies to mine on Federal lands with virtually no regulations to guide them, being able to put up an insufficient bond, and when they take bankruptcy and go south again, will leave the taxpayers of America to pick up the tab. I don't know how I can put it any plainer than that. 
Madam President, let me be just a little bit more dramatic, a little bit more graphic about why the anti-environmental rider in this bill should be taken out. 
I want you to bear in mind, last year we postponed it until November 15. If my amendment is not adopted, that takes us down well past November. It takes us into about January 2001; and more and more environmental degradation, more rivers and streams polluted, more mining companies taking bankruptcy and heading south with an insufficient bond. 
That is for what you are going to be voting. For all of those who are running for reelection this year, when you go home and your opponent says, `Why did you vote against putting some regulations in to regulate the use of cyanide to keep it from going into our underground aquifers and our rivers and streams; why did you vote to continue that,' I would like to hear your answer. 
But just to give the taxpayers of America some information, if not my colleagues who are not here this morning, in 1992, Galactic Resources, the owner of the Summitville Mine in Colorado, took bankruptcy. They left cyanide, acid, and metal runoff going into the underground aquifers and the Alamosa River. Do you know what has happened since then? The taxpayers of this country are paying over $1 million a year to try to contain cyanide and acid runoff from that mine, not Galactic Resources. 
The Summitville mine took bankruptcy and went south. That was in 1992. The reason they were able to create an environmental disaster in the State of Colorado is because Colorado's bonding regulations were insufficient. Federal regulations are similarly flawed. We have constantly postponed new regulations, and the regulations we were operating with were promulgated in 1981, and in 1981 we didn't even know about cyanide poison being used in the mining process. Secretary Babbitt is trying his best to promulgate rules and regulations to make sure there will be no more Summitville mines. 
So when people come walking onto the Senate floor to vote on this amendment, remember, you get to go home and tell your constituents that they are picking up a million-dollar tab a year because we do not have regulations to control gold mining in this country. 
Now we have a brand new one in Montana. Pegasus Gold Company, which has filed for bankruptcy recently closed the Zortman-Landusky mine on BLM and private land in Montana. They have filed for bankruptcy. Cyanide spills all over the place. And who do you think is going to get to pick up the shortage on their bond? The taxpayers of America. 
And here is one, to be totally fair about it, that is not on Federal land, the Gilt Edge mine in South Dakota, another 1998 matter. They had cyanide leaks in the ground water, acid mine drainage, and they are in financial difficulty. And if they take bankruptcy, it is estimated that their bond will pay about 50 percent of the cost of cleaning up that mess. 
The regulations that we are talking about trying to get promulgated to stop this outrage are not just to stop the use of cyanide. We are not trying to stop the use of cyanide. We are trying to make them use it in a way that we know the plastic cover on the ground is strong enough to not break and leak. But the second thing we are talking about is making them put up a sufficient bond; in case they do have a spillage, in case they do go broke, the taxpayers will not be left with it. 
The reason I use Gilt Edge is not because they are mining on Federal lands but because they are proposing to extend their operations onto National Forest land. 
So since 1976 we have been trying to stop mining companies from mining in an improper way, leaving the taxpayers with the tab. We have been trying a lot of other things without success. But if I were speaking on national television to 268 million people in America and all the adults were listening, how many votes do you think I would get? About 90 percent of the American people. But, unhappily, I am not speaking to 268 million Americans. Lord, how I wish I were; I feel supremely confident as to how the American people would feel about this. 
So, Madam President, let me go back and make one other point and then I will allow some of my adversaries to have their say. 
Let me describe for you how gold is mined today under modern methods. First of all, you have to dig up the earth. You dig up huge, cavernous amounts of soil that supposedly has gold in it. You bring the soil into the mine site, where huge plastic covers have been laid out on the ground, and you dump this soil on this plastic cover that covers the ground and presumably will hold any fluid or liquids that you put through this dirt. Huge pits. You ought to see them. They look like abandoned strip mining sites. But this modern method that I talked about is new, brand new, and is causing all the damage that we need regulations to control. 
Then they use a drip process along the top of this big mound of dirt where this cyanide drips through, and it seeps down through this huge pile of dirt. The gold is attracted to this cyanide solution. Then it pours out on the side into sort of a gutter, where the gold is strained out of it and the cyanide is recycled and once again put through this drip process. It is like a drip irrigation system. 
Now, the first thing you have to do is understand how lethal cyanide is, and the second thing you have to understand is that the reason some of these spills occur is that the plastic liners leak. Think about how ominous it is. How would you like to live in the vicinity where you knew your underground water supply had cyanide leaking into it? 
Mr. President, I have nothing against the National Academy of Sciences, it is a fine organization. But we don't need another Academy study. The National Academy of Sciences has already examined the matter. 
In 1978, when we enacted SMCRA, governing the regulation of coal mining, a provision was included in the bill to require the National Academy of Sciences to study the regulatory requirements needed to address the environmental impact of hard rock mining. That study was completed in 1979. That same study found a need for a Federal regulatory framework. 
In 1996, the Environmental Law Institute studied hard rock mining programs and said the current regulations were insufficient. That was in 1996. In 1992, the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs prepared a study that found significant gaps in environmental regulation of mining. The GAO has studied this issue to death and has found flaws in the administration of our mining laws. 
The question then becomes, When you consider all the studies that have been done and the damage that has occurred while we have been doing studies, why in the name of all that is good and holy do we need another study? I repeat, do we need another study to postpone this until after the year 2000, when a new Secretary, presumably, will take office who does not even believe in studies, let alone environmental regulation? This is all a ploy. Everybody in the Senate knows that. When they vote today, they are going to think, `Now, what kind of a 30-second spot can somebody make out of me voting to continue mining gold with cyanide when the regulations were written before cyanide was even used in gold mining?' And they think about it and they put it through this little filter, this little political filter in their ear, and say, `Well, on the other side it says the National Academy of Sciences. Who can object to the National Academy of Sciences studying something? It is a very prestigious organization.' And they can probably try to convince their constituents that they are trying to protect them by having the National Academy of Sciences do a study when, in fact, the National Academy of Sciences could do what they need to do on their own in 2 months. But the list I just gave you shows this has been studied and studied and postponed and postponed, until now we have these environmental disasters on our hands that cost the taxpayers `gazillions.' It is going to cost them a fortune. 
And don't anybody make any mistake in your judgment about how this is going to play out. As I said, we had a solemn agreement last year. Everybody understood exactly what we were agreeing to. And, incidentally, we said the Secretary had to consult with all the Western Governors. He has done that. Governor Miller, I think, is president of the Western Governors' Association; he has notified Members of Congress that they have been consulted with. Everything we agreed to last year has taken place, and we come back here today and industry says, `No, we have to have one more study.' 
I have said most of what I want to say. I just ask, what is the objection, even of the Western Senators? What is their objection to the Interior Department, that they want to prohibit any update of the regulations? Nobody has cited a single objection to the drafts of the Secretary of Interior that were going to go into effect, that were going to be promulgated November 15 of this year. Do they object to mining companies having to file a plan before they start mining? Do they object to requiring mining companies to post a bond sufficient to take care of the devastation that they may cause? Do they object to a regulation that says they must reclaim the land when they finish mining it? What is the objection? Is it that they have to minimize the adverse impact on the environment, if at all economically and technically possible? It does not say they have to. It says they have to minimize adverse impacts if at all technically and economically possible. Who could object to that? 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. My good friend and colleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, mentioned the fact that I come from a State where poultry is a big industry, which, indeed, it is. And they have been taking a lot of hits lately. Tyson Foods, which is by far the biggest poultry company in the United States, has been fined by the State of Maryland, been made to change their operations. The Secretary of Agriculture announced last week that we need a totally new set of regulations dealing with animal waste, including poultry. They are subject to all kinds of regulations. I have been here for 24 years now, and I defy any Senator to tell me one time I ever objected to a regulation that dealt with the environment where the poultry industry was involved. I wonder if the Senator from Alaska would tell us how he would feel if I came in here knowing that the poultry industry was creating an environmental disaster and said, well, I want 27 more months to study it--if last year I came here with a proposal saying you can't do anything to the poultry industry until every Governor in the country or every Governor whose State has poultry signs off on it, and, once you get that in place, say, well, all the Governors have to be consulted, and you get that in place, and then I come back and say, no, we need 27 more months to study it. 
I don't know how people would react to that. I expect rather severely. But I will tell you one of the differences. Very few States have hard rock mining on Federal lands.

Mr. BUMPERS. This says exactly what I have been saying, and that is, the President ought to veto the Interior Appropriations bill if my amendment is defeated. And I personally think he will. 
With all these disasters which I have addressed, all we have had is one delay after another. In 1993 they said, `Well, we are working on a mining bill,' and in 1994 the same people who said we are working on a mining bill and we should not deal with these regulations did everything they could to stall until 2 weeks before we were to go home to make sure there was no mining bill. 
And then last year they said, `We want all the Governors to have a say in this. Don't put a regulation into effect that prohibits the leakage of cyanide from a gold mining site unless all the Governors have signed off on it.' They backed off that and they said, `Well, they have to be consulted.' We said, `Fine, they ought to be consulted.' So they were consulted. And the president of the Western Governors' Association told the Senate Energy Committee that `We have been consulted.' So what do they do then? They come back and say, `Well, now we want the National Academy of Sciences to study the regulations'--anything under God's sun to keep from dealing with an unmitigated disaster. 
Why are the people of America indifferent? They don't even know about it. There is no hard rock mining in my State. I am not running for reelection, but if I were running for reelection I wouldn't get any votes in my State out of this issue. As Gilda Radner used to say--`if its not one thing, its another.' And the Senator from Alaska alluded to the fact that I had, indeed, been working with the National Mining Association trying to craft something to reform the 1872 law that Ulysses Grant passed and has been such an unmitigated disaster for this Nation. Think about a law still on the books that Ulysses Grant signed to encourage people to go West. Is that a legitimate reason for allowing this 126-year-old bill to stay on the books--encourage people to go West? That is what we are dealing with. 
And the Senator from Alaska said he and Senator Craig had a bill, and I asked them not to bring it up. That is true. I did that because I thought we were going to make a deal. The Chairman of the National Mining Association--who is a very fine, honorable man, in my opinion, a man of immense integrity--and I worked extremely well together. We were honest with each other, and our staffs developed a draft proposal. Unfortunately, that was before we ran it by the Western Senators. Two Western Senators said we can't do this. And the Senator from Alaska said the reason they didn't bring up the bill he and Senator Craig crafted was because he thought we had a deal. I thought I had a deal, too. 
The bill they wanted to bring up, the bill they crafted and they said it was too late to bring up, let me tell you what it would do. It says, first, that environmental regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Interior cannot be stronger than the State where the mine is located. Think of that. There is no point in even having a Federal regulation. Each State would be a king with regard to mining on Federal land. Every State would determine what the environmental regulations would be, because the Federal regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Interior could be no stronger than the State regulations of a particular State where a mine was located. 
How foolish can you get? And, when it came to the royalty, they would grandfather every mining company holding a valid claim. There are 300,000 claims in this country. If you grandfather everybody who has a valid claim, you would not collect enough royalties in the next 30 years to buy a ham sandwich. There is nobody to pay it. After all, people have been buying Federal lands for $2.50 an acre for the last 130 years. You cannot charge them a royalty because they own the land. We sold it to them for the princely sum of $2.50. So when you take all of them and everybody else who turns up with a valid claim, there is nobody left to pay a royalty. 
Mr. President, let me make a philosophical point. I am an unabashed, card-carrying, hardened environmentalist. In 1970, when I ran for Governor in my State the first time, the environment was just then becoming an issue in this Nation, albeit a fairly low key one. But it made a lot of sense to me, based on what I had read, and so I began to talk about the environment. I began to talk about Arkansas' magnificent rivers and streams and how they were being polluted. I began to think. 
In 1966, I went fishing on the Buffalo River, the most beautiful river in America. It was so magnificent. I had no idea that my own State had such a treasure. Two nights we camped out on a sandbar. We ate and we drank and we created a lot of garbage, and the tour guide took all the garbage that we created and put it in a plastic bag, waded out as far as he could into the river, and tossed it. And nobody thought a thing in the world about it. Finally, after a little bit of that, somebody began to raise the question about the Buffalo River being polluted. 
To shorten the story, we made it a national scenic river. It is a pristine, clean river. People come from all over the world just to camp out on the banks of the Buffalo or to fish the Buffalo. It was not even popular with the local people when we made the Buffalo River a national treasure, and today there is not anybody up there who would go back to the old ways. So, yes, you are being addressed by a card-carrying environmentalist. 
Do you know the other reason? I have three children and six grandchildren. We talk about how much we love them, how they are our most precious possession, how our whole life is calculated to make life more pleasant for them, and then we come in here to vote for trash like this. 
We only have one planet. God, in his infinite wisdom and in the heavens, gave us one planet to sustain us forever. Not next week, not next year--forever. We say, `Well, God certainly didn't mean to stop putting cyanide poison into our underground aquifers and our streams and rivers, because there are jobs involved in this. God didn't intend that.' No--that is how specious the arguments are that I have been listening to this morning. So you only get one chance to preserve the planet. 
You can buy these arguments about, well, what is wrong with the National Academy of Sciences studying the rules for mining? Nothing, except they have already studied it. Everybody studied it. There are GAO reports galore. If the National Academy of Sciences is so important to us, why was it not mentioned last year, and the year before and the year before that? It is a nicely crafted idea, because at the fundraisers, if anybody raises the question, you can say, `What is the problem with the National Academy of Sciences--it is a very prestigious organization--studying the rules on how we are going to mine?' 
It would not take 27 months. Mr. President, 27 months is carefully calculated to take us past the Presidential election of the year 2000. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, and the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, be added as cosponsors.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, Bill Clinton, my friend from my home State of Arkansas, has been taking a lot of trashing lately, a lot of it richly deserved. I am not here to defend the President. But I will tell you one thing. You can say a lot of things about him but you cannot say he is not an environmental President. I will tell you what I think he will do. I think he will follow the advice of Dale Bumpers and the New York Times and veto this bill if this amendment is defeated. I can tell you I don't care how weak he is, I don't care how disturbed he is about all of this, I don't care how disturbed the American people are, I promise you there is one thing about him that he will not yield on and that is the environment; and for the very same reason nobody in the U.S. Senate ought to yield on it. 
I know it is painful. I know companies are put upon because of the environment. But, when you think about what has happened to the environment over the past 300 years of history in this country, it is time we implement strong measures. 
Did you know that the rules right now say that you cannot even regulate a mine of 5 acres or less, you can go out and create all the damage you want to on 5 acres? That is a pretty good spread for some mines. In the State of Nevada, there are 2,400 mines of 5 acres or less. Here is a letter from the BLM office in Reno, NV, to an assemblywoman in Nevada, about these 5-acre mine sites. The BLM says:  
Since enactment of BLM's surface management regulations in 1981 [that's the one we are still trying to live with, put in effect in 1981, since the regulations in 1981] the BLM in Nevada has processed nearly 10,000 notices. Currently, there are approximately 2,400 active notice-level operations in Nevada. There have been many environmental and operational problems associated with the smaller operations in Nevada. 
We aren't talking about 1872. We are talking about May 1, 1997. Let me repeat that. 
There have been many environmental and operational problems associated with the smaller operations in Nevada. 
In summary, there are 90 exploration or mining sites of five acres or less in Nevada where a reclamation bond would have either probably prevented a new modern-day problem from developing or would have been used to reclaim an environmental problem. 
You can defend that if you want to if you are from Nevada. That is your privilege. Do you know something else? The Federal regs of 1981 are just like the Nevada law. We exempt all mines of 5 acres or less. Thousands and thousands of them are exempt under Federal regulations. And you think that doesn't create environmental havoc? 
Mr. President, I am not terribly optimistic about my chances of succeeding today. Last year, happily, we were able to work out an arrangement where we said we will consult with the Western Governors. Nobody mentioned the National Academy of Sciences last year. I have been in the Senate 24 years and ever since I have been on this issue, nobody has ever mentioned the National Academy of Sciences. But somebody cleverly came up with the idea and said, `At your fundraisers, you can always defend yourself; you can say, `The National Academy of Sciences did a study on that.' I sure hope they come up with a good set of regulations. I yield the floor, Mr. President.

<TEXT>
Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first of all, I want to make one point that perhaps has not been made, and that is that this amendment only applies on Federal lands. Bear in mind, all mining does not occur on Federal lands. There are all kinds of mines in this country on private lands. There are some on State lands. 
I might also say that we have given away 3.2 million acres of land in the past 126 years. Well, we did not give it away; we charged $2.50 an acre for it. Lands the size of the State of Connecticut we have given to the mining industry in the past 126 years to mine on. 
Do you know what else? They own it. We gave them a deed for $2.50 an acre, and they own it. And these regulations do not apply to people who own their own land. The States regulate that. 
One other point I want to make is that I believe the Senator from Idaho indicated something about my political position, my political base. No. 1, there is no political base on mining in my State. There is a political base for being on the side of keeping the environment as clean as possible, but that is not unique to my State. I assume that there are some people even in Idaho and Alaska who want to keep the environment as clean as possible. 
Let me say, as the Senators tick off all the laws that the mining industry has to comply with--clean air, clean water, reclamation--tell us which one of those you want to repeal. 
In the 1970's when a number of environmental laws were passed, go back and look at the speeches that were given, and given again today, about what a terrible disaster this would be if we passed this bill and made people comply with these nonsensical, crazy regulations. It is just another case where the old Federal Government is trying to tell us how to run our lives. 
Do you know the reason the Coeur d'Alene River is now a clean, pristine river? Because of the Clean Water Act. I applaud the people of Idaho who I assume didn't want that river to be polluted any further. I can tell you, it may or may not have happened if it hadn't been for the Federal Government's intervention. I don't know where that beautiful river in my State, the Buffalo, would be right now if we hadn't made it a wild and scenic river and stopped the disastrous pollution of the river. 
In the 1970's 65 percent of the streams, rivers and lakes in this country were neither fishable nor swimmable. And because of the terrible old Federal Government and all their regulations imposing on the business community of this country, today it is reversed--65 percent of the streams, lakes, and rivers of this country are fishable and swimmable. How I wish I could live long enough to see that figure at 100 percent. 
It is expensive. It is expensive to undo a mess. As I said on the Senate floor last week in a different context but it bears repeating here, as the English philosopher said, there is nothing more utterly impossible than undoing what has already been done. Do you think Bill Clinton wouldn't like to undo some of his past? Do you think people in my State wouldn't like to undo some of the surface mining, the strip mining, that we allowed to take place? They just dug out the earth, piled it up in big layers, took the coal, and left it. 
It is not even half over. When you consider the fact that mines of 5 acres and less aren't even regulated, when you think of all the 3.2 million acres of lands we have given to the mining industry, these lands are not included. 
So what do we have? The Senator from Idaho said Senator Bumpers is up there talking about what happened years ago. In 1992, in Colorado, Summitville's actions cost the taxpayers $30,000 a day; 6 years ago that disaster occurred. What did they do? They polluted 17 miles of a river. It is now a Superfund site. 
Zortman-Landusky, 1998, in Montana--going broke. Taxpayers will get to pick up the tab while we do another study by the National Academy of Sciences. Then you can go home and say, `Yes, I'm for the environment.' I think the National Academy of Sciences ought to study these things as the disasters pile up. In 1998, in South Dakota, they are not quite broke yet, they are in financial difficulties. They had a $6 million bond, and the cleanup figure is now estimated at $10 million. Who picks up the difference? You know who picks up the difference. 
There are 557,000 hardrock mine sites that are abandoned. Today, 59 of them are on the Superfund list. The cost to the poor taxpayers: $34 to $71 billion, because the U.S. Congress engaged in sophistry, specious arguments, as the pollution went on, as the unreclaimed mines were left for the taxpayers to pick up the tab. 
Think about 2,000 sites in our national parks that have to be reclaimed. Twelve thousand miles of rivers are polluted, and they say we need another 27 months to study it. 
I don't know much of anything else I can say about this. I will have a lot more to say tomorrow when I offer yet another amendment on mining. Then the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Idaho can have a big party and say, `That mean old Senator from Arkansas, we have heard the last of him,' because you will have. I have been on this subject now for 10 years, with just a few marginal successes. As I pick up the paper in a few years and watch how things have gone, I will be a detached taxpayer, still with strong feelings about it. All I can say is, I did my best to try to save this planet for my children, my grandchildren, and yours. 
Let me repeat one more time, when you consider FLPMA, which we passed in 1978, when you consider the National Forest Management Act, when you consider the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, tell us, which ones would you strike? Which ones would you repeal? 
It reminds me, as a southerner, what a tough time we had coming to grips with civil rights. Monday morning I will speak at an assembly at Central High School in Little Rock where, 31 years ago, the National Guard was called to keep black children from going to school there. The Arkansas Gazette, at that time the oldest newspaper west of the Mississippi, took a strong stand against Orval Faubus, who was Governor and who called out the National Guard to keep those nine children from going to school at Little Rock Central High School. 
They lost circulation down to about 82,000. Orval Faubus was elected six times--the first Governor ever elected to a fourth term. Only one had ever been elected to a third term. And who today would take that side of that question? There are a few, of course. Who today would want to go back to charging people to vote?--which they did when I was a young man. You had to go down to the courthouse and pay a dollar for a poll tax. Who would go back to that? 
If I were to start talking about the literally hundreds of things that we have done in this country that were terribly unpopular--I can remember when every doctor in America said, `If you pass that Medicare bill, you will be sorry; it will be the end of health care in this country.' Can you find me somebody today who doesn't like Medicare, including the medical profession? No. In the 1970's--go back and look at the speeches made when we passed a variety of environmental statutes. I never read as many doomsday speeches in my life. Who would go back to the time when we didn't have NEPA? Who would want to go back to the time where we emptied our garbage out in the Buffalo River in plastic bags? 
Sometimes it is a long time coming, and the disastrous part of it is that so much of it is irreversible; you cannot put it back the way God gave it to us. That might be getting too heavy on an issue like this. But I am telling you, when you look at the statistics of how many abandoned mine sites there are right now, when you look at the fact that we know what this is--this is nothing more than a dilatory tactic. There is not one Senator who doesn't know precisely what this is about. It is a simple delaying tactic. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield the remainder of my time--Mr. President, I will not yield back the remainder of my time. I think Senator Landrieu may wish to speak, so I will reserve the remainder of my time for her.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, here is what the new regulations contain: 
Regulations to minimize adverse environmental impacts, if economically and technically feasible--that is a pretty big loophole; that is what these new regulations provide--reclaim the land to its prior condition; bonding, enough bond to cover reclamation costs; and, protect the air and water quality. 
Let me ask my opponents on this issue, to which of those do you object? To what do you object? 
Mr. President, these arguments about the poor gold miners processing gold--I have heard those same arguments year after year, and sometimes when gold was more than $400 an ounce. If gold is cheap, that is the argument. If gold is high, then it is jobs. If neither apply, then it is that bad old Federal Government trying to regulate our lives--anything under God's Sun to keep from doing anything to make the mining companies of this country do it right. 
This is the simplest amendment in the world. Everybody knows what it is. For 17 years, since 1981, we have been living with regulations for the most part which were hopelessly out of date. In the meantime, we have been allowing cyanide to go into the rivers and streams and the underground aquifers of this country, and they don't want to do anything about it. They don't want a regulation or a rule that makes people responsible for that. 
I think I have said everything I can possibly say about this issue. I will simply say I may lose this afternoon, and probably will. And when 27 months have gone by, unless somebody takes it on again next year, maybe we will get James Watt back as Secretary of the Interior and we will not have to worry about things like this anymore. This is very carefully crafted to say to Bruce Babbitt that you cannot do anything--you can't do anything until the year 2001. At that time, my opponents on this divinely hope that there will be a Republican President and there will be a Secretary of the Interior who will do their bidding. That may happen. And in the meantime, unmitigated, unfathomable economic disasters will continue to occur. 
If this is an issue for the Senate to do something about, all you have to do is vote yes. If you do not want to do anything about it, then vote no. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I had not intended to discuss the subject of the hour this morning, and I will only do so briefly and, hopefully, not in a controversial way. I heard the Senator from Pennsylvania pleading with people to reserve judgment. And I simply want to echo what he said. These are very traumatic times for this country. And I would say, despite the trauma the country is experiencing over the apparently possible impeachment of the President, we still have a tremendous amount of work to do in the U.S. Congress, and the American people have a right to expect us to do that business before we leave here. 
While it is more gratifying, I suppose, from a political standpoint, as well as from a personal standpoint, to immerse ourselves in the Starr report, we still have so much very serious, important work to do here, and I would be willing to suggest that we should come back after the election if necessary to deal with some of these things. 
Having said that, let me say that the President will respond in time to the Starr report, I am sure. He is entitled to be heard. The American people are entitled to an objective, nonpartisan deliberation based on the facts. 
As a former trial lawyer, I have gone before jurors who I had a sneaking suspicion had made up their mind before I got to make my opening statement. And I can tell you, it is a very queasy feeling. I have tried cases when, in my own mind, I was satisfied that the jury had made up its mind before the case was tried, before they heard the evidence, despite what we lawyers call voir dire examination, where you ask the jurors: `Do you have any preconceived notions about this case?' All of them said no. And I did not come to that conclusion that they made up their mind before they heard the evidence just because I lost, it was based on other things. 
The American people have an inimitable, innate sense of fairness. The vast majority of the people in this country want, expect, and have a right to know that this whole situation is going to be considered in a very dignified way in accordance with the process. 
This should not be--and I do not think it will be a political witch hunt. And I want to compliment the people in the House whom I have watched in the Rules Committee and in the Judiciary Committee, and the Speaker of the House, in their admonitions to their own Members about this being a very solemn, somber time in the history of this country and we must treat it with the seriousness it deserves. This is not one of those `let's give them a fair trial and string them up' kind of hearings. 
So as an English philosopher once said, `There's nothing more utterly impossible than undoing that which has already been done.' Whatever the President's sins, they have been done. So far as anybody much knows at the present, the American people know what those sins were, his indiscretions, what he described as `indefensible.' 
So the question before the House will be whether or not any or all of those things combined reach the threshold that the Founders intended in the Constitution; and that is, we know it is not treason and it is not bribery, and the next question will be: Does it reach the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors? 
The President has admitted, as far as I know, virtually everything. So he has bared his soul to the American people and pleaded for their forgiveness, as he did this morning before a prayer breakfast. 
So, Mr. President, while I did not come over here to speak on that, I just wanted to add my comments to those of the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter. 
And I would also like to say that when I talk about the work we have yet to do here, I am talking about issues of health care, I am talking about issues of the environment, and I am talking about issues of education. I am not trying to make a comparison, but what I am saying is that morality is often like beauty, it is in the eye of the beholder. 
There has been an awful lot said about the President sacrificing his moral authority. And I would simply remind people--and this is not intended to be defensive--I would simply remind people that allowing children to go without health care is immoral, too, in this Senator's opinion. And abusing the only planet God gave us to sustain ourselves is also immoral. 
Probably next Tuesday, The Senate will debate a provision included in the Interior Appropriations bill that would prevent the Secretary of Interior from being able to strengthen the environmental rules determining how the giant mining companies of this country will mine gold, silver and so on from our public lands. Most people don't know it, but we mine gold through a process called heap leach mining. And do you know what we use? Cyanide. I am not saying it is immoral to use cyanide, but I am saying it is immoral to block regulations determining how you are going to use cyanide to keep it out of rivers, streams and the underground water supply. That is what the amendment on Tuesday will be about. 
I put in the category of being immoral to say the Secretary of the Interior must wait and let somebody else do a study before he can protect the environment. Last year, we had a handshake deal on this subject--we agreed not to procrastinate and delay Interior Department regulations any longer. Now, this year we have to have the National Academy of Sciences study it--postpone it for another 27 months. At the end of that, the mining industry will probably want the National Organization of Women to study it. After that, they will want NASA to study it --anything to keep from facing up to despoiling the only planet we have to sustain our children and grandchildren. As I say, morality takes a lot of forms.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I also wanted to discuss another matter of significance. We are going to technically have a budget surplus this year. Nobody knows how much it will be. The CBO has estimated the surplus will be somewhere between $50 and $63 billion. They have projected $1.4 trillion in surpluses over the next 10 years. We need to keep in mind that estimates are just that--estimates. When you consider the fact in the last 60 days, $1.9 trillion has been lost on the stock exchanges of this country, you tell me how you would evaluate that study that was made about 4 months ago that we are going to have a $1.4 trillion surplus over the next 10 years. The surplus may hold up this year and we may get a surplus next year, because an awful lot of people are bailing out of the market. 
But when we talk about a surplus, it has been said time and time and time again on the floor of this Senate, it is not really a surplus. I don't know why in the name of God we keep calling it a surplus when it isn't. But for the sake of argument, because this is the way we do it here, let's assume we will have a $50 to $63 billion surplus this year. But let me add this caveat: $100 billion of that is the excess in the Social Security Trust Fund. You take the Social Security excess out and we will have a $40 to $50 billion deficit. 
Now, having set the stage for whoever may be listening to this argument, we are effectively looking this fall for a surplus, and every dime of it will come from the Social Security Trust Fund. Then I pick up the paper this morning and I see where there is a move in the U.S. Senate to go ahead with a tax cut after all. I don't know whether what I read this morning is true or not, but I have applauded our Budget Committee chairman in the past because he has steadfastly been opposed to tax cuts this year. But this morning I read that maybe he is about ready to sign off on an $80 billion tax cut. I want to say this: There is an unassailable argument that can be made, that we are cutting taxes for some of the wealthiest people in America and it is coming right out of the Social Security Trust Fund. 
If you put $100 billion that we collected in Social Security this year, in excess of what we paid out, if you take that surplus and take it off budget and put it in the Trust Fund where it is supposed to be, you have a deficit. If you leave it in, you have a surplus. It is a phony surplus. And this tax cut will come out of the phony surplus, which means it is coming right out of the Social Security Trust Fund. 
Now, I would not presume to give political advice to the people on the other side of the aisle, and I can tell you that nobody ever lost a vote--normally--voting for a tax cut. In 1993, we lost control of the Senate because we voted for a tax increase on the wealthiest of Americans which brought about our current economic prosperity and renewed fiscal soundness. I said time and time again, if the Democrats had to lose control of the Senate for casting a very courageous vote that brought this country 7, 8 years of economic vibrancy, it was worth it. 
I lost two of the dearest friends I had in the election of 1994 because they voted for the 1993 budget bill. We have been benefiting from it ever since, and we now find ourselves in this very happy, euphoric state. Why cannot we enjoy and leave it alone? Why do we have to keep tinkering with it? If you don't want the Social Security Trust Fund to be a vibrant fund, something that gives people who are in the workforce at the age of 25 or 30 some degree of assurance that it will be there for them, if you don't want to do that, say so. 
Mr. President, do you know that under current estimates--and these estimates, as I say, are just what I say they are; they depend on the economy and they depend on a lot of things. But the Social Security Administration estimates by the year 2020, the Social Security trust fund will have a $3.7 trillion surplus. The only problem with that is 12 years later it is bankrupt. If we don't fix Social Security--we are not going to do it this year--if we don't get at it soon, and we allow ourselves to squander a $3.7 trillion trust fund, it will be one of the most callous, irresponsible acts ever taken by the U.S. Congress. 
If you don't want it to go to the Social Security Trust Fund, then you just tell your constituents you are not for a tax cut; you want it to either stay in the Social Security Trust Fund or you want it to go on the national debt, which now stands at about $5.2 trillion. 
We still have a vibrant economy. When you start taking money out of the Social Security trust fund to funnel into the economy, you have the remote chance of increasing inflation. You increase inflation, you increase interest rates. You increase interest rates, the buying of cars and houses goes `kerplunk.' Those are simple economic principles. They are just as certain to happen as the night following the day. 
Why cannot we be grateful for our prosperity? Mr. President, I vented my spleen on one of my favorite subjects this morning, and that is that I think tinkering with the phony surplus in order to provide a tax cut is not only bad economic policy, it is bad politics for those who propose it. In 1981--I am not sure I would have had the courage, except I had just been reelected, had 6 years in front of me to rectify whatever sins I committed--in 
1981, I stood right here--I think I have been sitting at this desk for about 18 years--and I made the point just before we voted that if you passed Ronald Reagan's tax cuts and doubled defense spending, you were not going to balance the budget in 1984, you were going to create deficits big enough to choke a mule. 
There is nothing more fun for a politician than to be able to say I told you so, so that is what I am saying. Eleven Senators voted against that. There were only three Senators who voted against the tax cuts and for the spending cuts, which would have balanced the budget in 1984; it was yours truly, Bill Bradley from New Jersey, and Fritz Hollings from South Carolina. But 11 of us voted against that tax cut and said you are going to get the deficit out of control. My precise words were: `It will be big enough to choke a mule.' You will find that in the Congressional Record. And we did it. I don't know whether we choked a mule or not, but the consequences were absolutely horrendous, and remained horrendous until 1993 when we were looking at $300 billion in annual deficits as far as the eye could see. 
So I am pleading with my colleagues to think about it. My voice is not persuasive on the other side of the aisle, and I know that. It is very presumptuous of me to even make this speech, and I don't intend to lecture. I am simply saying that despite what is going on here in this traumatic time in the history of this country, let's not compound that by making a terrible economic mistake. And, as I say, for some, in my opinion, it is a terrible political mistake. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I came over to express my very strong support for campaign finance reform. From the time I ran for Governor in 1970 until 28 years later--this very moment--I have abhorred the system of financing campaigns in this country. One of the reasons--not the main reason, but certainly one of the reasons I decided not to seek reelection this year was because I detested going out and raising money. 
Let me also say that it is reaching the point in this country where the cost of campaigning goes up every single year--and there is no end in sight. 
Right now the Attorney General is conducting a 90-day interim period investigation on whether or not the DNC coordinated a 1996 campaign with the President of the United States. The same thing is going on with the Vice President. And the same thing will go on forever until we change it, and change it dramatically--soft money, hard money, issue ads, attack ads. 
I close, Mr. President, by saying I consider not only the method of financing campaigns in this country ominous, quite frankly, I consider it rotten to the core. 
I also want to say to the American people----

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I want to lead off with one of Mo Udall's great statements: Everything that needs to be said has been said but everybody hasn't said it. So I want to get my two cents in before we vote on this measure this afternoon. 
A moment ago, I said everything about this issue I feel strongly about, except for one thing: While I strongly support this legislation, I also believe that the ultimate solution to this problem is public financing. Unhappily, I will no longer be a member of this distinguished body when this Country and Congress finally comes to its senses and realizes that until we go to public financing, our democracy is simply not going to work. I am reluctant to make an admission today, but I have always prided myself on standing up for things that oftentimes were unpopular but I felt strongly were right. 
I say to my colleagues, that I believe that one of the things that has sustained me is the reputation of having taken a tough stance from time to time. But since I announced that I would not seek reelection last June, and as I have walked on the Senate floor to vote, I have pondered how much the freedom of not running for reelection has influenced my vote. Now, that being said, I have cast many unpopular votes that have irritated the people of my State, on such subjects as the Panama Canal Treaty, and partial-birth abortion. However, after I announced I wouldn't run again, I have asked myself, How would I vote on this if I were up for reelection and knew I had to raise $3 or $4 million? 
I believe there isn't a person in this body who can truthfully and frequently say they are willing to take on interest groups. After all, we are supposed to be servants of our constituents. But oftentimes there are interest groups back home we are trying to satisfy because they have a block of votes. We might vote their way. Even if we vote our conscious, the public can never be sure our votes were untainted. 
The second thing that influences our vote is how our support or opposition will affect our money supply. I saw a comparison in the paper this morning of two PACs, of House and Senate leaders and the amount of money that certain individual groups gave those leaders for their PACs. Staggering amounts of money. I don't care how altruistic it is for `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,' it is foolish in the extreme to argue that this is a free speech debate. Mr. President, 94 percent of the people who run for office in this country win if they have more money than their opponents. A lot of good men and women are defeated every year in this country because they are not incumbents and they can't raise money. The people who give the big bucks don't like to give their money to challengers because they start out behind and usually stay behind. Of the 33 Senate races this year, I daresay there will be very, very few changes, in any, of those seats. In almost every instance, the candidate who has the most money and spends the most money will win the election. 
Sometimes I think about debates. I have the first amendment that we will consider on the Interior bill when we go back to it this afternoon. It is mine, and it is one that the mining industry of this country doesn't like. It is an environmental issue. I will make all of the arguments that I have made on this floor time and again, not only on that amendment but the whole issue of the 1872 mining law, which has been out of date for over 100 years now. God gave us one planet, only one. We don't get a second chance. Incidentally, I have always argued that the No. 1 problem in the world, of course, is population, but you can't argue that here because the first thing you hear is that somebody has converted it into an abortion argument. So we continue to neglect the No. 1 problem in the world; namely, the growing population of the planet. I saw a bumper sticker the other day that said, `Help save the planet, kill yourself.' Clearly, that is a pretty draconian way to save the planet. We ought to be talking sensibly about population growth, as we have been regarding campaign finance reform. 
I can go on and on about this, and will continue to do so until the taxpayers of this country understand that this is not an issue of free speech. If the American people buy this argument, they are essentially saying, `I'm willing for somebody else to have more free speech than I do because they have more money.' As we all know, about 90 percent of the people in this country can't afford to contribute and don't contribute. 
I had a few more remarks, but I understand the Senator from Georgia is pressed for time. I now yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just conclude my remarks by reiterating something I said earlier about the issue of free speech. We all know that the difficulty is a constitutional one because the courts have ruled that this is a free speech issue. But it can be overcome. It can be overcome with the McCain-Feingold bill. It can be overcome with public financing. There are all kinds of ways to amend the way we finance campaigns in this country without violating free speech. But let me just ask my constituents--no, let me ask my colleagues--no, my colleagues have already made up their minds. Let me ask the American people: Do you think we have a nice, democratic, fair system of electing Members of the House and Senate when some fat cat can give a candidate $4,000; he and his wife can give a candidate $4,000--$2,000 for the primary, $2,000 for the general. I ask you, how much can a working man making $10 an hour on an assembly line give? The question answers itself. If he has a wife and two kids, he can't give anything. I don't care how much he may love a candidate; he is not in a position, at $10 an hour, to be making political contributions. 
The second question: When a candidate gets $4,000 from a fat cat--when legislation is being considered in the U.S. Congress, who will get the candidate's attention? The poor stiff with a wife and two children to feed, educate and clothe and who is trying to make a living? How much attention is he going to get compared to the guy who gave $4,000? Now, that is an illustration that is palpably clear to everybody. 
Herman Talmadge, one of the great Senators who served here, had a lot of sayings in making speeches. He said, `If you want your audience to pay attention, you've got to throw the corn where the hogs can get to it.' You have to say it so people can understand it. What I just said is understandable. It is essentially as much a one-line description of what this debate is about as anything I can conjure up. 
The guy that gave $4,000 gets a lot of free speech, and a lot of the free speech he gets goes right into the ear of the Senator or the Congressman that got the $4,000. And when the phone call comes into the office from the poor guy making $10 an hour, with a wife and kids, because he wants a passport or because he knows a friend from Bolivia that is being mistreated under the immigration laws, do you know where his phone call goes if it is answered at all? It goes back to the staff. Where does the call go from the guy who gave $4,000? You and I both know where it goes. It goes directly into the office of the Senator. Do you call that free speech? Do you call that a democracy? 
It is impossible to keep up with the campaign finance laws as they are written today. One of the things Al Gore is charged with is making a phone call from his office to solicit money. 
I am not going to say anymore about that because everybody here understands that. The President is under investigation now under a 90-day sort of determination by the Attorney General as to whether or not in 1996 his campaign coordinated some ads with the Democratic National Committee. 
Today my side is going to lose. The way we finance campaigns is going to continue exactly as it has been since the memory of mind runneth not, and investigations of either Democrats, or Republicans, or both will continue. It is impossible to level the laws of this country, and in this very hostile partisan environment. 
Sometimes I think about offering a resolution in the Senate saying it is the sense of the Senate that there are some Democrats who have not yet been investigated and we want to know why. 
We will continue to lose this debate until the American people wake up not only to the corruption of the financing laws of the country, but to the fact that their democracy is disappearing right under their nose. 
It is so difficult at times to get people to focus on something that is a little bit complicated. They don't understand. Since it doesn't really relate to them, they just do not want to be bothered. 
Republicans--I will hand it to them. They are zealots. Rain or shine, they go vote. My party--we have to ride in the sunshine. In all fairness, I have to say that we represent a lot of people who do not own automobiles. They oftentimes don't have ways to get to the polls, unless some of that campaign money is given to drivers to go out and get them and bring them in. 
I saw a poll that showed that 71 percent of all Republicans say they are going to vote, and about 60 percent of the Democrats say they are not going to vote. Unless that figure changes, I can tell you what this election is going to do. I assume the President has to take some responsibility for that. I just do not know. He is my friend, and that is a separate subject. We will deal with that later. 
But even absent the Starr report, absent Monica Lewinsky, we had a plateful for the American people to ingest. Part of that plateful is corruption, which is, in my opinion, as threatening to the Nation as the Kenneth Starr report is. 
I suspect this country is in a bit of a funk today. I haven't looked at the market yet. It started off down this morning. I think that is all the result of people being upset and depressed--and, is the country leaderless? How is this all going to come out? Is it going to take 5 or 6 months to get this resolved? All of those things. 
Tonight, when you listen to the news, that is all you will hear. Tomorrow night, when you listen to the news, that is all you will hear. 
And here is something that goes right to the heart of whether we survive as a democracy, or not. Frankly--I hate to condemn the public--they are not paying attention. Every poll shows it. What is the most important thing to you? Campaign finance is about tenth on the list. Democrats keep trying to make it a big issue, trying to get people to pay attention to it, and in all fairness, seven or eight Republicans. But how can you expect them to when they hear absolutely nothing on the evening news but Monica Lewinsky and Kenneth Starr's report. As I say, I am not condemning the American people. That is just the way we are made. That salacious stuff is a lot more exciting than talking about campaign finance reform, which is complex. 
Mr. President, I have said all that I want to say, and all that I need to say. But I especially wanted to put in the part about free speech. 
It is so tragic that everybody here knows who is getting the free speech, and everybody knows whose voice is not heard because of the way we finance campaigns. I say that we ought to go to public financing. That way every person in this country who is a taxpayer would know that his vote was as important as anybody else's. His voice would be as important as anybody else's. As long as it is the richest and the wealthiest people who determine the outcome of elections in this country, where do you think we are headed? I will leave that question with you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, John Turner will retire this year after more than twenty-five years of service to the forest products industry. A native of Camden, Arkansas, John is completing a long and distinguished career with the Georgia-Pacific Corporation. 
John joined Georgia-Pacific Corporation in 1972 as Public Relations Manager for the Crossett, Arkansas, Division. His responsibilities were expanded to include government relations in 1977 for the states of Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas. In 1983, he assumed responsibility for state-level government affairs for the corporation and relocated to Washington, D.C. 
In his present position as Vice President of Government Affairs, John has directed and coordinated the corporation's Federal and State government affairs staff and legislative policy for the corporation in Washington and in the eight state office locations. 
In addition to a long association with various entities in the forest products industry, John also had a career in radio and television broadcasting. John was educated at Southern Arkansas University in Magnolia, Arkansas, receiving a degree in communications. 
Active in forestry and trade associations, John serves on the American Forest and Paper Association's Energy Council and chairs the Endangered Species Reauthorization Committee. John has also served two terms on the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission and one term on the Arkansas Forestry Commission. He is also a member of the Public Relations Society of America. 
Despite his consuming dedication to his industry, John has made time for numerous civic duties, including work with the Jaycees, Lions Club, Rotary Club, Boys Club of America, and United Way. He has served his local community as a city airport commission member and as a member of the hospital board of directors. 
Mr. President, I am proud of the association I have had with John Turner over the years. He has been a steadfast friend and a trusted adviser on issues of importance not only to his industry, but to the economy of our beloved State as well. His preparedness, integrity and willingness to compromise have served him and his industry well. 
I wish John and his lovely wife Jean a long and relaxing retirement. Perhaps John's retirement from his `day' job will give them time to more faithfully follow their beloved Razorbacks football and basketball teams, as well as enjoy their two daughters and two granddaughters. 
Mr. President, John Turner leaves big shoes to fill in the forest products industry. I hope his successors will look to his fine example of the role of the lobbyist and spokesperson in our system.

Mr. BUMPERS. I yield myself 3 minutes. 
Mr. President, this amendment, for the edification of people who didn't hear any of the debate last night, is to make a very minor change in the grand jury system. Now, bear in mind, the grand jury system is about as outdated, as big an anachronism as there is in this country. 
For openers, all this amendment does is to say that an innocent person who is called before the grand jury--not as a target, not as a defendant, but an absolutely innocent witness, an absolutely innocent witness who is terrified because he or she is appearing before the grand jury for the first time in his or her life, and they know that if they misspeak, if their memory doesn't satisfy the prosecutor, they face the possibility of being charged with perjury. 
Right now when that innocent person goes to testify before the grand jury, let's make it easy, let's assume, as I did last evening, that it is a Senator's wife; that might be understandable around here. The Senator's wife goes in after having paid some lawyer $5,000 or $10,000 just as a retainer to make sure she doesn't get charged with something for which she is innocent. She goes in and sits in the chair and they start asking her all kinds of personal questions that are totally irrelevant to why she is there: Have you been faithful to your spouse? Do you have a child charged with smoking pot? I understand your daughter is gay. 
Those things are not stretches of my imagination. But her lawyer is seated outside the door, because under the Federal rules he cannot come into the same room in which his client, the witness, is testifying. Think of that. Think about how we bash China and their criminal justice system and their violation of human rights. That Senator's wife might be called back again tomorrow and the next day and the next day and the next day. You have seen it happen. 
All we are saying is, don't make her crawl down off of the witness stand to go outside and talk to her lawyer about how she should answer these questions. If she does that three times, do you know what the grand jury does? They start nudging each other. `She must be hiding something; she is sure going out to talk to her lawyer a lot.' 
That is a woefully inadequate system for a great nation like this. All I am saying, let the lawyer come into the room. 
The Justice Department opposes this amendment. Now, doesn't that shock you? Of course they oppose it. They are in the business of putting notches on their belt. They want to be able to say this grand jury has never refused to return an indictment that I asked for. A New York judge said, `Of course, they return those indictments. A grand jury will indict a ham sandwich if the prosecutor asks them to.' 
All I am saying, let's follow what 27 States have already done. They have abolished the grand jury system. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am glad the opponents to this amendment don't have anything to say this morning, and I am happy to use up the rest of my time. Perhaps we can get a unanimous consent agreement that they will yield back the balance of their time and we will vote. 
All I want to say is we are talking about a criminal justice system of the greatest nation on Earth, which is terrible. We are not talking about the mob, we are not talking about the mafioso, we are talking witnesses. 
Here is a classic case of a fulfillment of what everybody in this Senate has said at one time or another, and that is criminals have a better deal than do ordinary citizens. A criminal gets an attorney hired for him if he doesn't have one. A criminal is advised to remain silent. The Senator's wife can't remain silent. She has been subpoenaed to come down and testify. 
All I am saying, don't make her go outside the room. The attorney in the courtroom, he is not going to file motions. He is not going to make objections. But I tell you what it will do. It will have a salutary effect on the conduct of the attorney prosecuting the case. 
He won't be asking redundant, personal questions that have nothing to do with the case. This is not a game of `gotcha,' a game of seeing how many scalps you can put on your belt, how many notches you can put on your gun barrel. This is American justice we are talking about. We haven't addressed the grand jury system in 10 years. It is 500 years old, and it is 10 times worse now than it was 500 years ago.

This morning, Senator Hatch and I agreed to a plan that recommended that the issue be submitted to the Judicial Conference for study and a report back to Congress. 
I have talked to the floor managers who have agreed to it.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I hope that we can probably yield time back on this amendment. Senator Hollings is a cosponsor of the bill which this amendment is based on, as are several other Senators. It is a very simple amendment. 
I first brought this issue to the Senate's attention in 1984 when it was determined that Charles Wick, who at that time was head of the U.S. Information Agency, had been tape recording conversations with just about everybody he talked to, including President Reagan and President Carter, without their knowledge or consent. 
He revealed that he had recorded over 80 conversations--Cabinet members, Presidents, everybody. They did not even know it. I do not mind telling you, while I knew that that was legal, I was deeply offended by it. And I am still offended by it. This is an area, that is so often the case, where the States are way ahead of the Senate. 
Recently, Attorney General Janet Reno testified before our Appropriations Committee, and I asked her, `General Reno, I have a bill pending in the Congress that would make it a crime to tape record conversations where only one party knew it was being tape recorded; namely, the person doing the recording, and the other person didn't know it. How do you feel about that, General Reno?' 
`Well,' she said, `you know, that came up in the Florida State legislature back in the early 1970s. And we passed a law in Florida that made it a crime to tape record telephone conversations where only one party knew about it.' And I said, `Well, let me ask you this: What were you doing at the time?' I guess she was district attorney or whatever they describe that position in Dade County, FL. And finally I said, `Well, General Reno, how did you feel about the Florida legislation?' She said, `I favored it.' Well, I favor it, too. 
And Charles Wick is not the first, and he certainly will not be the last, to have ever recorded telephone conversations without telling people. 
I have introduced this legislation three times--1984, 1993 and 1998. I will never understand--as those of us who lose never seem to--how, on God's green Earth, anybody would vote against prohibiting and outlawing such an outrageous invasion of people's privacy. 
Sometimes I am sitting in my office and talking on the telephone to people back home that are wanting me to support legislation, and sometimes I am sort of hanging foot loose and fancy free, saying things that I would not say publicly. And do not be offended; that applies to every single Member of this body. Every one of them have done it. 
Sometimes I say things, and later on I get to thinking, `You know what? If that guy was tape recording that'--he had a perfect right to--`I wouldn't have to know about it.' And you know something else? Approximately fifteen States have done exactly what Florida did; they have outlawed this. 
The Congress is the last one to ever get the word. On that grand jury amendment I offered this morning, 28 States allow a witness' attorney in a grand jury room. And Congress is still dithering and ringing its hands and saying--`Well, I don't know. We need to study it.' And here we are with one of the most egregious abuses known-- 
and we continue to tolerate it. 
What if you called from Maryland to Virginia? Let's just assume the Governor of Maryland calls the Governor of Virginia. Now, the Governor of Maryland assumes that he is protected because Maryland has a law against recording a telephone conversation when both parties are not privy to it. But the Governor in Virginia can tape-record the conversation and he hasn't violated Maryland law because he isn't in Maryland, he is in Virginia, where it is legal to tape-record such conversations. If for no other reason, we should have a Federal law to make the matter consistent. 
Now, in 1984, when I joined with Senator Metzenbaum on a floor amendment on this subject, I listened to the arguments over and over again that this would impede law enforcement. I want to tell you, so there will be no misunderstanding about this, I don't want any Senator coming on this floor and asking me, `How about law enforcement?' I have exempted intelligence gathering; CIA, DEA, everybody else is exempt; I have exempted the FBI, every sheriff, every police department. I have exempted anybody who even professes to know anything about law enforcement or intelligence gathering. I have exempted telemarketers, whose bosses have a right to monitor their conversations to see how effectively they are doing on the telephone. 
We have made this provision as palatable as we can possibly make it, and we have done it in a sensible way. Colleagues, you will never get a chance to vote for an amendment that has been thought out any better than this one has. It has now been 14 years since I first gave the Senate an opportunity to pass such an amendment as this. As I say, it is very narrowly tailored. 
All I could do, if I wanted to use up the entire 40 minutes, is to stand here and repeat over and over again how offended I am at the thought of somebody tape-recording a conversation with me and not telling me about it, and the first thing you know, I see it on the front page of the Washington Post. 
This amendment has nothing to do with Linda Tripp. This is not a partisan, political amendment. I am telling you, I introduced a bill on this subject in the Senate in 1984, and I introduced a similar bill in 1993, and I am offering it to this body in 1998. Linda Tripp played no part. You make up your own mind about that case, whatever it may be. I am just telling you, as a general principle and as a citizen of the Nation that values the privacy of its citizens above all, please support this amendment and let's put this one to rest once and for all. 
I yield the floor and I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, if you vote no on this amendment, you should be prepared to go home and say to your constituents that you really don't believe in privacy. When we have a law in this country that allows people to tape-record a conversation with you and only they know it is being taped and you don't and that is quite legal, we no longer have any privacy in this country. How do you explain that to your constituents? 
This bill would make it a criminal offense, as Janet Reno said she favored in Florida, as 15 States have already adopted. We overwhelmingly passed a law to make it a criminal offense to intercept a cellular phone call. What I am trying to do is to extend that to the old archaic rule--think of this, think of this. You can be talking to a person who is your best friend; he or she can be tape-recording that conversation and publish it on the front page of the New York Times or the Washington Post, and there isn't a thing you can do about it. 
I have exempted law enforcement; I have exempted intelligence agencies; I have exempted everybody who has to make telephone calls in their business; I have exempted people who are threatened or stalked. 
Please, let's correct this once and for all.

I offered it then, and I got 41 votes. I offered it again in 1993. Linda Tripp has nothing to do with this. 
This is plain decency. It is constitutional. It is an invasion of your privacy for somebody to record a conversation of you and you not know it.

<DOCNO>105-bumpers-ar-9-19980721</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. BUMPERS. I want to suggest to each Senator that they meditate on this proposition. 
The doorbell rings and the Senator's wife answers the door. There is a nicely dressed person, in a suit and tie, standing at the door. He hands her a paper, and she says, `What is this?' 
He says, `That's a subpoena.' 
She says, `What does that mean?' 
He says, `That means that the district attorney, the United States attorney wants to question you.' 
`Well, about what?' 
`I don't know.' 
`What does this paper mean?' 
`It means that you don't have any choice. You must go down and appear before the grand jury.' 
`Well, how long will that take?' 
`Well, as a matter of fact, sometimes it takes several days. Some witnesses have been known to have to appear for 5 and 6 and 7 days, different times.' 
`But I don't know anything. What can I testify to?' 
`Ma'am, I'm just a functionary. I have been requested, and it is my official duty to present you with this subpoena. Incidentally, the U.S. attorney also wants you to bring all of your telephone calls and also any other documents or letters you may have in your possession that would relate to anything.' 
`Well,' she says, `Do I get to bring a lawyer with me?' 
`Oh, yes, ma'am, you can bring a lawyer.' 
Then she says, `Well, can my lawyer sit in the grand jury room with me?' 
`No, ma'am, I'm afraid not. Your lawyer can sit outside the grand jury room but he can't come in the room with you.' 
Now, to a lot of people, this is a real story. This is not an Orwellian bad dream. This is what happens to a lot of innocent people in this country on a daily basis. She doesn't have any choice but to show up. 
If she had been arrested and charged with a crime, and she was a possible criminal who was about to go on trial and serve jail time if convicted, she would have a constitutional right to a lawyer, or to remain silent. She would not have to tell the U.S. attorney anything. She could remain silent. She could not only remain silent; she would be provided a lawyer if she could not afford one. 
How many times has every person in the Senate stood on this floor and said criminals have more rights than ordinary citizens? 
In this case, it is true. I just gave you a classic illustration of why it is true. If this woman were arrested by the police, or charged with a crime, they couldn't treat her in such a way. But, because she is an ordinary witness, an innocent citizen, she can be made to go and testify. She can be made to bring any documents the U.S. attorney chooses to make her bring. She can be required to walk in the grand jury room and sit alone on the stand in abject terror because her lawyer is not permitted in the room with her; he must sit outside. 
It is true that she can ask for a recess, leave the witness stand and say to the court, say to the U.S. attorney: 
`Before I answer that question, I would like to talk to my lawyer.' 
He says, `OK.' 
So she goes outside and she asks her lawyer, to whom she has just paid a $5,000 retainer because she is terrified--not because she has done anything wrong--she has just paid this lawyer $5,000. They are people of very modest means. He cannot go in the grand jury room, but she can go out and ask him a question. She is not a lawyer and she is not sophisticated enough to know on what questions should she defer to her lawyer. She could answer the most incriminating question in the world, in all of her legal ignorance, and not know she had just implicated herself. 
What if she says to the man who appeared at her door with a subpoena: 
`You say you don't know what they want to talk to me about?' 
He says, `Well, it's about the parking meter scandal.' 
`I don't know anything about any parking meter scandal.' 
`Well, I'm sorry, ma'am.' 
She says, `If they asked me something and I can't remember it, or if I try to remember and I give them an answer and it turns out to be wrong, then what happens?' 
`Oh, then in that case, ma'am, they may charge you with perjury.' 
Here is a classic case of a criminal justice system that is not working. I heard all these lamentations about human rights in China, but you tell me, how much worse can a situation get, when innocent people every day in this country are called to testify--and, frankly, as good citizens they should be willing to testify--but when they get in the grand jury room with the U.S. attorney, they are subject to his mercy. He can ask them--he can ask this woman, first crack out of the bat, in this investigation of a parking meter scandal: 
`Have you been faithful to your husband ever since you got married?' He can do this because there is no requirement of relevancy in the grand jury. 
`Well, as a matter of fact, I think that's personal.' 
`Ma'am, I'm asking you a question. I want an answer. I understand that one of your children is gay; is that true?' 
`Well, what's that got to do with anything?' 
`Ma'am, I'm asking you the questions. I'm the U.S. attorney here, and I can ask anything I want. Is it true one of your children got picked up one time on a pot charge when he was a senior in high school?' 
`What is that relevant to?' 
`Ma'am, as I said, I'm asking the questions here. Now, I'm asking you, and you are legally required to answer truthfully.' 
Senators, I'm going to tell you something. You think this is farfetched? Believe me, believe me, it is not. It happens all the time. 
You ask yourself this question: How would you like to be in the grand jury room without a lawyer--nobody--and you ask the U.S. attorney: 
`Look, I would like to go outside the room. My lawyer is sitting just outside the door. I would like to talk to him and ask him whether I should answer this question or not.' 
`You have a right to do that, ma'am. Go right ahead.' 
She goes out. After awhile, he asks her another one of those 
silly questions. And she says, `You know, I don't know how to answer that. I need to talk to my lawyer again.' 
The third time she does that, these grand jurors start nudging each other. `This woman is hiding something. She knows a lot more than she is willing to talk about. Why is she going outside to talk to that lawyer so much if she doesn't have something to hide?' 
That is the psychological part of trying lawsuits. I am telling you, I was a trial attorney for 18 years before I became Governor. I have seen prosecuting attorneys, I have seen local district attorneys, I have seen U.S. attorneys, eaten up with political ambition. And when they are eaten up with political ambition, do you know what they want? All the notches in their belt they can get. They want to be able to boast, `I never failed to get an indictment I asked for.' 
The chief judge of the State of New York once said, `You can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich if you ask them to.' I had a U.S. attorney tell me one time, `I have never failed to get an indictment from a grand jury.' I can tell you, if he had ever failed to get one, that would be one of the most abysmal failures I have ever heard of, because I know all kinds of U.S. attorneys and DA's all over this country who have been able to get an indictment every time they ask for one. Do you know why? Because there are 23 grand jurors sitting there who know nothing except what the U.S. attorney proposes to tell them, only what the witnesses he decides to call will tell them. 
Mr. President, I am not talking as any bleeding-heart liberal. I have defended a few criminals in my life. A couple of them I felt pretty sure were guilty, but the first thing I learned in law school is that this is a nation of laws; everybody is entitled to a lawyer, and to a fair trial. 
The grand jury system has gotten so bad that 27 States in this Nation have abolished grand juries. You think about that. The States are always ahead of us in Congress. Mr. President, 27 States have abolished the grand jury system, and 18 States have laws that allow the attorney for a witness to sit in the grand jury room with the witness. Now, what do these states know that we don't know? 
My amendment is just about as simple as you can make it. It says one thing, that a witness who has an attorney and wishes that attorney to sit in the grand jury room with them may do so. What is wrong with that? You tell me. Anybody, tell me. 
If a U.S. attorney is afraid to ask questions because he doesn't want her attorney to hear, what is objectionable about it? And why should he? Why should a U.S. attorney fear asking any question that he is going to ask later, perhaps, in the courtroom anyway? This is supposed to be a fair fight. Is he afraid of the truth? 
Do you know why we have a grand jury system? Because the Federal Government was not to be trusted and the Founding Fathers put the requirement in the Fifth Amendment: We will have a grand jury system. And the reason we cannot abolish it is because it is in the Constitution, and I would not change that. The States are not so fettered, and they are abolishing it right and left because they know that grand jury system is often not fair. It is just short of a Star Chamber proceeding because only one side of the case is heard. 
In medieval England people were tried by ordeal--they were thrown into the lake or had their hand dunked in boiling water. If they survived the ordeal, they were innocent. If they didn't, it didn't make any difference. That is what was called a Star Chamber proceeding. That is what people used to go through when they missed church. They were put in the stocks or they were subjected to boiling water or a whole host of other things. 
So that is the reason that many of the Founding Fathers came here after being abused and abused and abused in England. Because they were mostly a poor class, and they didn't trust Government. Because they had not trusted the King, they knew the King had all the cards, and they wanted to level the playing field and they wanted it to be a fair fight. I can tell you, we do not have a fair fight now in the grand jury. 
So, isn't this just simple justice, to allow a witness to have a lawyer? 
Is this complicated for anybody listening, that a witness who is not charged with anything should have a right to a lawyer in the courtroom, not sitting outside? Do you think a U.S. attorney would start off asking a Senator's wife if she had been faithful to him all of her life if her attorney was sitting there? I promise you he wouldn't. Do you think he would ask if her children were gay or had ever smoked pot if her lawyer was sitting in the room? Of course, he wouldn't. This is about simple deterrence of misconduct. 
I ask those who will oppose this amendment, What is the prohibition now under existing law to keep a U.S. attorney from asking those kinds of abusive questions, and worse? There is none. 
I remember one time talking with Senator McGovern when he was a Senator. One of these questions came up about charging everybody with everything and vetting everybody who came through. If you get nominated to an executive position, you have to go through a kind of inquisition. George McGovern said, `I want it on the record right now: I stole a watermelon when I was 12 years old.' 
I can tell you, what we have right now in the grand jury system is not fair, and every Member of this body knows it. I am not defending criminals. I am not saying give criminals an upper hand. What I am saying is give witnesses the same choices you give a defendant, the criminal, which is the right to the assistance of counsel, as guaranteed in the Sixth Amendment. 
Mr. President, I hope everybody understands this issue. I don't want to belabor it. It is the kind of amendment that doesn't need a lot of discussion. But you think about this, I say to Senators, your wife or family member who is as innocent as a newly ordained nun, who never did anything wrong in her life, is going before the grand jury system hardly knowing why she has been called and then subjected to day after day after day of testimony, or even 2 hours of testimony--whatever it is. At least put her on a par with the criminal defendants who are arrested and have to be placed on trial, who have a right to an attorney.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, that is a perfectly fair, legitimate undertaking, and I will not be much longer. Senator Levin is here and wishes to speak on the amendment, and any other cosponsors of the amendment who are listening should feel free to come over and speak, if they choose. 
The point I was about to make, and I will close on this--is this: The American people are fairly happy right now because the economy is going well. But I can tell you, there is one underlying sentiment in this country that is undeniable, and it is that the vast majority of the people in this country don't think we, who live in this rarefied atmosphere, know what their everyday lives are like, and they are right. They are right. 
Here is an opportunity to restore people's confidence in the system. It doesn't happen often. One of the reasons this amendment may not prevail is because in the scheme of things, with 268 million people in this country and probably no more than, what should I say, 10,000, 20,000 at most will appear before grand juries in any given year and answer questions, who cares about 10,000 people out of 268 million? I care. If I didn't, I wouldn't be staying here tonight to offer this amendment. 
I first started to object to voting on this in the morning, but the more I thought about it, the more I thought that it might be good. It might be good for Senators to reflect on this overnight and to think about the fact that justice denied to one single soul is an aberration to a free nation. 
I sincerely hope people will think about this and think about it in terms of their own personal lives--not some obscure thing you read in the Washington Post every morning or the New York Times--but you think about some of these things happening to people, and ask yourself: How would I feel about that? And, if a member of your family were involved, wouldn't you wish that this amendment was in place as a matter of law? 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.

Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, the administration had previously, and may still have, serious objections to the Murkowski amendment. But he and I had a conversation this morning. He has modified his amendment. The modification is at the desk. 
For the edification of our membership, simply because this may come up again in conference or even later on the floor, in 1906 the Congress passed a law giving every Native Alaskan the right to claim 160 acres of land in Alaska. In 1971, under the Alaskan Native Settlement Claims Act, we repealed the old 1906 Act. What Senator Murkowski seeks to do is very laudable, in my opinion. He is simply saying those Native Alaskans who would have otherwise had a right to claim 160 acres under the old 1906 law, but were in Vietnam and not physically present in Alaska so they could file such a claim--he is simply saying under this bill that they will be grandfathered in. If they were in Vietnam between 1969 and 1971, they are entitled to a claim. 
Some of these claims would be in conservation areas. That was the first, primary objection by the administration. We have changed that so the administration can select nonconservation lands if a claim within a park or wilderness or wildlife refuge is inconsistent with the purposes of that conservation area. So that takes care of most of it. 
They were vitally concerned about the cost which, as I say, should be mitigated greatly by this compromise we have entered into. 
I simply want to say there is one other objection the administration has. They are concerned about allowing people to claim 160 acres if they were not in Vietnam. The amendment does not really say you had to have been in Vietnam, but they had to have been in the military. They think that is a little broad. But in conference, whatever their objection is I feel sure can be worked out. 
I thank the Senator from Alaska. We had a hearing on this, but we had not marked the bill up. 
So, with those considerations, I think it is well to go ahead and approve it. If they still object to something, I think it will be something we can work out in conference. 
Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.

Mr. BUMPERS. I just want to echo the words of my chairman, Senator Cochran, and state, first of all, this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. So the world is not going to come to an end, no matter how strenuously somebody might object to a particular provision of the bill. I would have been willing--when I came on the floor, I discussed it with Senator Cochran--I would be willing to accept it and go to conference with it. It doesn't seem all that ominous to me. But there are some really strenuous objections on this side. So I suppose, as the chairman said, we are going to have to have a vote on it. I not only find nothing objectionable, I find a lot in it to commend. 
I think it is an excellent, very thoughtfully crafted proposal, and I agree with every one of the items he has listed here. I understand, as I say, that there are strong feelings on the other side. 
In conclusion, this is one of those things--I see my colleague from Arkansas seeking the floor, and I think I know which provision he dislikes intensely in it, and Senator Byrd, I think, has voiced objection to the fast-track provision. I wish we could adopt it on a voice vote. If we can't do that, why, then do something else. Maybe we can get Senator Grassley on the floor and at least get a time agreement on this amendment. It is the kind of amendment that can just go on all day long and it is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. We never will get the bill passed if we spend this much time on sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. We have a lot of work to do here. If we finish this bill today, we will be lucky, in my opinion. 
In any event, Mr. President, I hope that people who want to speak on this bill will hurry to the floor and get said whatever they want to say, and we can get Senator Grassley on the floor and maybe work out a time agreement so we have some definition of what the day in front of us is going to look like. I yield the floor. 
Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise to express my profound gratitude to my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, for always injecting a meaningful, penetrating history lesson such as we have just been subjected to. It had not occurred to me that it has been 211 years since those magnificent days in Philadelphia brought us this sacred document we call the Constitution which has made us the longest living democracy on Earth, under a Constitution that is the longest living organic law under which any nation has ever lived. 
I have made speeches on the floor time and again about what I call the trivialization of the Constitution. When one considers since Congress first convened there have been over 11,500 efforts to amend this document, over 11,500 resolutions introduced in the House and the Senate to amend the work of Madison, Franklin, Hamilton and Adams, and all those great minds which, as the distinguished Senator knows, the great scholar Arthur Schlesinger called the greatest assemblage of political genius ever under one roof--I don't quarrel with that for an instant. 
As you have so eloquently pointed out, those men were schooled in the art and the nobility of government. They were historians and they were lawyers, but they were brilliant men. They knew there would be charlatans coming down the pike, trying to trivialize the Constitution. I remember some since I came to the Senate. 
I am very pleased to say that I will, at the end of this year, have been a Member of this body for 24 years. I voted for one constitutional amendment the first year I was in the Senate, and it was a mistake. I am often asked by some member of the press, `Do you regret some of your votes?' 
Of course I do; I am not infallible. If I were doing it over again, I don't know which ones offhand, but if I went through my record, there would be votes I would change. And one amendment to the Constitution which I supported--which, in my opinion today, was dead wrong--I will tell you, was the Equal Rights Amendment. We didn't need a constitutional amendment to provide women with equal rights. We did that in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and it has been working just fine. We did not have to tinker with the Constitution to do it. 
I believe my staff has told me I have voted 38 times against constitutional amendments. I think I want that on my epitaph. And, while noble men may disagree on this, I do not intend before I leave the Senate to cast a vote to change the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights--I defer to my colleague--I think they were ratified in 1791. But when the framers left Philadelphia, it was understood that James Madison was going to compose these 10 amendments to the Constitution. These are today called our Bill of Rights. That is the first ten amendments to the Constitution, which provide us freedom of the press, freedom of religion--we have more freedom of religion than most of us are taking advantage of now--and freedom of speech. 
Sometimes when I read stories in the press, I think, surely there is some way we can change the freedom of the press clause in the Constitution to stop this sort of irresponsible reporting. But I am not going to do that, because I don't think you can do it without creating a lot more problems than you will solve. 
Senator Byrd, if I had my way, no youngster would graduate from college without a fundamental, profound understanding of the Constitution. And precious few of them are graduating with that knowledge today. 
Congress deserves a lot of credit. Oh, we take a lot of slings and arrows in this body about knuckling under the special interests, the voters, and the money, and all that sort of thing, but does it not speak well for the Congress that, out of 11,500-plus efforts to change the Constitution, we have only seen fit to do it 27 times? And that includes the first block of 10, called the Bill of Rights, in 1791. You take the 10 in the Bill of Rights out; that leaves 17 times we have actually amended the Constitution. And you remember, we decided we wouldn't drink, and later we decided we would drink; you take those 2 out and there are only 15 times. That is pretty amazing, is it not? 
We are importing workers. You heard the debate here just recently about how we are going to allow 75,000 to 95,000 high-tech personnel from abroad, special visa status to come to this country to work. I didn't vote for that bill, incidentally. I still think it was a mistake. But one of the things that troubles me about that is why we are going all out in this country to train people to be computer experts or high-tech gurus. Yet this poor document, the Constitution--which is next to the Holy Bible in sacredness to me--youngsters are graduating from college, and they don't know who James Madison is --the father of the Constitution. 
Now, I don't want to denigrate any of my colleagues, but I have to look very carefully at somebody today who thinks he can improve on the words of James Madison. I can assure my colleagues and my constituents back home that I will leave here this fall still only having voted for only one constitutional amendment in my 24 years here. 
So, Mr. President, I might just quit on this one note. If I were going to confess to this body the one thing about the Constitution that disturbs me more than anything else--it was a good idea in its time, but I am troubled about it now--that is the fifth amendment requirement of grand juries. The States have long since pretty much eliminated grand juries. But the grand jury system was guaranteed for serious offenses in the Fifth Amendment because they wanted a jury of your peers to make the decision to indict, not the King. 
As a matter of fact, the authors of the Constitution intended to make sure that we had no more kings, and they succeeded very admirably. We have had 42 Presidents, I guess, and no kings, since 1787. But I will say this. Their idea was that you could trust the people with your deciding fate and your innocence or guilt a lot more than you could the Crown or anybody representing the Crown. 
And, so, the grand jury system had the noblest of intentions. But I would be remiss if I didn't relieve myself of this thought for the benefit of whoever wants to listen. I can tell you, what is going on with the grand jury system in this country right now is dangerous--dangerous in the extreme. I am not suggesting we change the Constitution to do away with grand juries, but I am saying that the grand jury system needs some control and it needs reforming. I have introduced legislation which will do that. 
Well, Mr. President, this conversation has been the highlight of my day. I hadn't thought lately about that hot July in 1787 in Philadelphia. It 
was so hot and George Washington was so intent on everything being secret, they closed the windows and they almost suffocated just to make sure that nothing of the deliberations was heard on the street. But what a lucky people we are to have the honor and the privilege of living in this great country of ours because of those men. Some of them fought in the Revolution, sacrificed their families to fight in the Revolution. And they went there and provided us with this magnificent document. 
I thank the Senator again for raising our awareness level on that point. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, there is just one final little anecdote that I would like to share with the Senate. 
When my former colleague, Senator Pryor, left the Senate last year, he went home to the University of Arkansas to teach. He is sort of a roving professor. He taught one day at the school of business, and the next day the school of agriculture, and so on. He was at the law school one day. He said that some smart law student got up and said, `Why don't you deliver a lecture someday on the comparison of our democracy and the Athenian democracy?' Senator Pryor said he didn't know what to do. So he went back to his office and he called the Senate historian and he told him what he was up against. The historian said, `You are lucky. Senator Byrd has just delivered about 15 speeches on Athenian democracy.' He sent those to him, and he said everybody in the university thinks he is an Athenian scholar.

Mr. BUMPERS. Let me again echo the very eloquent words of the chairman, and for the purposes of the Record state this has been sort of a festering sore down at the Department of Agriculture for some time. I know the President is personally--very personally--interested in the extension of the statute of limitations so nobody who has a meritorious claim will be denied that claim simply because he did not understand the intricacies affecting his claim. 
By the same token, I think it is well, for the Record, to say--and I think this is precisely what has been said by the chairman; I will simply repeat it--we are not making a judgment on the merits of a single claim. We are simply saying that if you have a claim that has merit, we are going to give you a chance to present it; and hopefully it will be decided in a very judicial way and a justifiable way. 
So with that little caveat, I congratulate Senator Robb. He has worked diligently to try to find offsets in order to offer this. He has done a magnificent job. I thank the Department of Agriculture and the White House for their cooperation. 
With that, on this side of the aisle we are prepared to accept the amendment, Mr. President.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am in the majority leader's corner on this. This is unforgivable. Maybe there is some forgiveness in the order because most Members on our side are in a meeting with the President right now. I am hoping that somebody will have the nerve to walk out of that meeting to come over here and offer an amendment and get this show on the road. 
The other thing that is mildly encouraging is that we have been going over the list of Democratic amendments, and an awful lot of them are folding, and some are going to be accepted. I only know about three or four fairly controversial amendments that are probably going to require a rollcall vote--in the vicinity of three or four. The rest, I think, are either not going to be offered, or we are going to be able to accept them. Hopefully, we can get through here by sometime in the middle to late afternoon. 
I certainly appreciate the majority leader's frustration, with all of these amendments lying around and nobody here to offer them. In all fairness, the reason nobody is over here is because they are all in a meeting with the President. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

We have spent about 2 1/2 hours on this one. A lot of the people on this side are going to the White House at 4:30, and I hoped we could get a vote on it before they had to depart. I am always reluctant to suggest to anybody they cut their remarks short, and I guess we have already missed the 4:30 deadline. I see two Senators who are just chomping to speak, so there is no point in asking for a time agreement at this point. But I just want to make the Members aware, and I know I am joined by my distinguished chairman in saying, we are going to have to do something to speed this process up or we are not going to get out before December 1.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Bryan, in my opinion, is a meritorious amendment. He and I fought this battle. I fought it for maybe 3 or 4 years alone, and then Senator Bryan came to the Senate, and we have labored in the venue of trying to do away with what was then the Market Promotion Program and now called the Market Access Program. 
I have absolutely no quarrel with trying to assist people who really need help. The Export Enhancement Program isn't being used. It is a big program, but it isn't being used. When I started on this, the Market Promotion Program included the biggest companies in America, and that is the source of my objection. 
I am talking about some of the biggest corporations in America. And I see my good friend, Tyson Foods, is on the list still. I am sure they welcome getting $440,000 a year. Tyson Foods does over $5 billion a year, and I certainly do not want to pick on a company in my home State, particularly one that has so many of my close friends in it. But that is precisely the reason I have always objected to this program. I know that it does some good. 
I heard the chairman, Senator Cochran, talking a while ago about some of the benefits of it, and who has benefited, and how much, and so on. 
I just think it is welfare for the rich. That is the reason I have always opposed it. 
Senator Cochran and I disagree. I guess this is about the only thing--maybe one or two things--we will disagree on in this entire bill. We get along famously in the committee, but this is one that I simply could not let my dear friend, Senator Bryan, take on alone. I just wanted to get my 2 cents' worth in and to state that I will vote with Senator Bryan on this. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, in just a moment, staff will have a bill that I introduced several months ago. I would like to just discuss it briefly so we can get that behind us before I offer it. 
But this is an amendment that would award the Congressional Gold Medal to the nine African American children who integrated Little Rock Central High during probably the greatest threat to the Constitution since the Civil War. I lived through it. I was in a small town in western Arkansas called Charleston. That is my hometown, where I was born and reared. 
My hometown had integrated in 1954, very quietly and very peacefully, a town of 1,200 people at the time. Our schools had successfully integrated from the fall of 1954 until Governor Faubus called out the Guard to block integration at Little Rock Central High School in Little Rock. 
Let me also say that Charleston, this little hometown of mine which I am seeking to get designated a national commemorative site by the Park Service this year, was the first school to integrate following the Brown v. Board of Education decision in May of 1954. I was on the school board during that time, and we integrated the school that fall. There is still some controversy because good records were not kept about how many African American children were integrated into the school system. 
It went along smoothly. There were some schools that wouldn't play us in football, and there were some schools that wouldn't allow our band to participate, because we had African Americans on the football team and in the band. We lived with that as best we could. There was a lot of seething undercurrent. Even though it had gone peacefully for 3 years, there was still an unrest among some. 
After the turmoil in Little Rock, that seething unrest surfaced. I will never forget, Mr. President, I was trying a lawsuit on the third floor of Logan County Courthouse in Paris, AR, and I heard these rumbling trucks going down Highway 22 from Fort Chaffee which came through my hometown to Little Rock to provide the logistical support for the 101st Airborne which President Eisenhower had sent in to Little Rock to enforce the integration of that school. 
It was a very ominous, frankly, rather terrifying time. I was not as concerned about what was going on in Little Rock--though that was terrifying and certainly to the people in Little Rock it was terrifying--as I was with the certain knowledge in my own mind that we were in for big trouble in my hometown, too, because I knew, as I say, that seething unrest was going to be fortified and encouraged to try to do the same thing, and sure enough it happened. 
We had a big knock-down-drag-out election in March of 1958, and the whole issue was: Shall we stay integrated or shall we re-segregate? 
I convinced a friend of mine to run to fill one of the vacancies that had been created because things got so hot a couple of board members resigned. I think there were about 600 votes cast in that election, probably five times more than ever had been cast in a school election in Charleston, AR, in its history. In any event, the so-called `moderates' won overwhelmingly, and that put the issue to rest in my hometown. 
Back to the Little Rock Nine. Ernie Green testified in the Energy Committee the other day in support of a bill to make Central High School in Little Rock a unit of the Park Service. He was one of the Little Rock Nine, later was Assistant Secretary of Labor when Jimmy Carter was President. 
Anybody who didn't live through that time can never understand what a traumatic period that was for my State. We didn't attract a single industry in the State of Arkansas for almost 10 years after the Little Rock High School integration crisis. But those nine young black children who were escorted into that school in the fall of 1957 by paratroopers from the 101st Airborne showed more bravery than anybody I have ever seen in my life. It was absolutely unbelievable. 
They have been recognized in a lot of ways, but S. 1283 would provide them with the Congressional Gold Medal. It is an honor that they are due and that is long overdue. This bill was recently reported out of the Banking Committee and is now on the Calendar. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 465, S. 1283.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is an amendment that deals with what is a perennial knotty problem for the members of this subcommittee. It simply says that no funds may be used to prepare the budget for this subcommittee that includes user fees unless those fees have been previously authorized or under the budget identifies spending cuts or revenue increases that should occur in case the fees are not adopted, which they never are. 
We invariably get these budgets. The President invariably sends a budget over, and our subcommittee looks it over, and there is always a bunch of user fees in there. This is about the eighth or ninth straight year that user fees have been included, and the subcommittee never agrees to them. The reason we don't is that the full committee and the Senate would never agree to them either. 
This amendment is designed to say in the future, don't send those user fees over here unless you are prepared to tell us, in case we don't adopt the user fees, where you are going to find the spending cuts for it or where you are going to find revenue increases. This is a 1-year proposition. This provision will only apply to the budget year 1999. I think this has been cleared on both sides.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is an amendment that I think has a lot of merit. It is a pilot program under which farmers who are enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program can take a reduction in the payments that they would otherwise receive under that program in exchange for the right to bale hay and graze according to an agreement, of course, that they would have to work out. But they would have a right to forego certain payments in the Conservation Reserve Program in exchange for the right to hay and graze on some of their CRP lands.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this amendment codifies the Secretary of Agriculture's prohibition on the repackaging of eggs packed under USDA's voluntary grading program. This prohibition went into effect on April 27. It directs the Secretaries of Agriculture and Health and Human Services to submit a joint report to the relevant congressional committees on egg safety and repackaging. 
The amendment has been cleared by USDA, by the Food and Drug Administration, and the egg industry, and it is supported by consumer groups. 
The USDA recently reported, each year over 660,000 Americans get sick from eating eggs contaminated with salmonella enterovirus. Illness from this can be fatal to the elderly, children, and those with weakened immune systems. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control, this bacteria caused more reported deaths between 1988 and 1992 than any other foodborne pathogen. The estimated annual cost of illness from this particular salmonella ranges from $118 million to $767 million each year, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest. 
It sounds like a very good amendment to me.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station is the oldest experiment station in America. It has never been a part of the land grant college, and under the research bill that we just passed not too long ago, there was a provision that you had to be a land grant college in order to be qualified for these. 
As I say, the experiment station in Connecticut has always received these funds. But because of that, nobody was thinking about that experiment station at the time. This bill corrects what really was an omission.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this bill continues the current hiring system being used within the Forest Service and the Agricultural Research Service to examine for, and make, first permanent competitive Federal appointments. The hiring system will terminate on June 30, 1998, unless it is extended. 
Applicants and management officials have had an overwhelmingly positive response to the hiring system. Specifically, management believes the program has increased its control over hiring, resulting in a greater likelihood that the candidate pool is appropriate and available, reducing the number of staff hours expended in testing, examining and rating applicants. 
The Office of Management and Budget has no objection to this amendment. I think this has been cleared on the other side.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, recently I introduced S. 2030, the Grand Jury Due Process Act, to provide witnesses who are subpoenaed by federal grand juries with a right to the presence of counsel in the grand jury room. I am today introducing more comprehensive grand jury reform legislation which will remedy several major flaws in the grand jury system which today undermine the fairness of America's judicial system. 
Criminal justice must provide for more than swift and sure punishment. It must ensure fairness and due process to the accused as well as to witnesses and victims of crime. In the majority of cases, our courts provide a greater measure of justice than any other system known to man. Yet our system remains far from perfect. 
Of all aspects of America's criminal justice system, the grand jury has become the weakest link in ensuring due process of law. It is telling that most States have discarded grand juries entirely. Yet, the Federal Government is constrained by the fifth amendment constitutional requirement for grand juries, so we have to find ways to make the grand jury system work better. 
The legislation I am introducing makes five critical grand jury reforms: 
First, it directs the district courts to give basic legal instructions to the grand jurors at the time they begin their work. These instructions will include basic legal principles--the power to call witnesses, the power to investigate, and the power to indict on whatever charges the grand jury deems appropriate. No one would disagree with these basic instructions, but they are not required in the present grand jury system. Instead, grand jurors are told only as much about the law as the prosecutor chooses to tell them. My bill will change that. 
Second, this bill gives grand jury witnesses the right to be accompanied by counsel in the grand jury room. This section is virtually identical to S. 2030 which I have already introduced. It also requires that a witness subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury be advised of his right to be accompanied by counsel, of the privilege against self-incrimination and other basic rights when the subpoena is issued. 
Third, this bill strengthens enforcement of the existing rule on grand jury secrecy, which is a matter of first importance to the integrity of the justice system. News reports indicate that grand jury secrecy is now being violated on a regular basis. 
Fourth, this bill mandates that prosecutors disclose to the grand jury any substantial evidence they possess which indicates that the accused is not, or may not be, guilty. While this may seem elementary to most Americans, it is contrary to a Supreme Court decision, United States v. Williams--a very recent decision--which held that the prosecutor has no such constitutional obligation. 
Fifth and finally, this bill entitles a defendant to a transcript of the grand jury testimony of all witnesses who are called against him at trial. This is a matter of basic fairness. Anyone charged with a crime should have a right to know what a witness against him has told the grand jury. Knowing the witness's prior testimony is the essence of the right of cross-examination enshrined in the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment.  
BACKGROUND 
Grand juries have enormous power and they offer few protections to those who are called as witnesses or who are subject to investigation. Under the fifth amendment to the Constitution, Federal felony prosecutions must include indictment by a grand jury. This provision was intended to protect citizens against prosecutions which are without merit or which are politically motivated. The Founding Fathers had plenty of experience with prosecutorial misconduct by the English crown. That is the reason they inserted the grand jury into the Constitution. The Grand Jury was to be a bulwark against a tyrannical government. 
My own observations of grand juries go back to my years as a small town defense lawyer, but they are reinforced by present day cases and news reports. Too often, I have seen criminal prosecutions which should never have been brought, or witnesses who have been abused by prosecutors. Recently, newspapers are filled with stories of secret grand jury testimony--often attributed to prosecution sources--and of witnesses who have been called back to testify a fourth or fifth or sixth time before the same grand jury. Many of these witnesses are obviously not criminals, at least in a reasonable person's understanding of the word. 
To understand today's grand jury system, you must understand history. The grand jury, Mr. President, is one of the common law's most ancient institutions. Its roots go back even further than Magna Carta. In 1166, King Henry II proclaimed the Assize of Clarendon which required that 12 `lawful men' out of every hundred be sworn to tell whether they knew of any crimes committed in their towns. In these early days, grand juries operated mostly on the personal 
knowledge of the grand jurors. 
The grand jury then, like today, only had power to accuse. In those days, trial was by ordeal. The accused either had his hand placed in boiling water or was bound and thrown into a lake. If he survived without injury, this was an acquittal. It was not until the 13th Century that our English forbearers secured the right to a trial by jury. 
Trial by ordeal was supposedly abolished long ago, but I wonder whether many of today's grand jury witnesses might dispute this. 
In English and American history up until the time of the Constitution, grand juries were a bulwark of freedom which stood between oppressive government and the individual. Grand juries often disagreed with English and colonial judges who were in service to the Crown. These feuds helped define both the power of the grand jury and the liberties of free people. For example, grand jurors in colonial Massachusetts adamantly refused demands by the Crown to indict the colonists who had participated in the Stamp Act riots. 
Unhappily, the grand jury's role as defender of liberty, has changed dramatically for the worse over the years. Too often, the grand jury has become an arm of the executive branch and a rubber stamp for the prosecutor. In modern times, the Supreme Court has held that a grand jury may call witnesses to satisfy the mere suspicion that a crime may have been committed. 
Grand juries have been judged so superfluous by the states that about half of them decided long ago to eliminate grand juries and allow criminal charges to be brought directly by prosecutors. 
The chief judge of the State of New York remarked several years ago that most grand juries would indict `a ham sandwich' if the prosecutor so requested. A recent Supreme Court decision, United States v. Williams, the Court has held that the District Courts have no supervisory power over grand juries, and that grand juries are not even part of the judiciary. I disagree strenuously with Justice Scalia's conclusions in the Williams case. If grand juries are not accountable to the courts, then who are they accountable to?

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this morning's prayer was offered by the Reverend James Lupton. Reverend Lupton retired in May 1997 after eight years at St. Alban's Episcopal Church in Stuttgart, AR. 
During this ministry in Stuttgart, Reverend Lupton also served the people of St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Tollville, AR. Prior to that, he served for four years in a Texas ministry. 
Reverend Lupton received his call to the ministry later in life after a twenty-five year career as an architect. James comes from a long line of Arkansans. His mother's family was one of the first pioneer families to settle in Arkansas, coming to the state with Arkansas' first Governor, James Sevier Conway. 
I am pleased that this individual with deep roots in my state was given the opportunity to offer today's prayer. We thank him for his inspiration.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this will be the eighth year that I have stood here and debated whether or not America should go forward with a space station. I didn't like the idea of the Space Station Freedom, but it was probably a bargain compared to what the International Space Station is turning out to be. 
First, I would like to pose a question to my colleagues: Why is it that we continue to fund a program called the International Space Station, when every cellular biologist, every medical researcher, and every physicist in America who isn't involved in the program itself is vehemently opposed to it? These are some of the most brilliant people in America. Before we start off spending $100 billion, we ought to ask ourselves, Why are they opposed? Well, for very good reasons, and I will come back to those in just a minute. 
It is a mystery that here in Congress we talk seriously about a program which in the last 3 years has become almost laughable. If it weren't so serious and the amount of money so enormous, it would be almost a comedy--a comedy of errors. 
The cost began to spiral in 1996--maybe before that, but that was the first time we really knew it. The Russians have had space stations up for almost 30 years. The Mir is the seventh space station that the Russians have had up since 1971. And what do they have to show for it? Absolutely nothing. 
In a little while, I will come back and quote some of the top Nobel Prize winners, some of the top physicists in America, cellular biologists--you name it. I will come back and quote several of them and what they have had to say about the space station as a research vehicle. 
Now, you should bear in mind throughout this debate that when you talk about research on the space station, there is only one reason--one reason--you have to believe that the kind of research we are going to do, which NASA says will cure ingrown toenails, warts, cancer, sties--it will cure everything--you have to believe that research of whatever kind--mostly medical, and some of it molecular biology--but you have to believe that something happens in a microgravity situation that you can't emulate on earth, and not only is something going to happen in a microgravity situation, but it is going to be good. Again, I will come back to what the top scientists in this country have to say about it. But right now I will quote Professor Bloembergen, who is a top physicist at Harvard University. When he was President of the American Physical Society, which consists of 40,000 physicists, and, he summed it up when he said, `microgravity is of micro importance.' 
John Glenn came to the Senate with me. We developed a warm friendship the first day we met and we have remained friends. I consider him one of my dearest friends, except when I bring this amendment up. But Senator Glenn is not going to deny that about all you get out of this is whatever you can get from microgravity research that can be emulated on earth; but there is no need to emulate it on earth. You are going to hear all this business about gallium arsenide crystals, which is `bunk.' Even if you could build crystals on the space station, nobody on earth could afford to use them. 
Well, Mr. President, why are all these people opposed? Why are the top people on whom we rely for all of our medical research, cellular research--the top scientists in America--why are they outraged by spending $100 billion on one orbiting space station with a crew of, at first three people, and subsequently six or seven people? Why are they outraged? Well, one reason might be that they come up here pleading for money for honest-to-God research every year, and we give them a few shekels and off they go to do the best they can with it. 
Think about the National Institutes of Health getting about $13 billion a year, and they do research on everything--honest research. They send out money to every university in the country that has a medical school to do research. Well, if we ever get this thing in space, just the annual operating cost will be enough to fund 6,000 researchers at NIH and universities across America for a year. We are going to have six people on the space station doing what the National Research Council estimates to be 24 hours of research each day, at a cost at which we could hire 6,000 researchers on earth. 
Do you want to hear another one? Once we get it deployed, we are going to leave it in space for 10 years. You multiply the man-hours by 10 years that we are going to get in research, and if you don't just divide the annual operating costs, which, as I said a moment ago, would produce 6,000 researchers on earth, but divide it into the entire $100 billion cost, which is a legitimate thing to do because, after all, we are spending $100 billion to put the space station up and do research--whether you are going to build crystals or cure ingrown toenails, it is all research. But when you do that, the cost of each man-hour of research on the space station is $11.5 million per hour. 
Now, if that doesn't stagger people, what would? Here we starve the National Institutes of Health, we starve the Food and Drug Administration, we starve the Centers for Disease Control, and we are embarking on a program that will cost $100 billion, which translates into $11.5 million for every hour of research that will be done on that thing over a 10-year period. So can you see why I raise my voice? I can't believe it. It is so patently absurd and outrageous. And the ordinary layman in America thinks the space station is a pretty good idea. The Russians did it, why shouldn't we? 
But let's go to the original promises. Mr. President, not only are all of the scientists in America opposed to it, I will give you another reason that Congress ought to be opposed to it. It is because we have just had one broken promise after another from NASA. My good friend from Ohio has heard me say this many times. Let me get this off my conscience right now. I believe in NASA and I believe in the space program. I thought the Mars Pathfinder Program was wonderful. We sent an unmanned rover to Mars, and it took magnificent pictures and sent them back to earth. It gave us a much, much better comprehension, for whatever it may be worth, of what is on Mars. So I want everybody to understand that this is not an anti-NASA speech or amendment; this is an antispace station amendment. 
In September 1993, there was a solemn promise that was made to Congress and, therefore, to the American people. This is what a briefing paper on NASA's Web site says:  
In September 1993, a program implementation program called PIP had been developed in the baseline for the new International Space Station. The plan was coordinated with and agreed to by all existing partners. Based on this PIP, NASA reached agreement with the Clinton administration and with Congress that the International Space Station would be implemented with a flat budget of $2.1 billion a year. 
Let me indelibly ingrain that on your brain. NASA said we will do this for $2.1 billion a year. 
And we will build it. Bear in mind, there are three stages: Building it, deploying it, and operating it. The NASA briefing paper goes on to say: 
NASA promised that the program would remain on schedule and within the annual $2.1 billion and the runout $17.4 billion budget and that no additional funds will be sought. In exchange the program will be required to redesign and rescope the station. 
A solemn promise of $2.1 billion. But, as they say, something happened on the way to the forum. We are now up to $98 billion-plus and heading north. 
They also promised us that this thing would be finished by June of 2002. Again, something happened on the way to the forum. I will come back to that in just a moment. 
But we should have noticed back in 1996. If we had been paying attention in 1996, we would have known that something was happening. Precisely what was happening was, NASA transferred $235 billion from other programs within NASA to the space station. They did that with the approval of the appropriate committees of Congress here. I assume it was the Commerce and Appropriations Committees. But what else did they do? They then changed their accounting system so they could transfer another $100 million over to the space station. That $300 million didn't count against the $17.4 billion that the cost of this thing was supposed to be. It didn't count against the $2.1 billion they promised they would use every year and not ask for more. 
In 1997, guess what. The same song, second verse. In 1997, they transferred $200 million from the shuttle program to the space station because they had decided that Russia was not going to be able to come through with its part of the bargain their very first component--building the service module. They decided they might have to build it. So they transferred $200 million from the shuttle program to build what they call an interim control module. Then they again transferred $100 million from other accounts--mostly scientific accounts. 
So we are not going to get as much science as we planned, because they have already taken $100 million of that out, and this $300 million did not count against the annual $2.1 billion appropriations. 
Then in a hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee last year--I think it was in May--Boeing, the prime contractor, and NASA both appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee. Boeing said, in a rare admission, that it their part of the program was going to cost $600 million more than we anticipated. That didn't include the $600 million that had already been transferred by NASA from other accounts. NASA said that is true. But in that same hearing, they said the figure was not going to be $600 million in cost overrun, it would be $817 million. They also said in 1998 that they are going to need still another $430 million extra. 
I mean we are getting bombarded by transfers from other accounts, transfers with and without the permission of Congress, admitted cost overruns of $817 million on top of that. And we are going to need another $430 million in 1998. 
So, Mr. President, the thing is beginning to sort of roll out of control. And Dan Goldin, Administrator of NASA, takes the extra precaution, with, I think, a little prodding by Congress, to appoint a task force to look into this whole thing. He made Jay Chabrow, one of the premier space technology analysts in America, chairman of what is called the Chabrow Commission. They were formulated, I think, and appointed in September and went to work in November. And on April 15, 1998, they came back to the Congress and to NASA and said that the $21.3 billion that NASA admitted the station would cost in its FY 1999 budget was not enough. I should have mentioned that before. In their budget for 1999 NASA admitted that the space station was not going to cost $17.4 but, rather, $21.3 billion. They wish. 
Jay Chabrow, in whom Dan Goldin obviously put a great deal of confidence, comes back and says, `Would you believe $24.7 billion?' That is a $7.3 billion overrun--43 percent--just to build it on the ground before we have put the first piece of hardware in space. Chabrow went ahead to say you are not going to finish it in the year 2002. It is going to take 10 to 38 months longer to deploy the space station than you have been admitted, more likely 2 years. So, instead of the year 2003, it is going to be finished in late 2005, or early 2006 at best. 
Do you know what those kinds of delays mean in a program like this? Billions. If this had been anybody other than somebody like Jay Chabrow, with the credibility and reputation he has, everybody could have swatted it like a fly. But you cannot ignore this prestigious commission. 
Do you know what else? The Chabrow Commission went ahead to say this $7.3 billion overrun assumes that the Russians, our big partner in the space station, will perform on time. 
Mr. President, let's go to the next stage, deploying the space station. It is going to take, according to the latest figures from NASA, about 83 launches to deploy it. That means taking all of these parts into space over the period of the next 63 months, putting them together in space, and becoming what we call the International Space Station. When Jay Chabrow's commission said the cost overrun is going to be $7.3 billion, he went ahead to say `if the Russians fulfill their part of this bargain.' The Russians were scheduled to deploy the service module--a very important element in the space station--April 1998. Then it was going to be December 1998. Now we are up to April 1999. 
Do you know what those delays do? They cost billions. 
Do you know something else? Colleagues, let me ask you. Do you think the Russians can fulfill their part of this program? The Russians, who just barely have enough money to get a rescue team up to the Mir and rescue them, and whose electricity has been cut off at their primary cosmodrome at Baikonur. The electricity has been cut off because they won't pay their bills, and the reason they don't pay their bills is that they do not have the money. The reason they don't have the money is that the central government doesn't have the money to send to the Russian Space Agency. 
The Russians are our partners. I feel sorry for them. This statement is not intended to condemn the Russians. But to think that we are gambling $100 billion on assuming that the Russians will provide 49 of the 83 launches it is going to take to put this thing in orbit. We are depending on the Russians to do that? Do you remember when the Vice President went over to talk to Chernomyrdin and Chernomyrdin told the Vice President not to worry, that the money is going to be coming? 
The money did not come. The money has not come. 
Now, Mr. President, there is one admission I want to make right now. I would tell Daniel Goldin and the administration at NASA, forget Russia. I don't know what it is going to cost for the United States to assume its share of this burden, but whatever it is will be less than waiting for them to perform. They cannot perform. It is sad, and I am sorry, but the Russians are not going to be able to hold up their share of the bargain. 
The European Space Agency--I think there are 14 countries in the European Space Agency--is in this, and you are going to hear all these loud laments: We can't quit now; it is an international project. 
It is an international project with the United States putting up $100 billion and everybody else putting up $15 billion. The French are members of the European Space Agency. They have a very clever Space Minister, Claude Allegre. Do you know what he said? `It is time to get out. This was a mistake.' He went ahead to say, `People often do stupid things. There is no rule that says we have to applaud them.' 
They are in for 27 percent of the European Space Agency's share, which is around $9 billion to $10 billion, and they want out. They do not want to hear all these patriotic songs on the Senate floor about how this international cooperation is just wonderful. They want to save their 27 percent and get out while the getting is good. And as Claude Allegre, the Space Minister, said, `I have never seen any research that would justify this kind of expenditure.' 
Mr. President, some studies have been done which indicate that even if Russia could perform right on time, out of those 83 launches, 5 of the Russian launches could be failures under the best of circumstances--5 of those launches would be failures and 1 United States launch would be a failure. 
In addition there will be launch delays. You have a 5-minute window. Senator Glenn is familiar with all of this. You have a 5-minute window to launch those things. If you don't do it in the 5 minutes, Lord knows how long you have to wait. To assume that 83 launches to just get this thing into orbit are going to go off without a hitch, without a flaw, is naive and simplistic in the extreme. 
Going back to NASA's promises, in 1993, they said that in order to assemble this thing in space, it is going to require our astronauts to engage in what they called `extravehicular activity,' space walks for short, and it will take 434 man-hours, 434 man-hours of space walking to assemble this thing. 
In 1995, they said, no, it is going to take 888, a little over twice as many as we first said. In 1996, they said, no, it is going to take 1,104 hours of space walking. In 1997, in April, they said, no, it is going to take 1,520 hours. And in December of 1997, they said, no, it is going to take 1,729 hours. There is a nice, solid 400-percent increase or, if you choose, a 400-percent mistake. 
Mr. President, we ought to expect something as a return on our investment. We send our children and grandchildren, our most precious possessions, off to school every morning. All of us got teary-eyed as we sent our children off to school the first time. And incidentally, we sent them for 7 or 8 hours that day to be with a teacher who was going to have almost as much, and possibly more, influence on that child than the parents. 
How many debates have you heard in this Chamber about how the school buildings in this country are deteriorating? And how many debates have you heard about how we have to lower the size of the classes? Incidentally, that is a lot bigger issue. I haven't had any children in school in some time. I have grandchildren, and one of my daughters-in-law told me the other day my grandson was in a class with 34 students, and that is not extraordinary; that is fairly common, even though every educator will tell you anytime a classroom is bigger than 20 students, the chances of that child getting a decent education go down dramatically. Twenty is the optimum size for classrooms. So we wail endlessly on the floor of the Senate about our commitment to the education of these children, to teachers. That teacher to whom we send our child off to be with 7, 8 hours a day in my State, his or her entry level salary is in the $20- to $25,000 range. 
Just as an aside--this doesn't cost anybody anything-- if I were President Clinton, I would tell the American people I hope to raise teacher's salaries to $50,000 a year. I married a schoolteacher, and I can tell you categorically it is the roughest, toughest job in America. I would work for the Washington sanitation department before I would teach elementary and secondary education. And we pay tribute to them but we don't pay them money. 
Around here you hear all of these things. When we were marking the Agriculture Appropriations bill, virtually every Member of the Senate came to Senator Cochran or me or both saying, please, help me with this little project back home; we just need $400,000 for this; if we could just get $1.5 million for that. Do you know what Senator Cochran and I were dealing with? A budget that was $1 billion less than last year, a little over $13 billion for the whole Agriculture Department of America. This cost overrun just to build the space station on Earth would fund 50 percent of the agriculture budget. Think what it would do to send children to college. Think what it would do to improve teacher's salaries. We tried to appropriate $5 billion to upgrade the classrooms in this country. And we are talking about a $7.3 billion overrun here. 
Well, you trust the teacher with your child because oftentimes it is a joy to do it and sometimes because you have to. 
I started off this debate by saying that Congress is arrogating to itself a knowledge it does not possess as to what kind of research is likely to go on on the space station. If you think it can only happen on a space station, or if you think there is something peculiar about microgravity that we have to do all of this research in a vacuum, let me read to you, at the expense of boring you to tears, a few quotes. 
Here is Dr. Ursula Goodenough, a cell biologist from the University of Washington and past president of the American Society for Cell Biology. She wrote to Dan Goldin, the administrator of NASA, and said:  
The frontier of microgravity never did interest first-rate scientists, physical or biological. And this is all the more true now that it is clear that nothing of any real interest has emerged from the many in-flight studies on the effects of microgravity on this or that. 
John Pike, of the American Federation of Scientists: 
As soon as the most visible justification for piloted space craft becomes science, you got BS detectors going off all over America. 
Here is Marcia Smith. Marcia Smith is with the Congressional Research Service and probably knows as much or more about space than any person in America. She has done a report that is very current, issued in the month of July, that before any Senator votes to continue spending up to $100 billion or $150 billion, that Senator ought to read. Here is what she said in a publication in 1995: 
I don't know of any breakthroughs that have come out of Russian space station programs in terms of new or cheaper-to-produce materials or scientific discoveries. Mostly, they have learned how to operate a space station for longer periods of time. 
Longer periods of time--nothing in there about cancer, AIDS, myopia--nothing. They say the Russians have had space stations up for almost 30 years, Mir being the last one, and what have they learned? They have learned how to keep space stations up for longer periods of time. 
Here is a quote from Tim Beardsley, Scientific American. He, in turn, is quoting Elliott C. Levinthal, a former program director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. And he says: 
Levinthal, who has been a professor of genetics and mechanical engineering at Stanford University, asserts that no neutral committee handing out funds for basic research in biology would support microgravity studies. 
James Ferris, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, June, 1996: 
Nothing has come out of microgravity research to convince me that a material can be fabricated in orbit that is going to be better than what you can make on Earth. 
Why are we spending $150 billion if you believe that? 
Here is Dr. James Van Allen. Did you ever hear of the Van Allen radiation belt? One and the same person.  
With the benefit of over three decades in space flight, it is now clear that the conduct of scientific and applicational missions in space by human crews is of very limited value. 
He goes on to say: 
For almost all scientific and utilitarian purposes a human crew in space is neither necessary nor significantly useful. 
That is pretty powerful stuff from a man like Van Allen, isn't it--not necessary or useful? 
Here is Dr. Allen Bromley, Presidential Science Adviser, March 11, 1991, in a letter to the Vice President: 
The space station is needed to find means of maintaining human life during long space flights. This is the only scientific justification, in our view, and all future design efforts should be focused on this one purpose. 
That is George Bush's Vice President, Dan Quayle. That is back before Al Gore and Bill Clinton. And Dr. Bromley is writing to the Vice President, saying bear in mind that the only scientific justification should be focused on one purpose and that is maintaining human life during long flights. 
The American College of Physicians--medical doctors. The American College of Physicians: 
We agree that much, if not all, of the money slated for the space station, the superconducting super collider, SDI, and for Defense Intelligence could be better spent on improving the health of our citizens, stimulating economic growth, and reducing the deficit. 
That was in 1992 when people thought the deficit was absolutely out of control and so was Congress. And sometimes I wonder about Congress today, when I see us appropriating money to keep this thing going. 
Here is one from the American Physical Society, all the physicists in America: 
The principal scientific mission of the station is to study the effects on humans of prolonged exposure to a space environment. 
Listen to this: 
Medical researchers scoff at claims that these studies might lead to cures for disease on Earth. 
Why, you are going to hear all these things about, `We don't know what is up there; we have to go up there and find out.' We have been going up there for 30 years. We have been in space for 30 years. The space station will keep us there longer, but we have been there before. 
On cancer research--that is one of the things you always hear about, cancer research. Everybody deplores and is so frightened of cancer and AIDS and other terminal diseases like that. All you have to do is throw `cancer research' out and you can have all the money you want. And here is what Dr. David Rosenthal at the Harvard Medical School said on behalf of the American Cancer Society: 
We cannot find valid scientific justification for these claims and believe it is unrealistic to base a decision on funding the space station on that information. . . . Based on the information we have seen thus far, we do not agree that a strong case has been made for choosing to do cancer research in space over critically needed research [right] here on Earth. 
Mr. President, I will save some of the other quotes. I know it gets a little tiresome listening to somebody read on the Senate floor. I get a little wrought-up in debating this issue. But you show me somebody who can't get wrought-up over an issue and he ought not to be on the floor of the Senate. If you don't feel strongly enough about it to get excited and agitated about it, maybe you should not offer it in the first place. 
This is my last year in the Senate. This is my eighth and last effort to kill this program. But this year I am doing something a little different. Of the $2.3 billion we are talking about putting in the program for 1999--I would terminate the space station. It will cost roughly $800 million to terminate it. I would take $1 billion that is left over and put it in veterans medicine. The veterans have been squealing like a pig under a gate about how they have been mistreated this year, and they have been mistreated. If anybody in this body wants to redeem themselves, here is a chance to ingratiate themselves with every veterans organization in this country, who are totally wired to the fact that they have been shorted by the tune of about $1 billion. 
So I will put $1 billion of this in veterans programs. And I will put $450 million into low-rent housing. We are doing a magnificent job during this unprecedented era of prosperity; 67 percent of the people in this country own their own homes, or like me, have a fighting interest in one. But people who are poor and people who work that are poor, 60 percent of them spend over 50 percent of their wages on a home, on a house, on rents. 
The poor people always get the shaft, don't they? I have always thought they did. If it hadn't been for the Government providing me with the GI bill to go to a prestigious law school, I wouldn't be standing here right now. It was that mean old Government that everybody talks about how terrible it is that gave my brother and me a great education and gave us a fighting chance that we might otherwise not have had. 
People don't like to admit it, but the truth of the matter is, most people who make it in this world make it because they had a little luck along the way or because the Government gave them a little hand with an education or a small business loan or some kind of Government assistance. A lot of them, like me, got all three--luck, Government help, and I chose my parents well. Everybody doesn't get that chance. A lot of people do a miserable job of choosing their parents, but they can't help it. 
We can help it. We can do something for the least among us. I call on my colleagues for one time to rise above the politics of this. Eighty-five percent of the money goes to Alabama, California, and Texas. The rest don't have that much money in your State to warrant voting a bad vote. Anybody who can't justify a `no' vote on the space program doesn't have much business being here. Maybe you feel strongly about it, and I am not going to quarrel about that, but if you are looking for a political justification, anybody who can't justify voting to kill that thing has no business being in the debate on the floor of the Senate. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. President, first of all, let me remind my colleagues of how this all started. This is a classic case of a space station looking for justification. This chart shows where we started years ago, with a crew size of eight and a cost of $8 billion. Here are the capabilities we were told that the space station would have. 
First of all, it would be a staging base to go on to Mars with. Carl Sagan said that was a justification for it. He didn't think much of its research potential. But as a staging base to Mars, he thought it was a great idea. 
A manufacturing facility--make gallium arsenide crystals, I suppose; space-based observatory; a transportation node; a servicing facility, to service shuttles or whoever might come up to visit the space station; assembly facility--I don't know what they were going to assemble; a storage facility. 
One by one, every single one of those missions was eliminated as a justification for the space station. We have one remaining, and that is a research laboratory. So that is the reason you hear about how we are going to cure AIDS, cancer, and all these magnificent things that will happen in medical research in the space station--because that is the last only justification anybody can dream up. 
If you are having difficulty with that, write NASA and ask Administrator Goldin to send you a copy of his Chamber of Commerce glossy. It has it all in here. It has it all. If you are a conservative--and most people in this body profess to be conservatives--and you have any pang of conscience about spending $100 billion for a boondoggle, for utterly no redeemable purpose, if you are having problems with that, write to NASA and get their glossy brochure. It will just make you sleep so much better. 
Mr. President, I can remember, as the Senator from Iowa has pointed out, it took me 4 years to kill the Clinch River breeder. Howard Baker was majority leader, and no matter how close we got, he always had two more votes he could pull out of his pocket. I remember that fateful date when we had too many votes for him to pull out of his hip pocket, and he turned everybody loose, and we got 75 or 80 votes to torpedo the Clinch River breeder. Who has lost any sleep about the Clinch River breeder? And we saved billions. Everybody said, `They have broken ground; it is too late. We can't quit now; we have our nose under the tent.' We quit, and it has been God's blessing ever since we did. 
The Superconducting Super Collider, the gigantic hole in the ground in Texas--all I can think about is the Senator from Texas, the senior Senator from Texas, who defended the hole in the ground until the last dog died. I was arguing all along that there was a superconducting super collider in Switzerland, at the European consortium called CERN. No, the SSC's supporters said, our's got to be bigger than that one; got to be more expensive than that; got to have a 50-mile racetrack; none of that 20 mile racetrack business. We finally killed it after we spent $2 billion. And who here has lost any sleep over the Superconducting Super Collider? Everybody ought to rejoice every night that we saved $10 billion. 
So now here we go. How can a good conservative justify the kind of cost overruns we are looking at? How can you justify $100 billion when you think of the unmet needs in health care and education in this country? This program as a research vehicle is precisely 1,000 times less effective than doing the same research on Earth. So you ask, why are we doing it? 
The Senator from Texas has a very legitimate reason for standing on the floor and defending the space station. Texas gets $661 million a year out of it. In all candor, I might be standing here up here arguing on the other side if Arkansas got $661 million a year. For my colleagues who think you have a few jobs in your 
State, 85 percent of this money goes to Alabama, Texas, and California. The rest of you are just barely a layer; you are nothing. 
If you consider yourselves a conservative but only when it fits your convenience, you go ahead and vote against my amendment. But if you say you are a conservative and you don't believe in squandering billions and billions of dollars of the taxpayers' money, ask yourself a very simple question: What is your threshold? How high would this thing have to go before you would have to rethink your position? Forty-three percent cost overrun, just to build it on the ground? Is that not troubling to you? Is the $7.3 billion overrun just announced in the past 8 months, is that not troubling to you? Is the fact that we are already acknowledging a $7.3 billion cost overrun and headed in for the launching of this thing into space, and depending on the Russians for 49 launches, does that bother you? Who here believes that the Russians will be a player in this 1 year from now? They are not going to meet their deadline right now for launching the service module or what they call the functional cargo. 
If we are going to keep the Russians in the program, buy them out right now. They are not going to participate. They can't. Let me reiterate. The Russian Cosmodrome at Baikonur, the principal launching place, which is in Kazakhstan, has the electricity cut off because they don't pay their bills. How can you launch a space station from a cosmodrome that has had its utilities cut off? 
My junior colleague from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, invited you to read the GAO report. Let me add the Congressional Research Service report to that. You don't have to believe what I say or what Senator Harkin said or Senator Hutchinson. Read the reports that you always rely on, and see what they say. 
Take a look at this chart. This summarizes the so-called Chabrow report. The Chabrow Commission was appointed by Dan Goldin to analyze the space station. They were appointed by Goldin, and Jay Chabrow is considered one of the best space technology analysts in America. He says it will not cost $17.4 billion as NASA promised as recently as last year; it will cost $24.7 billion--a little over $7.3 billion cost overrun. How many children in America could you educate with that? How many teachers' salaries could you educate with that? How many classrooms could you build with that? How many students could you cut out of classrooms with $7 billion? We act like it is nothing around here. Nobody even gasps; nobody drew a deep breath when I started throwing these figures out. 
I commend my distinguished colleague from Maryland, and I thank her most heartily and profoundly for her kind words about my efforts on this. She mentioned the yellow lights that I had thrown up. I attended a meeting that she and the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee allowed me to attend, and in that hearing--incidentally, Daniel Goldin was testifying--I asked this question: `Mr. Goldin, is there a threshold for you? Is there a figure beyond which you are not willing to go? Is there a cost figure on the space station you are not willing to go beyond?' He must have paused at least 15 seconds. Finally, he said, `I really hadn't thought about it.' 
I have thought a lot about it. I have thought almost of nothing else since I started working on this. 
So I ask my colleagues, what is your threshold? In 1984, when Ronald Reagan first started talking about a space station at $8 billion, and now we are talking about $100 billion. 
Let me show you something. You see this $98 billion figure here? That is not all of it. No. 1, the cost overruns are going to skyrocket from here on. But even if they didn't, this does not include getting the space station down. Add $3 billion for that. So you are already well over $100 billion. When Ronald Reagan said it would be $8 billion to build this thing, I can only shutter to think what Ronald Reagan might think today if his $8 million was up to $100 billion. The conservatives who were in the Senate when Ronald Reagan was President would be gasping for breath. Nobody ever believed we were headed for such a pickle. 
If you believe that all the premier scientists in America don't know what they are talking about when they say microgravity research is of micro importance, vote no, vote against my amendment. If you think we are already spending enough at NIH on cancer, Alzheimer's, cardiovascular illnesses, vote no. If you think $11.5 million per man-hour for every hour of research that goes on in the space station is reasonable, vote against my amendment. That is right, $11.5 million an hour--as the Senator from Iowa has already said, at NIH you can get researchers who are the best in the country for $300 an hour. Divide the man-hours for research that you are going to get for this program for 10 years into $100 billion, it comes out to a cool $11.5 million per man-hour. 
Is nobody disturbed by this? 
Mr. President, I am reluctant to start reading it to you again. But I do want to quote Dr. Robert Park, a professor of physics at the University of Maryland and who has long been the spokesman for the American Physical Society, which is all the physicists in America. Here is what he said while testifying before a committee in the House on July 1, 1993. He was speaking for the American Physical Society, which is 40,000 physicists. I promise you that virtually every one of them--except those who are employed by NASA--are opposed to this. Dr. Park, in testimony, speaking for all those physicists, said:  
It is in the view of the American Physical Society that scientific justification is lacking for a permanently manned space station in Earth's orbit. We are concerned that the potential contribution of a manned space station to the physical sciences has been greatly overstated and that many of the scientific objectives currently planned for the space station could be accomplished more effectively, with a much lower cost, on Earth. 
It goes on and on. He has a magnificent statement. He says: 
The only unique property for the space station environment is microgravity. In 23 years of research, it has found little to no advantage from such an environment. 
Mr. President, what are we afraid of? Here we have a chance to save $80 billion. That `ain't' beanbags. We are going to spend an additional $80 billion minimum on this program, plus the 20-something billion we have already spent. If we continue to rely on the Russians, you can depend on the space station costing $120 billion to $150 billion, easily--the most monumentally expensive scientific undertaking in the history of the world, all at the expense of the taxpayers. 
I plead with you--plead with you--to use your common sense. You don't have to abandon common sense when you come on to the floor of the Senate. I promise you that you can justify this to your constituents. I said earlier, and I will say again, if you can't justify a vote against this program, you have no business being in the U.S. Senate. 
Mr. President, I know there are legitimate concerns by people who have honest differences with me. I would certainly never denigrate my friend, John Glenn. I know he believes fervently in this. We all wish him well in the endeavor he is about to take in another trip to space, and we applaud him. As far as I am concerned, I hope they get some beneficial research out of him. But I can tell you that he didn't have to go into a research project. If he just wanted to go up there and look out the window, it would be fine with me, and it would be fine with everybody else 
in America, too. Before I ever met him, he was a hero of mine. I had tears in my eyes, like every American did, when we saw John Glenn get out of that capsule. We all shared in his joy. We have shared the joy of John and Annie ever since he came to the Senate. We love him and we wish him well on everything--except the vote on this space station. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
I assume most everybody in this Senate now understands that we are debating an amendment that would terminate the space station, save $80 billion over the next 15 years, and this year alone put $1 billion in veterans medicine, $450 million into low-rent housing. 
I hate to call a program that has been successful in most ways, almost comical, but there is no way to describe what is going on with the space station right now any other way. We have been told from the beginning it would cost $17.4 billion to build the station on Earth. There are three stages: No. 1, you have to build it; No. 2, you have to put it in space; No. 3, you have to operate it for 10 years. 
What are we looking at? We are looking at a $100 billion cost today. Since last October 1, since last October 1, the Chabrow Commission, appointed by Daniel Goldin, the administrator of NASA, Jay Chabrow, probably the best space policy analyst in America, comes back and says the first part is not going to cost $17.4 billion; NASA is going to take 10 to 38 months longer than they told you, and it will cost $24.7 billion. That is $7.3 billion--a 43-percent cost overrun and we haven't even finished building it yet. 
If you think that is a cost overrun, wait until the Russians start reneging. Jay Chabrow says you will not have this thing finished in early 2003. You will be lucky to have it finished early 2006. So when the Russians start reneging on their part of it, we have about 80 launches to deploy this thing, and the Russians are going to be responsible for about 40 of them, between 40 and 49. Who here believes that a country who can't even pay the electric bill at their principal cosmodrome is going to come through on their commitment with that many flights? Every time they renege it will cost us close to $1 billion. 
I asked my colleagues this afternoon, and I repeat the challenge, I have talked endlessly about the cost overruns we are experiencing and the ones we are going to experience, and according to the way we have debated this thing this afternoon, those cost overruns are like Ross Perot's crazy aunt in the basement; we ignore it. I can tell you that crazy aunt in the basement will have a lot of company unless we kill this program now. 
You can save $80 billion. We have yet to spend $80 billion. If the cost overruns are anything even close to what they are looking at now, what Jay Chabrow says is a distinct possibility, you are talking about $100 billion to $150 billion, and every research scientist in America says it is of highly questionable value. As a matter of fact, virtually every one of them are adamantly opposed to it. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator from Texas just alluded to curing breast cancer and curing several other diseases. You could fund the National Institutes of Health God knows how many times for what this thing will cost. You are not going to cure anything with this. That is the reason America's physicists, cell biologists, and medical scientists are all opposed to it. 
You know what this space station is going to cost per man-hour of research?--$11.5 million per hour. Can you imagine us, with our eyes wide open, saying we are going to build a space station for research purposes that will cost $11.5 million an hour. It is the height of irresponsibility. 
The American people have a right to expect us to be fiscally responsible. I want to ask my colleagues in closing, how far are you willing to go? What is the threshold beyond which you are not willing to go? We have gone from $8 billion to $100 billion for the space station and we are headed for $150 to $200 billion. We kill the Super Collider, we kill the Clinch River Breeder, and who here misses them? We save America billions of dollars. You have a chance to save $80 billion right now and help veterans, help veterans and help people who are desperately needing low-rent housing. 
I plead with my opponents to support this amendment.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the Air Force is in the process of buying by far the most expensive fighter plane the United States has ever bought by a magnitude of 300 percent, to be precise. And that is if we can build it at today's estimated cost. I have not made any bones about the fact that I don't think we need the F-22, but we are going to get it. I lost the battle to terminate the program, I admit. But if we are going to spend $62 to $100 billion for 339 airplanes, we at least ought to fly that sucker before we buy it. And therein lies the problem. 
My staff found--the distinguished Presiding Officer will find this interesting--a copy of an article from the January 9, 1989, Atlanta Constitution. The Presiding Officer is familiar with that newspaper. And the headline is `The B-2: Fly Before You Buy.' How many times have my colleagues heard that term, `fly before you buy'? No less than a thousand. 
My colleague, Senator Pryor, used to screech to the roof of this Chamber about buying weapons before they have been tested. 
Let me begin with a little history of the F-22. It is the Pentagon's intention--and they usually get their way--to buy advanced F-18s, the so-called E/F model. We are going to buy 30 of those next year. Then the Pentagon also plans to buy the F-22, which is supposed to be the greatest, most sophisticated piece of weaponry in the history of the world. And we are going to buy 339 of those. And then in the year 2005 we will start buying 3,000 Joint Strike Fighters. It is going to be stealthy, and it is going to be everything that anybody could ever conjure up. It will be used by the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, the Brits, and perhaps some other members of NATO. 
Mr. President, we are buying all these fighters in spite of the fact that the intelligence community and everybody who knows anything about an airplane knows that there isn't a plane in the world--in France, in Russia, in China--that is even remotely comparable to our F-15 and our F-18 and there won't be, the CIA says, for 15 to 20 years. So what is the rush to judgment? 
A little more about the F-22 and its checkered history. We started out to buy over 600 F-22s, and the Air Force said, we will buy them at a certain such cost. It became apparent that they could not even begin to buy that many airplanes for those dollars, so they cut the number to 438. It turns out they could not buy 438 for that price, and Secretary Cohen, to his eternal credit, said this is the amount of money we are going to spend and no more. And so that took the number down to 339. Sixty-two billion dollars, and we put a cost cap for that amount in last year's Defense bill. Listen to this, that comes to $182 million for each F-22 we buy. That is roughly three times more than we have ever paid for a fighter plane. 
So what is next? Lockheed Martin and the Air Force say in November of 1994 that the F-22 will require 1,400 hours of testing before we start production. That sounded reasonable. Then in May of 1997 they say, no, we don t need to do 1,400 hours; 601 hours of testing will be adequate. And now guess what we are down to in this very bill we are debating. You see the figure on this chart: 183 hours. 
Mr. President, that comes out to only four percent of the four percent of the F-22's whole 4,300 hour flight test program. Four percent. 
Now, the Defense Science Board and every flight evaluator and testing expert will tell you that most of the complaints, most of the flaws in an airplane, will, indeed, show up when you test it between 10 and 20 percent of the number of hours that it should be tested. But here we are in February of 1988. In 1998, they said 183 hours. This bill that we are debating was crafted in May of this year. Bear that in mind. A lot of things have happened since then. 
Mr. President, the Air Force the other day--as a matter of fact, it wasn't the other day; it was yesterday--the Air Force sent a message to every Senator's office saying, `Here is why you ought to oppose the Bumper's amendment.' But they closed it out exactly the way I knew they would close it out: 25,000 jobs--mostly in Georgia and some other States. 
Mr. President, here is how much we tested other fighters before we made an initial purchase. The F-15 was tested for 975 hours before we bought the first one; the F-16 was tested 1,115 hours before we bought the first one; the F-18, 1,418 hours before we bought the first one; and the F-18E/F, the follow-on model, which really didn't need all that much testing, we tested for 779 hours. But do you know what else happened. During flight testing of the F-18E/F, they discovered that it had a problem. It was called `wing drop.' 
Now, if you listen to this illustration, you will know what you get into when you do this business of buying before you fly. They had to test-fly the F-18-E/F, they had to test-fly it almost 2,500 hours to cure one flaw in a time-tested airplane. 
We are spending $200 million a year on the B-1 bomber, and do you know why? Because we didn't test it. We were so hot to buy that bomber back during the cold war that we started buying the initial airplanes before we even tested them. 
We are spending over $200 million this year, and we will spend $198 million next year on it. 
And so what came next? The next thing that came was the B-2 bomber, and it is not fixed. And we are spending God knows how much money on it every year because we didn't test it before we bought it. 
What this bill does--I hope my colleagues will pay close attention to this--this bill does not keep the Air Force from buying what they call lot 1 of low rate initial production, two airplanes. We don't stop that with my amendment. We don't change the bill. They can go ahead and buy those two airplanes. 
But then there is $190 million in this bill that is fenced, it is to buy long-lead items for the next six airplanes. It says you cannot buy them until you have tested it at least 183 hours and the Secretary certifies a couple of things, then you can go ahead and start toward $1.5 billion worth of airplanes, after 183 hours of testing. 
I have a something here the Pogo Alert, put out by the Project on Government Oversight. It says:  
The contractors building the aircraft [referring to the F-22] may be satisfied with a promise of future testing in order to get the program funded now and will welcome getting more money in the future to fix problems discovered too late. But the Government should not walk into such a situation knowingly. To avoid more problems with the F-22, the Government merely needs to follow its own rhetoric of adopting commercial best practices, and that means, in this case, testing before producing, not after. 
Once the waiver is issued by the Secretary of Defense, all bets are off. We are headed for a $1.5 billion purchase of six airplanes. And when we start running into trouble we will already be committed just as we were on the B-1 and the B-2. 
The Air Force says, `We will test this airplane. We will get in the 183 hours before December.' Would you like to know how many hours they have tested it so far? As of June 16, they have tested it 6 hours. And they say yes, but we are going to step that up to 15 hours a month. If they do, in December they will have about 95--95 hours of testing. 
My amendment says they ought to test this plane for 601 hours before the initial purchase of these six production airplanes is made. That is the amount the Air Force said they would do just last year. Why is it that we are in such a sweat to get this unbelievably expensive airplane built with not an enemy in sight, not anybody in the world with airplanes to even come close to the F-15s and the F-18s and the F-16s? Yet they want to go all out to start buying this airplane. And we know, we know to a certainty that we are going to regret it. The testing so far, incidentally, the 6 hours it has been tested, is on what they call a clean airplane: No armaments, no sidewinders, no SRAMs, no nothing--just a clean airplane, 6 hours of testing. And when you start putting the armaments on it and in it, it takes on an entirely different aerodynamic. 
I get frustrated and too loud sometimes, because I cannot believe what we do. Do you know what the Air Force told the GAO in 1992? Listen to this. In 1992 they said: We don't have to rush anymore. The cold war is over. We can take our time in testing weapons in the future. We do not have to urge what we call concurrency. Concurrency is buying airplanes while you are testing them. You are buying airplanes on the come, betting on the come. You are betting that somehow or other, whatever problems crop up, they can be solved. That is called concurrency, and that is what the Air Force told the GAO, in 1992, that it was not going to do. It said, we are not going to use concurrency as an excuse to buy weapons in the future because we are not in that big of a hurry. 
Mr. President, I wish I could say that I thought Senators who were listening, and those on the floor would take a very sensible view toward testing an airplane before we buy it, particularly the most expensive fighter plane we have ever bought. But I am not hopeful. I have seen it happen too many times, planes being built in a lot of States with a lot of jobs. Nobody wants to be accused of being soft on defense. And they know to a certainty that the American public, by and large, will never know what happened--just as they don't know what happened in the case of the B-1 and the B-2. And their money will have been spent. 
Mr. President, it is the `same old, same old.' It is Lucy 
holding the ball for Charlie Brown and swearing she won't pull it out from under him this time. So it is a freebie. You can go ahead and vote against this amendment and be ironclad sure you will never pay at the polls. Nobody is going to say why did you spend that $62 billion to $100 billion on that F-22 without even testing it? They don't know about it, so you get a free ride. 
Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the distinguished Senator from Michigan for his very fine comments. 
I have a couple of questions. No. 1, if 601 hours was the right number of preproduction tests last year, why is 183 hours the right number this year? 
If you want to use apples and apples, you compare flight hours prior to award of a production contract. This chart shows the preproduction flight hours here. Those planes were tested this amount: 975 hours for the F-15; 1,115 hours for the F-16; and 1,418 hours for the F-18--preproduction hours. 
And what are we going to do for the F-22? 183. 
And let me repeat, when you talk about how much more this is going to cost, $3 or $4 billion more, if we do not do this--you tell me, what if the Secretary does not wait? They still have to test 433 hours, and presumably you are going to get into the same cost figures of a $3 to $4 billion cost overrun. 
And while I am at it, let me ask the Air Force and Lockheed Martin this question: If you did not know, if they did not know that this committee, the Armed Services Committee--if they did not know that the required test hours were going to be cut from 600 to 183, why did they make those commitments that would generate a $3 to $4 billion cost overrun? Why are we responsible for the cost overrun that they have incurred--not us--they? 
Oh, Mr. President, it is so frustrating. 
I want to say this on the floor. Everyone knows I am leaving at the end of this year. I am not running for reelection. And, you know, it is no fun saying `I told you so" when you are in a little country town down in Arkansas instead of on the Senate floor. I told this body years ago that when push came to shove the space station costs were going to start escalating. 
You listen to this. I told you years ago that the space station was going to cost well over $100 billion. And now it is almost up to $100 billion and rising. Since October 1, the cost overrun, just to build it--not deploy it--just to build it is 44 percent in 8 months. 
And this F-22 fighter, this airplane is going to cost this body and this country more headaches than you will ever dream of. And tonight is an opportunity to avoid it. Why do we insist on going headlong into the production of an airplane this expensive, this sophisticated, which requires even more testing because of the new sophisticated equipment it has on it? And it is stealthy, all of those things. 
So I will tell you tonight--and I will not be here to say `I told you so'--you are making a fatal mistake. You will regret it. The cost of this airplane is going to be a lot more than $62 billion. 
When the Air Force said, `We'll build it for $62 billion,' Secretary Cohen said, `OK, that's what we're going to build it for.' They said, `How many can you build?' They said, `Three hundred thirty-nine.' So last year, courtesy of my good friend from Michigan, Senator Levin, and Senator Coats, and Senator McCain, we took the Air Force's word, and we put the total cost at $62 
billion--$182 million each. 
And we hadn't anymore got it ink printed, the ink wasn't dry, before the Air Force says, `I'm sorry, we can't do it. We have to lift that cap.' You know something else? It will be lifted. It will be lifted. Nothing is ever permanent around here. How we deceive ourselves and get by with it. 
The only satisfaction I will get out of this evening is knowing that sometime in the not-too-distant future I will be proven correct. Would you buy an automobile that had been tested for 6 hours, or even 183 hours? You wouldn't buy a Jeep that had only been tested for 183 hours, but we are going to spend $100 billion on 339 airplanes. 
I yield the floor, and I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, we are embarked on buying the most expensive fighter plane in the history of the United States. As a matter of fact, three times more expensive than any fighter plane in the history of the United States, the F-22, $182 million each, $62 billion total--which will surely go to $100 to $125 billion before we are finished. 
When we first started talking about it, the Air Force said we will test this plane, preproduction, 1,400 hours. In 1997, they said no, 600 hours. Now this bill says 183 hours, if the Secretary will certify a couple of little deals. You wouldn't buy a golf cart that hadn't been tested more than 183 hours. 
We are going right down the B-1, B-2 lane. I can tell you, we are headed for big-time trouble. All I want to say is, not only is this plane very expensive, it is simply not going to work.

 Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to designate Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, as a National Historic Site. Central High School is perhaps the most well-known school in the nation, as a result of the high profile and pivotal role it played in the desegregation of public schools in America. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Hutchinson in sponsoring this legislation. 
In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its landmark decision, Brown versus Board of Education, which held that the segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. The following year, in its Brown II decision, the Court ruled that integration of the public schools was the responsibility of local school districts, to be carried out `with all deliberate speed.' This set the stage for the eventual confrontation in Little Rock. 
Prior to the Brown decision, Central High was attended only by white students. Following the Court's decision, the Little Rock School Board initially made plans to comply with the decision in phases to be carried out over six years. However, by the time the district began to implement the decision in the fall of 1957, the political controversy had increased to the extent that only 9 black students decided to enroll at Central High, with approximately 1,900 white students. Those nine students later became known as the `Little Rock Nine,' and are an inspiration to America. 
Mr. President, earlier this Congress, Senator Mosely-Braun and I introduced legislation, S. 1283, to award the Congressional Gold Medal to those nine extraordinary individuals--Jean Brown Trickey, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Melba Patillo Beals, Terrance Roberts, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed Wair, Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, and Jefferson Thomas. It is my strong desire that both S. 1283 and this legislation will be enacted into law in the remaining months of this Congress. These nine sons and daughters of Little Rock are proud symbols of the progress we have made and a solemn reminder of the progress we have yet to make. 
By the time the Little Rock Nine attempted to enter Central High in September of 1957, the issue of desegregation had polarized not only Little Rock, but the entire nation. The Governor of Arkansas, Orville Faubus, ordered the Arkansas National Guard to prevent the desegregation of Central High. Following several days of unrest, a Federal District Court in Little Rock issued an order preventing the National Guard from further obstructing desegregation efforts in Little Rock. Amid this period of intense feelings and acrimony, President Eisenhower issued an Executive Order which federalized the National Guard and deployed Federal troops to enforce the district court's order. Although several events of the following days were tense and often ugly, the eventual peaceful resolution that followed helped to ensure the successful implementation of the Brown decision, not only in Little Rock, but throughout the South. 
Last fall, on the 40th anniversary of the 1957 events, the attention of the nation was once again focused on Central High, and the Little Rock Nine once again entered through the school's main doors. However, this time those doors were held open by the President of the United States and the Governor of Arkansas. 
Establishment of the Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site will, for the first time, provide the National Park Service with the ability to interpret for all Americans the complete history of the desegregation of our public schools, certainly one of the most important social events in the history of our country. Let me hasten to add, Mr. President, that Central High will continue to be a functioning high school, managed by the Little Rock School District. Designation of the school as a National Historic Site will also complement the very successful interpretive activities already undertaken by the Central High Museum and Visitor Center. 
There is no question as to the national significance of Central High School. The school is included on the National Register of Historic Places, and was designated in 1982 as a National Historic Landmark by the Secretary of the Interior. 
There is strong support for this bill, both in Little Rock and with the entire Arkansas Congressional delegation. The City of Little Rock, the Little Rock School District, Central High Museum, Inc., area residents, and many other organizations and individuals in Little Rock have expressed support for this proposal. It is my hope to have a hearing scheduled for this bill in the very near future, with passage by the Senate shortly thereafter.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I know my good friend Senator Inouye is here because he has a judgeship nomination he feels very strongly about. I have waited here for over an hour now, and I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to speak for 10 minutes on the Hutchinson amendment.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me say it is with some regret I rise in opposition to an amendment by my distinguished colleague and good friend from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson. It is never pleasant to take an opposite viewpoint from your colleague, but I feel very strongly about this, as does he. 
Let me say, first of all, I have no quarrel or suggestion that any of the information that Senator Hutchinson has just given us about conditions in China are incorrect. I do not know that they are correct, but I am sure he has checked out the facts he just gave the Senate. What I want to say is, if you had been in China with me in 1978 at the end of the Cultural Revolution, and it was at the end of the Cultural Revolution, and if you had heard the stories or if you had read the documentation since the end of the Cultural Revolution about what went on in China, I suggest this debate ought to be not about where China is, but how far she has come since 1978. 
On the issue of religion in China, according to the New York Times, in 1979 there were three active churches in China. Today there are 12,000. In addition to the 12,000 temples and churches in China, it is estimated that over 25,000 religious groups meet in the homes of members every week, and nobody has tried to stop that. On the contrary, when you think of the growth from 3 to 12,000, China should receive some recognition for what they have done and the improvements they have made. 
Nobody in the U.S. Senate will take issue with some of the accusations here that have been made about China's opposition to religions of all kinds. Nobody will argue that China has a good human rights record. Nobody will argue with very much of what has been said here. What we are arguing here is a simple philosophical point that I feel strongly about, and that is that China is 10 times more likely to allow the kind of progress that is going on there today, which has been absolutely phenomenal, when they are engaged in dialog with nations like the United States with whom they would like to have good relations, than it would be if we try to tell a great nation of between 1 billion and 2 billion people--25 percent of the Earth's population resides in China--they are much more likely to behave themselves when they are dealing with people who constructively engage them than they are with people who ignore them and try to impose sanctions. 
What if China said, `We are not going to do business with the United States anymore until they pay the United Nations dues? We are paid up. It is the United States that is the deadbeat. They owe the United Nations $900 million.' 
You would hear a hue and outcry in this country that would drown out every rock band in America. 
Mr. President, China has a long way to go. Nobody argues that. But I can tell you that by the President constructively engaging China, presumably he will talk to them forcefully about human rights, inquire and talk to them forcefully about the issue of forced abortion, talk to them about religion, talk to them about political freedoms and how much better off they would be, talk to them about nuclear weaponry and how we are relying on China to temper one of the most volatile dangerous regions in the world, between India and Pakistan. 
If you read the Washington Post yesterday, read the interview with President Jiang, you heard him say that he was shocked to hear India use, as one of its excuses for exploding a nuclear weapon--a weapon--he was shocked that they used 
China as a threat to India as one of the reasons. China and India have not been big bosom buddies. I am not suggesting that. As a matter of fact, it hasn't been too long since they had a border war. But, in my opinion, China is not the reason they exploded a nuclear bomb. The reason they exploded a nuclear weapon is because the Indians and Pakistanis mistrust each other, and one of the main reasons they distrust each other is because of their religious differences. If you look around the world, you will find most of the wars, most of the dissent going on in the world today is because of religion--in Ireland, in Bosnia, in China, in India and Pakistan. 
Mr. President, I think we ought to utilize China as a possible broker in the fight on the Korean peninsula, as well as between India and Pakistan--that whole region of the world. 
I heard something the other day. I don't know whether it is true or not. I heard some guy on NPR talking about the criminal justice of the United States. There are 70,000 people in the United States in prison who are innocent. That is not the best record in the world, if that is true. I expect it is probably close to true. Every day you read about somebody who gets out of prison who has been there 10 years because he was found, finally, to be innocent. Nobody's criminal justice system is perfect. I am not saying there are not a lot more people imprisoned in China who are innocent. All I am saying is for any nation to hold itself out as perfect and to castigate other nations for being imperfect is the height of hypocrisy. 
Mr. President, nobody disagrees with the issues that are being raised in this amendment, nor is anybody suggesting the President not engage the Chinese very forcefully on those issues. We have a trade imbalance with China. They sell us a lot more than we sell them. But I can tell you, if you took away the $5 billion in goods we sell to China every year, there would be a lot of jobs lost in this country, and the people who sell in China, and other people who buy from China, are opposed, very strongly opposed to this amendment. 
Two final points. A lot of people have a very difficult time since the Soviet Union disappeared. They have a very difficult time accepting the idea that we don't have anybody to hate. We had the Soviet Union for 70 years. It was so much fun. We didn't have to debate about who the enemy was; we knew it was the Soviet Union. 
We built weapons galore, trillions of dollars' worth, because of the threat of the Soviet Union. 
The Soviet Union is not around anymore, and we have been searching frantically for somebody with which to replace the Soviet Union, somebody we could hate with a great deal of gusto and vigor. 
I have watched for the past 2 years. I have watched the anti-China decibel level rise to unprecedented rates. China has been elected. I am not suggesting this amendment is offered because of the hatred for China. I am telling you, you cannot keep 270 billion dollars' worth of defense going a year unless you have an enemy. The military industrial complex has decided that is China, so we are going to continue to build weapons, and we are going to continue to make China the bad guy. 
As I say, when you say these things, it looks as if you are being apologetic or defensive. I am not, not for a moment. I am simply saying that is a fact, and I can tell you, since those bombs exploded in India and Pakistan, it is a very ominous sign, and I can tell you the threat to civilization has gone up exponentially. 
When the President is going to visit a country which has signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which has signed the Conventional Weapons Treaty, Conventional Weapons Convention, and which has agreed to quit shipping any information of any nuclear value to Iran, those are things that would never have happened if the Hutchinson amendment was in place. I feel quite sure the Hutchinson amendment will be defeated. I hope so. 
He is my colleague, and I regret taking a position opposite him on any issue, but on this one, I can tell you, in my opinion, common sense dictates that the President do exactly what he is doing. I wish him well. I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, many of us in Arkansas have been working for several years to reverse a critical ground water resource problem that is developing in our region and will ultimately affect the entire country. 
Throughout this century, aquifers in the lower Mississippi River Valley have been falling due to high demand and relatively low recharge. The United States Geological Survey has found that current trends by the year 2015 will reduce the saturated thickness of the aquifers to the point that soils will begin to compact, recharge will not be possible, and the aquifer will effectively be dead, along with nearly half of the U.S. rice industry. Because of the magnitude of this problem, state and local efforts to correct it will never succeed without assistance from the federal government. In that event, a regional economic collapse will occur, a major environmental resource will forever be lost, and our legacy to future generations will carry a lasting shadow of irresponsibility. 
The President's Budget Request provided $11.5 million for the Grand Prairie Region. I understand the difficulty the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee faced in trying to fund many worthwhile projects. Unfortunately, the Grand Prairie Project was not funded in this bill. It is also my understanding that the House Energy and Water Appropriations Bill provides the full Budget Request of $11.5 million for the Grand Prairie project. 
I ask the Chairman, Senator Domenici, for his support in accepting the House level when this legislation is considered in conference.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am most pleased to join my very good friend, Senator Cochran, in bringing this bill to the floor. I think that, considering the constraints that Senator Cochran--who is really the crafter of this bill--considering the constraints that he was operating under, this is a remarkable bill. 
We were allocated, and even in the President's budget request, $1 billion less than we had last year. To try to craft a bill meeting the really mostly legitimate demands--or at least even funding or increased funding--under that kind of a burden was extremely difficult. I did not interfere--tried not to interfere very much in Senator Cochran's work because he was already burdened heavily enough in trying to fit all the pieces of this mosaic together. But he deserves the praise and the accolades of every Member of this Senate for what I think is a remarkable achievement. 
Mr. President, Senator Cochran has outlined the levels of funding provided in this bill for various functions and programs under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee and I will not repeat them. Let me simply say Senator Cochran and I have done the best we could with limited resources to maintain the activities at USDA, FDA, and other agencies that are so important to the American people. 
I wish I could be equally as pleased with the budgetary hand with which this subcommittee has been dealt, but the reality is that a budget request filled with user fees, initiatives, and other issues coupled with a 302(b) allocation that reduced our available resources well below last year's levels has produced very hard choices for us. As the Washington Post pointed out in an editorial earlier this week related to the fact that our bill freezes the WIC program at last year's level, until the overall budgetary parameters affecting this subcommittee are adjusted, there is little this subcommittee can do. We can't provide more with less. 
However, in my view, the bill before us, which Senator Cochran has crafted, makes the best of a bad situation. Would I suggest increases in certain programs if the resources were available? Of course I would and I believe Senator Cochran would agree with those increases. But it doesn't take a rocket scientist to conclude that when you have less to work with, something has to give. Unfortunately, this year is one in which avoiding the budget ax may itself be a victory. 
We hear a lot these days about budget surpluses. We also hear a lot about how to spend those surpluses, such as providing tax cuts. We talk a lot about saving Social Security, but we still count those revenues coming into the Social Security Trust Fund as part of that glorious `surplus' which many are eager to divide up and share with their friends. 
The other day, a group of people from a very poor part of the East Arkansas Delta were in office asking for help to reduce flooding in their communities. The flooding causes their septic tanks to back up, resulting in sewage floating down the streets of small rural communities and into the ditches throughout the county. When this bill was considered by the full committee, I explained this problem to Senator Stevens and other members of the Appropriations Committee. Senator Stevens and others pledged to help and I hope that we will be able to include an amendment to this bill that will provide necessary funds so these people in East Arkansas will have a few of the basic services that many of us take for granted. Still, this leaves Congress with the remaining problem of caps on domestic spending that is affecting the lives of everyday people all across this country. 
The immediate future holds little promise for improvement. The Budget Act requires that the coming years will witness continuing declines in discretionary spending, which means the subcommittee's allocation will likely be less next year than this and Senator Cochran's headaches (not mine) will be even more severe than they have been these past few weeks. Having said all this, let me come back to the task at hand and simply state that Senator Cochran has done all excellent job in making the pieces fit into a very complex mosaic. 
As I have suggested, the watchword for this year has been `maintain'. This bill restores many of the worthwhile programs that were deleted in the President's budget request and even provides a sight increase in the formula base funds for research and extension activities that have been held steady for many years. Conservation and rural development programs are protected 
as best we can in spite of changes in loan subsidy rates that caused severe problems in maintaining last year's program levels. We protected rural water and sewer programs which are among the best investments the federal government makes. We were also able to maintain many of last year's program levels for rural housing programs. 
The WIC program is expected to average more than 7 million participants in fiscal year 1998. This bill provides funds necessary to maintain that caseload. I wish we were able to provide a higher level, but limited resources have left few options. I am willing to work with Senator Cochran and other Senators to find ways to provide higher levels for important programs such as WIC if reasonable offsets or additional resources can be identified. 
For years, so called `budget hawks' have been telling Congress to `cut the fat'. For this subcommittee, the `fat' was eliminated a long, long time ago. Today, we are cutting into the `lean.' These cuts hurt farmers and they hurt our agricultural research base which is needed to make possible the means for this planet to avoid global starvation in years to come. These cuts hurt small rural communities and they hurt children. They deprive our nation of a cutting edge in maintaining a place in global markets. They place our food and blood supply at risk and, quite simply, they harm America. This is certainly not the fault of Senator Cochran, but these problems have fallen in his lap, and mine, and on us all. I only hope that in years to come, those who would cut the `fat' out of these programs first explain where the `fat' is. 
I also feel it is important to make a quick reference to an item in the bill that has long been near and dear to my heart as I know it is to Senator Cochran. For longer than we have shared a place in the United States Senate, Senator Cochran and I have shared a common state boundary along the banks of the mightiest river on the continent. One hundred years ago, the highest form of travel in this country was to take a ride on a Mississippi riverboat. Ten years ago, I sponsored legislation to create the Lower Mississippi River Delta Regional Commission. Sadly, the focus of this Commission was not to highlight the gilded days of luxurious steamboat travel, or the glorious setting in the lobby of Memphis' Peabody Hotel, where legend holds the Delta begins, but to reverse the tragic decline in economic and social prosperity that has resulted in harsh impoverishment up and down this mighty river. 
Today, the Chairman of this Commission which we formed in 1988 now sits at a desk in the Oval Office of the White House. President Clinton submitted a budget amendment to this subcommittee to create a Delta Regional Commission based largely on the findings of the Lower Mississippi Delta Regional Commission and in the combined spirit of us all to provide a better life for the most hard pressed of our citizens. The President's request called for $26 million to establish and provide assistance to this worthy cause. 
With the limited resources of this subcommittee, we were not able to create a new `agency' for the Delta, but we did provide the Secretary of Agriculture authority to work with local groups in the region to help them help themselves. USDA holds many programs important to the Delta such as rural housing, water and sewer programs, conservation, food assistance, research and education, and many, many more. This subcommittee, over the past several years, has provided funding for the Delta Teachers Academy which has been a highly successful program to improve educational opportunities in the region. The Delta Teachers Academy is an example of the progress in rural America that USDA can help foster. I am pleased that the President has added his voice to the call for rejuvenation of this region that two hundred years ago was the western border of our nation, but now lies at its heart. 
In closing, I would be remiss not to state publicly my admiration for Senator Cochran and the honor I have enjoyed serving with him on this subcommittee. This is my last agriculture appropriations bill to be considered on the floor of the United States Senate, but I will always cherish the friendship and warm memories of my colleagues. 
Let me conclude by saying that I do not know of anybody in the Senate for whom I have a higher regard and more respect than I have for Senator Cochran. I was chairman of this subcommittee until the Republicans took over in 1995. Senator Cochran has chaired it since that time. He was my ranking member when I was chairman. And I daresay, with no reflection on any other chairman and ranking member of any of the subcommittees on appropriations, or I daresay any other committee of the Senate, I doubt that any of them have enjoyed better cooperation with each other than Senator Cochran and I have enjoyed, and that is based on the tremendous respect I have for his ability and his understanding of these programs. I concede he understands some of these agricultural programs a lot better than I do. 
But having said all of that, Mr. President, I just say it has been a genuine joy to work with Senator Cochran. Let me say, again, there is no Member of the Senate for whom I have a higher regard and greater respect. It has been a great honor. I will miss times like this when we come before the Senate to present this bill. I will miss working with Senator Cochran on issues that we both care deeply about, but it is time for me to move on. I want to thank Senator Cochran for his always generous and laudable remarks that he made about me. 
So with that, Mr. President, I hope that Senators who have amendments will come to the floor so we can dispose of this bill as expeditiously as possible. We did very well on the water and energy bill. I would like to think we could do as well on the ag bill. If Senators would come to the floor and offer their amendments, we will.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I, first of all, compliment my distinguished colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, for what I thought was a very compelling analysis of what our relationship with China is and what it should be and what the President ought to be doing in China in the way of engagement to improve our relationship. 
I agree totally with everything he said. Right now, China, obviously, is not a democracy, though about 40 percent of her economy is private enterprise in the true sense of the word we cherish here. 
We have found in the past that when nations begin to permit economic freedom, usually the economic benefits that come from that become highly desirable to the people, and then they begin to seek more freedom, more democracy. On the other hand, you can argue that political democracy and social freedom should come first and everything else will follow. I would like to believe that, but I believe in the case of China, where unbelievable changes have occurred in the last 20 years, the ordinary citizen of this country cannot even begin to fathom the dramatic changes in the culture, even in the political system, and the economy of China. 
So I happen to come from the school of thought that believes that when people have economic freedom, political freedom is more likely to ensue than vice versa. I understand all the arguments on human rights. And nobody is going to stand up, who is in his right mind, and say that China does not violate human rights. Of course they do. And I do not care what anybody says, under the best case scenario, you are not going to get the kind of democracy in China overnight that we enjoy in this country. 
But I can tell you this. Engagement of China on these issues is going to be 10 times more beneficial to both their citizens and the world than our sitting back with a purist attitude saying that, `If you don't do all these things we tell you to do, then we're going to quit trading with each other and we're going to quit our dialog with each other. You go ahead and start shipping missiles to Iran. You go ahead and violate the chemical weapons ban which you signed in 1992. And go ahead and violate the test ban treaty which you signed in 1992.' Who wants that? Who thinks that is a good idea? 
I am not saying China would do it, but I am simply saying we are not going to bully a nation of 1.2 billion people. And I think our chances of bringing them into the mainstream are infinitely better if we engage them. 
So, No. 1, I applaud the President for going to China. I have a little difficulty with the Tiananmen Square event. But if you wanted to sour the trip from the opening gun, just have the President go there with a precondition that, `I will not have any dialog with you in Tiananmen Square.' He can turn right around and get on Air Force One and come home for all the good he is going to do. 
Those are the realities, Mr. President. Whether we like them or not, those are the facts. And everybody who knows anything about human psychology knows what would happen if the President took that kind of a stance, which a lot of people in this body have urged him to take. 
He should go there resolute on talking about human rights with the Chinese and engage them on it as strongly as he can. He should engage them on any suspected arms shipments or transfers of chemicals that we are concerned about. He should talk to them about all the violations of human rights. And he should ask them about the slave and prison labor. And he should ask them about forced abortions. 
There are a lot of forces at work in this country, Mr. President. We are having a very difficult time in this country since the Soviet Union fell. For the last 50 years, politicians in this country have had a field day hating the Soviet Union. We all have. It was a bizarre situation. And the Soviet Union, while they were our allies in World War II, after World War II was over, we had a very--not tenuous--disastrous relationship with them. 
And the only reason I make that point is, now that the Soviet Union no longer exists, we have been looking around for an enemy. We do not cope very well without somebody to hate, and China has been elected. You cannot justify $270 billion on defense expenditures unless you have a genuine, certified enemy. So there is a lot of that at work here. 
I believe Eisenhower was absolutely right when he described the military-industrial complex as a real threat to the country. It is alive and well. I have always chastised President Eisenhower, whom I admired and thought he was a pretty good President, for not having made that military-industrial complex speech when he took office instead of when he left. We are all awfully courageous when we leave office. 
But in any event, there are a lot of people who simply cannot accept China because it is communistic. Even though, as I said, 40 percent of their economy is in the free market sector, politically it still is a Communist Nation. And there is no such thing as real democracy in China. 
Mr. President, there are people in this body who are going to vote against the most-favored-nation status of China because of China's treatment of Christian missionaries. I read an interesting story on that this week which pointed out there are 67 million Christians in China and the number is growing all the time. I do not really know how serious the discrimination allegation about religion is in China, but I will tell you, I suspect that it is exaggerated to some extent. 
But you have these people who resent China's, at least, reluctance to allow all of these various religious missionaries, especially Christian missionaries, into their country. So they are not going to vote for most-favored-nation status. 
And then there is, of course, this anti-Clinton segment. Some people have a very difficult time giving the President credit for anything. And so if they can make President Clinton look bad by going to China to consort with the same people Richard Nixon consorted with, if they can get any mileage out of that, they are going to take advantage of that. So you have that political faction working. 
So, Mr. President, I think the President is doing the absolutely right thing. I think he is going to be extremely well prepared for his dialog with the Chinese leaders. I personally believe that the Chinese can have some influence in tranquilizing the hostility between India and Pakistan. And when I say `tranquilizing,' I am talking about dampening their hostility toward each other ever so slightly. 
Mr. President, I said the other day to the Arkansas Bar Association that I believe religious extremism in any form is dangerous to our Nation and to the world. And the dispute between Pakistan and India is essentially a religious dispute between the Hindus and the Moslems. And if you look around the world--you look in Bosnia, they are all ethnically the same, but you have Catholics and you have Christians and you have Moslems. The Serbs are Russian Orthodox and Christian; and Croatia is essentially Catholic; and Bosnia is essentially Moslem. 
That is a volatile mix. Something close to 100,000 or 200,000 people have died as a result of the hostilities generated to a large extent to those religious differences. 
So if China can be a force in that part of the world to give the rest of us a little respite, a little better feeling about our ability to bring Pakistan and India together--I don't think it is unthinkable at all for a nuclear war to break out between those two nations; hostilities are intense--if China can do anything at all to `tranquilize' the situation, we ought to be bringing them right along and telling them `do everything you can.' 
I thought India's excuse for exploding a bomb, because they were afraid of China, was as transparent as Saran Wrap. China and India have always been enemies of a sort, but not nearly the intensity of the relationship between India and Pakistan, for example. In my opinion, they were looking for anything they could get ahold of to justify what they did, which is unforgivable. 
When I think about the population of China, I was there in 1978, and the population was 800 million. The population of China since 1978 has grown by 400 million people--140 million more than there are in the United States--which brings me to the second part of this sermon. 
Last night, I went downtown to receive a plaque from the Natural Resources Council which is an organization of 72 environmental groups. In my response, on a more serious note, I said I don't want to be the skunk at the lawn party, and I would like to think that I am a great environmentalist, but we talk about ozone depletion, we talk about global warming, we talk about building electric automobiles, and all of these things we are going to do to stop global warming from occurring. But the truth of the matter is we do not talk about the No. 1 environmental problem of the planet, and that is a population out of control. 
When I was a young 18-year-old recruit in the Marine Corps in World War II, this Nation had 130 million people. So in that period of time, from the time I was a raw recruit in the Marine Corps until today, we have increased our population by 138 million--268 million, compared to 130 million. At that same time, we had 30 million vehicles in the United States; today, we have 200 million vehicles. Estimates are that by the year 2050 we will have 400 million vehicles. My commute time from my home to the U.S. Senate in the 23 1/2 years I have been here has increased by 12 minutes. 
Today, we are taking 2.5 million acres of arable land that was previously used to grow food to feed ourselves and to export to a hungry world, out of cultivation every year and we are adding 2.5 million people to the population. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to understand that you have a train wreck coming. On top of that, our agricultural yields are becoming static. Soybean yields were up slightly last year, corn yields were flat; wheat yields that we have seen increase over the years are becoming static. We could, perhaps, put a lot more money into research and reverse that trend so that we get greater and greater yields, but isn't it amazing our priorities, when we spend $1.8 billion a year on agricultural research, and we send $40 billion a year down at the Pentagon for them to make things explode louder. 
Now, it is really tragic when you think about the problem of the population increase of the planet, not to say anything of the United States. By the year 2100, barring an epidemic or a pandemic, we are going to be standing shoulder to shoulder on this planet. Yes, people, by their very numbers, are polluters. We have to be fed. That means we use up our land. We have to be housed. That means we use up our resources to build houses. We have to be transported so we have to go in an automobile that puts a lot of noxious fumes into the atmosphere and uses up our resources at an exponential rate. On and on it goes. 
When you start talking about the problems of the population increase of the planet and what it means for our grandchildren--it makes me shudder to think about it. I must say I take strong exception to those who hold up our foreign aid spending to all of the countries who have family planning programs, when every single country that has a family planning program shows the abortion rate goes down. But I don't want to get into the abortion debate either. I am simply saying you can shove this problem under the rug, which we have been doing a magnificent job of for the last many years, or you can face up to it as China has tried to do. 
In 1978, when I was in China the last time, they had a family planning program going there. Since that time, it has worked partially in the big urban areas. It is not working in the rural areas. They still have a culture there that you have to have children to help you till the crops. You have to have children to help you do everything, so they keep having children. 
Mrs. Bumpers, just came back from Africa. She was over there trying to help Africans immunize their children. She was in Zimbabwe and the Ivory Coast. She said it was the most exhilarating experience she ever had in her life, watching mothers bring their babies through the hot sands and dust, into these clinics, 
where they were having what they called national immunization days. She began to give polio doses herself. She said it was the most gratifying experience she had ever had. 
She was amazed with some of the progress they are making in Africa. One of the things they have done on the Ivory Coast is cut the birth rate, with family planning, from six per woman to four. 
Now, here is a relatively primitive country called the Ivory Coast in Africa, which seems to have a better grip on what the real problems of the world are than we have. There is more to that. I don't want to take any more time, Mr. President. I have said all I can say about what I consider to be the real problems. One of the frustrating things is--and I don't say this with any degree of acrimony or bitterness at all, and it has been a great honor to be one of the less than 1,800 people who ever served in the U.S. Senate, and I will leave here with a heart full of gratitude, hopefully strengthened by great relationships with many colleagues. But I am disenchanted, to some extent, about our inability and our unwillingness to deal with some of the real problems. We do a great job of dealing with the politics of problems, but we have a tough time facing up to the fact that our children are not being well educated. 
I am dismayed when I think about the $50 billion or $60 billion surplus we are supposed to have at the end of this year and people are talking about tax cuts. I would not have any objection to that, Mr. President, if that tax cut went to the lower-income groups in this country who are still being relegated to last place. This is a personal opinion. One of the reasons the stock market has gone crazy in the last several years is because there is so much money floating around in this country, people have no choice but to invest it. They are not going to put it into T-bills when they can put it in Microsoft, or something else that will pay 20 to 30 percent, or even more, than a 6-percent bond will. But I can tell you that all of this money that exists in this country that people largely have made out of the stock market has not filtered down to the bottom 40 percent of the people in this country. 
I would vote for another minimum wage increase because every statistic I have seen has shown that, No. 1, you don't lose jobs--the traditional argument made against it--and, No. 2, this country is not going to be what it ought to be unless we bring other people up. Every statistic I have seen in the last year is that the rich are still getting richer and the poor, by comparison, are getting poorer. 
I would be hard-pressed to vote for a tax cut for the well-off when children are going to school all over Arkansas, being taught by teachers who go into teaching at an entry level of $20,000. Do you know what I think, Mr. President? I think teaching is the toughest job in America. I would rather clean the streets of Washington, DC, and carry garbage than teach school. One of the reasons I feel that way is because I married a schoolteacher and I know what they go through. It is the toughest job in the world. They go through 4 years of college and get a degree in education and go into the schools of my State at an entry level of $20,000. If they are lucky, the next year they will get a cost-of-living increase. 
My daughter, who is my pride and joy, is with a law firm downtown. She is not going to teach for $25,000 or $30,000 a year, and she would be a magnificent teacher. There are people all over the country--men and women--who would be great teachers, who are not going into the teaching profession because it simply doesn't pay enough. When you compound the fact--if you agree with me that it is the toughest job on earth--it surely doesn't pay enough. 
I was doing an interview this afternoon with a prominent author here in Washington who is writing a book. We were talking about the American people and what is going on. There is something going on in this country that nobody really quite understands. I don't. I probably wasn't very helpful to him because I didn't have any brilliant analysis of what is going on in the country. But I said, `I think the disenchantment is more a result of the way people feel that the educational system is failing them than anything else.' I also believe that television, which ought to be this magnificent medium of communicating and making our children so much smarter, is failing us miserably. 
Mr. President, I have gone from China to population to schoolteaching in all my meanderings here. But I can tell you there isn't anything wrong with this country that setting our priorities straight would not cure. Until we have an educated electorate, and until we provide an education for every child in this country, not just an education at the elementary and secondary level, but at the college level, until we make the commitment that every kid in this country gets a college education, or at least is not denied a college education for lack of money, don't talk to me about tax cuts. 
What makes a country great? What makes a country great is how well their people are educated and, therefore, how civil their people are to each other, what their conduct is. When I see people engaged in certain kinds of conduct you want to ask them, `Why are you doing that?' They do it because their parents or nobody else ever told them not to. I could sit here and list all day long the things that are my favorite pet peeves. I am always saying to Betty, `I wonder why that kid did that.' She says, `Because nobody ever told him better.' 
So Mr. President, I certainly am not giving up on this Nation. The people of this country are rhapsodic about one thing, and that is that we got our budget house in order. The fact that we have a surplus this year is nothing short of a miracle, and the people know it. But if we start spending it and squandering it instead of dealing with the problems we still have we will be back in trouble. The other day, Mr. President, you were in the Appropriations Committee when I made a short speech about what a tough time we had crafting this agriculture bill. 
I said, `You know we don't have any money to do much of anything.' 
A couple of weeks ago, I had a delegation come to me from the Mississippi River delta, the poorest part of my State. Four communities described graphically for me how, every time they have a heavy rain, sewage runs down the street and runs down the ditches. The health consequences of that are absolutely incalculable. I said, `I have looked high and low, looked everywhere in this budget, and every other budget, trying to find $2.8 million to alleviate this problem.' Because I made that speech there in the committee, I think I about got it solved. But I can tell you, that is going to be the greatest thing that has ever happened to those people in those communities. When I was a kid, we didn't understand why people died of typhoid fever in the summer because the outhouse was just 10 steps away from the water well. That is sort of the situation these people are living in. 
Mr. President, we have a lot of unmet needs in this country, and I am not voting for any tax cuts until we address those. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 1693, the `Vision 2020 National Parks System Restoration Act.' I want to commend Senator Thomas, the bill's author, for his efforts in bringing this bill to the floor. As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Historic Preservation and Recreation, he has been willing to compromise and work with all involved parties, including Secretary Babbitt, Senator Bennett, and me in an effort to enact a meaningful and comprehensive bill for our national parks. It has been a pleasure to work with him on this important legislation and I look forward its passage before I leave the Senate this year. I would also like to particularly thank Senator Bennett, who has once again been very helpful and constructive in developing a bill that can garner such broad bipartisan support, as I believe this bill has. 
Although this is a comprehensive bill that makes a number of positive changes in the way national parks are managed, for me, the most significant provisions are found in title IV--the National Park Service Concessions Management Improvement Act. 
Mr. President, for almost 19 years I have worked to reform the concessions policies of the National Park Service to increase competition, provide better services, and to ensure a better return for the American public. Over the past two decades, we have held dozens of hearings, and we've debated this issue in mark-ups and on the Senate floor. 
As you know, during the 103rd Congress Senator Bennett and I sponsored a bill which passed the Senate by a vote of 90-9, and passed in the House of Representatives with only minor changes by a vote of 368-30. Despite the overwhelming vote margins, we were unable to pass a final bill before the Congress adjourned. Given the magnitude of those votes, it is very frustrating to be here once again debating park concession reform. 
While I support passage of this bill and believe it will enhance the Park Service's ability to better manage our National Park System, the bill before us today is a real compromise between Senator Thomas and myself. The bill--particularly the concession title--does not contain all of the policy changes that I would like to see made. However, passage of this bill will finally allow the Park Service to have meaningful competition for park concession contracts. 
Most importantly, the bill will repeal the 1965 Concession Policy Act--a 30-year old anachronism--including its most anti-competitive provision, the granting to incumbent concessioners of a preferential right to renew their contract by simply matching the terms and conditions of a superior offer. 
Other important provisions in the concession reform title include: maintaining existing statutory protections for outfitter and guide contracts and small contracts with less than $500,000 in annual gross revenue; a prohibition against giving any concessioner a preferential right to provide new or additional services; and language linking the value of facilities built by a concessioner to actual construction costs, adjusted for inflation, rather than the `sound value' possessory interest allowed under current law. 
While the concession title has been of particular interest to me, the bill before us today includes several other titles which I believe will greatly enhance the Park Service's management authorities. The bill includes directives for the Park Service to improve career development and training for its employees and to establish a strong scientific research program in national parks. It codifies criteria for the Park Service to use in evaluating areas proposed for addition to the National Park System. It gives the Park Service much needed authority to collect and retain fees for commercial filming activities in national park units, and it extends the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program for park fees for another six years. The bill also will allow the Park Service to develop and market annual park admission passports to increase public awareness about parks and to raise new revenues. There are a few other titles included in the bill, but those are the most significant provisions. 
Mr. President, the concession reform provisions in this bill are a great step forward for the National Park Service and the taxpayers. I strongly support these and the other provisions in this legislation, and I hope my colleagues will join me in helping to pass this bill.

 Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a long time friend, Ross Pendergraft. He was a good and decent man who helped make his community and State a better place. I extend my condolences to his family and friends, but especially his lovely wife Donnie. 
Ross passed away Sunday at the age of 72 in Fort Smith, Arkansas, a city he called home and where he was a former executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Donrey Media Group, which owns five fine newspapers in my State and more than fifty nationwide. Donrey owes its great success in a tough business in large part to the efforts of Ross Pendergraft. 
I knew Ross long before I entered public life. He was a man of great personal integrity and professional accomplishment. He was a man of wit, humor, and compassion who made a deep impact on the life of his community. He will be terribly missed by those in the newspaper business and by the thousands people whose lives he touched not only in Fort Smith but throughout Arkansas. 
Born in Abbott, Arkansas, Ross was a World War II veteran, and attended Arkansas Tech University at Russellville on the GI Bill, like so many of us did. In 1948 he joined the advertising staff of the Southwest Times-Record newspaper in Fort Smith, and so began his rise through the ranks of the Donrey organization. In 1961 he was named general manager of the Times-Record and by 1990 he oversaw all Donrey newspapers in the continental U.S. and Hawaii. Three times he was named `Man of the Year' by the Arkansas Press Association. 
But he also found the time and energy to serve his community. He was the first vice chairman of the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation, a charitable trust. He was a chairman of the Fort Smith United Way, a president of the city's Chamber of Commerce, a former member of the Arkansas Highway Commission, and he served on the Arkansas Action Committee as well as countless other civic and charitable organizations. 
Ross worked tirelessly to get better roads in western Arkansas and to promote economic development in Fort Smith, which is now among the fastest growing regions in the United States. 
Though Ross was a man who oversaw more than 50 newspapers and bought newsprint and printers ink by the ton, he was never one to seek the limelight or use his position for personal aggrandizement. So many of his good works took place quietly, behind the scenes, out of the public eye. He was a man who loved his family, loved his community, and loved the newspaper business. And while my State is diminished by his loss, it has been and will continue to be enriched by the work that he did, the causes he served and the example he set.

Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Chair for reminding me. 
Madam President, this amendment repeals a provision in the immigration laws that was a tragic mistake when it was enacted. My amendment to strike that provision deals with economics, it deals with patriotism, it deals with immigration, and it deals with fraud. In order for my colleagues to understand precisely what we are talking about, let me set the stage. I fought this battle in 1989 and, at the expense of sounding a little self-serving, lost, but predicted what has happened would happen. 
The immigration bill considered by the Senate in 1989 included a provision of the bill to increase investment because we were headed into a recession. We decided we would take a page out of the play books of Canada and Australia. We thought, if they can sell citizenship for $200,000, citizenship in the United States ought to be worth at least $1 million. It is a very logical assumption. So, we said, in that bill in 1989, we will reserve 4,800 visas for foreigners who wants to come into this Nation and bring $1 million and hire 10 people: We will give you a green card at the end of 2 years, and, at the end of an additional 3 years, we will make you a citizen of the United States. 
Then in the conference committee we decided we could do even better than that. We said: You don't have to bring $1 million dollars; bring $500,000. If you put a hamburger joint up that will hire 10 people in an area of high unemployment or in a rural area, we will do the same thing for you. We cut the price of citizenship from $1 million to $500,000 and the 4,800 slots that we reserved in the Senate bill increased to 10,000 in the conference report. 
Multiply $1 million by 10,000 visas and just think of all the magnificent investment we would have in this country and how many jobs we would create. 
Madam President, that `ain't' all. We said not only will you not really have to create 10 jobs with your $500,000 or your $1 million, you only have to maintain 10 jobs. What does that mean? If old Joe's hamburger joint is about to go out of business and he has 10 employees and you are willing to buy his place and keep those 10 employees working, you have maintained 10 jobs, so you qualify for American citizenship. 
Then in 1993 we decided we would liberalize it a little further. Not only do you not have to create 10 jobs, not only do you not have to maintain 10 jobs, all you have to do is indirectly provide 10 jobs if you invest in businesses located in certain areas known as Regional Centers . What does that mean? You are making widgets. You employ five people to make widgets. You have two people to distribute them and three people to sell them. Those are indirectly created jobs. Therefore, you get your green card at the end of 2 years, and you get your citizenship papers at the end of 5 years. 
I can remember at that time how we thought Hong Kong was going to flood this Nation with people with $1 million in their pocket because they were terrified of the Chinese taking over Hong Kong. I must say, the program, such as it is, has been mostly of people from the Pacific rim--Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan. 
Madam President, do you know the nice thing about this? If you have $500,000 to invest, bring the little wife and kids, too, you are all welcome. They are also going to ultimately be entitled to citizenship. 
What have been the results? Madam President, a cottage industry of consultants and limited partnerships has grown up in this Nation. No plan the U.S. Congress has ever devised has been scam-proof, and God knows this one is no exception. What do these consultants do? Why, they advertise in the newspapers in Hong Kong, in Oman, in Taiwan, and they say, `You don't even need $500,000, you don't need $1 million, you only need $100,000.' We have gone from $1 million to $500,000 to $100,000. We have gone from creating jobs to maintaining jobs to indirectly providing jobs. It is incredible what has happened to this program. 
How do they get by with this? These consultants form limited partnerships. They get several of these people who have $100,000 and they pool all those $100,000 contributions from various people. 
What about the $500,000 requirement? How are you going to put up $100,000 and meet that? Easy. You give a promissory note for $400,000. You give $100,000 in cash--incidentally, there is a little matter of a $35,000 to $50,000 fee that goes to the consultant. So if you come, you ought to have $150,000 in your pocket, $50,000 for the consultant and $100,000 to show your good faith, and then be willing to sign a note for $400,000. But not to worry. At the end of 2 years, your note is forgiven. Forget the $400,000 note. If you are in the $1 million class, forget the $900,000 note. And if, at the end of 2 years, the business has not done well, shut it down. When you shut it down, you can go down to the courthouse and apply for your citizenship 3 years later. You do not have to maintain the business for the ensuing 3 years to get your citizenship. Shut that sucker down after 2 years; it has probably been a loser anyway. 
Madam President, Russell Burgoise was quoted in an April 13, 1998 New York Times article. He is a spokesman for the Immigration Service. He said: `These plans don't meet either the spirit or the letter of the law.' 
Recently, when the INS sought to revoke up to 5,000 visas, the New York Times in the same article said `influential Members of Congress protested the Government was changing rules in midstream,' and the INS backed off. 
Late in 1997, the Times of Oman, not a widely read paper in Washington, contained an advertisement which said: `U.S. green card for anyone who can show U.S. $500,000.' 
They ought to be prosecuted for misleading advertising. It doesn't take $500,000, just $100,000 would do fine if you know the right consultant in this country. 
It is an interesting thing that it took these consultants and these limited partnerships to figure out how to get the program going. Until the latter part of 1996, the investor visa program had been an even worse disaster than its worst critics--namely me--had predicted. Nobody was showing much interest. 
In 1992, 280 people applied, 240 were approved. In 1993, 384; 1994, 407; 1995, 291; 1996, 616; in 1997, 1,110. The consultants are getting geared up now. It is still a far cry from the 10,000 slots available, but in 1997, 1,110 petitions were approved. But over the last 7 years, only 3,284 have been approved. 
So, despite the fact that the program has been weakened unbelievably to make almost anybody eligible for it, nobody much has been applying. Out of 7 years, we only got 3,000-plus, and we are supposed to be doing 10,000 each year. 
AIS, one of the consulting organizations I mentioned a moment ago, specializes, as I said, in pooling investors to bankroll larger products. 
Now you should know that a lot of people invest their $100,000 not to become American citizens; they come here because they want to purchase citizenship for their children and educate them here. Or they come here for any host of other reasons. Maybe they are actually coming with their family. That would be a fairly laudable purpose. But they do not come because they want citizenship. And a lot of people will freely tell you the reason they did not want to be citizens of the United States is because they will have to pay taxes. They have to pay taxes on all of their income all over the world wherever it may come from. They are not about to do that. They only have to come here twice a year to keep their eligibility for the green card. 
AIS has advertised `Alternate residency: Less restrictive and expensive than other plans in other countries.' You are not becoming a citizen of the United States. You do not have to love the flag. You do not have to say the Pledge of Allegiance. You do not have to fight our wars. You do not have to be any particular age. You do not have to have any specialized education. You do not have to have any experience. You do not have to know the language. All you need is `green.' You do not have to know anything about the poor and huddled masses that Emma Lazarus wrote about. 
Madam President, this program is so rife with fraud. In some instances, you can get your entire $500,000 back. If you invest $500,000 or $1 million, there are some plans under which you can get it all back and still get your citizenship. 
Harold Ezell, a former INS regional immigration commissioner--now a lawyer in Newport Beach, CA--this is a former INS official's quote. What did he say about Congress, about this bill? `They were smoking something when they wrote it.' `We've shot ourselves in the foot.' Another attorney said, `You know, since we're blatantly soliciting the wealthy, we might ought to charge $2 million.' 
Madam President, the investor visa program makes no economic sense either. The underlying bill we are debating today would raise the cap on the number of workers who will come into this country who have skills, principally for the computer industry. 
The Senator from Michigan, who is handling this bill on the floor, wants to raise the annual limit on people coming into this country from 60,000 to 95,000. Now, you think about the incongruity of raising the level of people we invite into this country because they have a skill and because we have a labor shortage. We would not do it otherwise. We have a labor shortage of so-called skilled workers. At least, that is the proposition. I do not believe it, and I am not going to vote for the bill. I will announce that right now. 
This country, incidentally, as great as we are, to be depending on the rest of the world to send us their skilled workers so we can stay afloat in the computer industry, or whatever, is the height of something or other. If we have a $50 billion surplus looming this year, for Pete's sake, let us educate our youngsters so we do not have to depend on anybody else for these skills. That should not be too difficult. 
But here we are saying we want to invite an additional 35,000 laborers into this country because we have a labor shortage, and at the same time saying, `If you will give us $100,000 or $500,000'--whichever the case may be--`and hire 10 people, we'll give you citizenship.' 
There is an outfit in West Virginia called InterBank, and they want to create a telemarketing business. While the deal has not been approved yet, the wages will be $6 an hour. I have not seen a McDonald's in I don't know how long that didn't have a sign in the window saying, `Help wanted. Pay up to $6 an hour.' We are desperate for workers at all levels in this country, and here we are asking people to put up money and come into this country and hire workers. How silly can we get? Even if it were not rife with fraud, even if it were not shameless to be selling American citizenship, it makes no economic sense. It is an oxymoron to vote at the same time to bring 95,000 workers in and ask somebody else to come in and hire more workers. 
Every time Alan Greenspan appears on a television station, every time he appears before the Banking Committee, every time he appears before the Joint Economic Committee, Wall Street and all of America holds its breath for fear he is going to announce an increase in interest rates. And why are they afraid he is going to raise interest rates? Because they have a labor shortage. In Economic 101 at the University of Arkansas, I was taught--and it is still a fundamental economic principle--that when you have a labor shortage, you have to pay more for labor. You think McDonald's is paying $6 an hour because they want to see how far they can exceed the minimum wage? They are paying $6 an hour because they cannot find workers for any less than that. That is still a pitiful wage, but be that as it may, I am not here to debate that. 
What I am saying is, everybody is scared to death that this labor shortage is going to kick wages up, that in turn is going to create inflation, and inflation is going to cause Alan Greenspan to raise interest rates, and raising interest rates is going to bring the longest sustained period of economic prosperity in the United States to a grinding halt. These are not things that you have to be a rocket scientist to understand. Everybody knows precisely what I am talking about. 
Finally, Madam President--and I am reluctant to say this because I am not one who has stood on the floor of the U.S. Senate and waved the flag and beat my chest and talked about what a great patriot I am. I put in 3 years in the Marine Corps in World War II, for a very simple reason--we were in a war where the absolute freedom of this Nation was at stake. Not even a second thought about it. And 25, 30 other million men and women did the same thing. 
I have voted against constitutional amendments on flag burning. Nobody is more deeply offended than I am to see an American flag burn. There are ways to deal with it. But you do not need to tinker with the Bill of Rights for the first time in more than 200 years. 
I still get goose bumps at a military parade when Old Glory goes by. And I am offended by a law which puts American citizenship up for bid by either the wealthy or those willing to participate in a fraud. 
How crassly we demean this precious blessing we call citizenship. Emma Lazarus who wrote those magnificent words in the Statue of Liberty about, `Give us your poor, your tired, your huddled masses,' Emma Lazarus must be whirling in her grave to even hear such a debate as this going on. 
The families of the people whose sons and daughters fought those wars for citizenship and freedom--and the families of those who died, and they did it because they valued citizenship so highly--must be weeping at the thought of citizenship being sold to the highest bidder. It is vulgar. How we champion citizenship that we once prized so highly. 
Madam President, these people are not the poor. They are not the huddled masses who were our ancestors and who came here for freedom to contribute their labor and their values to live, live free, and to raise their families and die here, even in battle, if need be. 
These people who we welcome for $1 million are coming twice a year because that is the only way they can keep their green card. They don't want citizenship because that would require them to pay taxes. 
What in the name of God has happened to this place? 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Before the Senator leaves, let me say how much I appreciate his very kind and complimentary remarks in his opening statement, and to say that I value his friendship very highly. He and I have been close friends for many years. We were both Governors and we relate in that way. His uncle used to be Governor of my State. I must say to the Senator from West Virginia that I wonder what has happened since 1989 when he voted with me on precisely the same amendment, and his vote now after the INS says we must have been smoking something when we passed the bill in the first place?

Mr. BUMPERS. Would the Senator answer one additional question? First of all, I come from a poor State, too. In Arkansas, our teachers' salaries are 45th in the Nation. I don't know where we are economically; it's in that vicinity. I relate to the poverty you have described in southern West Virginia. Yet, I have to say I believe that if I could communicate the remarks I made a moment ago in offering this amendment to the people of my State--and there are plenty of areas in the Mississippi Delta where we are desperate for jobs, and this may be a gross exaggeration--I believe 90 percent of the people of my State would agree that it is wrong to be selling citizenship like this. They might be willing to accept tax credits to attract foreign investment. They might be willing to do all kinds of things that you and I did as Governor to try to attract industry into our States. But I believe that people in my State would take a very dim view if they knew, No. 1, the amount of fraud that has now been uncovered in the program; and, No. 2, the fact that we are selling citizenship in exchange for a few bucks from some of the wealthy people in other countries just to come here and get citizenship. Don't you think there is something a little crass about that?

Mr. BUMPERS. I had a question. I wanted the Senator to give me a full and complete answer according to his beliefs. 
Let me make one other observation. The other day, the Appropriations Subcommittee on HUD-VA very graciously invited me over to question Dan Goldin, who is, as the Senator knows, the Administrator of NASA. And, as the Senator knows, I am opposed to the space station. I know the Senator is strongly in favor of the space station. But I asked Mr. Goldin about the $6.8 billion overrun that has just been announced. It has not been built. It is not deployed and operating. It is a 43-percent cost overrun. I said, `Mr. Goldin, is there any threshold beyond which you would not be willing to go to build the space station?' He said he had not thought about it. 
If somebody asked me desperately, `We want jobs in Arkansas'--and as much as I want to do something about the delta area of my State, there is a threshold beyond which I would not be willing to cross. That would be to sell citizenship to a bunch of takers and not givers.

Mr. BUMPERS. I am quoting a newspaper article. 
I will answer the next question. This is an op-ed piece in a West Virginia newspaper. 
Yesterday the United States was selling citizenship. The program was supposed to spur job creation. The investors have the money to spend, and the benefits are worth it to them. Is it fair to open a door to citizenship but let only the rich pass through? Of course not. But that is what is done. Now there are new problems. Years after the program was established companies began springing up to pool investments and people seeking those visa. A Virginia firm called the InterBank Group plans to use some of that capital to build two telemarketing centers in southern West Virginia.' 
That is what the Senator alluded to in his comments. 
They say: 
The InterBank ran into trouble in California where the Department of Corporations in March indicated that the company was luring investors who had no way of knowing that their investment would qualify them for a visa. InterBank says it was all a misunderstanding and is being worked out. Meanwhile, INS is 
reexamining the foreign investment deal, including InterBank, and hoping to set up stricter rules. InterBank maintains its deal should pass muster and is going ahead with the telemarketing centers. But the money is tied up until INS makes a call. That the visa program has run into trouble shouldn't be a shock to anyone. It is just too tempting with all of that money, and all of those communities are grateful for any investment.

Mr. BUMPERS. Let me just say to the Senator from West Virginia that there isn't a Senator in the U.S. Senate for whom I have greater respect and hopefully a warmer friendship and whose opinions I value highly. I tell you, I have been in that position many, many times where I simply disagreed with somebody who couldn't understand why I disagreed with them. And the Senator is a great champion for the people of West Virginia. The jobs situation in West Virginia is paramount to him, more than almost anything else in that State; that is, trying to improve the quality of life for people. I certainly would not ever suggest anything to the contrary. It is just that I would be willing to provide jobs for the people of West Virginia by attracting foreign investments with tax credits and anything under the shining sun, except offering them citizenship. There is just something crass about that that really hits me right here. That is the only difference we have.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, some of this information is really strange to me. It is things I never heard before. The Immigration and Naturalization Service is the one who said, first, that we must have been smoking something when we passed this law, and, second, that we shot ourselves in the foot. And now they say that this program cannot be monitored. 
The law does require the INS, incidentally, to study the background of these people. You think about that. And the INS says that is utterly impossible. This can be drug money. Any guy who has run drugs in Colombia or wherever can come to this country, put up $100,000, and pretend that he is creating jobs and get himself a green card in 2 years. 
Hold a hearing in the Judiciary Committee and ask the INS how well they are monitoring this program? They will tell you they don't even come close to having the personnel to monitor this program, or the background of the people who are coming in, the background of those who are putting the money up. Of course they can't. They can't stop the hoards crossing the border from Mexico into the United States. They can't stop the hoards coming into our airports. How do you expect them to do background checks to determine whether or not this money that they do put up, which is about 20 percent or 10 percent of the required amount, how do you expect them to be able to determine whether that is drug money or not? Whether the guy is an escaped convict or not? Whether he is simply coming to educate his children and comes here long enough to set the thing up and goes back to Korea or Hong Kong or Taiwan or wherever. Most all of these people are coming from the Pacific rim. 
When I say that, I say that advisedly. They are not coming at all. They are coming to visit and then they are going home. They are buying what is advertised by AIS, the biggest limited partnership who deals in these things; they are buying American citizenship and they are buying an alternate residence. 
Mr. President, let me say one other thing in response to the statement of the Senator from Massachusetts. Pedro Martinez gets a permit to come here for a certain number of days and then he has to go back to the Dominican Republic? Other players, such as Livan Hernandez, of Cuba, came here because he was a baseball pitcher and because he was willing to get in a boat and risk his life, I suppose. Was he one of those? Let me ask the Senator from Massachusetts, was Livan Hernandez one of the boat people that they rescued?

Give that guy a chance to become an American citizen. That is the way our ancestors came. They took risks to get here. They would do anything in the world--to fight and scratch and claw to get here. And people still do. 
So what are we doing? We are not rewarding them. We are taking up some of the immigration slots in this country with this scam, one of the biggest scams ever perpetrated by the U.S. Congress deliberately.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, if I may respond to that, that is exactly what the INS says. They cannot monitor this program. They don't have the people to monitor it. They don't know whether they are staying or not. 
But if you talk to these people running these limited partnerships and consulting firms who are the people really making money out of this--you have to pay them $50,000 up front to pull this scam off. And INS will tell you that they cannot monitor the very question, the very point that the Senator from Massachusetts makes. They are not complying with any of these laws. INS will tell you some of them are and some of them aren't, but they cannot monitor it. The law is bad and the enforcement is impossible.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, in 1989 this body adopted a provision that said anybody who will invest $500,000 or $1 million in this country and create or maintain 10 jobs can get a green card for 2 years and, 3 years later, have American citizenship. The program never took off, and since that time a cottage industry has grown up of people who were advertising in Taiwan and Oman and saying: `$100,000 is all you need. You give us a $400,000 promissory note, you still get your green card.' The INS says it is impossible to monitor. You don't know where these people are coming from; you don't know where their money is coming from. 
Mr. President, what we are doing allowing this to continue --and the INS says it is a disaster--is cheapening American citizenship. You want foreign investment? Give them tax breaks. Do not--do not--cheapen American citizenship. These are not the tired, these are not the poor, these are not the huddled masses. These are people from Hong Kong, Korea, the Pacific rim, who don't even come here; they send $100,000. They don't even want our citizenship, because they have to pay taxes. 
It is a terrible, shameful thing. It is downright vulgar. I plead with you, vote to strike that provision from the bill.

Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I recently introduced S. 1968, the Telephone Privacy Act. This bill, which has bipartisan support, has nothing to do with Linda Tripp or anybody else. 
I first proposed legislation regarding telephone privacy in 1984 when it was revealed that Charles Wick, who was head of the United States Information Agency, had tape-recorded President Reagan and President Carter and several Cabinet officials 84 times without their knowledge. 
Can you remember when you were a kid and you used to listen to telephone conversations? The announcer would call somebody or somebody would call in because they had the answer to a question, and you would hear beeping in the background. In those days, that was a sign that you were being recorded. Somewhere along the line, that practice was discontinued. Today, you can tape-record your very best friend and not tell that friend and hand it to all three networks for use on the evening news and no federal crime has been committed. 
Not too long ago, Attorney General Reno testified before the Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Justice, Commerce, on which I sit. At that time, we were working on this bill, and I asked her about it. She said, `Well, Florida already has such a law that makes it a criminal offense to tape-record a conversation without telling somebody.' 
I said, `How long have they had the law?' 
She said, `Since around 1970.' 
I said, `Were you the prosecutor in Dade County at the time that happened?' 
She said she was. 
I said, `Well, how did you feel about the bill when it was being debated?' 
She said, `I favored it.' 
As usual, Congress doesn't get the message until after the States have acted--16 States have already enacted legislation almost identical to S. 1968 , and here we sit still allowing people to invade our privacy, the most fundamental privacy when people have their guard down the most, by tape-recording conversations which can later be used for any purpose they choose. It is not an offense, and it ought to be. 
I hope that some of my colleagues who may be listening will go back and look at my full remarks that were entered in the Record at the time I introduced that bill.

Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, on a separate matter, I want to inform my colleagues that I am also working on legislation that will require prosecutors, before they ask for an indictment, to also give the grand jury any exculpatory evidence they may possess. 
Prosecutors, as I previously outlined in some detail, have such an advantage, such an upper hand. Some of it is legitimate, and some of it is not. As one New York judge said, `A grand jury will indict a ham sandwich' if the prosecutor asked them to. 
I had a prosecutor tell me one time, `This is the best grand jury I ever saw; it indicted everybody I asked them to indict.' Of course they indicted everybody. They are putty in his hands. 
I will just give you an illustration of the kind of case that I am trying to get at. 
Let's assume that you are a prosecutor and you are getting ready to ask the grand jury to indict somebody for capital murder. Assume further that all the testimony that has been taken in that case said that the man who pulled the trigger and committed the murder was wearing a green jacket. 
Assume further that the prosecutor has had information come to him personally, though it has never been presented to the grand jury, that it was, in fact, a red jacket. 
I am making a rather extreme case here, but I ask you, in the spirit of elemental fairness, do you believe that the prosecutor, before he asks somebody to go on trial and possibly end up in the electric chair, is beholden in any way to tell the grand jury of totally exculpatory evidence that he may have in his possession? 
There is a Supreme Court decision, the name of which I forget, in which the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the prosecutor is absolutely under no compulsion to tell the grand jury of any exculpatory evidence in his possession. If that isn't a betrayal of everything that we Americans believe, including fundamental fairness, if that is not a betrayal of everything I was taught in law school, I cannot think of a more egregious case. 
Madam President, one of the reasons we have not had these debates in the past is because the crime rate in this country was soaring. And everybody was in a put-them-in-jail and throw-away-the-key mode. But I wanted my colleagues to stop and just reflect for a moment. God knows, I am not suggesting any guilty person should go free, but you heard that old story: Better that 1,000 guilty people go free than one innocent person be convicted. 
I did not do very much criminal trial work when I practiced law. I used to take maybe one case a year just so I would have to stay boned up on what the Supreme Court had ruled on, mostly rules of evidence and defendants' rights. And, yes, I defended a man one time that in my own mind I felt sure was guilty and the jury acquitted him. That sounds terrible to a lot of people who do not understand the criminal justice system. Everybody is entitled to a trial. 
So all I am saying is the crime rates are coming down. People ought to be in a little more circumspect mood about what the Founding Fathers meant. The most important thing I said in my former remarks a moment ago about the bill I am introducing today is that the law is supposed to be a shield as well as a sword. It is supposed to protect the liberty of people in this country as well as to prosecute the guilty. It also has an obligation to defend and free the innocent. So that is all these proposals I am making are calculated to do; keep a firm commitment to our elemental belief in fairness, in the rights of the innocent and, yes, to prosecute and convict the guilty. 
Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I am today introducing legislation which will remedy a longstanding injustice in our criminal justice system by granting to grand jury witnesses the right to the presence of counsel when testifying before the grand jury. 
In our legal system, the right to counsel is fundamental. Every person, no matter how guilty or innocent, deserves to have an advocate. So fundamental is this right to counsel that it was recognized by the founders and enshrined in the sixth amendment to the Constitution. Along with the right to an impartial jury, public trial, and the right to confront witnesses, it is a universal element of fundamental fairness recognized by every civilized system of justice. Lawyers may never be popular, said William Shakespeare in Henry VI, Act III Scene II: `The first we do, let's kill all the lawyers.' 
But lawyers are a necessity. No one in his right mind wants to confront the judicial system without the benefit of a lawyer. 
The Anglo-American criminal justice system has given us more freedom and better justice than any country in the history of civilization. The rights of American citizens evolved over centuries of English and American history are now enshrined in the Bill of Rights and are the standards of freedom and liberty all over the world. 
We must not allow those rights to be eroded. No American would claim that our system is perfect, nor do I so claim. I am convinced beyond a doubt that our system has serious flaws, one of which most people are probably not even aware and many might find hard to believe in this day and age. A witness summoned before a grand jury has no right to the presence of his lawyer in the grand jury room. Depriving anybody of the right to counsel is fundamentally wrong. No person should be required to face any part of the criminal justice system without the presence of his or her lawyer if he or she chooses. 
Think of it this way. Police have absolutely no right to question an arrestee without his lawyer in the room unless the individual waives that right. The police even have a constitutional duty under the Miranda decision to advise people of their rights to a lawyer, even though anybody who has watched television in the last 35 years ought to know that they are entitled to a lawyer. If the police fail to observe this constitutional requirement, the statement by the accused is inadmissible in court. 
But when an ordinary citizen is called before a grand jury, no lawyer--no lawyers are allowed to be present. The prosecutor and the grand jury have the unlimited ability to question the witness, who is not even under arrest, without an attorney present. This gross inconsistency can only be described as Byzantine, an anachronism. 
I have never been one to say that criminal defendants have too many rights. They have no more than the Constitution entitles them. In this instance, however, a criminal defendant has more rights than the average ordinary citizen called before a grand jury. A criminal defendant cannot be questioned without a lawyer present, and he or she may invoke his or her right not to testify under the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. 
But a witness, a witness in the grand jury room who may later become a target under criminal investigation, has no such rights. He or she must testify fully and truthfully, no matter how burdensome or embarrassing or impertinent or irrelevant the questions may be, and without the assistance of counsel. The rules of evidence which normally require that questions be relevant and material do not apply in the grand jury room. On the contrary, so-called `fishing expeditions' have become commonplace. No matter how irrelevant or outrageous the questions, the witness must answer. 
Madam President, I ask you or any American to consider whether, if you or your son or daughter were served a subpoena to testify before the grand jury on a criminal case, even though the grand jury is supposedly investigating somebody else, would you want the right to have your own lawyer in the room? Would you feel the process was a fair one if you were told that you were not legally entitled to have a lawyer present? What if you or your loved one were called before the grand jury for a second, third, or fourth time? Would you begin to feel that you might be under suspicion for something? And would you feel comfortable answering endless questions without your lawyer present? 
The grand jury is the only circumstance I can imagine in life where a free person does not have a complete legal right to hire a lawyer and have that lawyer accompany him in any kind of proceeding. No matter how serious the matter under consideration, no matter what the question--from the most 
complex matter of tax accounting to the most personal, intimate family concerns--no matter how hazy your recollection might be, you have no right to a lawyer before the grand jury. The grand jury room is the one and only room in the courthouse, the very temple of justice, where the proceeding is entirely one-sided. 
Under existing law, there could be a sign on the grand jury room saying, `No lawyers allowed.' The Government has as many lawyers as the Treasury can pay. The witness has zero. Notwithstanding that he or she may be there against his or her will, notwithstanding the power of the grand jury and the prosecutor to indict, a witness before a grand jury is defenseless. He or she has no friend in the room. Surely, nobody feels so alone as a grand jury witness, knowing that the weight of the Federal criminal justice system rests on his or her every word. Give the wrong answer, you can be accused of perjury, obstruction of justice, or any other of a number of crimes. If you refuse to answer, you can go directly to jail without benefit of a trial, being held in contempt. 
Madam President, I ask you to consider, What kind of atmosphere is created in this one-sided proceeding? Is it one of fairness or is it one of intimidation? Bear in mind that there is no limit on the number of times a person may be called to testify before the same grand jury. In recent news reports--we have all read them--some people have been called to testify for the fifth or sixth time--no lawyer allowed--before the same grand jury. If you were in this position, or a member of your family were, how would you feel about being called for the sixth time to testify without your lawyer present? Would you feel threatened or intimidated? And this kind of proceeding not only does not provide justice and fairness, it doesn't even provide the appearance of justice and fairness, which is essential if citizens are to have confidence in our criminal justice system. 
This system needs changing. The bill I am introducing is a modest proposal to give some balance to a very unlevel playing field. The main purpose of the original grand jury was probably helping in the collection of taxes. These ancient roots precede even the right to jury trial, because in the earliest times, trial was by ordeal. The accused was required to put his hand in boiling water or was tested by drowning. Needless to say, there weren't very many acquittals. 
The grand jury has always symbolized the power of the criminal justice system to bring any person before the bar of justice. No one is beyond the power of the grand jury to seek evidence and to indict if there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. Even before the right to trial by jury was secured, English grand juries had power to investigate and to accuse. Composed of ordinary citizens, grand juries had the power to compel any person to appear and give testimony or evidence. Historically, the grand jury was a guarantor of liberty--a guarantor of liberty. 
The courts have often stated that the grand jury has a dual function. Listen to this. The courts have said that the grand jury has a dual function, `to clear the innocent, no less than to bring to trial those who may be guilty.' The grand juries exist `as a means of protecting the citizen against unfounded accusation, whether it comes from the government, or be prompted by partisan passion or private enmity.' 
We just saw what private enmity is when somebody tried to set up Howard Baker in a tax fraud case. 
The Founding Fathers so respected the institution that they enshrined the right to indictment by a grand jury in the sixth amendment to the Constitution. Here it is:  
No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, [and that has been interpreted many times to mean a felony] unless on presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger * * *. 
That is amendment 5 to the Constitution. The grand jury should be both a sword and a shield, a powerful tool in the hands of prosecutors and a defender of liberty by protecting against meritless or overzealous prosecutions. 
In colonial America, a grand jury in Boston helped signal the beginning of the end of colonial government when the jurors refused the Government's request to indict the Stamp Act rioters. In modern times, however, the grand jury has become almost exclusively a sword and not a shield. Examples of the grand jury as a shield are hard to come by. In short, we have allowed the protection intended by the founders to take a 180-degree turn. 
The Supreme Court has conceded that the grand jury does not always serve its intended purpose of protecting the innocent. This is what the Supreme Court said in U.S. v. Dionisio: 
The grand jury may not always serve its historic role as a protective bulwark standing solidly between the ordinary citizen and an overzealous prosecutor. 
Those were the words of Justice Douglas. Douglas said in dissent in that case--he was much more explicit: 
It is, indeed, common knowledge that the grand jury, having been conceived as a bulwark between the citizen and the government, is now a tool of the Executive. 
Despite its ancient origins, the grand jury remains one of the most controversial aspects of our judiciary system. Most States have abandoned or abolished grand juries in favor of the filing of information by prosecutors. That is the way we do it in my home State of Arkansas. Many would argue that the grand jury is an anachronism which costs more than it is worth. In one of the most famous critiques of the institution, the Chief Judge of the State of New York stated that most grand juries would `indict a ham sandwich' if the prosecutor requested it. 
While some have argued for eliminating the grand jury, I am not one to second-guess the wisdom of our Founding Fathers. Rather, I believe we should make the system work as intended--as a protector of freedom--by reforming the grand jury system so as to ensure due process of law for all concerned. 
In the 1970s, there was considerable debate in Congress over the merits of the grand jury following revelations of abuses of the system under the Nixon administration. There has been no serious congressional debate over the grand jury system for over 10 years. The time for that debate has come. 
Over 30 years ago, the Supreme Court said in Gideon v. Wainwright that counsel must be appointed for those who cannot afford a lawyer before any criminal trial in which a prison sentence may result. 
The bill I am introducing today is a logical extension of the sixth amendment to the Constitution, as well as the fifth amendment's promise of due process of law. Granted, a witness before a grand jury is not under immediate threat of indictment, but most of them are there against their will, and they are certainly looking over the abyss. 
Let me emphasize that my bill, although a departure from historical practice, is still a modest proposal. This bill would not in any way change criminal procedure except for allowing a witness' lawyer to be present in the grand jury room. The lawyer would not be allowed to speak to the jury or to examine witnesses. He or she would be able to advise his or her client and no more. 
Allowing the mere presence of a witness' lawyer will in no way disrupt or slow the grand jury proceedings. What it might do is to deter a prosecutor from doing something improper simply because he knows there is no other lawyer watching. It may give a witness some comfort to be able to ask his or her lawyer for advice before answering a complex question. That right is provided today, but the witness has to go outside the courtroom to see his or her counselor because the counsel is not allowed in the grand jury room. 
My bill will thus allow for grand juries to operate more smoothly and efficiently, reducing the need to stop proceedings so the witness can go out of the room and talk to his or her lawyer. 
This bill goes to the very reason lawyers exist. It may give the public more confidence that the proceedings are fair and balanced at a time when public confidence in the judicial system is about as low as it has ever been. If any of these purposes are met, my legislation will have served a noble purpose. 
Mr. President, I hope that all Senators will take note of this bill and that they will support it. It will be referred to the Judiciary Committee, and I hope that the committee will schedule hearings very promptly.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first of all, let me say that I have listened rather attentively to the debate the past 3 days. It has all been heartfelt. A lot of it has been very thoughtful. I think it has been instructive for the Senate to hear this debate. 
I spent a lot of time reading a lot of articles, doing a lot of research and trying to reach a conclusion that I felt not only was correct, but one that I would feel very comfortable with not just today but in future years. 
I have heard a lot of people say the average man on the street in Russia does not really care about NATO expansion. I agree with that. He or she doesn't care about it right now, just as the American people are not zeroed in on partial-birth abortion right now. But you wait until October and November comes and all those 30-second spots start appearing on television, and those awful, barbaric films are shown just before the election, and you will find that virtually everybody in America cares about that issue. And when the election in Russia is held in the year 2000, you can rest assured the hard-liners are going to have a picnic. 
Mr. President, I have read a number of times that we should not let the Russian hard-liners dictate our foreign policy. I agree with that. By the same token, I do not think we ought to gratuitously allow the Russian hard-liners to dictate internal policy in Russia as well as foreign policy to come. 
I am one who believes that peace on the Eurasian Continent and probably in the world is dependent on our engaging Russia over the next several years. I do not denigrate any of the arguments for ratification. I think a lot of the arguments are very compelling for expanding NATO. But when I weigh what I believe will be the cost sometime in the future compared to the benefits, I believe the cost is likely to far outweigh the benefits. 
What do we get out of it? Not NATO but the United States. How are we enriched? How is our security aided by taking in these three countries? If, as I believe at some point the hard-liners in Russia are going to have a field day with this, just as there are people in this body and in the United States who cannot give up on the cold war, I think we are going to pay a heavy price. 
Nobody should cling to the naive belief that a lot of this expansion is not dictated by the hard-liners in this country. We have our own. We have people who after 50 years of fearing the great Russian bear and communism and the Soviet Union have a very difficult time turning loose that philosophy. 
I hear it said that we gave our word to Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, and we must follow through on our word. I hear it said that they have suffered enough. And God knows, we can all relate to that. We all know what Eastern Europe endured under the foot of communism and the U.S.S.R. for 45 years after World War II. Not only are we sympathetic, in my opinion, without the expansion of NATO, the United States and our allies in Europe would come to the rescue of any of these countries if they were threatened. But we should bear in mind also in that connection that it was not Russia, it was not the Soviet Union that invaded Czechoslovakia, that invaded Poland and Hungary. 
We hear all of these soothing assurances from proponents of enlargement that NATO is a defensive alliance; we have no aggressive intentions. I believe that. Of course, that is true. But I am not Russia. I ask the Members of this body, if the shoe were on the other foot how would they feel? Incidentally, I might say that one of the most powerful speeches I have ever heard made on the Senate floor was about 30 seconds long during the Panama Canal Treaty debate. That was by far the most volatile political issue to confront this body since I have been in the Senate. Everybody that was going to vote for it--and it had 67 votes--was trying to cleanse their skirts with their constituents back home. And Henry Bellmon, a wonderful Republican Senator from Oklahoma, stood at his desk at about where the Senator from Indiana is seated right now and said: `I have agonized about this for 6 weeks. The President's called me. The Secretary of State's called me, and people on the other side have called me. Mr. President, I 
have decided that I think we ought to treat the Panamanians the way we would want to be treated, and therefore I am going to vote for the treaties.' He shortly thereafter announced he would not run again because he knew he could not possibly be reelected in Oklahoma with that vote. You talk about a profile in courage. That is probably the most dramatic illustration of it I have seen since I have been in the Senate. 
And so I ask you this: If this treaty were being executed by Russia, Mexico and Canada, and Russia was saying not to worry, don't worry about us lining up with Mexico and Canada on your border, we have no aggressive intentions, how would that go over? 
Mr. President, we cannot deny what this treaty is all about. It is to hem Russia in. The Russians are not stupid. 
Look at some of the declarations in the resolution itself. Paragraph (2)(A)(i). It says:  
Notwithstanding the collapse of communism in most of Europe and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States and its NATO allies face threats to their stability and territorial integrity including [listen to this] the potential for the emergence of a hegemonic power in Europe. 
That is No. 1. `The potential for the emergence of a hegemonic power in Europe.' 
Now, the Russians would never guess who we were referring to with that. Further: 
The invasion of Poland, Hungary, or the Czech Republic, or their destabilization arising from external subversion, would threaten the stability of Europe and jeopardize vital United States national security interests. 
Who would invade Poland, Hungary or the Czech Republic? The Russians would never guess who we were referring to in this resolution. 
Listen to this: 
Extending NATO membership to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will strengthen NATO, enhance security and stability in Central Europe, deter potential aggressors, and thereby advance the interests of the United States and its NATO allies. 
Question: Who do you think the potential aggressor is? 
Or, perhaps the Russians will never see or know about a letter I received in my office last week from Mr. Bruce Jackson, president of the United States Committee to Expand NATO. Here is what he said: 
Dear Senator: 
I am forwarding a copy of Charles Krauthammer's opinion piece which appeared on April 17 in the Washington Post while the Senate was in recess. While I cannot say that every member of the U.S. Committee to Expand NATO shares Dr. Krauthammer's views on Russia, we are in complete agreement with his conclusion: 
NATO expansion is simply a return to--a ratification of normality . . . It is the easiest U.S. foreign policy call of the decade. 
If you need any additional information, call me. 
This is the Committee to Expand NATO, saying we agree with virtually everything Dr. Krauthammer said in his article in the Washington Post. And what did Dr. Krauthammer say? Listen to this headline. This is the headline of the Krauthammer article that that committee says they agree with totally. `Is NATO expansion directed against Russia? Of course it is.' 
What would our response be if we were in Russia's shoes? Their conventional forces are in shambles, their economy is a basket case, their people are demoralized and they are experiencing the fifth consecutive year of economic negative growth. The most dangerous thing in the world is for a bully to jump on somebody who is weak. You know what I have always said? I think government has a role in our lives. I think government has a role in protecting the weak from the bully. I am not saying the United States is a bully. But I am saying, when we expand NATO at a time when Russia is on their hunkers and everybody knows it--mostly the Russians--what would our response be? We have assured Russia orally we will not put nuclear weapons in Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. But we have refused to put that in writing. You think of that. 
Again, I am going to come back to the broken promise of all broken promises in just a moment. But here we are telling Russia that we will not put nuclear weapons in the three countries that we are taking into NATO, `So you have nothing to fear.' But we don't want to put it in writing. And yesterday the U.S. Senate, by a vote of 90 to 9, said the very foundation of NATO requires a nuclear presence in Europe and those three countries were not excluded in that amendment. 
The Russians would have to be naive beyond all imagination to believe that Dr. Krauthammer wasn't saying it exactly right. NATO enlargement is designed to hem Russia in. 
Mr. President, the last time Russia took our word for something was in 1990. It was in a meeting during a meeting between Secretary of State Baker and Mikhail Gorbachev, and the promise was very simple, according to Jack Matlock, who was our Ambassador to Russia at the time. When the Soviet empire was falling apart and the Germans were clamoring to reunify the west and east, we promised Mikhail Gorbachev that if he would not interfere with the reunification of Germany, we would never move NATO 1 foot further east toward Russia. I have no documentation to prove that, but I called Jack Matlock, who knows what happened, and asked him. He assured me in roughly a 30-minute conversation, over and over and over, that not only did the United States promise Russia we would not move any further--wouldn't move NATO any further east toward Russia, Helmut Kohl later joined in the promise. I am not saying that Gorbachev had that much option. I am saying we made the promise. Again, an oral promise. 
Let me go back to the rationale some people use for saying we have to go through with this. It is because we promised the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary that we would do it. How about our promises to Russia that we would not? 
So, what are we doing to Russia? We are forcing them to rely more and more heavily on nuclear weapons. And the more you rely on 
nuclear weapons, the lower the hair trigger for nuclear war. Why are they depending on nuclear weapons? It is cheaper. They can maintain a nuclear force at a fraction of the cost of maintaining a conventional force in case NATO did attack them. 
Are we safer with the Russians depending on nuclear weapons? Of course we are not. That is another big negative to this whole thing. And the Duma says they are not going to ratify START II. Maybe they will. I hear arguments on both sides of that. But I can tell you this, START II is extremely important to the security of the world and it is extremely important to the security of the United States. But the Duma has not ratified it. They have talked about it for almost 2 years now and they have not ratified it. 
So, what does that mean? It means we have to maintain our nuclear forces on a high state of readiness, at an extra cost of several billion dollars a year. There has been a lot of talk about who is going to pay for all of the new weaponry for Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. Nobody has mentioned the fact that instead of destroying weapons, as we would under START II, we may very well not only keep them but keep them on a high state of readiness, and it is already costing us several billion dollars a year to maintain the extra nuclear forces. 
What are our friends in Russia saying? Mr. President, I feel this may be the most salient point I can make in the debate on why I do not intend to vote for the expansion of NATO. What are our friends--who we are depending on to democratize and bring sanity to the Soviet Union and bring that poor, bedraggled nation into the 20th century--what are they saying? 
Victor Chernomyrdin, everybody thought he was a rational, moderate person. Vice President Gore is genuinely fond of him and met with him many times. What does he think about this? Here is what he said:  
We will never agree that the expansion of NATO is needed now, since its doctrine of confrontation with the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet Union and Russia, has not essentially changed. 
That is one of our good friends. Then: The Russian Federation National Security Blueprint which was signed by Boris Yeltsin: 
The prospect of NATO expansion to the east is unacceptable to Russia since it represents a threat to its national security. 
What did the State Duma, the principal legislative body in Russia, say 3 months ago? This wasn't way back in the past, it was January 23 this year. They passed a resolution saying: 
Given the weakening of Russia's defense capacity, NATO enlargement means the appearance of the most serious military threat to our country since 1954. 
And here is Yuli Vorontsov, Ambassador to the United States: 
I would say that movement of NATO forces close to the Russian borders is generally being considered by all political forces in Russia as a threat. You can ask anybody there. Do not just ask Communists; we know what they will say. Ask liberals, ask democrats, ask young and ask old. Nobody in Russia is applauding this move, because everybody is afraid it is going to be a military threat. 
That is what our friends in Russia say. What they say is, `You're cutting our legs off right under us. We want to be friends. We want Russia to move into the 21th century, and we want peace on the Eurasian continent. So what in the name of God are you doing threatening us with this expansion?' 
Bill Clinton made one of the most poignant statements he has ever made in his life back in 1992 when he was running for President. April 1992--listen to this beautiful statement: 
What does a democratic Russia mean to Americans? Lower defense spending, a reduced nuclear threat, a diminished risk of environmental disasters, fewer arms exports and less proliferation, access to Russia's vast resources through peaceful commerce, and the creation of a major new market for American goods and services. 
That is what President Clinton said in a beautiful statement in 1992 when he was candidate Clinton. 
What does Admiral Bill Crowe say? And Admiral Crowe, incidentally, favors the expansion of NATO, but he wrote some beautiful words about it. Listen to it. I think everybody in this body and everybody whoever knew him has a profound respect for Bill Crowe, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently Ambassador to the Court of St. James. He said: 
Put bluntly, the outcome of events in Russia can directly affect the future of the free world. The epic journey of that great nation is far from over . . . If the Russian people ultimately return to some form of autocracy, it would be a genuine disaster, not only for them but for us as well. In essence, I would judge that Russia is our number one foreign policy challenge, and it would be folly to treat it otherwise. 
Yet we are engaging in precisely what he said--folly. What did Jack Matlock, who was our Ambassador to the Soviet Union at the time, say? 
In making a major effort to bring more members into NATO when countries who wish to join face no military threat, the administration undermines its ability to protect the United States and its allies from potential nuclear leakage from Russia. 
He goes on to say: 
Russia may have no choice other than to accept an enlarged NATO, but in the ensuing atmosphere of political estrangement, close cooperation in nuclear matters, never easy, will become even more difficult. It will also be much harder to maintain the momentum of weapons destruction if it appears to Russian military planners that they must maintain a nuclear option in order to balance an expanding NATO. 
Mr. President, did you know that we have spent billions of dollars in Russia helping them dismantle their nuclear weapons? That is what we call Nunn-Lugar money around here. It is the best money we have ever spent. I promise you, Mr. President, I promise you that the Russians are going to ultimately say, `Get out. We thought you were serious about dismantling our nuclear weapons and dismantling yours, but if you are going to treat us this way and show this kind of bad faith toward our good faith in dismantling our nuclear weapons and letting you do it, it is over.' 
Our former colleague Sam Nunn who was the most revered person on military matters I ever served with--and believe you me, Sam Nunn and I had plenty of disagreements--is opposed to NATO expansion. Here is what Sam Nunn said: 
I believe it is essential for the Clinton administration and our allies to start laying the groundwork now for a `soft landing' for U.S.-Russian relations in the wake of NATO enlargement. Unless this is accomplished soon, there will be a significant deterioration in U.S.-Russian and allied-Russian relations, and a political climate may emerge in Russia which erodes the ability and the willingness of Russian leaders to make rational decisions on critical foreign policy matters. 
Even those Russians who are most inclined to seek compromise and who see no military threat in the admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO would find the expansion of NATO into the geopolitical space claimed by the former Soviet Union intolerable. 
Of course they find it intolerable. 
Mr. President, I do not speak out of fear of Russia. I do not speak out of denigration of my colleagues who think this is absolutely the right thing to do. It is no secret that President Clinton and I have been close friends for 25 years, and I have, I think, the best record in the Senate of supporting his legislation. Maybe one other Senator has a better record than I have. But I think he would be the first person to understand my strong feelings that this is a mistake. 
When I about this subject, I think of all throughout history, from Napoleon to Hitler, who have underestimated Russia. And I can tell you we are underestimating Russia, we are assuming that she is always going to be an economic basket case, that she will never be able to build her conventional forces and that she will always accept our soothing assurances that our intentions are defensive and not offensive. 
One of the best books I ever read in my life, Mr. President, is called `The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam,' by Barbara Tuchman. No young person should be allowed to graduate from high school and certainly not from college without reading Barbara Tuchman's `The March of Folly.' 
Bill Lind, who most of the people in this body know, an expert on military affairs of some note, widely respected, wrote an article about NATO enlargement not long ago, and he refers to this magnificent book, `The March of Folly.' He said: 
It is folly to humiliate a Great Power during an historical moment of weakness. It is folly to reignite a cold war within the West--and Russia is rightfully part of the West--as the world moves into an era of conflicts among cultures. It is folly to risk pushing a weak Russian government further toward loss of legitimacy, when its replacement may be a variety of non-state entities ranging from mafias through religious groupings, some of which would inevitably possess remnants of the Soviet nuclear arsenal. 
Bill Lind goes on to say: 
In her glorious book, `The March of Folly,' Barbara Tuchman writes: `A phenomenon noticeable throughout history regardless of place or period is the pursuit by governments of policies contrary to their own interests. Mankind, it seems, makes a poorer performance of government than of almost any other human activity. In this sphere, wisdom, which may be defined as the exercise of judgment acting on experience, common sense and available information, is less operative and more frustrated than it should be. Why do holders of high office so often act contrary to the way reason points and enlightened self-interest suggests?' 
Mr. President, Barbara Tuchman's definition of `the march of folly' was when nations take action, and there is a small minority of people saying, `If you do this, you're going to be sorry,' and it turns out the warning was not heeded. Nations went ahead headlong, and the march of folly continued to the considerable detriment of the nation that did not listen. 
Admiral Yamamoto told the Japanese warlords, `I've been to the United States. I will participate in the attack on Pearl Harbor. I will serve my Emperor and do the best I can. But you are foolish if you think you're going to conquer the United States. I've been there. I've seen their industrial might.' 
In World War I, the commander of all the German U-boats said, `I cannot sink the amount of shipping you tell me I have to sink in order to defeat the United States.' Yet they went headlong and paid no attention to him. 
Even when the Greeks attacked the Trojan fortress, and placed the Trojan horse outside the gates, one person, Laocoon said, `Don't let that horse in here. What have the Greeks ever done for us? It is a trick' But he was a solitary voice, so the Trojans brought the wooden horse into the city. The rest is history. Fifty-five of the best Greek soldiers piled out of the horse and took the Trojan fortress. 
There are not too many dissenters in this debate. I am one of them and I hope to God I am wrong. I can tell you that in my opinion we are going against our enlightened self-interest and continuing the march of folly. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators Chafee, Hollings, Boxer, Torricelli, and Wellstone, to introduce the Telephone Privacy Act of 1998. The issue of telephone privacy thrusts itself into the news every so often. I have introduced similar legislation twice before, because these concerns have been with us since Alexander Graham Bell installed the first party line. 
In the early '80s Charles Wick was the head of USIA. He freely admitted that he had recorded more than eighty conversations with then President Reagan and former President Carter, cabinet members and many others. None of those people knew that Mr. Wick had recorded their conversations. I was absolutely appalled to learn that such conduct is perfectly legal. I have been trying to correct that gap in the law ever since. 
Usually, we hear about this issue after some incident where an unsuspecting person has suffered harsh personal consequences after a private conversation has been recorded and disseminated. The Speaker of the House himself was recently recorded by a third party while speaking on a cellular phone. If that call had been made on an ordinary phone, any party to the call could have recorded it without informing the Speaker or anyone else--and it would have been perfectly legal. He could have broadcast it on the evening news and published the transcript in the New York Times. This should be repugnant to almost everyone and yet it is all quite legal. My two previous efforts to make such conduct illegal failed. I believe that in the present environment a majority of our people think it is time to correct this abomination. 
Sixteen states have outlawed the taping of phone conversations without the consent of all parties to the call, but the federal law has not caught up with those states. Until a bill like mine becomes law, recording of personal conversations will be legal, so long as one party to the conversation is aware of such recording. 
How many Americans are aware that it is legal for the private telephone conversations of any person in this country to be monitored and even recorded without his or her consent? Indeed, how many Senators know? 
Americans cherish their privacy as nothing else. One of the reasons the President's popularity is so high is people believe his privacy and the First Lady's privacy has been unfairly invaded. 
How many times have we heard a recording on television or read a transcript in the newspaper where one of the parties makes some embarrassing revelation, confident that the conversation is `private,' never suspecting that he or she was being recorded? 
I am not talking about authorized law enforcement surveillance. I'm not talking about calls to 911. I'm not talking about employers who must monitor calls made by employees in the course of their duties and my bill makes no change in the law regarding Caller ID technologies. My bill would also allow victims of phone threats to record threatening 
calls. This bill retains all of the existing exceptions to the law that allow our law enforcement agencies and intelligence gathering agencies to carry out their important duties unimpeded. 
I want to emphasize that the only change this bill is intended to make to the status quo is this: subject to existing exceptions, under my bill, the interception of wire and electronic communications will be permitted only where all parties have consented, rather than allowing only one party to make that determination. Existing penalties for violations of the law will remain unchanged. 
The current law leaves a huge hole in the rights of telephone users. We have tolerated that gap for many years, but those have been years in which communications technology has exploded. In 1998, the technology to intercept and record telephone calls and other wire communications is available to almost everyone--you can do it with an ordinary answering machine. Much of our lives is now conducted over the telephone. Too much of our privacy is at risk. Too much mischief can be made to allow this flaw in our right to privacy any longer.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Coverdell bill. Let me start by saying that I served on the school board of Charleston, AR, population 1,200, for 12 years before I ran for Governor of my State. I have often said--not entirely facetiously--that I ran for Governor to get off the school board because that is the worst job I ever had. It was a poor school district. When we asked the people of that district, though, for millage increases to build new facilities, not one single time, in my memory--not just the 12 years I served on the school board--did the people ever defeat a millage increase to improve the plight of our students. That situation still exists. The reason it was so difficult is because salaries were pitifully low. 
When I got out of law school, I didn't know what I was going to do, but I knew I wasn't going to make very much money practicing law. Betty went to work teaching third grade in the Charleston Elementary School at the princely sum of $125 a month. That is what we lived on. Things were very tough. In a relative sense, things are not all that much better right now. Incidentally, Charleston was the first school in the South to integrate schools after the Brown decision in 1954. Yes, my little hometown was the first school south of the Mason-Dixon Line to integrate its schools following the Brown decision. We are proud of that. 
I am a great champion, as a result of my experience on that school board, of public education. I have nothing against private schools. When I was elected Governor, because I was apprehensive about the safety of a couple of my children, I sent them to private schools. I was concerned about their safety not because of the schools, but because their father was Governor. The second reason I sent them, of course, is that I had the money to do it. 
Under the Coverdell bill, if we are going to spend $1.6 billion over 10 years, that equates to the princely sum of $160 million a year. Do you know what that does for education in this country? Nothing. That is not a drop in the bucket compared to the educational needs of this Nation. 
Senator Moseley-Braun has an amendment to rebuild the crumbling infrastructure of the school buildings in this country. I think it is $5 billion over a 5-year period. That doesn't even begin to address the problem when you consider the fact that 93 percent of the money under this bill goes to the wealthiest people in America, goes to those people who go to private schools, and 7 percent goes to the other 85 percent of the people in America who go to public schools. I repeat--this is a Treasury Department figure--93 percent of the dollars that would go for education under this bill goes to the families who send their children to private schools. That is 12 percent. Seven percent of the money goes to the other 85 percent. That tells you all you need to know about what this bill is all about. It doesn't address the problems of education in the country. It simply extends those IRAs to the first 12 grades. That in itself is nonsense. 
If all of this money is going for private schools, then there is not very much of it--$37 a year--for a family who sends their children to a private school. Who is going to send their kid to a private school for $37 a year? But more importantly, the people who send their children to public schools get the princely sum of $7 a year. 
So you have to ask, what is going on here? What do we think we are going to do for somebody for $7 a year, or even the wealthy people for $37 a year? 
Mr. President, that tells you one thing. The reason I am so stridently opposed to this bill is that it is a nose under the tent of crooks to aid private schools, even though it be very small and it is a diminution of public education. I can tell you where you are headed. You are headed toward the abandonment of public education in this country, and you are headed for one of the biggest disasters of the Nation when you go to vouchers. I am adamantly, and always have been, opposed to vouchers. But I can tell you that will ultimately be the end result of this bill. 
Our educational system is not perfect--never has been, never will be. But the reason we had a tough time in Charleston, the reason we have a tough time in America in public education is we are not committing the resources to it. We have a $50-billion surplus this year. Think about it. Six years ago we were looking at a $300-billion deficit. Today, we are looking at a $50-billion surplus. 
I am not voting for tax cuts. I am not going to vote to spend that $50 billion for tax cuts when we have 40 million people with no health insurance. We have an educational system that is 13th among 17 developed nations of the world. We have environmental problems that are going to cost billions and billions to solve. 
I will tell you what I would like to do if I were king. I can tell you Bill Clinton agrees with this. I would start a GI bill to make sure that every child in America got a college education. They would get a Pell grant--not loans. They would get grants. Every kid in America--86 percent of the people in this country--would go to college if they had the money. If it had not been for the GI bill waiting for me when I got out of the Marine Corps in 1946, I wouldn't be standing here. There are about seven other Members of the Senate who would not be here either if it had not been for the GI bill. If you want to spend that $50-billion surplus, give the children of America a college education and make sure they get it. 
Mr. President, I will close by saying, if I had my way, in addition to giving every child a college education, I would also reeducate the teachers of America. I can remember when the Carnegie Foundation started the program to allow teachers of this country--a limited number of them--to improve their skills by going to summer seminars about 10 or 12 years ago. The first one was at the University of Texas which had a summer seminar dealing with Virgil's Aeneas and Homer's Ulysses, comparing them, and 4,400 schoolteachers applied for 250 spots. That shows teachers want to improve their education if they had the money. 
Since that time we have done a little bit in the National Endowment for the Humanities. If I had my way about it, every schoolteacher in this country would be making a minimum of $50,000. How do you expect teachers to spend all of this time going to college and then standing out there and getting killed, as one in my State did 3 weeks ago in Jonesboro, AR? And we pay them $25,000 or $30,000 a year. They can go to law school and start at $75,000 to $100,000 a year. Why would anybody want to teach school when it is a dangerous profession among other things? The pay is miserable. Those are the reasons our educational system is lacking. 
Mr. President, I will not belabor it any longer but to simply say this is precisely the wrong thing to be doing if you are trying to improve education in this country. Improve the teacher quality, improve the buildings they go to school in, improve the safety of the teachers, and improve the discipline in the classroom. This is a nose-under-the-tent approach. 
I cannot state it strongly enough. I thank God Bill Clinton is in the White House. He will veto this thing the minute it hits his desk. I will praise him for it. 
I yield such time as may be remaining in opposition to the Mack amendment.

Mr. BUMPERS. I yield myself 5 minutes. 
Colleagues, not long ago we debated what we called unfunded mandates to the cities and States of the country. A lot of tears were shed on this floor, because we said we were imposing all sorts of obligations on the cities and the counties and the States and making them pick up the tab for it. I am here this morning to tell you about the biggest unfunded mandate of all. 
In 1975, the Congress--this body, along with the House--passed what is called the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, and we said in 1975 in the legislation that we wanted disabled children taken care of and that we would pay 40 percent of the cost. Twenty-three years later we are paying 9 percent of the cost. 
The schools of this Nation have been literally bankrupting themselves to make up the difference. You are talking about billions of dollars that the United States made a solemn obligation to pay and has reneged on. 
Having said that, let me tell you about the most unwarranted tax loophole in the Nation, and it is called a depletion allowance. It goes to the oil companies. It goes to natural gas companies. It goes to coal companies. And it goes to people in the mining industry who hardly paid a red cent for the gold, silver, platinum, palladium, zinc, copper--you name it--that they take off Federal lands. 
I stood here on this floor--this is about the 8th or 9th year--and everybody knows the arguments. Everybody knows that it is the biggest ripoff going on in America today. And you talk about--you talk about--doing away with the Internal Revenue Code and betting on the come that somehow or other we will get a new revenue code before this one expires--listen to this. 
You go down to the Gulf of Mexico and you bid $1 billion to drill for oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico, and you are entitled to a depletion. You ought to get a depletion allowance. And how much is it? Oh, it is about--well, I do not have it here. I think it is 15 percent. Fifteen percent they get for a depletion allowance because they paid $1 billion for it. And everybody--the coal companies--we let coal competitively. We let our oil and gas leases competitively. But for some reason or other we give away all the gold and silver and platinum and palladium and other hard-rock minerals we have. 
So what else do we do? We not only give them away, we pay them to take it. How do we do that? Here it is. Let us assume that Stillwater Mining Company in Montana, for example, which says there is $35 billion worth of platinum and palladium under a 2,000 acre tract, they intend to mine it and they intend to pay the Government roughly $10,000 for it--$10,000 for $35 billion worth of minerals that belong to the taxpayers. 
Oh, the poor taxpayers. How we lament their plight in this body. Except when it comes to hard-rock mining. And then you know what the taxpayers get? They get nothing. You know what they pay? They buy this land for $2.50 an acre. Stillwater will pay about $10,000 for $35 billion. That is what they are going to pay for it. And here is what they pay the Federal Government. That is what they pay the taxpayers in royalties--zip, zero, zilch. Not a red cent. 
What else do they get? They get a depletion allowance of 15 percent on gold. They get a depletion allowance on silver of 15 percent. They get a depletion allowance on platinum of 22 percent and on palladium of 22 percent. 
That is right. The American taxpayer--the American taxpayer--is the big sucker in this whole thing. Here is an opportunity to fulfill an unfunded mandate and remove one of the most scandalous loopholes on the tax books of this Nation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, isn't it wonderful that the hard rock mining companies don't pay taxes? Isn't that just remarkable? We give them billions of dollars' worth of minerals for $2.50 an acre, we allow them to create environmental disasters, we allow them to take the minerals and not pay one dime in royalty, and they are not subject to pay any taxes. Isn't that just wonderful? The oil companies, who right now are getting about 50 percent as much for their oil as they got a year ago, not only have to pay billions for the rights to drill for oil on Federal lands, but they also have to pay royalties. And they pay taxes. 
If somebody walked in here and made the argument that was just made about the fact that mining companies pay taxes, if somebody made the suggestion that oil companies not pay taxes, you would be laughed out that door. If the same argument were made for coal companies who pay zillions just for the right to take the coal and a 12.5 percent royalty, and if we suggested that they not have to pay taxes, you would be laughed out the door. 
What is it about the rock mining industry? We give them billions of dollars' worth of gold, silver, platinum, palladium; they create environmental disasters; they don't pay a dime in royalties; they take a depreciation allowance on top of that of 15 to 12 percent; we give it to them and then pay them to take it. The children of this Nation--we give 9 percent to the school district to take care of disabled children. 
I can tell you who is going to win in this battle here today. It isn't going to be the disabled children, it is going to be the same people who have won for the last 8 years, as I presented it. It will be the mining companies. They will continue to get Federal lands for nothing. They will continue to get a depletion allowance to mine it. They will continue not paying Uncle Sam one dime in royalty. If they come to your house and say, `You have this tract of land out back loaded with gold, and we would like to mine it,' do you know what they are willing to pay? Eighteen percent royalty. But they come to the U.S. Government and say, `You have this tract of land that has gold on it.' We say, `Oh, really? Please take it. Please leave an environmental disaster to the tune of $76 billion for the taxpayers to clean up. Please don't pay us any royalty. We do need a few billion dollars more for disabled children, but not from you.' 
One of these days, the people of this country are going to rise up in righteous indignation when it finally soaks in on the American people what is going on in this industry and how Congress is aiding and abetting one of the biggest scams in the history of the world. 
Colleagues, when you walk in here to vote today, look at that chart. You have a choice of removing an unjustified tax loophole that is not available to anybody else--nobody else. You can remove it from the biggest mining companies in the world--not the United States, in the world--and give it to the disabled children of this country, the school boards which have been waiting for us to fulfill a 23-year promise to provide 40 percent of the cost of taking care of disabled children. So far, we have paid the paltry sum of 9 percent. 
I yield the floor and save remainder of my time.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I will not belabor this any further. Everybody knows the argument. It is just a question of whether you are willing to do right or not. We are mining $2 billion worth just in gold a year off Federal lands that we have given the mining companies--gave them. They pay no royalty. They didn't pay anything for it. I forget who it was who talked about how valuable minerals were. Eighty percent of the gold mined in this country goes for jewelry. And we are willing to subsidize that to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a year when we have disabled children in school waiting for us to fulfill a promise? It is just as simple as that. 
I yield the remainder of my time and ask for the yeas and nays.

We cried tears galore around here about unfunded mandates to the cities and the States and the counties, and we took care of it. Here is the biggest unfunded mandate of all. We promised the school districts of this country 40 percent for disabled children, and so far, after 23 years, we are giving them 9 percent. 
You get a double whammy. You get a chance to fulfill that mandate and, No. 2, take care of a totally unjustified tax break we give the mining companies. We give them Federal lands for $2.50 an acre, they mine the gold and silver off of it, and we pay them to take it, a 15 percent depletion allowance. So I would take that depletion allowance and give it to disabled children.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first I express my sincere gratitude to the Senator from North Dakota for taking on this issue. I decided perhaps nobody was going to offer such an amendment. But I take this opportunity to say to my colleagues and the American people, for that matter--we are not supposed to call attention to C-SPAN2, but I hope a lot of people are watching C-SPAN2 because I want to say that this is my 24th year in the Senate, and this is the most irresponsible, without question, the most irresponsible provision I have ever seen in a piece of legislation. The very idea of saying we are going to abolish the Internal Revenue Code without a clue as to what we are going to replace it with is the height of irresponsibility. 
I know the applause lines. As the old saying goes, I know how to bring people to their feet. The object of any responsible legislator is to bring people to their senses. Everybody knows that when you talk to the Chamber of Commerce, if you are looking for that nice applause, just get on the Internal Revenue Service. Everybody has his own favorite horror story. I have my own. I daresay every Member of this body has his own horror story about their arrogance, how overbearing they are, how they have cost you money. Those are indefensible. I am not defending those. 
But I can tell you, if you think the year 2000 computer glitch is bad, if you think that may bring this country to the brink of disaster, you just eliminate the Internal Revenue Code with absolutely no thought of what you are going to replace it with, just as this country is on a sound financial basis, and as we are looking forward to a surplus this year, what in the name of all that is good and holy are we thinking about? 
Is it going to be a flat tax? That gets a lot of applause in some places. As far as I am concerned, the flat tax was created by the `Flat Earth Society,' but that is beside the point. I know how to get applause talking about a flat tax. Everybody `pays the same amount.' 
Is it going to be replaced by some kind of a flat tax where your church contributions won't be deductible? Is it going to be a flat tax where, as the Senator from North Dakota has pointed out, your mortgage interest will not be deductible? `Mr. Businessman, before you applaud, are you willing to give up depreciation? Are you willing to give up hundreds of other things that are in the code now that you know about?' 
I will tell you one thing, I will take the known, no matter how bad it may be, before I will take the unknown. And for the Members of the Senate to buy into this proposition of saying we are going to eliminate--eliminate--the Internal Revenue Code with nothing to replace it--do you know something, I didn't vote for that extra thousand pages in the Internal Revenue Code last summer. All the people who were so hot for the balanced budget amendment and the big tax cuts and what do we get? A thousand more pages in the Internal Revenue Code so they can go out and tell the Chamber of Commerce what a horror it is--the same people who bring you this piece of 
trash. 
Mr. President, I, again, thank my friend from North Dakota for alerting the people of this body and, hopefully, across America, that we are not just going to take this country to the brink of a disaster, we are going to take it right over the brink, and if you get to the year 2000 after you eliminate the Internal Revenue Code and you don't have anything to collect $1.7 trillion with, you tell the Social Security recipients how that is going to work out. Tell everybody--the Medicare people--how that is going to work out. 
I plead with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, do not buy into an applause line. Keep your sanity and do the rational thing and strike this from this resolution. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.  
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have the utmost respect for the sponsor of this bill, but I have utterly nothing but contempt for the amendment. 
Medicare has done more to provide a good night's sleep to the elderly of this country than any other single program, with the possible exception of Social Security. We made a solemn contract with the elderly of this country to provide them with medical care. When I was first elected Governor of my State, I found that 50 percent of the people didn't even know what to do 
in case they got sick. But when you polled the people over 65, they knew what to do and they knew where to go and they knew their bill was going to be paid. 
The underlying assumption of the Kyl amendment is that somehow or other people are having a difficult time getting a doctor to take them. Now, the General Accounting Office has answered a number of questions propounded to them by the distinguished senior Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, and in answer to one of the questions: How much difficulty are they having? here is the answer. According to the GAO, 96 percent of the Medicare-eligible people in this country stated that they had some difficulty getting medical care. But listen to this. The Kyl amendment goes to this figure: Only two-tenths of 1 percent said they had difficulty getting satisfactory assistance because of Medicare. Here we are tinkering with a system that has been so successful and so rewarding to our elderly, because two-tenths of 1 percent of the people in this country said they had difficulty getting the kind of care they wanted under Medicare. 
No. 1, doctors right now, under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, are eligible to charge 15 percent more than the Medicare allowance. For example, you have a procedure--say, laser surgery for your eyes. Assume that the Medicare limit on laser surgery for your eye, or eyes, is $1,000, but the doctor can charge 15 percent more than that, or $1,150. Medicare may only pay 80 percent of the allowable charge, or $800, but the doctor can charge 15 percent more than the Medicare allowance. 
The balanced budget amendment also provided that if a doctor wants to privately contract, he or she may privately contract, but they have to drop out of the program for 2 years. 
Now, we feel strongly--many of us--that this is an elitist amendment. Obviously, there are a lot of people in this country--perhaps 2 percent to 5 percent--who will pay a doctor of their choice whatever he charges. They want him; they are used to him. Say I worked from the time I was 30 years old until I was 65 and went to the same doctor, and when I became 65 I said, `Doctor, I am switching from my Blue Cross policy over to Medicare.' The doctor says, `I'm sorry, I'm not going to be able to take care of you anymore because Medicare is simply not meeting my expenses.' You think about that. The patient may be a person of very modest means but who, above all, wants to go to the doctor he or she has been going to for years, and the doctor says, `Well, now, if you are willing to pay, that is a different matter, I will let you keep coming to see me.' 
Let me tell you another thing the doctor can do. Assume you are in a fairly big-sized clinic, and the doctor says, `We will take you for your heart conditions under Medicare, but we can't take your liver,' or, `we can't take your kidneys.' Think of all the different kinds of contracts people would enter into. If this amendment ever became law--God forbid--you would start hearing some of the most fraudulent contracts and some of the most exorbitant charges for medical services that would choke a mule. 
Mr. President, if there is a problem with Medicare, if we are not paying enough to entice a majority of the doctors in this country to provide services under Medicare, let's raise the rates. But for Pete's sake, let's not allow people to enter into these private contracts. I have the utmost respect for the medical profession. But I am telling you, you are giving them unbelievable leverage over millions of Medicare patients if you allow them to say, `I can't take you because Medicare is not enough.' If only two-tenths of 1 percent of the people in this country are having difficulty getting medical care because of Medicare rates, I suggest to you that that is not a sufficient number to warrant tinkering with one of the finest programs this country has ever produced. 
I yield the floor and yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk, but I think the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and I have a pretty good understanding about the amendment and its intent. And I am not saying that he agrees with every jot and tittle of it, but I think that he feels pretty much the way I do about it. 
Let me just say for the Record that here is what I am trying to accomplish with the amendment. As you know, an emergency appropriation does not require an offset. An appropriation in this bill which is not an emergency does require an offset. And under the Budget Act, spending that is not an emergency and nondefense discretionary spending must be offset with nondefense discretionary spending and defense spending that is not an emergency must be offset by defense spending cuts--offsets. 
And the House has done something--the thing that really sort of got me interested in this--the House has done something which is really very strange and, frankly, I consider to be a violation of the Budget Act. What they have said is, we are declaring these items--for example, assistance to Bosnia and the Iraqi operation--as emergencies. And, as I said, under the law they do not require offsets if they are emergencies, but the House has chosen to offset them anyway. And they have offset them totally from nondefense discretionary spending, such as housing, AmeriCorps, and other things that may not be popular to some people but they are fairly popular with me. 
So what I want to do is emphasize that the Senate is proceeding exactly the way we should and in accordance with the Budget Act. We have declared these things emergencies. The ones that have not been declared emergencies we have offsets for. And when we go to conference with the House, we are going to be in a strange position. They are going to be saying this is an emergency, but we are going to offset it anyway. 
I think that the chairman agrees with me that if the conference does, in fact, have any offsets--and particularly offsets of emergency matters--that we will comply with the requirement of the Budget Act; and that is, defense spending increases for emergency purposes will be offset by defense funds, and the same way with nondefense discretionary spending. 
And I would like, if I could, to get the chairman of the committee to comment on what I have just said.

Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I simply want to call to the body's attention--indeed, to the American people's attention--an editorial in the Washington Post this morning called `Trigger Happy.' 
As you know, my home State is Arkansas, and we have just experienced one of the gravest tragedies in the history of our State. People all over the State--not just those in Jonesboro --are grieving over the loss of four children 11 years old, and one 32-year-old pregnant schoolteacher, a catastrophic happening that no one can even begin to explain. 
But the Post this morning certainly points out one of the serious problems facing this country, and one with which we have never even come close to coming to grips with, and I don't in the foreseeable future see us coming to grips with it. But here it is: In 1992, handguns killed 33 people in Great Britain; 36 in Sweden; 97 in Switzerland; 60 in Japan; 13 in Australia; 128 in Canada; and, 13,200 in the United States. 
There was a study completed by the Violence Policy Center. And as the Post points out--they can't put it all in here. But listen to this: 
For every case in which an individual used a firearm kept in the home in a self-defense homicide, there were 1.3 unintentional deaths, 4.6 criminal homicides, and 26 suicides involving firearms. 
The overall firearm-related death rate among U.S. children aged less than 15 was nearly 12 times higher than among children in the other 25 industrialized countries combined. 
From 1968 to 1991, moter-vehicle-related deaths declined by 21 percent, while firearm-related deaths increased by 60 percent. It is estimated that by the year 2003, firearm-related deaths will surpass deaths from motor-vehicle-related injuries. In 1991 this was already the case in seven States. 
Madam President, those figures are so shocking to me. I have studied this issue for some time and have lamented the increasing violence from the Postal Service. And now it seems that it is becoming endemic in the schoolyards in America. 
When in the name of God is this country going to wake up to what is going on in the country and the easy accessibility to guns? 
I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just, first of all, express my profound thanks to the distinguished Senator from Illinois for her sensitivity and sincere compassion over what is the most traumatic event, perhaps ever, in my State. We have tornadoes and we lose a lot of lives in tornadoes, and we have a lot of property damage. But for just sheer trauma, this event is really unique to us, as it would be to any State in the Nation. The grief is indescribable. The circumstances are indescribable. Nobody could speculate with any degree of accuracy as to what possesses an 11- or 13-year-old child to do this. You can wonder how did they lay their hands on such an arsenal of weapons in order to perpetrate the crime? But at this point, I share the comments of the Senator from Illinois that it is premature to speculate on that because that will all come out as the investigation goes forward and is unwound. 
I simply want to say that it is a terrible plight in this country when such an event can even be thinkable, let alone happen. It is becoming all too frequent that you pick up the 
paper and find that this is happening in the school yards of America. This is not a high school, this is a middle school of 11-, 12-, and 13-year-old youngsters. Nineteen were injured and five are dead. It is an unspeakable horror. I know I speak for all the Members of the Senate in expressing our sincere grief, our condolences and sincere sympathies to all the people who have been affected in this, the parents and relatives of the children who have been injured and killed, and to those others who were not but will be traumatized and scarred by this for the rest of their lives. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

The reports from officials at the Department of Agriculture would suggest that with an additional $50 million, which would bring the total supplemental appropriation for the Emergency Watershed and Flood Prevention account to $100 million along with the $60 million allocated for the Emergency Conservation Program, the needs of Georgia as well as the numerous other Americans around the country who are in need of natural disaster relief will be met.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Cochran, Chairman of the Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, in offering an amendment to S. 1768 relating to the boll weevil eradication loan program. Our amendment will provide an additional $222,000 in budget authority to support an increased program level of nearly $19,000,000. This amendment will return the program to the fiscal year 1997 level of approximately $40,000,000 which is consistent with the program's identified need. 
This loan program is an important component of USDA's overall boll weevil eradication strategy. Already, regions of this country are benefitting from complete boll weevil eradication. The benefits of this program include reduced chemical applications, higher net farm income, increased land values, and other attributes important to the vitality of rural America. This program benefits not only farmers, but everyone interested in a clean environment and economic prosperity. 
There are still large regions of the country where the boll weevil eradication program is either in the very early stages or has not yet begun. In my state of Arkansas, referendums have been recently concluded in which farmers are agreeing to assessments to pay their share of the boll weevil grant program that is administered through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The loan program that we seek to increase, administered by the Farm Service Agency, helps farmers accelerate the timetable for complete eradication of this pest. 
It is very important that we move these areas forward as quickly as possible to help protect the environment and to help sustain rural economies. The program level made possible by this amendment will return the program to last year's level which is the very least we should do at this time. 
Again, I want to thank Senator Cochran for his leadership on this issue and to Senators Stevens and Byrd for seeing it included in the text of S. 1768.

Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, let me thank first the Senator from North Dakota for his very kind remarks and for yielding to me immediately, because I do have a committee that I 
need to get back to. 
I have come to the floor every time I have had an opportunity for the past 23 years to express my moral and vocal support for legislation that has any potential for curbing drunken driving. 
I grew up in a devout Methodist household where, in a small town, drinking was absolutely forbidden. Everybody in town knew who drank. We didn't have anything but Presbyterians, Catholics, Methodists, and Baptists. The Catholics drank wine. We could not have wine at communion in the Methodist Church because the Methodist Church was adamantly opposed to any alcoholic beverage. So we drank grape juice at communion. But my mother, considering the fact, as I have said many times on this floor, that I grew up in a household where we were taught that when we died we were going to Franklin Roosevelt. My mother and my father thought he was the greatest man who ever lived. But my mother could not abide Eleanor Roosevelt because she had been accused--I am not sure, according to Doris Kearns' book, `No Ordinary Time,' what the real circumstances were. But, anyway, it was a widely held belief in this country that Eleanor Roosevelt had told young women how not to drink too much, which was, if you drink, you only have one drink, or drink in moderation. That was more than my mother could abide. She detested Eleanor Roosevelt until her dying day. 
The interesting thing about growing up poor in the South in those days was, as I say, most people couldn't afford to drink, even if they wanted to. But my mother and father, until the day they died, never--either one--tasted alcohol in any form. 
So it was on March 22nd. I was a freshman law student at Northwestern University in Chicago. One Sunday evening somebody came in--there was a telephone booth down the hall in the dormitory--and said, `Dale, somebody wants to talk to you. It is long distance.' I went down. My sister's brother-in-law was on the phone saying my mother and father had been in an accident and he thought I should come home. He described it for me, and still it didn't really sink in. But, in any event, that was about 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening. I made arrangements to fly home the next morning. That was back when air traffic was almost nonexistent. 
But the sum and substance of the story, Madam President, was my mother and father and another couple had been out on a Sunday evening jaunt and had gone over to Oklahoma to look at the spinach crop on some land that my father owned. They were returning about dusk on a narrow, two-lane highway where I-40 runs today. 
So this drunk comes roaring over, sliding into my father's side of the road. And that is the end of the story. The woman, who was a friend, was killed instantly. My mother and father were taken to the hospital in Fort Smith, where my mother died 2 days later and my father died 6 days later. 
The interesting thing about that whole thing is--you can think of all kinds of interesting sidelights to a story like that--that the man who hit them had been run out of town in a small town. I believe it was Danville, AR. The sheriff told him to get out of town. He was drunk. So I don't know where he was heading. Some people said he was heading for California. And the State Police picked him up on the way. They didn't pick him up. They saw that he was drunk. The State trooper started chasing him, had a flat, and had to give up the chase. 
So here was a family as close as any family could be. Interestingly, my brother was himself in law school at Harvard. I believe he was a classmate of Senator Chafee. He was a sophomore at Harvard Law School. They didn't have semesters like they did at Northwestern. This was in March. Of course, he had to drop out of school. We both dropped out of school because we were so devastated. He lost the whole year and had to go back and take the whole year over because he was not there for final exams. 
I am taking up too much time, I see. I just want to say that ever since that tragedy happened in my household, I have done everything I could do, both here and as Governor of my State, to make sure other families were not devastated in such a way. I had always been opposed to the death penalty before that happened, and I had a tough time after that reconciling my position. I came down on the side of the death penalty later on because I couldn't make much of a distinction between a drunk driver killing my father and mother than I could if he had done it with a gun. 
When I have a chance to vote for an amendment like Senator Dorgan's, it is a pleasure. I compliment him for doing something that may--just may; no, it will--keep a lot of families from enduring the agonies that this close family, as close knit as any family ever, endured being totally destroyed in the blinking of an eye because of a roaring drunk. 
I am pleased that the Senator from North Dakota has asked me to come over and speak on it. It is my honor. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield to no Senator, with the possible exception of Robert C. Byrd from the great State of West Virginia, in my contempt for and disdain for the line-item veto bill that we passed in the 104th Congress and which two district courts have held to be unconstitutional. But I intend to vote to sustain the President's veto. 
I stood on this floor day after day, year after year, saying that the line-item veto was a lousy idea, an unconstitutional idea. When I think of the abuse that I and Senator Byrd and the people who stood fast on the floor of the Senate against the line-item veto--when I think of the abuse we took, the political abuse we took for resisting what was a palpable political idea, that still rankles me. Like so many ideas that have been floated through this body in the past 23 years that I have been here, they have immense popularity but they are lousy ideas, and the line-item veto stands out about as high as any next to the constitutional amendments related to prayer in school, flag burning and term limits and all those others things that people love to bring up here so they can run on them because they are popular. 
A little history. When Ronald Reagan ran for President in 1980 he ran on the single proposition that he would balance the budget, and the people of this country were becoming, at a time when the national debt was $1 trillion--the people were not only becoming apprehensive about the ability of Congress to control its habits, they were becoming downright frightened. So the soothing voice and the soothing promise of Ronald Reagan played very well with them and he was elected in a landslide. He carried 44 States. He promised that he would balance the budget in 4 years and maybe in 3. 
I believed him. I thought he really was committed to a balanced budget. Frankly, not to denigrate the President, I think he really was committed to a balanced budget. I just think, somehow or other, his advisers gave him bad advice and convinced him that, somehow or other, the budget would take care of itself just because he was President. So he came with one of the strangest economic programs in the history of this country. The Nobel laureate at MIT, whose name I forget, who won a Nobel prize for economics, said it was the most profligate, irresponsible economic policy, not in the history of America, but in the history of the world. 
And what was it? We would balance the budget by cutting taxes. That is a new one, isn't it? You balance the budget by cutting taxes. And, to his credit, he offered a lot of spending cuts. Some of them were foolish. I remember making ketchup a vegetable in the school lunchrooms. I didn't think that was a very appropriate way to balance the budget. I didn't think considering Hamburger Helper to be an entree was a very good way to balance the budget. But I voted against his tax cuts. There were 11 Senators, 11 Senators who voted against the tax cuts which were, as usual, mostly for the rich. But on the spending cuts I voted `Aye.' Eleven Senators voted against the tax cuts, and I said--if you want to read a beautiful speech, write my office and I'll send you a copy of it--I said, `If you pass this bill, you are going to create deficits big enough to choke a mule.' I was wrong. They were big enough to choke an elephant. 
But then when it came time to vote for the spending cuts, and there were a lot of programs that I liked that President Reagan was proposing to cut, some to eliminate, and I voted with him. And you know something? There were only three U.S. Senators who voted against the tax cuts and for the spending cuts. 
The budget would have been balanced in 3 years if a majority of the Members of Congress had voted that way. Three Senators--Bill Bradley from New Jersey, Fritz Hollings from South Carolina and yours truly. I want that put on my epitaph. 
As the deficits began to soar, first to $100 billion and then later to $200 billion, that was scary. That was scary, Mr. President, when we doubled the national debt of $1 trillion, which has taken us 200 years to accumulate, and all of a sudden the first 4 years of Ronald Reagan's administration we doubled it. We did not balance the budget, we doubled the national debt, and people were scared. That is when President Reagan said, `What we need is a line-item veto. If you will just give me a line-item veto, I can balance the budget.' 
Every thinking person knew at that time that you weren't going to balance the budget with a line-item veto. 
I can remember when entitlements represented almost as much as the entire income to the Federal Government. I used to do a study every year on seven programs: defense, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the debt, Civil Service pensions and one other thing which eludes me. Seven things. When you added those seven things up, not counting any other discretionary spending, you used up virtually all of the income the Federal Government had. To suggest that a line-item veto could be used to bring this budget into balance in light of those kinds of statistics was absolutely inane, if not insane. 
I can remember when I ran for reelection in 1986, the question was always--of course, first of all, I had to face prayer in school. But you know something, Mr. President, with my constituents, I was the only southern Senator who voted against a constitutional amendment for prayer in school. When I explained to my constituents why I voted against it, I got 62 percent of the vote. That sounds like a boast. I don't mean that. All I am saying is, when people hear common sense, they respond in a commonsensical way. 
Not only was I having to defend myself against prayer in school, I was having to defend myself against the so-called line-item veto. Why do you not want the President to have the right to stop all those pork projects? It was like Gerald Ford said when he was first elected President. He learned early on the difference between those very meritorious projects out in his district in Michigan and all those poor projects in the rest of the country. 
The point is, every analysis that was done of the Federal budget showed that if a line-item veto were used to the very maximum, it would have a minuscule effect on the deficit. It was nothing but a distraction, but a very politically popular one. A lot of us who stood up for the Constitution paid dearly. We were abused politically by admittedly unsophisticated people, well-meaning people, but people who really did not understand the Constitution, which says Congress shall pass a bill and present it to the President. It did not say for the President to pick and choose what he wants. It said he shall sign it or not sign it. If he does not sign it, he can veto it. Approve or not approve, those were his options. 
The President has the right and the power--he has the bully pulpit. Anytime the appropriations committees are meeting in the U.S. Senate, the President can call over here and say, `If you put this, this, this and this in that bill, I am going to veto it.' I have seen Presidents do it a lot of times. Bill Clinton does it all the time. 
Do you know what we do? We normally take it out because we do not want the bill vetoed. That is a Presidential prerogative. But John Adams, James Madison, people who drafted the Constitution, would be whirling in their graves if they knew this body passed such a piece of legislation as the line-item-veto bill. 
Mr. President, I feel badly sometimes when I talk the way I am talking right now, because a lot of well-meaning Senators really believed in the line-item veto, I think. I don't mean to denigrate 
anybody who disagrees with me on this. It is just that I feel so strongly about the Constitution. 
I have to say, the Congress is the worst place in the world for trivializing the Constitution. It is incredible the things that people come up with. There was even a resolution in 1976 in the House of Representatives saying it shall be unconstitutional for any President to run who hasn't got enough sense to get out of a hail of bullets. Not out of the rain, out of a hail of bullets. 
Mr. President, 11,000 resolutions have been submitted in the Congress since this great Nation was founded--11,000--to change the Constitution. If you take the Bill of Rights out, to the eternal credit of both Congress and the American people, we have only tinkered with it 17 times. No thanks to Congress, in one way, because there have been plenty of efforts, 11,000 efforts, to amend the Constitution, the greatest organic law in the world. 
So every time we get a chance to do something politically popular, it is always the Constitution that suffers, that magnificent document crafted by the greatest assemblage of minds under one roof in the history of the world. People around here treat it as though it is a rough draft. 
I do not want to wait for the Supreme Court to declare the line-item veto unconstitutional, which they will surely do. I want the people who passed the line-item veto bill in the first place to repeal it. It is our solemn duty to undo one of the most miserable mistakes we have ever made. 
I spoke to some of my good friends who supported that thing, and now they tell me they supported it because they believed there would be a new President in 1996--I must say a lot of people voted for the line-item veto because they thought Ronald Reagan would have been elected forever for life. Nobody ever thought about William Jefferson Clinton being in the White House when the line-item veto took effect, and he likes it. He had it when he was Governor. I was Governor of Arkansas before he was and I liked it. I used it. I used to call those legislators up and say, `You know that vo-tech school down there in your hometown. There is $250,000 in this budget. If you don't get down there and behave, there isn't going to be any vo-tech school in your hometown.' If you want to straighten up a legislator's conduct, that is the way to do it. 
As I say, I am not being cute about this, I am just simply saying I am going to vote to sustain the President's veto, because I want the line-item veto to be painful enough that a majority of the people in this body will be willing to undo a miserable mistake we made. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon not just in support of but in strong support of the nomination of Dr. David Satcher to be Surgeon General of the United States. 
I also want to state that I have a personal prejudice because I have worked closely with Dr. Satcher over the last 5 years since he became head of the Centers for Disease Control. 
There is a current cute saying making the rounds in Washington, and unhappily it is true. This is the only nation on Earth where a person is presumed innocent until they receive a Presidential nomination. 
We have had a lot of contentious debate on this floor about various nominations. I have not participated in many of those debates. But I am participating and I will continue to participate in the nomination of Dr. Satcher because I think he is one of the finest medical people in the United States. I also happen to think that he is one of the finest men, one of the finest people in the United States. I believe that the President could not have chosen better for this position. 
Mr. President, it is a real travesty to me that people who want to serve their Government in a position such as this are subjected to such a contentious process. Admittedly, the position of surgeon general doesn't have a lot of clout, but it does have a lot of public relations value. There are a lot of public appearances made by the Surgeon General. They take a lot of different positions on medical techniques and medical practices in this country. In some respects, I can sympathize with the Senator from Missouri who is opposed to this nomination, apparently based on Dr. Satcher's presumed feelings about the issue of partial-birth abortion. I happen to agree with Dr. Satcher on partial-birth abortions, but I recognize it is a very, very difficult moral question for everyone. I also have to confess to the Senate that I voted against Dr. Koop's confirmation to be Surgeon General because of his position on that issue, and have lived until this day to regret my vote because he turned out to be one of the greatest surgeon generals this country has ever had. I didn't know Dr. Koop. If I had known him maybe I would have voted differently. 
I do know Dr. Satcher in a very personal, intimate way because I have worked closely with him for 4 years. But aside from that, I ask my colleagues to look at his credentials. Look at the life of this African American who has risen from a poor rural community to become prominent, to become a role model. He went to Morehouse College, the same school Dr. Martin Luther King graduated from. Do you know what he did there? He was Phi Beta Kappa, which means that intellectually he was superior; a good student. From there he went on to get his MD and Ph.D. from Case Western Reserve in Cleveland. He did that in 1970, and then went into a career of academic and public health medicine. 
So far that is pretty impressive, is it not? A man who has spent his entire life since 1970 in public health and was a Phi Beta Kappa with the highest degrees you can get in medicine. After he graduated he served on the faculty at the UCLA Medical School, and as Dean of Family Medicine at King-Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was then appointed president of Meharry Medical College in 1982. He was President of Meharry Medical College until 1993 until President Clinton chose him to head up the Centers for Disease Control, an agency to which we turn time and time again every year. Whether there is an EColi breakout, or a virus breakout in Africa, or whether it is mad cow disease in England, or whether it is an avian flu virus in the chickens of Hong Kong, it is the Centers for Disease Control who the world calls on, and they respond. They respond always in a very professional and effective way. 
I don't know what else may be involved in this, other than partial-birth abortions. I have heard that some people take exception to the role of the Centers for Disease Control in 
conducting research in developing countries aimed at reducing transmission of HIV from pregnant mothers to newborns through AZT therapy. Let me say, first of all, that tests to measure the effectiveness of long-term AZT therapy on pregnant women were started long before Dr. Satcher came to the Centers for Disease Control. Let me also say those tests were expanded upon to measure the effectiveness of short-term drug therapy, because the public health infrastructure in Africa could not support the longer-term regimen. Getting AZT to pregnant African women during their entire pregnancy was almost impossible because of logistics. It was just not practical. The short-term regimen provides massive doses to pregnant women just before they deliver. And it is this short-term approach that holds out hope for the thousands of HIV-infected children who are born in Africa each week. In every experiment, the health ministers of each African country in which the trials were conducted approved the study design. 
But whether you like that or whether you do not like that, or whether you don't think the tests should have been conducted, or if they were not conducted correctly, the entire process started long before Dr. Satcher came to CDC. And the process was a joint effort of NIH, CDC and the World Health Organization. And what difference should it make when we consider the nomination of this outstanding candidate for the post of surgeon general? 
Mr. President, there is also controversy on the question of preventing AIDS transmission through needle exchange and on the issue of making condoms available in public schools. Regarding the former, Dr. Satcher has said that science rather than politics should determine our policy. On the issue of condoms, Dr. Satcher has stated that such decisions should be made in local communities by parents, teachers and community leaders. Who here can disagree with those positions? 
Mr. President, on the issue of partial-birth abortion, the American Medical Association came out and said they are opposed to it but here is what they say about Dr. Satcher.  
The American Medical Association continues to enthusiastically support Dr. David Satcher . . .' [The surgon general's office] `has been vacant far too long,' [and] `the American public needs a credible voice they can turn to in times of a public health crisis. . . . We urge Congress to look at the totality of Dr. Satcher's expertise and experience. He is a physician, administrator, educator, and outstanding public health leader. 
Why is it we turn to the agencies like the AMA when we agree with them and want to ignore them when we don't agree with them? 
Mr. President, I want to go back to say that Betty Bumpers, my wife, and I have devoted a large part of our public life, which now spans 27 years, to improving the immunization of children. It was Betty's idea. It was not mine. And until this day she is extremely active. She and Roslyn Carter have their own program, and have had it for 7 years, called `Every Child by Two.' They go around the country and work with governors and community groups to educate parents and providers on the importance of immunizing our young children by age two. I have paid close attention to CDC's immunization program ever since I came to the Senate, and over the past five years under Dr. Satcher's leadership, our nation has achieved the highest immunization levels and the lowest rates of childhood disease in our country's recorded history. What parent in the United States wouldn't take great pride in that achievement? What Senator would not applaud Dr. Satcher for the role he has played in eradicating polio from the Western Hemisphere? Who would not applaud Dr. Satcher's efforts to eliminate polio in Africa? The elimination of polio in the United States alone saves the taxpayers of this country $250 million a year. He had whooping cough when he was a child. It made an indelible impression on him, and it was the reason he went into medicine. 
So when I think of the many conversations and meetings I have had with Dr. Satcher in my office, he is always at the highest professional level. I have never heard him utter a statement that didn't reflect credit on him personally and didn't reflect credit on his total commitment to the health of the people of the United States. What in the name of God else do you want--would we reject a man who came up from nothing to become one of the preeminent medical people in this country simply because we disagree with him on one or two things? 
I notice people who do not want Washington telling them what to do often want Washington to tell the rest of the country what to do. If an atheist invented a cure for cancer, would you refuse to take it because he was an atheist? Of course you wouldn't. 
That is the kind of logic we are confronted with here because you may disagree on a policy that really is not a policy. You want to deprive this man of the post that the President nominated him for. And what did he say in answer to a letter from Senator Frist from Tennessee? What did he say to Senator Frist about the issue of partial-birth abortion? I see Senator Frist on the floor. He knows exactly what he said and it is this: 
Let me say unequivocally that I have no intention of using the position of Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon General to promote issues related to abortion. I share no one's political agenda, and I want to use the power of these positions to focus on issues that unite Americans--not divide them. If confirmed by the Senate, I will strongly promote a message of abstinence and responsibility to our youth, which I believe can help reduce the number of abortions in our country. 
Where can you find a more noble or professional statement than that? 
I say to my colleagues: Let us not divide ourselves over an appointment of this importance and destroy a man who has devoted his entire life to the well-being of the children of this country as well as its adults. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President. 
Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to resolve a serious problem facing consumers and Main Street businesses in America. This problem allows consumers to be misled regarding their tax liabilities and puts Main Street businesses at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis out-of-State companies. The problem of which I speak is the loophole that allows companies to ship goods across State lines without collecting the taxes due on those goods. 
My bill, The Consumer and Main Street Protection Act of 1998, will give States the option if they choose, of removing this unfair advantage enjoyed by out-of-State companies. The legal effect will be to authorize a State or local jurisdiction to require out-of-State companies to collect use taxes on sales of personal property delivered into that State or local jurisdiction, if that State taxes its own citizens on retail sales. 
This bill does not create a new tax. Indeed, it doesn't create a tax at all. It merely deals with how existing taxes are collected. Specifically, it would allow States, if they choose, to shift the burden of collecting and remitting use taxes from the consumer to the company. 
At this point, I should clarify the meaning of the term `use tax.' A use tax is a tax on goods purchased in one jurisdiction for use in another jurisdiction. For example, goods purchased in Tennessee for use in Arkansas are subject to an Arkansas use tax. Use taxes are used to keep people from avoiding sales taxes. If a State doesn't have a use tax, its citizens can avoid paying sales taxes by making purchases in another State. By imposing a use tax equal to its sales tax, States can remove the incentive to engage in tax circumvention. 
Therefore, in the 45 States which presently have sales and use taxes, consumers are legally obligated to pay those taxes, whether the purchases are made at a local department store, via mail order, or over the internet. Unfortunately, catalog companies typically do not make their customers aware of this obligation--in fact, some mislead customers into believing that out-of-State purchases are `tax free.' This, of course, is patently false. The company may be exempt from collecting use taxes, but the customer is still liable for paying those taxes directly to the State revenue department on every out-of-State purchase. 
This situation causes three serious problems. First, consumers are often shocked to discover that their `tax-free' purchase is not really tax free. State revenue departments inform tens of thousands of consumers every year of this sad fact. The consumer finds he is liable for back taxes, interest and penalties. 
Second, Main Street retailers are placed in an unfair position vis-a-vis mail order houses. This occurs because mail order products if no tax is collected, are cheaper than if bought in Main Street department stores. Not only do most mail order houses not collect use taxes, they don't tell their customers that they are legally liable to pay the tax. 
Third, State and local governments lose revenues because billions of dollars of the taxes are never collected. According to the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, State and local governments lose over $3.3 billion a year for this reason. This occurs, even as mail order companies impose significant costs on State and local governments by sending an avalanche of catalogs and product packaging to municipal landfills. Every year over 3 million tons of third class mail, most of which is catalogs, goes to landfills in this country. This is not surprising considering the billions of catalogs which consumers receive in the mail every year. One company alone, Fingerhut, Inc., mails out nearly 500 million catalogs annually. With mail order sales growing by approximately 6 percent per year, this burden on State and local government will increase significantly in coming years.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, prior to introducing my bill, let me just lend my support to the remarks just made by the Senator from South Carolina. He and the Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, have made speech after speech after speech on the floor of this body about how we do not have truth in budgeting. We do not have a balanced budget. We are not even close to a balanced budget and are not going to be for some time to come. And the idea of people talking about tax cuts or using the budget surplus, which does not exist, to using that surplus to cut taxes or to increase spending is an absolute absurdity. 
I think this year, 1998, we are anticipating a $100 billion surplus in Social Security. So I lend my support to what the President said the other night. And I lend my support to what the Senator from South Carolina just said.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, on September 23 of this year, my colleague, Senator Cochran, chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies, rose on the floor of the Senate to express objection to a provision of the FDA reform bill that would direct the appropriations subcommittee to provide established levels for salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration through fiscal year 2002. If the appropriations bills did not meet those levels, referred to as trigger, the FDA would not be able to collect or use receipts authorized by the Prescription Drug User Fee Act [PDUFA]. The effect of the provision Senator Cochran found so troublesome would have been to place a budgetary gun to the head of the appropriations subcommittee under threat of PDUFA fees not being collected and the Nation's drug approval process placed at risk. As ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee, I shared Senator Cochran's concerns, but honestly hoped that the problem he highlighted would be corrected before we were faced with final passage of the conference report on FDA reform. While the conference report before us today does provide some relief in fiscal years 2001 and 2002 from the earlier Senate language, I am still disappointed that more progress was not achieved to inject a greater dose of realism into the expectations of the FDA authorization committees of the House and Senate. 
I do not mean to detract from the very important work of the FDA nor to minimize the need to push ahead aggressively with drug approvals. I equally appreciate the concerns of the prescription drug industry, which will be responsible for paying the PDUFA fees, that their considerable contributions will be used to supplement, not supplant, the drug approval process. However, an unfortunate charade has been employed to suggest the language now contained in FDA reform is going to protect, in fact guarantee, increases in the level of Federal funds appropriated for FDA drug approvals. I must point out to my colleagues that the language before us does nothing to assure that very goal and I feel compelled to highlight the provision's failing. 
FDA reform would require the appropriations bills for fiscal years 1999 through 2002 to provide levels for the FDA salaries and expenses account at levels no lower than the fiscal year 1997 level adjusted by the lesser of inflation based on the consumer price index or changes in growth of national domestic discretionary spending. The FDA salaries and expenses account contains funding for all activities of FDA, including drug approvals, subject to an appropriation other than amounts for buildings and facilities. The FDA reform legislation contains no requirement that FDA allocate any portion of the salaries and expenses account for drug approvals. Therefore, while our appropriations subcommittee may comply with the full letter of FDA reform requirement, that act alone would provide no assurance to the drug industry that the FDA appropriation would be used as they expect. FDA certainly has other pressing budgetary demands such as the need to account for the rental space arrearage for which the General Services Administration is threatening action against FDA, and continued work on tobacco issues. FDA will also need increased attention in the area of food safety which continuing headlines, such as that appearing in the Washington Post this weekend about the more than 700 people made ill by contaminated food in southern Maryland, will no doubt place greater workload on the agency. An arbitrary appropriation trigger will produce no magic bullet aimed solely at the problem of drug approval backlogs.

Mr. BUMPERS. I have included this history of funding to show how the amount of appropriations for FDA salaries and expenses has increased every single year since fiscal year 1988 except for the period between fiscal year 1995 and fiscal year 1997 when the level was held at a freeze. I also want to note that the 3-year period connecting fiscal year 1995 and fiscal year 1997 was a period in which the 602(b) allocation to our subcommittee fell by 11 percent. I hope my colleagues see in this history a commitment by our subcommittee to recognize the importance of FDA's activities. Further, I hope my colleagues see that even during a time when nearly all other programs under our jurisdiction had to take significant reductions, FDA was held harmless. I believe this history reflects well on the commitment and good faith of our subcommittee. 
An obvious result of the provision contained in FDA reform will be continuing further reductions in other programs under the jurisdiction of our subcommittee. Those programs will again have to suffer unless, in the unlikely event, we receive substantial increases in our future 602(b) allocations. There are many, many other programs for which our subcommittee is responsible that are important to people and communities all across the Nation. Our bill provides funding for all activities at the U.S. Department of Agriculture--except the Forest Service--and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. At USDA alone, there are hundreds of programs essential to rural and urban America that will be harmed, again, if our subcommittee is expected to provide FDA, and FDA only, with inflation increases through fiscal year 2002. USDA programs have already been radically cut by our subcommittee over the past several years while, as noted above, FDA was provided substantial increases or, at least, held constant. 
I understand a few other proposals were suggested, and rejected, during consideration of the FDA reform legislation. One proposal was to hold FDA to a freeze, something which we have shown we have done historically. Another proposal would have specifically protected the FDA activities for drug approvals. That approach would have better addressed the concerns I outlined above. I understand this proposal to protect FDA drug approvals was rejected due to objections from nondrug related industries concerned that FDA resources might be transferred from their own specific priority areas to drug approvals. Ironically, that is the same concern I have heard from groups fearful about what the provision in FDA reform will do to USDA and CFTC programs. 
Mr. President, at times I feel there is an outright assault on the appropriations process. Too many times in recent years we have seen requirements imposed on the Appropriations Committee by other legislative and procedural vehicles that continuously impairs our ability to respond to agency needs and responsibilities to our states and the American people. Based on administration projections, the trigger mechanism contained in FDA reform would force the appropriations subcommittee to increase the FDA salaries and expense account from the current $857 to $876 million in fiscal year 2002. According to the President's 1998 budget, the projected request for FDA salaries and expenses for fiscal year 2002 is only $691 million. This is a difference of nearly $200 million, an amount worthy of deliberate consideration by the appropriations subcommittee. Additionally, the FDA reform provision does not account for the possibility of a tobacco settlement that might replace current appropriations expenditures, consolidation of food safety functions in some agency other than FDA, or other potential changes that would affect, and possibly reduce, the budgetary requirements of FDA. Even though the provision does attach the trigger to the lesser of the consumer price index or changes in the growth of national domestic discretionary spending, there is no guarantee that any increase in overall domestic discretionary totals will be reflected in the 602(b) allocation for our subcommittee. 
For the coming year, I can assure my colleagues that I will work with Senator Cochran and others to assess the requests of all agencies and departments that will come before our subcommittee. I strongly believe that we have been fair in our setting of priorities and that we will continue to consider the merits of all requests in order to balance the fiscal demands and resources in a manner consistent with our abilities, good judgment, and the recommendations of all Senators.

<TEXT>
Mr. BUMPERS. First of all, when I was Governor of my State, one of the first orders I issued was that any employee of the Arkansas Revenue Department would be summarily fired if it was found that that employee, without provocation, was rude to a taxpayer. And within 3 weeks we fired one employee, and it had an unbelievable impact on the conduct of everybody else. We had very little trouble out of the revenue department during my 4 years as Governor. 
No. 2, insofar as the Speaker's proposal to spend a minimum of $30 million doing a survey, sending out a questionnaire to the taxpayers of this country asking how do you feel about your taxes and how do you feel about the IRS, I can save him that $30 million. I already know the answer. Every Member of this body knows the answer to that question. People think they are overtaxed and they think the IRS is filled with a bunch of arrogant bureaucrats whose whole purpose in life is to make people miserable. 
Finally, my question concerns this matter of attorney fees. Could you tell us what the criteria is in tax court? Let me walk through a case. 
Let's say the IRS sends you a notice and says we have determined in looking over your tax return that you owe us an additional $5,000, and here is why. And you write back and say I disagree. At that point, the burden is on you to prove that you don't owe $5,000, and under this bill the burden will remain on you to prove that you don't owe $5,000. 
If the IRS feels that they have won the argument, that you in fact do owe $5,000, and they refuse to relent, the normal method for you to challenge that is for you to pay the $5,000 and then go to tax court to recover it. Is that a fair statement?

Mr. BUMPERS. Let me ask you this question. Let's say we have a criminal case where the IRS charges you with tax evasion, that is, deliberately defrauding the Federal Government by evading or cheating on your income tax return. Then the U.S. attorney's office will indict you and haul you into court for a criminal trial. 
At that point the IRS, of course, does have to sustain the 
burden, is that not correct?

Mr. BUMPERS. I don't know the answer either. I think under existing law, and certainly under the Hyde amendment, you would be entitled to attorney fees if you were--I forget the exact language, something to the effect that if you have been frivolously or vexatiously charged and tried, you are entitled to attorney fees. But there is an existing statute which provides attorney fees if the court decides that this case should never have been brought, and several other criteria. 
But I just wondered if this bill changed any of that regarding criminal trials.

Mr. BUMPERS. Senator, if I could just make one last comment. This is not in defense of the IRS, just simply an observation. The truth of the matter is a lot of people resent the taxes they have to pay. That is a given. My salary is paid by the taxpayers, but every April 15 I get a little vexed, just like every other taxpayer does, about what I have to pay. But having said that, I think it would be remiss if we didn't point out that we lose $100 billion a year in taxes to the Federal Treasury by people who defraud the system, the underground economy. 
Consider the fact that 1997, this year, the people of this country will pay about $650 billion in personal income tax. 
The corporate tax, as you know, yields much less than that. But just take the personal income tax. If we are losing $100 billion from people who absolutely refuse to live by the law--and that is who IRS ought to be after, of course--that is one of the reasons the rest of us have to pay more, because a lot of people don't. 
I just wanted to make that point and to say I think the IRS generally tries its best to collect the appropriate amount of taxes. The thing that gets all of us in more trouble than anything else is when honest, hard-working people are pilloried by a bureaucratic agent or auditor from the IRS. The agent may be right. It is usually not so much a question of whether the agent is right or not; it is their conduct that is offensive to people, and that is one of the reasons their public relations is so poor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise to day to introduce the Transition to Electric Competition Act of 1997 along with my colleague from the State of Washington, Senator Gorton. This bill provides for the transition toward deregulation and competition in the electric utility industry. 
While few people find a discussion of the electric utility industry and the many laws and regulations governing the industry exciting, the fact is that electricity is an extremely important commodity which affects everyone on a daily basis. Any event that increases or reduces electric rates can impact: First, the lives of the poor and those on fixed incomes that depend on electricity to heat their homes in the winter and cool them in the summer; second, the price of goods we buy every day; as well as third, the competitiveness of our factories. In addition, decisions made by electric generators often have a direct effect on our environment as well as our energy security. 
It is not at all inconsequential that the electric utility industry, which has remained relatively static for the last 60 years, is undergoing a fundamental change. Instead of the traditional vertically integrated local utility, which generates power at its own plants, transmits that power over its own lines and sells that power to all consumers in a particular area, consumers in some States are starting to be bombarded with all sorts of offers from companies competing to become their power supplier, and other entrepreneurs will be seeking to buy large blocks of power to serve certain kinds of consumers. Naturally, these changes are bound to create considerable apprehension among both utilities and consumers. 
Mr. President, in January I introduced S. 237, the Electric Consumers Protection Act, because I believed that retail electric competition was inevitable and Federal legislation was necessary to ensure that certain consumers were not disadvantaged in the process. Several States were proceeding to introduce competition in their jurisdictions and a number of others were examining the matter. Since that time I have become even more convinced that competition is on the horizon. Eleven States have now enacted legislation or issued regulations requiring retail competition by a time certain. Almost every other State currently has the matter under review. 
Some argue that there is no need for the Federal Government to intervene; that the States are doing just fine on their own and they should decide when and how to proceed with retail electric competition. Mr. President, I couldn't disagree more.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Washington State for his eloquent remarks. I just wanted to say how honored I am to have him join me on this bill, and reiterate one other thing because Senator Gorton and I want to be totally honest to the people of this country as we go forward with this bill. 
I think one thing that I must say is that, in my opinion, this $220 billion industry can cope with this bill--not only cope with it, but that industry, business, and the consumers of this country will all benefit from this, and the Nation will benefit because it is a global economy where we are competing so strenuously with the other nations of the world. 
Electricity is such a big part of our producing industry, and the less they pay the more competitive we become. That ought to be a real incentive for the people of this body to look very seriously at this bill.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, from 1993 to 1997, the Navy retired seven Los Angeles class attack submarines--seven in that 4-year period. In that same period, we were in the process of building three Seawolf submarines at a cost of $13.2 billion. Not one of those submarines that we have decommissioned, all of which had a 30-year life expectancy, not one that we retired had less than 12 years left on its life expectancy, and several of them had 14 years left on their life expectancy. 
In that same period of time, we retired two nuclear-powered guided-missile cruisers, the Virginia and the Mississippi. Both of those ships had 20 years left on their life expectancy. And just last month, the Navy decommissioned another Virginia class guided missile cruiser, the U.S.S. Arkansas. That ship is near and dear to my heart because my wife Betty christened it. The U.S.S. Arkansas, incidentally, had sailed for only 18 years, and had a life expectancy of 20 years left on it. CGN-41. That stands for cruiser, guided missile, nuclear. 
In that same period of time, 1993 to 1997, we decommissioned five frigates, everyone of which had anywhere from 14 to 16 years left on their 35-year life expectancy. 
In that same period of time, we also decommissioned nine guided-missile frigates, every one of which, but one, had a 21-year life expectancy left. 
Now, Mr. President, the Navy and the Pentagon has told the Defense Subcommittee on Appropriations on which I sit, as does the Presiding Officer, that tight budgets were requiring them to do more with less and that we are wearing out our ships and exhausting our crews because of the high operating tempo we are demanding of them. 
I have had reason to reevaluate what those officials have told us. First, Congress added $720 million to the 1998 defense budget to increase from three to four the number of DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class destroyers we will buy this year. The Arleigh Burke destroyer is a very fine ship, and it carries the Aegis air defense system. But let me repeat that this extra ship cost $720 million. 
Secondly, I learned, as I said, that the Navy would retire the U.S.S. Arkansas while it still has 20 years of useful life left. That ship is now being broken up for scrap. 
You have to ask yourself, why are we retiring perfectly good multimission surface ships when the cost for a comparable new ship is staggering? So I decided to look into this early warship retirement, and here are some of the things I have learned. 
Those ships that I mentioned that we retired between 1993 and 1997, the five regular frigates and nine guided-missile frigates and the two nuclear-powered guided-missile cruisers and the Los Angeles attack submarines, all of those ships, as I said, had 12 to 21 years left on their lives. During that same period of time, Congress appropriated about $18 billion to acquire two new submarines and 16 Arleigh Burke destroyers. 
It seems to me that this is awfully penny-wise and pound-foolish to be retiring these ships and spending so much to replacing them with fewer ships. We could keep a lot more ships in service at a lot less cost if we canceled or delayed procurement of just one or two of the submarines or destroyers the Navy plans to buy over the next 4 years. 
Listen to this. It costs $200 million to refuel a Los Angeles class submarine and about $30 million a year to operate it. So the Navy could refuel three Los Angeles attack submarines and operate them until the year 2014, 16 to 17 years from now, for the price of buying one New Attack Submarine. 
In addition, it costs about $25 million a year to operate a guided-missile frigate. So, for the cost of the one Arleigh Burke destroyer that we added to the fiscal 1998 budget, the Navy could operate three Perry class frigates until the year 2007. 
I know that the Los Angeles class submarine is not quite as good as a Seawolf, or New Attack Submarine. I know a guided-missile cruiser or frigate is not quite as capable as an Arleigh Burke destroyer, but those older classes were good enough for the cold war when they were expected to cope with a highly sophisticated air and sea threat from the Warsaw Pact. 
Here are some comments by Admiral J. Paul Reason, the Commander in Chief of the Atlantic fleet. You don't have to listen to what I have to say, but listen to what the commander of the Atlantic fleet has to say, Admiral Reason. He says, according to the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot, that the fleet might be better served by cheaper ships in greater quantity: `I would rather have three hulls that have one-third the capability of an Arleigh Burke.' 
If from a pure military standpoint three cheaper ships are sometimes better than one expensive new one, why are we spending money mothballing or scrapping perfectly good ships with a 20-year life expectancy and then spending staggering sums to build new ones? 
Mr. President, I am not going to pursue this. The question is very simple. I intend to get into it in depth next year when we have hearings before the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee with the Navy. But I will tell you--and I serve notice on them right now--I will tell you what I think is going on. I don't think that the reasons given us are legitimate. They make no sense to me. I am not, admittedly, a Navy man, but when you look at the dollars and cents and when you look at the threat and you look at the life expectancy on magnificent ships--I can vouch for the U.S.S. Arkansas, I have been on it more than once, and it hasn't been that long ago when it was the state of the art. And I don't buy this business that we have to pay any price to get the absolute added technological edge on every one of our systems. 
This is a terribly expensive program the Navy is undertaking, doing away with perfectly good ships, with long lives left, to replace then with fewer hugely expensive ships. I agree with the admiral down in Norfolk when he says that sometimes he would rather have three cheaper ships that will do one-third of the job than have one ship to replace them. 
So I think that what we are doing is retiring perfectly good ships in order to keep the shipyards of America working. 
What does that mean? It means we have a lot of people in this body who have shipyards in their jurisdictions, and they want to keep those jobs busy. I understand that. If I had one in my State, I would be wanting those workers to stay busy, too. 
But I tell you the enormous cost to the taxpayers of this, in my view, is nothing short of outrageous. I do not buy the rationale for it. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this morning, I was reading the New York Times and came across an article truly exhilarating to me. It dealt with a matter that the Presiding Officer is all too familiar with, too. A number of large States are in the process of negotiating an agreement with some of the biggest mail order houses in the country, under which those mail order houses will, in the future, pay sales tax on merchandise they send into States that have either a use tax or a sales tax. 
It was in the 1992 Quill decision the Supreme Court ruled that Congress could authorize the States to require collection of sales and use taxes by mail order houses shipping goods across State lines. But Congress would have to make that decision formally by legislation. 
So I sponsored such legislation because I was a former small town merchant--I practiced law, I ran cattle, I had a small hardware retail and appliance store, and I even owned a cemetery one time, Mr. President. I did anything I could do to make money. Even back in those days, a lot of people ordered things from catalogs. I resented it. I was on Main Street collecting sales taxes, paying a corporate franchise tax to the city, paying all the taxes that make a decent place to live, and I was being competed against by people from other States who paid nothing. 
In 1994, and again in 1995, I introduced legislation to authorize the mandated collection of interstate sales taxes. I got a vote on it and, of course, didn't get nearly enough to pass. Everybody got up and wept and wailed and said, `This is another tax, all you tax and spenders.' As I say, I did it because I am a 
former retailer and I resented having to compete against people who did not have to collect a sales tax, which gave them a big competitive advantage on big-ticket items like refrigerators, television sets, and so on. So I admit I came into the debate because of my personal experience. But I also felt very strongly that equity was on my side. 
I never will forget the distinguished junior Senator from Utah, in a Small Business Committee hearing one day, making a point, after having heard several mail order catalog executives talk about how this was going to be a terrible burden on them and some of them would go broke, and it was an impossible administrative nightmare to collect taxes for 50 different States and a lot more jurisdictions than that because cities and counties also have sales taxes. I will never forget the little lecture that the Senator from Utah delivered, describing his own personal experiences, and that it had not been a burden for his company. I will always be grateful to the Senator for having helped out so magnificently that morning. 
Now, Mr. President, annual catalog sales are approximately $210 billion. Now, there are a few good citizens like Home Shopping Network who collect sales taxes on everything they sell. But most do not collect the taxes except when their physical presence creates a nexus with the State which requires that collection activity. 
Let me explain that requirement. If a mail order firm has a physical presence in a State, the State may require that firm to collect sales taxes on the goods it sells in the State. If a company has a presence, for example, in the State of Arkansas and sells something through their mail order catalog to an Arkansan, the physical presence of that shop in Arkansas requires them to collect sales tax on any mail order sales to the Arkansas resident. But if they do not have a presence in Arkansas, they can send all the merchandise they want to into the State and not collect a dime in sales tax. 
It is also unfair to the State and local governments which bear increased burdens because of mail order activity. For example, every year million of tons of catalogs go into the municipal landfills of this country, and State and local governments must pay for that. I think much of that comes to my house every year, frankly. Here it is, getting close to Christmas, and every night when I go home, I can't open my front door because there are so many catalogs behind it. But yet mail order companies pay virtually nothing to help States dispose of those millions of tons of waste. 
So, Mr. President, I have always felt that this was terribly unfair to Main Street merchants in America. There is not a great incentive to avoid taxes on small ticket items, but on big ticket items there is a huge incentive. A few States, like Wisconsin and Maine, have put a provision in their State income tax return for taxpayers to list the value of merchandise purchased through mail order. 
Last year, Wisconsin collected $1.3 million from that provision. But there is no telling what the State should have collected had all mail order sales taxes been collected. The $1.3 million came from people who were honest and voluntarily put on their State tax return what they purchased by mail order catalog and paid the sales tax on it. But there is no way the States can enforce an effective sales tax collection system on mail order goods. Forty-five States impose sales taxes on mail order purchases, but they have no effective way to collect it. 
Sometimes the States do collect the taxes on big-ticket items, however, and then the customer gets a rude awakening. I remember the story of a family in Florida which went up to North Carolina and bought some $25,000 worth of furniture because that company in North Carolina had advertised no sales tax. The family furnished their entire house all with new furniture, loaded it onto a van, and took it back. And, lo and behold, they were stopped at the Florida border and had sales tax assessed against them. The tax came to several hundred dollars, and it was a rude shock to that couple. There are a number of illustrations like that. 
But I do not want to take up too much of the Senate's time on this issue. All I want to say is that when mail order companies fail to collect sales taxes on their sales, it is unfair for the Main Street companies who do collect such taxes. It is not right for some to do it and the rest to be exempt. Now this agreement, which will reportedly be announced tomorrow between the largest States and the largest mail order houses, is a giant step in the right direction. I do not want to say anything tonight that would in the least hinder those people negotiating that agreement from finishing it. On the contrary, I applaud them, I thank them for doing what is right. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I came over to speak on a beautiful, lazy Friday afternoon--that is one of the times you can get the floor without having to sit around too long--and talk about three or four items that I have just been reflecting on--nothing heavy. 
But to take up campaign finance reform first, that issue has had the Senate tied in knots, now, for about 6 weeks, so tied in knots that we are not going to be able to finish the work that we ought to finish, particularly on the highway transportation bill, and that is a real tragedy. Nevertheless, I have felt very strongly about this issue for a long time, so strongly that earlier this year I introduced my own bill to provide for public financing of campaigns. 
I think I could probably say without fear of contradiction--and at my age I am not likely to live long enough to see this country go to public financing--and yet in my opinion that is the only solution: If you take all private money out of financing of campaigns in this country then you know that any private money in a campaign is a violation. 
Senator Thompson has just announced--essentially announced--the shutting down of the hearings on campaign finance reform. Nobody's fault--I thought Senator Thompson did a credible job. I thought all the members of the committee did. But there really was not very much there, except occasional abuses, cases of neglect, inattention, and heavy partisanship, but very little in a way that could remotely be construed as illegal. Yet, for all the abuses--and there were some--uncovered and testified to and about during those hearings, there is not any strong sentiment here to change the system under which those abuses occurred. If we do nothing this year, we do nothing next year, you can rest assured the abuses will continue. 
I come from the Democratic Party. Of course, when it comes to raising money, we are a threatened species. But completely aside from the politics of the issue--and the fact is that the Republicans outraise us--I think our Democratic National Committee is in debt by $15 million. I saw a big story in the paper this morning that the Democratic National Committee was going to raise $2.5 million at a retreat in Florida this weekend, and the story acted as though there was something ominous and maybe certainly unethical about it. But it didn't seem that way to me at all, not under the existing system. There is nothing wrong with people giving $50,000 a couple to attend a weekend retreat. That is a pretty steep price, but people do it every weekend in both parties. The price is just not normally that high. 
But I also feel that as long as we allow that sort of thing to continue, we are effectively selling off the Government to the highest bidder. I said on the floor, and it bears repeating, you cannot expect a democracy to function as it is supposed to function when money plays the role it plays in our campaigns. So, I hope that, come next March or whenever they have agreed to, if there has been such an agreement, that we can address the McCain-Feingold bill. I am a cosponsor of the bill, but I must say it pales compared to what I think ought to be done, namely go to public financing and take private money out of it. 
I saw a list in the Washington Post yesterday of all the incumbents and how much money they had in the bank and how much the challengers had. And the incumbents are all friends of mine. This is not to belittle them. They are simply taking advantage of the system as it is. But the incumbents have millions in the bank and the challengers had virtually nothing. As a country lawyer from a town of 1,200 people who jumped up from a private practice to run for Governor--which most people considered insane, trying to get me to submit to a saliva test--believe you me, I know the power of incumbency and I faced it. 
In the first primary, I spent $90,000. You couldn't get on the evening news for a week for that today. 
I don't want to get too preachy about it. This is something you can get preachy about. But the fact is, I see campaign finance reform now in a different way than I saw it even as recently as 2 or 3 years ago. I see it now as a real threat to this Nation. It is no longer, at least it should not be, a partisan matter. It is, and it shouldn't be, because everybody's future is at stake. 
I saw in the paper this morning where one of the candidates in Virginia is going to be given $1 million by his party. I saw last week where one of the candidates for Susan Molinari's spot, I guess it is in New York, that one of the parties is dumping $800,000 into that campaign and that person's opponent had $35,000 in the bank. You don't have to be brilliant to know how those races are going to come out. Television does it all and you cannot get on television without money. That is what these massive contributions are all about. 
Whoever has the most money 94 percent of the time wins. You can hardly call that a democracy because, as I say, it is threatening.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, there is a lot of talk now since the President has announced that the deficit this year for 1997 is, I believe, $22.6 billion. That is an incredible figure. In 1993, you are looking at a Senator who was genuinely concerned, really concerned, not just concerned, alarmed about where we were heading with these massive deficits of $290 billion a year, and no one seeming to want to do something about it, either cut spending or raise taxes, both of which would be necessary to address the problem. 
I have said on the floor before, so far as I am concerned, regardless of what President Clinton does before or from now on, his legacy is going to be the bill in 1993 that addressed that problem in a very courageous way, so courageous it cost a lot of Members on my side of the aisle their seats. But it reduced the deficit from $290 billion a year, and it is reduced to this year $22.6 billion. That is an awesome, awesome result, and one in which the people in this country ought to take great pride. 
Then I hear on the House side where the Speaker said, if we have a surplus left next year, he would like to have it go on to defense spending. Completely aside from what I want to say on the subject, that is not where I want it to go. I want the so-called surplus to go right into the National Treasury, because even though the deficit this year is $22.6 billion, that does not include $114 billion that we are using in trust funds--Social Security, airport, highway trust funds--to get to that point. 
So while we are all patting ourselves on the back, Senator Hollings says giving ourselves the Good Government Award, for doing something about the deficit, we should not ever lose sight of the fact that the $22.6 billion is not the deficit. The deficit is $22.6 billion plus the $114 billion we are spending in trust funds by borrowing, and until we add $114 billion in surplus to the $22.6 billion in deficit, we will not have a balanced budget. 
I agree with Alan Greenspan--I don't always agree with him--but I agree with him on one thing. Even using the jargon of the Senate and assuming that $22.6 billion is the deficit, that is not the honest deficit, but assuming that it is, if we have anything in excess of that next year, I would like to see it go into the Treasury, because the more we pay on the national debt, the lower interest rates are going to go, and the lower interest rates go, the better off the economy is going to be.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, everybody has heard that old expression about fools walk in where angels fear to tread. I have heard as a practicing lawyer, as a citizen and certainly as a Member of the U.S. Senate, as many tales about the IRS as anybody in this body. There have been unbelievable abuses, a lot of which have been aired in the hearings that Chairman Roth held in the Finance Committee. 
You don't get accomplished diplomats for what we pay auditors in the IRS. Oftentimes, you get somebody who really is, indeed, abusive. Even though he is spending the taxpayer's money he is auditing, he can be very unpleasant. It isn't just the abusiveness of the auditors. Occasionally it is also their incompetence. 
I was trying to help somebody one time and made a phone call back when I was practicing law. `We can't talk to you; send us a letter authorizing us.' 
I was a little offended by that, but at the same time, I understood. Anybody could call and say, `I'm calling on behalf of' somebody else. They don't know who they are, so I had to get an affidavit from my client and send it in saying I was authorized to represent her in a tax dispute. 
But my point is all this legislation to abolish the IRS without putting anything in its place is not all that troubling to me because something has to give. You can't abolish the IRS and abolish the Tax Code without replacing it with something. 
What you replace it with certainly ought not to be a flat tax. So far as I am concerned, the flat tax was created by the Flat Earth Society. A flat tax, No. 1, is not ever going to pass here because invariably it does not allow people to deduct interest on their homes. It doesn't allow charitable contributions. The church people, the universities of the country who depend so extensively on giving are not ever going to sit still for a flat tax. If the middle- and lower-income groups of the country knew what the flat tax would do to them, they wouldn't stand still for it. 
I can promise you that under every flat-tax scenario I have seen, people who make between $30,000 and $100,000 are going to wind up paying more, and people who make more than that are going to wind up paying less. I have not seen one single flat-tax proposal that doesn't take all the progressivity out of the Tax Code. 
I can tell you, I only have 1 more year in the Senate, but I am not going to vote during that year for anything that even smacks of a flat tax. Oh, everybody thinks it is so simple. Do you know why the Tax Code is so complex? Because of the U.S. Congress. They drafted it. We just got through adding about 800 pages to it with the so-called balanced budget bill. 
Of course, it is complex. When you consider the myriad of transactions that occur in this country and you are trying to deal with all of them and there are lobbyists all over the city asking for special favors--this little thing in our business, and this little thing in our business--that is the reason the code is indecipherable today. So don't blame the IRS because the Tax Code is indecipherable, blame the U.S. Congress. We are the ones who drafted every word of it. 
So, Mr. President, bear in mind that for the last year--and the IRS has many statistics on it--there is about $100 billion, somewhere between $92 and $95 billion in tax evasion every year. 
What does that mean? Let's assume in the year 1997 that we collected $600 billion in personal income tax, and that is probably pretty close to correct. 
Assume further that the IRS had been able to collect the $100 billion which is not being paid that ought to be paid. You could reduce taxes by $100 billion. That would be pretty nice. 
You hear all kinds of talk around here about tax cuts. But nobody ever wants to give the IRS any more money to enforce the Tax Code against those people who are paying no taxes. One of the reasons our taxes are as high as they are is because of the underground economy operated by people who deal in cash and do not pay taxes for the privilege of being an American citizen. 
I am inclined to support--I read an op-ed piece in the Post this week strongly opposed to this idea. I do not know whether it was this week or not. But this business of shifting the burden to the IRS from the taxpayer has some merit. 
I offered a bill in 1980, and it passed the Senate. It never passed the House, but it passed the Senate. The Republicans liked it so well they put it in their platform in the convention in 1980. But I had a provision that said, any time a regulator comes into your plant and charges you with a violation, you would have to sustain the burden of proving that that regulation was valid. 
If somebody comes into your plant and says, `Your fire extinguisher is 2 inches too high off the floor and, therefore, I'm fining you $100,' it would be incumbent, under existing law, for the person who owned that plant to prove that Congress did not intend for him to pay a fine because his fire extinguisher was 2 inches too high off the ground. 
Under my bill that passed the Senate in 1980, the burden would have shifted to the regulator, the guy who is trying to impose the fine. He would have to prove that the regulation is valid and within the intent of Congress. You shift the burden. But my bill excluded the Internal Revenue Code. I won't go into all the reasons we did that. It did not seem workable. 
But now I am going to look very closely at this proposal of Bill Archer's, from the House, to shift the burden to the IRS when they allege that somebody is deficient or made a mistake on their tax return or generally state when the IRS is accusing somebody of owing money, they will have to sustain the burden of proving that instead of shifting the burden immediately to the taxpayer. 
Mr. President, I had one or two other issues I was going to talk about. But in the interest of expediting this evening and allowing people in the Senate to get out of here--they all look at me with mean looks, so I know everybody is wanting to shut this place down--I will forgo a couple of other items and save them for next Friday afternoon. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BUMPERS. Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, we are here today debating this issue which was a political creation in the beginning. It was a terrible idea and in my opinion, plainly unconstitutional. Ronald Reagan was President. He had promised the American people he would balance the budget by 1984 after he was sworn in in 1981. And in 1984 we did not have a balanced budget. On the contrary, deficits were soaring wildly out of control. 
And then we begin to hear and read where the President said, `Well, you can't blame me because, you know, I can't spend a penny that Congress doesn't appropriate.' And I am not going to belabor that argument, but the next thing we heard was, `If only the President could pick out all those pork projects and veto them, these deficits wouldn't be soaring out of control.' 
First of all, if the President had full line-item veto authority at the time, according to most calculations, the amount of dollar savings as a result of those vetoes would have been infinitesimal in comparison to that staggering deficit. All that line item veto talk was nothing but a sheer diversionary tactic in the face of a promise that had not been kept. 
And I do not mean to denigrate President Reagan. But that rhetoric was the genesis of a very bad idea and in my opinion a patently unconstitutional idea. 
I am almost bitter, Mr. President, at the passage of this line item veto. The worst thing that can happen to a politician is to allow himself to become cynical or bitter, so I will say that I am elated. I am elated that this day has come. 
A lot of the people in this body stood and made magnificent speeches about how wonderful the line-item veto would be. They declared that 80 percent of the American people favored the line-item veto. I understand that; I took a lot of political heat, along with a lot of people on this side of the aisle who stood up against the line item veto. Senator Hatfield, who is no longer in the Senate, stood up against it, along with a few people on that side of the aisle. We all took unbelievable political heat back home because it was wildly popular. The people had been led to believe, and they did in fact believe that the real problem with the spending habits of Congress was that the President did not have the line-item veto. So I don't know how many times the line item veto proposal was presented in this body, but I promise you I voted no, no, no every time. 
So I am elated today because a lot of the people who got a lot of political benefit out of their support for the line item veto are now complaining. They are not saying that it was a mistake to pass it in the first place. No, they say that the trouble is that the President has abused the authority. Regardless of whether the President has properly vetoed these items before us today, I am not surprised at their protests. This is precisely what we told them they could expect if they passed the line-item veto. It is a bad idea, and plainly unconstitutional in the way it transfers the power of the purse to the President. 
I heard Senator Graham from Florida about his use of the line-item veto when he was Governor of Florida. I had the line-item veto when I was Governor of Arkansas--and I used it. You know how I used it? I would call a legislator down to my office and say, `You just voted against that administration bill, and you have a $250,000 appropriation coming for a big project in your district. And I can tell you, that sucker's toast unless you get down there and change your vote.' That is what I did. 
One of the arguments we made here was that the President could cow virtually any Member of the U.S. Senate with a line-item veto. I do not think President Clinton intended to insult Members of this body when he vetoed these 34 items, but it was a terrible political mistake. 
Any time you veto bills that affect more than 25 States, you are in trouble. I do not think the President was really thinking about that. Incidentally, he followed me as Governor of Arkansas. 
And he used the line-item veto pretty extensively when he was Governor. But one of the main reasons I object to it is that it gives the President unbelievable power over the Members of this body. And I can tell you, the Framers of the Constitution never intended for a President to have that kind of power. That is the reason they said: The Congress will pass the laws, and present them to the President, not item by item, but bill by bill. 
So, Mr. President, in conclusion, let me say I hope some of my colleagues will take this to heart and not trivialize the Constitution. It is almost contemptuous the way we treat our Constitution sometimes. I have voted for one constitutional amendment since I came to the U.S. Senate. That was the Equal Rights Amendment. I am sorry I voted for that, because it is not necessary. I have voted `no' 37 times on constitutional amendments, and `yes' once, and I regret that one. That is not to say I will never vote for a constitutional amendment, obviously. I reserve judgment on that. 
But the thing that chagrins me more than anything else is that every time somebody comes up with a cute political idea, they want to put it in the Constitution. And I have taken heat on prayer in school and the balanced budget amendment and flag burning and term limits, and court-stripping proposals. I have taken my share of heat on all those things, almost every one of which undeniably was political. 
So, as I say, if some of my colleagues--if as many as one colleague today is thinking, `I regret having voted for this thing. I regret having voted for something that in my heart I knew was unconstitutional,' I hope those members will think hard about this vote. Let me close, Mr. President, by saying that I am going to vote to uphold the President's veto. That may sound a little bit perverse, I suppose, based on what I have been saying. I do not know all the merits of these 34 items. That probably does not speak well for me, but I can tell you one thing, if one of them affected Arkansas, I would be voting to override it. And this entire package of line item vetoes is going to be overwhelmingly overridden by this body. There may not be five votes to uphold the President. 
But I will vote to uphold the veto and I will tell you precisely why. I want to make it so painful to support the line item veto that when we come to our senses and the legislation comes up to repeal the line-item veto, that it will be passed 100 to nothing. So the more pain we inflict, the more likely that is to occur. 
Ultimately, I think the line item veto will be repealed. I think that if Senator Byrd could bring up his line-item veto repeal today, I would like to believe it would pass almost 100 to zip. It was a terrible idea. And the time has come when the Senate should think better of it. 
I look forward to getting a piece of legislation up here even before the Supreme Court strikes it down. I personally believe the Supreme Court has very little alternative but to declare this thing unconstitutional when it is presented to them by somebody with standing. 
So, Mr. President, this is really a happy day for me, now that the Senate is addressing this item. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, The Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1997, which the Senate passed yesterday, includes a provision which authorizes the Secretary to provide funds to a national organization which promotes educational opportunities at the primary and secondary levels in rural areas with a historic incidence of poverty and low academic achievement. 
The 1990 Report of the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission identified quality of education as one if its 68 issues to be addressed through State and/or Congressional action. One of several recommendations offered by the Commission was that educational agencies in the Delta establish cooperative partnerships with institutions of higher education. In 1992, the Delta Teachers' Academy was launched as one of the first large-scale, federally funded responses to the Delta Development Commission. Since that time, the Delta Teachers' Academy has offered outstanding opportunities for elementary and high school teachers to increase their academic proficiency and has become the largest professional development program operated by the National Faculty. Acting under the assumption that well-prepared teachers beget well-educated students, Congress has continued to provide funding for the Delta Teachers' Academy. Giving teachers the resources, knowledge, and support they need to achieve the goals set for them should reside at the heart of educational improvement efforts. 
The importance of preparing young people for the challenges and realities of the 21st Century is indisputable. The region of the United States known as the Lower Mississippi Delta--Eastern Arkansas, Southeast Missouri, Southern Illinois, Western Kentucky, Western Tennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana--has lagged behind the rest of the country in economic growth and prosperity. This area suffers from a greater amount of measurable poverty and unemployment than any other region of the country. It is inhibited by people who have used their sense of place to develop a cultural and historical heritage that is rich and unique. A letter from then-Governor Bill Clinton which accompanied the Delta Commission's 1990 report identified the region as `an enormous untapped resource for America' that `can and should be saved.' The Delta Teachers' Academy has endeavored to do just that. 
The Delta Teachers' Academy, the National Faculty's single largest program, unites teachers from largely poor and isolated districts for long-term study in core disciplines. The three-year program combines intensive summer institutes with on-site sessions during the school year. Each teacher team works in collaboration with college and university scholars in one or more of five core disciplines--English, geography, history, math, and science. As teachers improve their mastery of these subject areas and gain confidence in their professional development, they are able to pass their knowledge along to the students with whom they come in contact. In 1995, the program served 600 teachers in 43 program sites. The Academy has continued to expand its outreach efforts and currently serves over 1000 teachers in the 219 counties and parishes comprising the Lower Mississippi Delta. 
Positive outcomes have been reported for the Delta Teachers' Academy by the General Accounting office in June of 1995 and as recently as August of this year by Westat, an independent entity commissioned to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. Both determined that the Delta Teachers' Academy is effective in fulfilling its two primary goals--increasing understanding of academic subjects and providing new and useful teaching skills. The GAO report specifically noted the Academy's success in helping teachers' institute changes in their curricula and classroom practice. 
I feel that the Delta Teachers' Academy represents community partnership at its very best. I am pleased that Congress has agreed to provide a special authorization for this incredibly worthwhile program. This makes clear Congress' commitment to improving educational opportunity and the overall quality of life for people living in the Lower Mississippi Delta and the need to continue our support such as the Delta Teachers' Academy.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, in bringing to the Senate floor the conference report for the fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill for the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and related agencies. We concluded a successful conference with the House and although our 602(b) allocation had to be adjusted downward, we were still able to maintain relatively high levels of funding for many important programs. 
As I stated during consideration of the Senate bill, I had hoped we could provide higher levels of funding for agricultural research. I am happy to report that the conference agreement provides a higher level of funding for the Agricultural Research Service than was contained in either the earlier House or Senate versions. Funding for the Food Safety Inspection Service is provided at a level more than $15 million above last year and additional funds are included for the President's Food Safety Initiative at USDA and FDA. 
The conference report contains funding for conservation programs well above last year's level and I am happy to report that the House and Senate conferees have agreed to changes in rural development activities that will protect program integrity and make them more efficient. The WIC Program retains the increase of more than $100 million above fiscal year 1997 that was included in the Senate bill and full funding for FDA's youth tobacco initiative is provided. 
I regret that we had to defer consideration of this conference report until this time. We had completed conference action and had been prepared to conclude action on this bill well in advance of the end of the previous fiscal year. However, questions raised by the authorization committees of the Food and Drug Administration postponed this final action until today. I look forward to quick passage of this conference report and approval by the President. 
We have already seen the President exercise his new authorities of line-item veto on bills presented to him. I no doubt suspect that he will review this legislation with a similar critical eye and, without doubt, he will find items that had not originated with the executive branch. Mr. President, I do not here intend to reopen floor debate on the ill-conceived line-item veto. However, I remind my colleagues, and my friend in the White House, that the Congress has very explicit responsibilities derived from the U.S. Constitution relating to the expenditure of funds. Simply because an item does not originate with the executive does not mean it is without merit. Let me plainly observe that when this bill was on the Senate floor in July of this year, it passed by a resounding 98 to 0. Mr. President, that simple statistic should speak for itself and send an important message to those who would undue the work we have done. 
In closing, let me again say what a pleasure it has been to work with my friend from Mississippi, the chairman of this subcommittee. He understands the programs and the issues contained in this bill and his leadership has been beyond value. Let me also again thank the subcommittee's majority staff, Rebecca Davies, Martha Scott Poindexter, Rochelle Graves, and, on this side, Galen Fountain, Carole Geagley, and Ben Noble of my personal staff. All their work has been important to completing work on this bill.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Washington. The purpose of the RC&D program is to encourage and improve the capability of State and local units of government and local nonprofit organizations in rural areas to plan, develop, and carry out programs for resource conservation and development. The NRCS also helps coordinate available Federal, State, and local programs to ensure adequate protection of natural resources while promoting sound development practices. Funding of the RC&D Councils is an important priority for the NRCS, as correctly emphasized by the conferees, and I urge the NRCS to not overlook opportunities to enhance the efforts of the RC&D Councils in a manner complimentary and consistent with these stated objectives.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I will engage the distinguished manager of the bill in a short colloquy, but let me start off by saying that there are parts of this bill that are confusing because any bill of this magnitude obviously has some things that are hard to understand without knowing precisely what was intended. These are fairly arcane questions, usually not very entertaining to anybody except those of us who deal with issues affecting the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior. 
Question No. 1. As I understand it, the U.S. Government will pay $250 million for the Headwaters Forest as provided in the bill; correct?

Mr. BUMPERS. There is a provision in the bill that says before the President can spend that money, the $315 million, which includes both the New World Mine and the Headwaters Forest, before the President can spend that money to acquire those two properties, the authorizing committees of the House and the Senate have 180 days from the date of enactment of this bill in which to take action. If they take no action, presumably the President would be authorized to go ahead and make the purchase?

So, the $699 million we are appropriating, under current law, the appropriate agencies, the Forest Service or the Department of the Interior, would have the right to spend other funds unrelated to Headwaters Forest and the New World Mine to make the normal kinds of purchases that they have always made; is that correct?

If the Secretary and the Governor of Montana cannot agree prior to this date on something similar to $10 million, then the Governor of Montana is within his right to demand the so-called Otter Creek tracts, which are tracts of land with a considerable amount of coal underneath them; is that correct?

Mr. BUMPERS. Now, I wonder if the Senator has seen some figures provided by the Greater Yellowstone Coalition as to what the Otter Creek tracts are worth. Let me preface that statement by saying I think the people who are following this bill are under the assumption that we are going to pay Montana $10 million to offset any economic loss they sustained as a result of our purchase of the New World Mine. There are going to be some jobs lost, and so on, that they would have otherwise gotten. Now, if the Governor of Montana is smart--and I assume he is--he is not going to negotiate very seriously on this for $10 million because he knows if there is no agreement, he gets the Otter Creek tracts. The Otter Creek tracts are estimated to have a value of $4.26 billion. 
Now, if the U.S. Government were to lease those lands to somebody under the Mineral Leasing Act, we would charge them a 12.5-percent royalty. Half of the royalty from that coal would go to the State of Montana and the other half would go to the Federal Treasury. If the Governor of Montana is very shrewd, and he can bottle up negotiations and not take the $10 million, which most people assume he is going to be getting, and the State of Montana will wind up with the Otter Creek tracts and own all the coal outright * * * not just get the 12.5-percent royalty. Does the Senator from Washington know what the Federal share of the royalty from this coal would be?

Mr. BUMPERS. Senator, if I may, here are the figures furnished me on the point I am trying to make. This is a real bonanza for the State of Montana--and I have nothing against them and their two Senators; they are two of the dearest friends I have in this body. So it always causes me grief when somebody is getting something, just as I am under this bill, to say these things. Here is the figure given to me. The Otter Creek tracts contain 533 million tons of coal. The current price of such coal is $8 a ton. It would come to $4.26 billion, and if you take 12.5 percent of that, you come out with about $266 million in royalties that the State could get. Mr. President, that is a lot more than the $10 million that I think most Senators in this body think we are giving the State of Montana. 
So I wanted to raise that point because, as you know, the 
administration is pretty concerned about this bill. I don't know that the President would veto it. If he were to veto that particular provision under the line-item authority that he now has and the Supreme Court later determined that the line-item veto is unconstitutional, then this is still a viable provision and his line-item veto of it would not stand.

Mr. BUMPERS. Senator, you and I have talked about this in private. I think it is well to get this on the record also. You may have alluded to this in your opening remarks. But another item that I think the administration is terribly concerned about is the provision in the bill that says `no funds can be spent to revise forest plans until new final interim or final rules for forest land management planning are published in the Federal Register.' You know, of course, under the national forest management plan, they are required to update the plans on the forests periodically. It is my understanding that some 42 plans would be blocked until the Forest Service publishes new final interim or final rules for forest land management planning. I can tell you that is costing the administration considerable pain. Would the Senator like to elaborate on that?

Mr. BUMPERS. One final question and a remark. I see the Senator from New Mexico on the floor. He and I have talked about this privately. There is a grazing provision in this bill that is of some concern to me. There is a court order in New Mexico regarding grazing rights, and there is a provision in here that says that none of the funds may be used by the Forest Service to carry out a court order. As I told him, I am not going to get into that, but I think that has a little bit of danger. Just for the record, I will let the Senator say what he said to me privately about that provision.

Mr. BUMPERS. Let me say this to the distinguished Senator from Washington, whose friendship I treasure. First of all, he has worked tirelessly to craft this bill, and there have been many conflicting forces pulling him in one direction or another. I know it has not been easy. He has always been very accommodating to me and I want to thank him profusely for that. More importantly, I want to tell him I was moved a moment ago by the very nice things he said about the role I played in the integration of my little school in Charleston, AR, at that time, with a population of 1,200. It was the very first school in the Old Confederacy to integrate after the Supreme Court decision in Brown versus Board of Education. He very generously put a $50,000 appropriation in here to do a feasibility study about establishing a national historic site in that community to commemorate this historic event. I express my deep and profound gratitude to him for that. He also agreed to include $150,000 for a similar designation for Central High School, which was the scene of one of the most, if not the most, dangerous situations in the United States since the Civil War.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, about 10 days ago the Senate adopted the appropriations bill on defense. I sit on the appropriations committee. I was one of five Senators who voted no. I think the bill passed 95 to 5. 
I don't enjoy voting against a defense budget. I am not running again, so I am not worried about somebody accusing me of being soft on defense. That has always been the mortal fear of Members of the Senate when you are voting on weapons system, that their opponent in the next election will accuse them of being soft on defense. 
Sometimes I think we should be accused of being soft in the head. We passed a bill that contained $247.5 billion for defense, and that did not include nuclear weapons and weapons development. That is all handled in the energy and water appropriations bill. And it did not include military construction, which is also in a separate bill. When you add those together, the appropriations for national defense total $268.2 billion. That is right up there with what we spent in the cold war. 
If, in 1985, you had asked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, indeed, if you had asked all the chiefs, `If the Soviet Union were to suddenly be dissolved and disappear, how much do you think we could cut the defense budget,' I promise you the answer would have been anywhere from $50 billion to $100 billion. Today the Soviet Union has been dissolved. It does not exist anymore. The military forces of Russia are in shambles. And we are appropriating $268 billion--big, big figures. 
What are we thinking about? There is not a major enemy in sight. How much do we spend? And who are we afraid of? Here is a little chart that I believe my colleagues will find interesting. When we appropriate $268 billion, we are spending twice as much as all of the eight potential enemies we could possibly conjure up. Here is what the United States spent, $268 billion; Russia, $82 billion; China, $32 billion; and the six rogue countries, $15 billion. So we spend twice as much as all of those countries, twice as much as Russia, China, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Syria, Libya, Cuba combined. And when you add the NATO alliance, Japan and South Korea to what we are spending, it comes to four times as much. The United States and its allies are now spending four times as much for defense as virtually everybody else in the world. 
That is the macro overlook of what I think is terribly wrong with the way we are appropriating money. But within that $268 billion, let me just tell you some of the reasons I could not stomach it. Between 1998 and 2001, under that bill, we are going to retire 11 Los Angeles class submarines that have an average of 13 years left on their lives. What are we doing? When we appropriated the money to build Los Angeles class submarines, we were assured these submarines were the best in the world and that they had a 30-year life. Everybody beat themselves on the chest and said isn't that wonderful, we are building submarines that have a 30-year life. So now we are retiring 11 of them that still have 13 years left on their lives. Why? So we can build one new attack submarine in fiscal 1998 at a cost of $2.3 billion. 
You talk about penny-wise and pound-foolish; we are going to spend $3.4 billion for four DDG-51 destroyers. That is even one more than the Pentagon requested. How are we going to pay for that? Well listen to how we are going to pay for it. First of all, I am offended because they are retiring a ship that Betty Bumpers is the chief sponsor of. We christened the CGN-41, a guided missile nuclear ship, back in 1979. That ship had a life expectancy of 38 years, 
and we are about to scrap it. It is as modern as tomorrow. We are going to scrap it so we can build four new DDG-51 class destroyers, to keep the shipyards busy. We are retiring one of the most beautiful ships you will ever see, and it has 18 years left on its life. 
We are also retiring three Perry-class frigates that have 20 years left on their life. What in the name of all that is good and holy do we care what the life expectancy of a ship is if we are going to retire them in order to make room for some more ships? The first thing you know, we will be building them and retiring them before they go into service so we can keep the shipyards busy. 
Then, Mr. President, there is the $331 million in this bill for the B-2 bomber. Let me say in all fairness, as long as William Jefferson Clinton is President, we are not going to start building B-2 bombers. I heard him speak on that subject. But what are we doing? We are saying, `Well, Mr. President, we know you don't like the B-2, so what we're going to do is give you $331 million to start building nine more B-2 bombers, but if you don't want to do that, then spend this money on spare parts on the ones we have.' 
The Pentagon and the Air Force didn't ask for an additional $331 million in spare parts, and we are not going to build the B-2. Why in the name of all that is good and holy are we putting $331 million in the budget? 
I come finally to the two items that really burn me worse than any other part of the budget. First, the F-22 fighter. When you start seeing full-page pictures in the New York Times and the Washington Post and in Roll Call and The Hill newspaper of this magnificent F-22 fighter, you can bet your bottom dollar the full-court press is on. I have no more ability to stop the F-22 fighter than I can keep the Earth from revolving. Once a plane like that develops the kind of momentum the F-22 has, nobody can stop it. Nobody can stop it no matter how foolish it is. 
Let me wedge the F-22 fighter for you in between two other fighter planes. Right now we are beginning to build a new version of the Navy's F-18 fighter plane called the F-18 E/F. It is the most advanced version of the F-18 to date. Cost? Mr. President, $90 million each. Number? Probably around 600. 
The Navy says, and the intelligence community confirms, that the F-18 fighter will be superior to any other non-American fighter plane in the world through the year 2015. I repeat: The 500 to 600 F-18 E/F's we are going to build will be superior to any non-American fighter plane known in the world between now and the year 2015. The Navy says it will provide air dominance until the year 2020. I am for it. We are building it. It is a magnificent airplane. 
So what are we going to do now in the year 1998 to 2000? We are going to start building this F-22. Do you want to know the cost of that? Sixty-two billion dollars for 339 airplanes. That comes to somewhere between $180 million and $190 million each, which makes it precisely twice as expensive as the most expensive fighter plane ever built in the United States. 
If we needed it, we might justify the cost. But if we don't need it, we couldn't justify it at any cost. An Air Force official has said, `I promise you, we will build these 339 planes for $61.7 billion.' 
We just happened to be debating the authorization bill for defense at that time. I said, `OK, we'll take you at your word. I can't stop the plane, which I would divinely like to do, but we will hold you to your word. You say you can build it for $61.7 billion. Let's put that in the bill, that you may not spend more than that.' 
Do you know what? They are already hollering like a pig under a gate: `We can't live with it.' 
So when you talk about a $190 million airplane, that is what they are saying today. Anybody who has been in the Senate as long as I have knows they are not about to build that plane for that. They already cut the number of planes because they faced a $16 billion cost overrun. 
To proceed with the sequence, in the year 2005, we are going to start building what we call the Joint Strike Fighter, and we are going to build about 2,800 of those. I happen to support the Joint Strike Fighter because it is going to be used by the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps. It is supposed to cost much less than $100 million each and be a state of the art fighter plane. 
So why are we sandwiching this F-22 fighter at a cost of $62 billion between the F-18 and the Joint Strike Fighter? Why? Because the lobbyists have the power to make it happen, not because we need it. It is a cold-war relic. 
You might ask, `Well, who dreamed up the F-22?' I will tell you who dreamed it up. The Russians. Back when the old Soviet Union kept us from sleeping at night, they announced in the early 1980's, back in the heyday of the Soviet Union, `We're going to build a fifth-generation fighter that's going to be superior to anything ever built in the history of the world.' 
That is all you have to do to get the Pentagon's attention. So the Air Force went to the drawing board and started designing the F-22 to meet the threat of the Soviet Union and their fifth generation fighter. 
What happened? The Soviet Union went bankrupt, and the fifth generation remained on the drawing board where it is today, unless they have lost it. What are we doing? We are getting ready to produce an airplane designed to compete with a plane that is still on the drawing board in Russia and may never come off the drawing board. 
The F-22 has virtually no ground-attack capability. They put a couple bombs on it just so they could say it has ground-attack capability. It is a good airplane. I am not arguing that. You can build all kinds of airplanes that are good airplanes, but I want to tell you something, while it has a good air superiority capability, in Desert Storm and Iraq, we flew four times more ground-attack flights than we did flights to achieve air dominance and air superiority. Mr. President, this cold war relic should never have been built. 
Finally, the argument that I thought I was going to finally win--I don't win many arguments on defense. I don't know of anybody who ever tries to kill a weapons system or bring some sanity to defense spending that ever wins. I can only remember two or three weapons systems in my 23 years in the Senate that we have ever stopped. They take on a life of their own, and the minute Congress starts looking at them, the manufacturers start running full-page ads in every newspaper and magazine in the United States, giving the American people the impression that we will be seriously threatened if we don't build that particular weapons system. 
The one I thought I was going to win was to stop plans to backfit our Pacific fleet submarines with new ballistic missiles. We have 10 Trident submarines in the Atlantic and 8 in the Pacific. The ones in the Atlantic are furnished with what we call the D-5 missile. A fine missile, very accurate. It is the most modern, accurate ballistic missile we have. Our eight Trident submarines in the Pacific are equipped with an older missile called the C-4. 
The C-4 is not quite as accurate as the D-5. Do you know what the difference is, Mr. President? According to unclassified data from the Congressional Budget Office, the C-4 lacks having the accuracy of the D-5, and the accuracy shortage is about 450 feet, or the distance from where the Presiding Officer is sitting right now to where the Speaker of the House is sitting down the hall. 
When you consider the smallest warhead that goes on these missiles, the 100 kiloton W-76 warhead, would wipe the District of Columbia completely off the map, why, again, in the name of all that is good and holy are we getting ready to spend $5.6 billion to take the C-4 missiles off our Pacific fleet and replace them with the D-5 missiles? Do you know why? Because the Navy wants it, and the Navy and the industrial complex have the power to get it. 
We had a serious debate in the appropriations committee on this, and as I started to say earlier, I thought I had won that debate. I thought the committee was agreeing with me. I thought the committee agreed that it would be the height of foolishness to retrofit those submarines in the Pacific when the warheads and the missiles on them will last longer than the submarines. No question about it. 
So what are we going to do here when the cold war has long since ceased to exist? We are going to scare the life out of the Russians by modernizing our ballistic missile submarine fleet and spend $5.6 billion that we could save doing it. We may also keep the Russians from ratifying START II. 
Oh, I could go on and on about what an utter waste of money that is. Did you know that those C-4 warheads I just described for you and the missiles on which they sit will last longer than the submarines? We are not even going to backfit four of the submarines because they are going to be retired before the C-4 missile will have lived out its usefulness. 
So, Mr. President, I do, indeed, get agitated about these things, and I get frustrated. 
The people sent us here to do a job as best we see fit. 
When I see the needs of this country, when I see an educational system that needs to be fixed, when I see a planet threatened by environmental concerns, and when I see us fighting over who is going to get highway money to take care of the 200 million vehicles in this country, I get frustrated. Mr. President, do you know, just sort of digressing for a moment, when I was a young marine in World War II, I remember seeing in one of the papers in California that we had 30 million vehicles on the road. 
You know how many we have today? Two hundred million. By the year 2050, at the rate we are going, we will have 400 million. Mother Teresa was the exemplification of a woman who lived the consummate Judeo-Christian life, God bless her soul, but she was fighting a losing battle from the very beginning. When she was a young novitiate, India had 250 million people. Today, they have almost 800 million. Mother Teresa was fighting a losing battle. 
The highway commissions in our respective 50 States are fighting a losing battle, too. They are trying to build more highways, wider highways to accommodate 30 percent of all the vehicles in the world. Those 200 million vehicles in this country are 30 percent of all the vehicles in the world. 
We are going to have to think differently and act differently if we are going to deal with our transportation needs in the future, or every city in America is going to be in gridlock. 
In that connection, in putting that in the context of another burning issue around here called global warming, those 200 million vehicles contribute 27 percent of all the world's greenhouse gases that the United States throws into the stratosphere. 
When you think of what it is going to cost to clean up all the Superfund sites in this country. To try to keep our water and air clean, and when I looked at the kind of money we spend on defense, so much of which is wasted, I had to come to the floor to make this speech. 
I did not want to vote against the defense budget. I just simply say I thought it was too much money. It was a lot more than too much money. It was putting weapons systems in mothballs that have long lives left. It was buying weapons systems we do not need. It was cold war mentality at its worst when the cold war is over. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill on behalf of Senator Carol Moseley-Braun and myself authorizing the award of the Congressional Gold Medal to the extraordinary group of Americans known as the Little Rock Nine. 
We speak often of heroes in this body. Sometimes we worry that there are no heroes in our country today, no one for our children to look up to, no one to inspire us to be our best selves. But a couple of weeks ago, we had a vivid reminder that there are still heroes among us. The Little Rock Nine returned to Little Rock Central High School to stride through the doors again. This time those doors were held open by the Governor of Arkansas and the President of the United States. 
Jean Brown Trickey, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Melba Patillo Beals, Terrence Roberts, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed Wair, Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, and Jefferson Thomas. Their names are not so familiar to the American public, but they ought to be. 
On a fall day in 1957, these nine Americans were teenagers, children really, and they marched up the steps of Little Rock Central High School, young black teenagers through a huge crowd--actually a mob--of angry white people who despised them just for being there and presuming to attend a public school in their own home town. They marched up the steps with a cool courage that remains awesome today, no matter how many times we see the grainy newsreels. 
In 1957, Little Rock was not a very big city, but for a few days, it became the center of the world. Arkansas was not the most staunchly segregationist State in the South, but politics, history and fear conspired to make it the crucible for the authority of Brown v. Board of Education. And through that storm of controversy marched these nine young people, frightened but dignified, barely comprehending what was happening but sensing that they were helping to move aside a profound obstacle. 
Now, even the people who jeered at them will admit that they were impressed and moved by the courage of those nine kids. The images of those days in Little Rock, and the extraordinary lives these nine sons and daughters of Arkansas have led are proud symbols of the progress we have made in America and a solemn reminder of the progress we have yet to make. 
Any ordinary teenager is sensitive to the tiniest insult, the most innocent slight. It is hard to imagine what these nine felt as they were cursed and spat upon, peppered with every slur and threat the crowd could muster. They were opposed by the Governor, by most every local leader, by their peers and by a fully armed unit of the National Guard. They were able to enter the school when President Eisenhower ordered in units of the airborne division to escort them and enforce the order of the Supreme Court. But it was not the power of the soldiers or the authority of the law that won the day. It was the grace and courage of those nine young people. 
Their grace and courage prevailed that day and has inspired us for 40 years. They deserve our thanks and admiration. They deserve a medal. We should present those nine heroes of Little Rock with the Congressional Gold Medal as a permanent remembrance of their unforgettable moment of courage. I hope all of my colleagues will cosponsor this bill and see that it quickly becomes law.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just say McCain-Feingold may be dead as most people around here seem to believe. I have always believed the American people can have anything they want any time they are unified. The time is fast approaching when the American people are going to demand that we change a system that is rotten to the core. McCain-Feingold goes a long way in that direction. It doesn't go nearly far enough to please me personally, but at least it will be a beginning. 
The two things you can do to restore people's faith in the American Government and Congress, the two things you can do that will instill more confidence than anything else would be to balance the budget and change the way we finance campaigns. 
I have heard all the sophistry about the constitutionality of this bill. I just want to tell you, when it comes to free speech, you can hang your hat on free speech if you want to, but the thing that makes this system rotten is that a guy who can afford to belly up for $100,000 gets a lot more free speech than some guy giving $25. The reason he doesn't give $25 is because he knows it gets him nothing--not even good government. 
So I plead with my colleagues, for God's sake, let's do something that the vast majority of the American people want us to do--that is, to level the playing field for all parties. You don't have a democracy when the people we elect and the laws we pass depend on how much money we raise for it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me say, first of all, that the distinguished Senator from Maine, Senator Collins, has been waiting for a long time. I am most reluctant to take her spot. But I understand she has to leave. So rather than waste the time, and with her indulgence, I hope she will forgive me, I will go ahead and proceed with my statement. 
First of all, Mr. President, I would like for every Member of Congress to ask himself or herself this very simple question: How much longer do you think our democracy can survive if we continue under the present system of financing our campaigns? 
The first question ought to be: Can we continue to pass laws and elect people based on how much money they have and expect a participatory democracy to survive? 
Question No. 2: Can this democracy survive under the present system of financing campaigns if we adopt McCain-Feingold? 
With the utmost respect for two dear friends in the Senate, Senator Feingold and Senator McCain, I would have to say that this bill will help our democracy last a little longer than it would if we do nothing. 
We call ourselves a participatory democracy. And yet, most people have long since quit participating. 
So another question that every Member of the Senate ought to ask before they vote on this bill is: Why do only 50 percent of the people in our country bother to vote? 
The next question they ought to ask is: Why do only about 4 percent of the people in the country contribute to candidates and parties? 
We can contribute 3 bucks to the Presidential Election Fund by checking a box on our tax return, without any cost to ourselves, yet the percentage of people who check that box is down now to about 13 percent of the people who file tax returns. Thirteen percent will say, `Yes. I want $3 of my taxes to go to the Presidential campaigns.' I think there are an awful lot of people in this country that think they are paying that $3 out of their own pocket. They don't pay the $3. All they do is say I would like for $3 of my existing tax liability to go to the Presidential campaign. That system has attracted much higher percentages than in the past. But it has been declining. 
So, ask yourself. Why do only 50 percent of the people vote? 
Why do only 4 percent of the people contribute? 
Why is the number of people checking the box on their Federal tax return continuing to go down? 
The answer to that is very simple. They don't think they count. They say to themselves: `Why should I contribute? Yes. I could give 25 bucks. I could give 50 bucks.' But when you see $100,000 contributions in soft money, and you see the $2,000 contributions to candidates, really $4,000 if the contributor's spouse also contributes, who will believe that his $15 or $20 is going to make a difference? And they are showing in big numbers they don't believe they count by staying home on election day. 
And they see legislation passed continually where they know money was the determining factor. 
I can remember when I was a young attorney just out of law school practicing law in my little hometown. A man came into my office one day. He said, `I want you to give me $250 for a Member of Congress.' And I said, `He's not even up for reelection this year. Why would I give him $250?' He said, `Well, they have a lot of expenses,' and so on. And I said, `Well, I'm not going to give you $250,' the primary reason being I don't have $250. The second reason is $250 is two monthly house payments. And the third reason is I don't even like the guy; he doesn't represent my views. And fourth, I thought, if I were going to give $250, why would I give it to you? Why wouldn't I give it to the candidate so he would at least know I had given him $250 and I would also like for him to know that that is a big, big amount of money for a struggling young lawyer in a little town in Arkansas.

Mr. BUMPERS. No, I won't yield, Senator. I have been waiting all afternoon to speak. 
When I ran for Governor the first time, I found asking for money the most difficult thing I had ever done. I could not believe that I had to go around pleading with people to give me a few dollars. Nobody wanted to give me any money anyway because I had 1 percent name recognition when I started running. Some guy gave me a $100 one day, and he said, `I bet the horses all my life, but I have never bet on such a long shot as yours.' But he gave me $100 anyway. 
I asked Tom Eagleton, the fine Senator from Missouri, when he announced he was going to leave the Senate, `Tom, why are you leaving?' He gave me three reasons. First of all, he said, `I'm tired of laughing at things that ain't funny.' The second was, `I'm tired of answering hate mail.' And third, `I'm tired of going around with my tin cup out'--three very compelling, perfectly legitimate reasons for wanting to leave the Senate. 
As good as McCain-Feingold is, it does not remove the problem Senators face of voting on issues in which an awful lot of people who have given them money have a dynamite interest. My son, who lives in Little Rock, and his wife had twins about a year ago, and they had a woman who came to stay with them when the twins were born. They are very fortunate they can afford that. A lot of people have twins and they can't afford to have that kind of help. Be that as it may, she has been a very intelligent woman. I visit with her when I go over to see the twins. Last week she said, `You know, Dale, I don't know much about what's going on up there, but it seems to me like you all spend all your time investigating each other.' I said, `That's right, Nancy.' 
That is all we are ever going to do as long as we finance campaigns the way we do now. Every time you vote on an issue, Senators, you are vulnerable to accusations if it benefits anybody who ever helped you. When you take money from somebody and you vote on an issue, you better hope two things: That the issue turns out well, and that the guy who gave you money does not turn out to be a crook because if he does, the press comes running to you: How much money did he give you or why did he give you money? Was there any quid pro quo? 
I am reluctant to mention this, but I am going to tell you the truth. I never did like the Keating case. A colleague whom I consider to be one of the most honest men I have ever known spent $600,000 of his own personal money defending himself because he was said to have helped somebody who gave him money in a campaign. I can promise you he would never have taken it in a thousand years if he thought it had the least taint to it. And if Keating's S&L had made it, you would never have heard about the Keating case. There would have been no case. But because he was giving money to a lot of people and his S&L went under, and he turned out to be a crook, then we had this big dog and pony show in the Senate that lasted a year or more. 
You know, I have been a friend of the President's for now 26 
years. And as well as I knew the President, as close a friend as we have been through the years, I never heard of Whitewater until he became President, never knew there was such a place, never knew there was such a corporation. And if Bill Clinton hadn't had the temerity to come to Washington as the President of the United States, you would never have heard of Whitewater. It is all how things turn out. 
But to reemphasize the point I started to make, that is, colleagues, when you take a contribution from anybody, even if your own intentions are pure, you better hope that money is coming from an honorable person. You better hope it is coming from somebody who isn't out defrauding people. And you better be careful how you vote on issues that can help a contributor if they turn sour or turn out to be a crook. It doesn't matter if you cast that vote on the merits. And as long as we have this system of financing campaigns you can lie awake at night worrying about it because it is a real threat. Where a quid pro quo can be inferred, it will be. That is the perception that will remain until we change the campaign finance law. 
We have reached the point, Mr. President, where every single Member is constantly just one step away from disaster. And guilt or innocence has little to do with the outcome. One woman told me the other day that she had been interviewed and appeared before grand juries in one of these many investigations and was going to have to deed her house--I promise you she is totally innocent of anything--going to deed her house to her lawyer because it is the only asset she has that will come close to covering her legal bills. 
Well, we have reached the point in this country where simple negligence, bad judgment, just plain policy differences are becoming criminal offenses. How many independent counsels do we have running loose in this town? And how many more will we have? I can answer that partially. As long as we finance campaigns the way we do now, there are going to be independent counsels galore in this city. When you increase funding, spending on congressional elections in 1976 from $99 million to, in 1996, almost $800 million, you have to ask, where is this going to end? That is an 800 percent increase in 20 years, with no letup in sight. 
Look at the $450 million or almost $500 million in soft money for both parties during the last election cycle. It will be more this year, they are already ahead of the 1995-1996 cycle. Who gives that money? It is not little struggling lawyers as I was 40 years ago in a little town in Arkansas. It is not average folks with five and ten and fifty dollar contributions. 
I will tell you when it is going to end, Mr. President. It is going to end when the American people rise up in righteous indignation and come to the realization that the system is rotten, come to the realization that they do not count. It will end when enough people in Congress get tired of every contribution that goes sour being microscopically addressed by the press and wondering about when you are going to be on one of the news magazines the next episode. 
There is no perfect solution to this. I happen to come down on the side of public financing. I have a bill. I wanted to introduce my bill as an amendment. Senator Kerry and Senator Wellstone have a bill. We discussed whether to try to offer our bills as amendments to this bill. We concluded that would probably be counterproductive, would not get many votes, probably would not get a single Republican vote, maybe 25 or 30 Democrat votes. Yet 66 percent of the people, according to a Gallup poll in October of last year, 66 percent of the people in this country said they favor public financing of our campaigns. 
I heard the distinguished Senator from Colorado say a moment ago that he won even though he was outspent. I was too in my first race. I ran against a Rockefeller. I guess you would call that stupidity. But in any event, I won, and when I ran for the Senate against an incumbent, I was badly outspent. But I tell you, those are rare exceptions. I applaud anybody who spends less money than his opponent and manages to win because 90 percent of the candidates in this country who spend the most money end up winning. Pretty heavy odds. According to statistics to this date, if you have the money, you have a 9-to-1 chance of winning. 
In the 1995-96 election cycle, 400 corporations, labor unions, and individuals contributed $100,000 or more in soft money; 400 of them gave over $100,000. Were they after good government? Is that what they wanted? I don't mean to demean anybody, because I have a lot of friends who have been faithful to me for 26 years in the contribution area. I can truthfully say I am most grateful to all of them. But when I first started running for Governor in my State, there were no campaign laws and I was absolutely aghast at the amount of cash money, greenbacks, that was floating around in campaigns. One man handed me fifty $100 bills. I knew he had a deep and abiding interest in certain things that were bound to come up when I was elected, if I was elected. So I handed him his fifty $100 bills back. 
Do you know something? He doesn't like me to this day. You can't give people money back and make them like it, can you, Senator? 
My campaign finance director came up and said, `How are we going to run this race? You are giving more money back than we are taking in.' I have given a lot of money back. All I am saying is, when you think about how much money $100,000 is, and when you think about who gave it, you have to believe that they wanted something more than good government. 
In 1996--listen to this--in the U.S. Senate, Senate incumbents had a 2 to 1 spending advantage over challengers. You hear people say public financing of campaigns is welfare for the politicians. Do you know what I say to chamber of commerce and Rotary Club members, all conservative businessmen who do not much like this idea of public financing? I remind them, you have been investing in the stock market for several years now and you have been doing well. But I can tell you, if you really want to make some money, if you really want a return on your investment, you opt for public financing. That will give you the biggest return of any investment you ever made in your life, because we won't be spending a lot of money on unworthy projects that contributors supported. It will be a great investment because it will yield a cleaner government and the people will believe it is a cleaner government. 
The average successful Senate race today costs $4 million. That is average. Some races have cost as much as $28 million. Where will we be 20 years from now if the costs of Senate races continue to go up another 800 percent? You can't count that high. You can't get computers to count that high at the rate we are going. 
One of the problems that I have with the McCain-Feingold bill, and I am a cosponsor and ardent supporter and I certainly intend to vote for it, but I will tell you one of my fears is, while it will help preserve our democracy for a little longer and it will take some of the problems out of the way we finance campaigns today, nothing will cure the problem like public financing. 
But the point I want to make, what I worry about is, if we pass McCain-Feingold, there will be a lot of hoopla about it, because I have never known people as tenacious and determined and as hard-working as Senator Feingold and Senator McCain have been on this issue. They have my deep and abiding admiration for their tenacity and their determination to try to do something about what is wrong with the system. But if it passes, we will go home and we will pat ourselves on the back and give ourselves the `good government' award, as Senator Hollings is always saying, and the American people will be thinking the system has been fixed. A lot of it will have been fixed, but problems will remain and I fear that they will make the people even more cynical. 
The issue advocacy ads that are really ads for a candidate--they drive me crazy. This bill would help to bring them under control, require disclosure of the sources of money used to produce them. They are really campaign spending. 
I can tell you, I have voted for one constitutional amendment since I have been in the Senate. I voted for ERA soon after I arrived in the Senate. 
Since that time, I have voted about 32 times against every constitutional amendment. Either earlier this year or last year, I voted against Senator Hollings' amendment to the Constitution which would have allowed the Congress to set campaign spending limits. I am going to vote for it. I want to announce now publicly, the next time Senator Hollings brings that amendment up, I intend to support it. Despite my deep reservations about amending our Constitution, I will do almost anything to change the way we finance campaigns in this country, because I am absolutely convinced that this system is totally destructive to our democracy. I yield the floor, Mr. President.  
Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, there were five votes against the conference report on Defense appropriations. I was one of those five. I do not presume to speak for any of the others. I 
speak only for myself, and I will speak at length on my reasons next week. 
But I just want to say tonight that by adopting that conference report we are embarking on the building of a fighter plane called the F-22, which is going to be twice as expensive as any fighter plane ever built. My guess is that it will cost somewhere between $70 and $100 billion when it is finished, for 339. We are embarking on a $4 billion cost of retrofitting the Pacific fleet with D-5 missiles on ships which are already equipped with C-4's, and the C-4's will outlive the ships they are on. And for a lesser reason, of course, the $331 million in the bill on the B-2 bomber. 
Mr. President, if you want to spend this for new bombers, be my guest. If you don't, put it in spare parts. If they need spare parts for B-2's, let's appropriate the money to do it. But let's not use that kind of shenanigan to get $331 million in here and hope we can crank up the B-2 program again. We are talking about ringing up new expenditures of close to $100 billion in this. I will elaborate more extensively next week.

Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I rise today because I believe the Senate set a terrible precedent last Thursday when it voted to uphold a point of order that was made against an amendment that Senator Gregg and I offered to H.R. 2107, the Interior appropriations bill. This amendment proposed to collect the royalty from hardrock mining operations on public land and a reclamation fee from hardrock mining operations on land that was patented pursuant to the 1872 mining law. The receipts collected from the royalty and reclamation fee would have been deposited in a trust fund to be used to reclaim abandoned hardrock mines in the West. 
Opponents of my amendment, in an attempt to prevent Senators from going on record in support of an effort to make the mining industry help pay for the environmental disasters it has created, raised a point of order arguing that the reclamation fee constituted a tax proposed by the Senate and thus the amendment violated the origination clause of the Constitution; that is, that all revenue measures must originate in the House. Unfortunately, the Senate voted to uphold the point of order even though the amendment was not even close to being unconstitutional. 
The Supreme Court has held on numerous occasions that while a tax provision may not originate in the Senate, a governmental fee can. `A statute that creates a particular governmental program and that raises revenue to support that program, as opposed to a statute that raises revenue to support government generally, it is not a `bill for raising revenue' within the meaning of the origination clause.' That is confirmed in United States versus Munoz-Florez. My amendment would have imposed a royalty and a fee in order to directly fund the reclamation of abandoned hardrock mines. It was not intended to raise revenues for the Treasury. 
In fact, Madam President, the Parliamentarian has already ruled that the reclamation fee provision does not constitute a tax when the Parliamentarian referred S. 326, which includes the very same reclamation fee proposal that I had, to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee rather than the Finance Committee. The House Parliamentarian made the very same ruling when he referred the House companion to S. 326 to the House Natural Resources Committee rather than the Ways and Means Committee. 
I find it perplexing that anybody could argue that the amendment that Senator Gregg and I offered to the Interior appropriations bill could possibly constitute a tax. However, even if that were the case, it ought to be noted that the Interior appropriations bill originated in the House of Representatives in accordance with the origination clause of the Constitution. It does not matter that the amendment was offered in the Senate as long as the bill originated in the House. In Flint v. Stone Tracy Company, 220 U.S. 107 (1911), the Supreme Court ruled that legislation which created the tax on corporations complied with the origination clause even though the corporate tax was proposed by the Senate as a substitute to an inheritance tax that was included in the bill as reported by the House. 
The fact that H.R. 2107 was reported by the Appropriations Committee rather than the Finance Committee is not relevant. The Senate has in the past added an amendment which modified the Tax Code to an appropriations bill. For example, in 1982 the Senate added a provision to the supplemental appropriations bill which limited the availability of certain tax deductions for Members of Congress. 
Madam President, Senate rules do not permit the Parliamentarian to rule when a point of order is made against an amendment on constitutional grounds. If the Parliamentarian had been able to rule, the point of order would not have even been made and the decision would not have been close. Instead, the point of order was made with the knowledge that Senators would be able to defeat the Bumpers-Gregg amendment without actually going on record in support of allowing mining companies to continue acquiring billions of dollars worth of minerals from the taxpayers of this country without compensation and leaving those same taxpayers with environmental disasters to clean up. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have come here today for the eighth consecutive year to debate what I feel very strongly about and have always felt strongly about. I have never succeeded. Since I am going to be leaving next year, I know all my friends from the West are going to be saddened by my departure, and so far I don't have an heir apparent to take on this issue. 
First of all, I want to make an announcement to the 262 million American people who know very little or nothing about this issue. The first announcement I want to make today is that they are now saddled with a clean-up cost of all the abandoned mining sites in the United States of somewhere between $32.7 and $71.5 billion. Now, let me say to the American people while I am making that announcement, you didn't do it, you had nothing to do with it, but you are going to have to pick up the tab of between $32 to $71 billion. 
The Mineral Policy Center says there are 557,000 abandoned mines in the United States. Think of that--557,000 abandoned mines, and 59 of those are on the Superfund National Priority List. Mining has also produced 12,000 miles of polluted streams. The American people didn't cause it; the mining industry did it, and 2,000 of those 557,000 sites are in our national parks. 
Now, Mr. President, my amendment would establish a reclamation fund in the Treasury and it would be funded by a 5-percent net smelter return for mining operations on taxpayer-owned land. Royalties based on gross income or a net smelter return are traditionally charged for mining on private land and for mining on State-owned land. 
Much of the hardrock mining going on in this country is being done on the lands that you have heard me talk a great deal about--that is, lands that have been sold by the Federal Government for $2.50 an acre. However, a significant amount of mining goes on on lands where people have a mining claim on Federal lands and they get a permit to start mining. The Federal Government continues to own the land. We don't get anything for it. We don't even get $2.50 an acre for that land. So my net smelter royalty only applies to those lands which we still own. 
Now, isn't that normal and natural? If you own land that has gold under it and somebody comes by and wants to mine the gold under your land, the first thing you do is say, how much royalty are you willing to pay? Nationwide, that figure is about 5 percent. But I can tell you one thing, and this is a major point, if somebody came to you and said, I want to mine the gold, the silver, platinum, or palladium under your land, the first thing you would demand is, How much are you going to pay me for it?

Mr. BUMPERS. Senator, the U.S. Government has sued this company for $600 million. The Government estimates that the cleanup cost is going to be $1 billion. The Senator comes from the great State of Idaho, and I am sure they don't enjoy ingesting cyanide any more than anybody else in any other State would. 
But the Senator would have to admit that Idaho couldn't, if it wanted to, clean up this site. It doesn't have the resources. It is the taxpayers of this country that are stuck with that $1 billion debt out there with a company which brashly says, `If you would have regulated us closer, we wouldn't have done it.' That is like saying, `If you had taken my pistol away from me, I wouldn't have committed that murder.'

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just say to the Senator from Idaho that my legislation for 8 long years has been an anathema to him. I am not saying if I were a Senator from Alaska, Idaho, or Nevada I wouldn't be making the same arguments. 
But I want to make this offer. It is a standing offer. If the State of Idaho will commit and put up a bond that they will clean up all those abandoned mine sites in that State, that they will take on the responsibility, and do it in good order, and as speedily as possible, I will withdraw my amendment. I don't have the slightest fear. We all know that this is a Federal problem. It is a Federal responsibility to clean up these mine sites. The only way we can do it is to get some money out of the people who got the land virtually free and who have left us with this $30 billion to $70 billion price tag. 
Let me go back, Mr. President, and just state that since 1872 the U.S. Government in all of its generosity has given away 3.244 million acres of land. We have given it away for $2.50 an acre. Sometimes we got as much as $5 an acre. There are 330,000 claims still pending in this country. And the Mineral Policy Center estimates that since 1872 we have patented land containing $243 billion worth of minerals--land that used to belong to the taxpayers of this country. 
We now have a moratorium on all but 235 patent applications. But the 235 applications, when they are granted, will represent the continued taxpayer giveaway of billions of dollars worth of minerals and land. 
Stillwater Mining Company in Montana has a first half certificate for 2,000 acres of land in the State of Montana. What does that mean? That means they are virtually assured of getting a deed to 2,000 acres of land. It means that they are virtually assured of paying the princely sum of $10,180. Guess what is what is lying underneath the 2,000 acres: $38 billion worth of palladium and platinum. My figure? No. Stillwater's figure. Look at their prospectus. Look at their annual report. They are saying to the people who own stock, `Have we pulled off a coup.' We are going to get 2,000 acres of Federal land for $10,180, and it has $38 billion worth of hardrock minerals under it--palladium and platinum. 
You know, one of the things that I think causes me to fail every year is that it is so gross, so egregious, that people can't believe it is factual, that it is actually happening. But it is true. 
Look at what happened to Asarco. They paid the U.S. Government $1,745. What did they get? $2.9 billion worth of copper and silver. 
You never heard of a company called Faxe Kalk. Do you know the reason you never heard of it? It is a foreign mining company. You don't usually hear of them. The other reason you don't hear of them is because they are a Danish company. One of the things that makes this issue so unpalatable is that many of the biggest 25 mining companies in the United States are foreign companies. 
We ought to go today to Denmark and say, `We would like some of your North Sea oil.' What do you think they would say if we said, `Look, we are going to start drilling here off the coast of Denmark. We will give you a dollar now and then for the privilege.' They would say, `You need to be submitted for a saliva test.' 
But the Faxe Kalk Corporation comes here, and they say, `You have 110 acres out here in Idaho, Uncle Sam. We would like to have it. We will pay $275 for it.' 
So they go to Bruce Babbitt and they say, `We will give you $275 for this 110 acres.' 
Do you know what is underneath it? One billion dollars worth of a mineral called travertine. It is a mineral used to whiten paper. That is $275 the taxpayers get and $1 billion a Danish corporation gets. 
In 1995 the Secretary of the Interior was forced to deed 1,800 acres of public land in Nevada to Barrick Gold Co., a Canadian company, for its Gold Strike Mine. Barrick paid $9,000 for that 1,800 acres. 
Mr. President, there isn't a place in the Ozark Mountains of my State where you could buy land for one-tenth that price. 
The law required Secretary Babbitt to give Barrick, which is the most profitable gold company in the world, land containing $11 billion worth of gold for $9,000. 
I could go on. There are other cases just as egregious as that. For 8 long years, I have stood at this very desk, and I have made these arguments, as I say, which are so outrageous I can hardly believe I am saying them, let alone believing them. 
Newmont Mining Co. is one of the biggest gold companies in the world. They have a large mine in Nevada which is partially on private land. 
When people say that somebody is mining on private lands, if you will check, Mr. President, you will find that in most cases that land was Federal land that somebody else patented, and then somebody like Newmont comes along, and they say, `You hold a patent on this land that you got from the Federal Government for $2.50 an acre and we want to mine on it.' Do you know what Newmont pays to the land owner on its mine in Nevada? An 18 percent royalty. 
Mr. President, as I just mentioned, most of the land being mined on, so-called private lands, are private because somebody bought it from the Federal Government years ago for $2.50 or $5 an acre. 
True, it is private. They own it. They paid for it. The mining companies are willing to pay the States--they are willing to pay the States a royalty. They are willing to pay the States a severance tax. They are willing to pay the private owners of this country an average of 5 percent. But when it comes to paying the Federal Government, it is absolutely anathema to them. There is no telling how much the National Mining Association spends every year on lobbying, on publicity, on mailers, you name it, to keep this sweetheart deal alive. 
Since I started on this debate 8 years ago, the mining companies of this country have taken out billions of dollars worth of minerals from taxpayer-owned land. And do you know what the Federal Government and the taxpayers of this country got in exchange for that? One environmental disaster after another to clean up. And so that is the reason my bill, which contains a royalty and a reclamation fee, goes into a reclamation fund to at least start undoing the environmental damage these people have done because it is too late to get a royalty out of them. The gold is gone. We got the shaft. They got the gold. And it is too late to do anything about it. But you can start making them pay now to clean up those 555,000 sites. 
Arizona has a 2 percent gross value royalty for mines located on State lands and a 2.5 percent net income severance tax for all mines in the State. 
Montana, 5 percent; fair market for raw metallic minerals; 1.6 percent of the gross value in excess of $250,000 for gold, silver, platinum group metals. 
All of these States charge royalties for mining operations on State-owned land. Most of them also charge a severance tax for mining operations on all land in the State. Mr. President, what do they know that we don't? A lot. The States are collecting the money, but not Uncle Sam. 
Do you know why I have lost this fight for the last 8 years? Those States that have mining on Federal lands have great representation in the U.S. Senate. I know that every single Western Senator is going to start flocking onto this floor as soon as I start talking about this amendment. 
Do you see anybody else on this floor who is not from the West? Do you know why? My mother used to say, `Everybody's business is nobody's business.' This is everybody's business, except it just doesn't affect their States. There are no mining jobs in their States. For 8 years I have heard all these sayings, as to how many jobs you are going to lose, despite the fact the Congressional Budget Office says, `None.' 
`You are going to lose all these jobs. It is going to discommode the economies of our respective States.' And yet the States don't hesitate. We have people in this body who are Senators from the West who have served in State legislatures, who helped pass these laws, who helped impose royalties and severance taxes against the mining companies. But somehow or other they go into gridlock when they get here. At the State level they don't mind assessing these kinds of taxes. The States need the money. We do, too. We are the ones who are tagged with this gigantic bill for reclamation. 
Mr. President, I could go through a list of things I have here. Amax, for example, pays 6-percent royalty on the Fort Knox Mine in Alaska. The chairman of the Energy Committee 2 years ago passed legislation providing for a land exchange on Forest Service land in Alaska. The Kennecott Mining Co. was willing to pay the Forest Service a $1.1 million fee up front, and then a 3-percent net smelter return on the rest of it. We agreed on it, ratified it. I voted for it. 
But, now, isn't it strange that here is a mine in Alaska that we had to legislatively approve--because of the ownership of the land, it involved a land exchange--and I was happy to do it because it was a fair deal and these people demonstrated an interest in paying a fair royalty for what they took. 
Mr. President, I will yield the floor. I will not belabor this any further.

Mr. BUMPERS. Let me say to my colleagues that I didn't get a chance to ask for a division. So, if you want to stand on ceremony, if you want to go home and tell the folks back home why you voted to continue giving billions of dollars worth of gold and silver away every year because of this little fine, distinguished point, you go ahead and do that. Be my guest. 
If you are looking for something to hang your hat on even though you would be entirely incorrect, you can do it. 
Do you know something else? The Senator from Alaska, the Senator from Nevada, the Senator from Idaho, and others who introduced this bill in this Senate, they have a royalty provision in their bill. That bill, like the bills I introduced, has been referred to the Senate Energy Committee, not the Finance Committee. Obviously my amendment does not contain a tax. 
So we raise this little fine diversionary point and we hope that people will forget that, since 1872, 243 billion dollars' worth of their property has been expropriated by the biggest corporations in the world--not in America, in the world. So, candidate, when you see a 30-second spot next year saying, `He voted to continue this foul, outrageous, egregious practice, and the landowners of this country, the taxpayers who own it, you tax them for everything.' How many times during the budget debate did I hear the cries about the `poor, taxed American taxpayer?' Go home and tell that taxpayer you were just kidding. If you weren't kidding, why are you voting to continue to give billions of dollars worth of their property away every year? 
The Senator from Alaska says, `If you pass the Bumpers amendment, you are going to drive all these mining companies offshore.' Do you know what my response to that is? If all you want to do, Stillwater Mining Co., is take 38 billion dollars' worth of platinum off of 2,000 acres of land in Montana and give us $10,000 back for your $38 billion, so long, good riddance. What on Earth are we thinking about in this body? 
So, Mr. President, let me make this point one more time because I promise you there is going to be a lot of 30-second spots next year on this issue. You cannot duck this one forever. You cannot campaign back home on the finely crafted point of order made by the Senator from Washington that this doesn't belong in this bill and the House of Representatives will blue slip it. Since when did that become a big item around here? If you are looking for something to hang your hat on, you go ahead; you vote for the point of order and then go home next fall, and when you are in a debate with your opponent and he says, `He has voted time and again to give away these billions of dollars of resources that belong to you, the American people for nothing; he is willing to make the oil companies pay 12.5 percent royalty, make the gas companies pay a 12.5 percent royalty, is willing to make the coal operators pay a 12.5 percent royalty, or an 8 percent royalty for underground mining, but when it comes to gold and silver, he gets lockjaw, just can't get it out of the chute.' You answer that when your opponent hits you with that and tells you that the Federal Government would have received $12 billion in royalties since 1872 for patented land alone.

Let me make one other point. Even if the point of order was valid against the reclamation fee, which it clearly is not, how can anybody argue that the royalty is unconstitutional. 
So I leave it to your conscience on how you want to handle this. I will yield now to the Senator from Alaska.

I consider this the most egregious thing that the Senate turns its back on every year. Of all the battles I have fought, particularly on the defense budget and in the Energy Committee, none of them are of equal importance to me as this. It is an absolute enigma to me how this body continues to vote to continue this outrageous practice. 
While you are telling them about that fine constitutional distinction, in answer to why you are giving the gold and silver away to the biggest mining companies in the world, also remind them that not only do we not get one farthing in return for our gold and silver, they have just left you with a $32 to $70 billion cleanup cost.

The reason I can tell you that with absolute certainty is because the bill of the Senator from Alaska, the Senator from Idaho, and the Senator from Nevada, has a royalty provision in it. The Parliamentarian of this body referred it to the Energy Committee--not the Finance Committee. There isn't any question that there is no point of order against the royalty provision in this bill.

Mr. BUMPERS. Does the Senator realize that the land on which they are paying 18 percent royalty was formerly Federal land and was patented by a totally different person and they bought it, they bought it from somebody else who paid the Federal Government either $2.50 an acre or $5 an acre? They are paying him, not the Federal Government. 
You see, if they had been smart enough to get a patent before this other fellow did, they would not have had to pay anything. Now they are paying somebody else who patented the land 18 percent, but if they had gotten the patent from the Federal Government, they wouldn't have had to pay a penny. 
Indeed, Senator, I don't want to make too much light of your argument, but I don't even know what your answer is. I still do not understand why it is they are willing to pay 18 percent royalty to a guy who patented the land from the Federal Government. It is now private land because he bought it for $2.50 an acre. They are willing to pay him 18 percent royalty but the other lands--it is a part of the same lode of gold that they got a patent on from the Federal Government. They are not willing to pay one farthing, and the reason they are not willing to, I say to the Senator, you and I both know the answer, they got a bird nest on the ground.

No. 1, this point of order made, this constitutional point of order: If you are going to vote on this, you bear in mind that if we allow a point of order to be made against my amendment, what is to stop others from raising points of order against any of your amendments where the opponents want to avoid an up or down vote?

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me first of all say my opposition to my colleague's amendment is difficult for me. I have the utmost respect for him. We have a fine working relationship. Occasionally we have a disagreement, as on this amendment. I know he feels very strongly about it. 
My interests in the wilderness areas and the rivers of this country go back to the time when I was Governor of the State of Arkansas. Long before Congress considered wilderness legislation, Arkansas was considering it. I must confess before God and everybody that my wilderness proposal was the only substantive legislation I lost or was unable to pass in my first term as Governor. It was considered a little bit of a radical concept. 
Now, of course, we have millions and millions of acres in the national forests and State forests set aside for wilderness areas. It was a concept whose time had not come in 1971. I remember one legislator said, `Who wants a wilderness? If you want one, go grow one.' That is how shallow the thinking was about wilderness back then. 
Fortunately, I was able to designate a few rivers as scenic rivers. I am pleased we were able to do that. I am a strong believer in preserving everything that has any aesthetic or cultural value. 
Now, as I see this proposal, not my colleague's proposal, but as I see what the President is proposing, I just do not understand, frankly, the opposition. We have had some calls in our office suggesting that this is a United Nations plot to take over private property. Well, I wouldn't be standing here saying that the President's idea is a good one if I thought for a minute it was going to take people's property away from them, that there was some kind of cabal or conspiracy to do such a thing as that. 
I guess that you could compare this to a scenic highway. In Arkansas we designate scenic highways in our State. You know why we do that? To entice tourists to drive on those scenic highways. You drive a few miles west of Washington, DC, and all you can see are signs saying `Scenic Highways.' I have never heard any outcry from anybody in my State opposing scenic highways. We love them. They do wonders for the Arkansas tourist industry. 
If I understand the proposal on the heritage rivers, it is designed so that the President would have to be told or he would have to be requested by the people in the local community that they want to declare their river an American heritage river. If he did it, it would be an honorary designation more than anything else. The only time any Federal resources would be committed to it would be if the local community decided that they wanted to start a new project along the river, as we have done in Little Rock, AR, with a beautiful new park. 
In 1972, I attended a Southern Governors' Conference in Austin, TX. We always have a big dinner at the close of those things. Lady Bird Johnson was my seatmate at dinner. I had never met her before. She is a very gracious, charming woman. The Lady Bird Johnson Park out here is a real tribute to her. She told me, `Governor Bumpers, I was in Little Rock about 2 weeks ago and I was staying in a brandnew hotel. I looked out my window toward the river and there was the county jail and a sand and gravel operation.' She said, `I believe that Little Rock is the only city in the world on a major river that doesn't have a riverfront park that utilizes the beauty of the river and builds on the beauty of that river.' 
I came back and reported that to the city fathers in Little Rock. It was rather embarrassing when she brought it to my attention. To make a long story short, we now have one of the most 
magnificent riverfront parks in Little Rock, AR, today, of any State in the Nation. We have a week-long Riverfest festival which everybody in Arkansas takes great pride in. 
There is nothing underhanded or sinister in this proposal. The President is not asking for legislative authority. He is simply saying, if the community of Little Rock came to him and said, `We want this river in our State declared an American heritage river,' he could proclaim it, like giving them a plaque. Everybody in this body has 1,000 plaques. What is wrong with that, providing recognition to aesthetic values in this rather meager way? 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, more than a year ago I addressed this body to tell my colleagues about a proposed gold mine that posed a major threat to Yellowstone National Park. Crown Butte Mining, Inc. proposed to construct a 72-acre impoundment area with a dam that would be somewhere between 75 and 100 feet high, which would have a plastic lining on the bottom and some sort of a cap on top to keep oxygen away from the 5.5 million tons of tailings from the mining operation that would go into this impoundment area. The purpose of keeping the oxygen away from it is to keep the waste from turning into sulfuric acid. This earthfill dam would be located high about Yellowstone National Park and the Yellowstone River, in one of the most seismically active, earthquake-prone areas of the country. An area where it snows thirty feet a year. 
I introduced a bill at the time to withdraw Federal lands from around that mine from further disposal under the mining laws, and to draw attention to this problem. I said at that time that my bill would not legally stop Crown Butte from proceeding with the mine, but that I hoped my bill would discourage them and dissuade them from doing it. I said that I hoped that Crown Butte, as good corporate citizens, would not force the issue and leave us to wonder whether or not this 5.5 million tons of tailings that they proposed to impound there could possibly break loose and pollute the Clarks Fort and Soda Butte Creek, which flows right into Yellowstone National Park. 
To their credit, Crown Butte has not proceeded. They recognized that the public wanted to protect Yellowstone, and they were going to have to overcome some fairly significant environmental problems. And they reached an agreement with the administration and with local conservation groups that had sued them, and they agreed to let the United States buy out their interest. They reached that agreement more than a year ago, and the only thing that is required for it to be consummated--for Yellowstone to be protected from this threat and for the company to receive what they believe is fair compensation--is for us to fund that agreement in this bill. 
The Interior Appropriations bill includes $65 million for this purpose. So we have the money to accomplish this goal of protecting Yellowstone National Park. 
Unfortunately, as the bill currently stands, it requires further legislation for the administration to actually use the money for that purpose. I hope we dispense with that requirement. The question is simple--do we protect Yellowstone National Park through an agreement which is supported by both the mining 
company and the National Park Service, and which involves paying the mining company the appraised value of its property? Or do we need to kick this around for another two years, and reward the mining company for being a responsible corporate citizen by saying, `We've got to think more about this'? 
As the ranking minority Member of the Senate Energy Committee, I am very sensitive to that Committee's responsibilities. But it is quite clear that no new law is required for this agreement to be consummated. It involves purchasing private inholdings in a National Forest--something the Interior Appropriations Committee has funded in hundreds of places over the past several years on the authority of existing law. 
The question is simple. Do we take the opportunity to save Yellowstone, or throw it away? 
I went to Yellowstone when I was 12 years old--breathtaking. I never forgot any part of it, the geysers, the magnificent waterfalls--all of it. Here is the first national park in America. Yellowstone, a crown jewel. To allow a huge industrial development generating hundreds of tons of highly acidic mine waste to threaten to destroy the first national park in America, one of the real crown jewels of the world, not just America, is absolutely unacceptable. 
Many times we find that we in this chamber can't agree on some proposal to protect environmental values because there is another side, and a conflict. Here there is no other side. The mining company wants to solve this problem. The conservation community wants to solve this problem. I hope that when we take this matter up in conference, we will drop this requirement for further legislation and simply solve the problem.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have not heard every speech on the question of the National Endowment for the Arts. I know about the principal amendments. Frankly, the amendments that most intrigue me are those that propose for block grant. I am not sure I am going to vote for anything that provides for a block grant, based on what I know about the proposals that are being made. But I will come back to that in just a moment. 
I would like to share with my colleagues one of the reasons I am a strong supporter of the National Endowment for the Arts. If I were `king,' we would be putting over $1 billion a year into the program, maybe more than that, because I personally feel that it provides the kind of cultural benefit that is not only sorely lacking in this country, but is diminishing. Mr. President, $100 million represents one-tenth of 1 percent of our $1.6 trillion-plus budget. 
That is 38 cents for every American citizen to provide programs that enrich the culture of this Nation and give a lot of youngsters who would not otherwise have the opportunity the absolute, abject joy of enjoying music, good literature, and dance. 
I can tell you that no nation has ever really prospered well that didn't have a culture that embraced the performing arts and the fine arts. 
I am sorry Mapplethorpe ever got a grant. That is the thing that set off the firestorm in the country, from which we have never recovered in the Congress. But let me go back. 
I grew up in Charleston, AR, with a population during the Depression of 851 people. The only cultural enrichment we got in that town was a high school band. It was started when I was a sophomore in high school. So I took band and became a trumpet player and later became trumpet player in the University of Arkansas band as well as drum major of the Razorback Band--because I had learned some music in the high school band. I might add that we were extremely fortunate because we had an unusual band director, a brilliant man. He used to gather some members of the band at his home in the evening. We listened to great music--Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Sibelius--and that is when I developed, as a very young teenager, a keen appreciation for symphonic music. We went to Jackson, MS, to a regional band contest, and our sextet won first place. Not only were we learning something about good music, but we were also learning something about how one builds his ego, his self-esteem, and his pride out of this little town. 
So when I went to the University of Arkansas, as I said, I was in the band, sang in the university chorus, went to all the drama presentations, and then I went into the Marine Corps. 
After the war--I told this story a couple of years ago on the floor of the Senate--I was waiting to come home. I was in Hawaii. One day I saw a bulletin saying that anybody interested in Shakespeare should show up at such and such a barracks this evening at 7 o'clock. So I went. Lord knows I had never been exposed to Shakespeare. The man who had put the sign up and who was going to teach Shakespeare turned out to be a Harvard professor of Shakespearean literature. He had a tape recorder. Tape recorders were unheard of then. I had never seen a tape recorder, and I certainly had never spoken into one, and, therefore, I didn't know what my voice sounded like. 
So, after giving us about a 1-hour lecture on Shakespeare, he took his tape recorder, and he said, `I am going to deliver a couple of lines from Hamlet's Speech to the Players.' He had a magnificent baritone voice with that Shakespearean accent. He spoke into his microphone, `Speak the speech, I pray you.' And then he went on. I could tell it to you now. I do not want to bore you with it. But I can still remember every word of it. 
So, when he played it back, it was so beautiful to hear this mellifluous voice. Then he handed it to me and said, `Here, you do it.' He put the lines in front of me, and I spoke into the tape recorder. Then he played it back. I could not believe how poorly I spoke. 
You know, I took a vow that evening that I did not want to sound like that. I wanted to have a rich tone of voice like he had. But, more than anything else, I discovered that there was a lot of literature that I knew nothing about that could be very enriching. 
So, I came back, and I studied diction and debate. I began, on occasions when I got a chance, to go to all the drama presentations. Most people in this audience are frustrated actors. But my point is all of that had such a powerful influence on my life. I daresay, if it had not been for those experiences, I would have never been Governor of my State, and I certainly wouldn't be standing here as a U.S. Senator. These are the sort of experiences that the National Endowment for the Arts funds for so many youngsters, experiences that they would never otherwise have. 
When I was Governor, my wife was looking for some way to use 
her position as First Lady to benefit the children of Arkansas. Nancy Hanks, who was then Chairman of the National Endowment, came to Arkansas at Betty's invitation. Betty talked Nancy Hanks into giving her a $50,000 grant to do a small pilot program of art in the first grade. Betty had been an art major. She thought children ought to be exposed to art in the first grade. 
So, the National Endowment, because of her appeal to Nancy Hanks, gave her $50,000, and she started a few programs. Today programs of that sort are common. Every first grade in Arkansas has art. It is mandated now. 
She had a little left over from the $50,000, so she decided she would take it down to the prison and see if any of the inmates had any talent for art. It was absolutely amazing how much talent the inmates had. All I could think about was how many of those people might not have been in prison if somebody had picked up on either their artistic talent or maybe some musical talent that had never been explored. 
Do you know something, Mr. President? When I became Governor of my State, the prisons were in such horrible condition that they were under the control of the Federal courts. We couldn't do anything in the prisons without Federal court approval, they were so terrible. I was sort of hesitant to go down there. But I went. I was doing everything I could to improve the condition of our prisons. You know what Winston Churchill said once that you can tell more about a civilization by the way they treat their elderly and the conditions of their prisons than anything else. It is a strange thing but probably true. 
So, I started going down to have lunch with the inmates. I would visit with them. I visited with the hardened killers that were on death row. I can tell you, I don't believe in all my conversations with the inmates in the Arkansas prisons that I ever visited one who had a role in the senior class play in high school, who played in the band, who had a college degree--though there were a few there--or who owned his own home. Nobody is shocked at that. We know who is in the prisons--people from broken homes, people who are uneducated, and people who never had a dog's chance as far as learning anything about art, literature, or music. 
I can tell you that the $100 million we spend on this program may be the most productive money we spend. It is tragic that it is not at least 10 times more than it is. You think about the greatest Nation on Earth, the United States, spending 38 cents per person per year to support the arts while Canada and France spend $32, almost 100 times more per person than we do. In Germany, it is $27 per person. My colleague and I share a concern. I heard his speech a moment ago. He comes at it a little differently than I would. But certainly his argument about how much our home State gets is, in my opinion, a valid argument. We got about $400,000 this year. I think that in the past we have gotten as much as $500,000. But, if you disbursed the $100 million of the National Endowment for the Arts money according to population, we would get $1 million. We have 1 percent of the population of this country. We would get $1 million. We feel a little slighted. 
But there is another dimension to it. That is, if we are going to do block grants to the States, some money should be held aside for national programs that serve all of the States, such as PBS, public broadcasting. I see a lot of fine shows on PBS that are partially funded by NEA grants. In my opinion, many of those shows would not be there for all to enjoy without that funding. If you didn't have the National Endowment, a lot of national programs that benefit everybody, even National Public Radio in Alaska and West Virginia, would not exist. 
Second, the national programs that are funded by the National Endowment for the Arts raise an average of $12 in matching money for every dollar that NEA provides. In my State, we leverage $3 in matching funds for all the money you send to Arkansas. And we are proud of that. 
So, I am not so sure that, if you put these block grants out, you are not going to wind up losing a lot of matching dollars. 
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas has an amendment that has some appeal to me. It provides 75 percent of the money in block grants. I think maybe 60 percent for openers would be better. So I am not totally opposed to that. But I am not going to vote for any proposal to block-grant money that does not carry with it a mandate for matching money. If we are going to match money, as we do in Arkansas now, $3 for every $1, why not require the same of block grant recipients? 
When you consider how much money the arts produce in this country--between $30 and $40 billion a year--and you think about how much income tax we collect a year from the arts, we are big winners. The $100 million is peanuts compared to the $ 3.4 billion in revenue the arts generate in this country. 
I am not going to take much more time here. I see we have other speakers wishing to speak. But there are some national programs that we need to continue funding with this money. The YMCA is putting culture programs in its facilities throughout the country with NEA support. There are a lot of NEA-funded regional dance tours, a lot of national dance tours, and programs for children everywhere. 
Incidentally, when I played in the high school band we thought we were pretty good. At the bi-State band contest with Oklahoma, the Iowa State band performed on the stage of the Fort Smith High School. I had never heard a really great band before. We only had 30 members in our band. Here was this Iowa State band with 150 members, and when that conductor brought his baton down, I thought I was going to faint. I had never heard such music. So it was, the first time I ever went to a symphony. I am telling you, these things are important to the culture of this country. I do not for the life of me understand the antipathy that some of the Members of this body have for what I consider to be absolutely essential and basic to the character of this country. It is important that we give a lot of citizens of this country access to the performing and fine arts. That would never happen if it were not for this program. 
I look forward to the day--I will not be here, Mr. President, after next year--but I yearn for the day when we treat this program with the respect and the money it deserves. And, like so many other things, if we do away with it and let that bulwark of our culture slip into oblivion, we will pay a very heavy price for it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, several years ago, there was a magnificent book that came out by a great historian, Barbara Tuchman, called the `March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam.' The book cataloged how in moments of history, terrible tragedies, terrible mistakes could have been avoided because there was always some lone voice saying, `Don't do that.' Almost invariably, the politics of the moment dictated otherwise. 
The book `From Troy to Vietnam,' starts out with the Trojan horse. Every schoolchild knows the story of how the Greeks went to rescue Helen from the Trojans. Finally, after many, many months of not being able to break into the Trojan fortress, the Greeks designed this Trojan horse, a wooden horse, a fabric horse, as the Aeneid describes it, and they place this horse outside the Trojan fortress. The Trojans are afraid that the gods have placed the horse there, and it would be a terrible tragedy for them if they didn't let the horse into the fortress. One person, named Laocoon, said, `Don't let that horse in. What more than madness has possessed your brains?' he said. `What have the Greeks ever done for us?' But he was the sole voice of dissent. So they opened the gates. They let the horse in, and 50 of the Greeks' finest soldiers poured out of the belly of the horse and took the fortress. 
In World War II, when the debate was going on with the German high command about whether to get involved in the war, whether to antagonize the United States or not, the commander of all the German submarines was consulted. `If you can sink so much allied shipping,' they said, `the United States won't be a threat.' And the German U-boat commander said, `You're silly; you're foolish. We can do a lot of damage, but we can't come close to sinking that much allied shipping.' And his voice was drowned out as if he had never spoken. 
When the warlords of Japan sat around plotting the attack on Pearl Harbor, the great Japanese admiral, Yamamoto, stood up and said, `I've gone to school there. I know the Americans, I know their industrial output, I know their tenacity, and I know their love of country. This will not work.' He went ahead to say, `I am at the Japanese Emperor's beck and call, and I will do anything I am called on to do.' The rest of that is history. 
Yamamoto's voice was drowned out. 
Today, we have this reconciliation bill before us. And there were few lone souls in the U.S. Senate who voted against the great tax cut of 1981, Mr. President. Only 11 people stood up in the U.S. Senate and said, `I'm not voting for a concept of doubling defense spending and cutting taxes and presuming to balance the budget.' Eleven souls said, `No, let's not do this. It is the height of folly.' 
Our voices were drowned out. At that moment, the national debt was $1 trillion and the interest on that debt in 1981 was $60 billion. Our voices were drowned out. And 16 years later, because our voices were drowned out, today's national debt is $5.3 trillion, and the interest on that debt has gone from $60 billion a year to $359 billion a year. That is the interest we are paying on the national debt in this year of our Lord, 1997. You know how much of that $359 billion is as a result of the craziness of this place in 1981? Approximately three-hundred billion dollars. 
The pages who sit in front of me will not live long enough to see that figure even reduced very much. You want to do something for the children? You say, let us give the middle-class children of this country a tax break. How about tomorrow's children and the children in the next generation and the next generation? What are you doing for them? You are saddling them with an incredible debt. When I think about what we could do if we would not pass this bill. With the economic growth we have enjoyed for the past six or seven years, and as we anticipate it will be for the immediate future, would almost certainly balance the budget in 1998, and we could even run a surplus in 1999. Balancing the budget is within our grasp, an eyelash away. And this bill thwarts it in the name of a middle-class tax cut. 
About the only distributional analysis that has been done on this bill is a study by the Citizens for Tax Justice. And what do they say? Just look at this chart. 
Look at this middle-class tax cut, Mr. President. The bottom 20 percent, people who make less than $12,000 a year do not get a tax cut. They get virtually no benefit from the child credit and capital gains and the other major tax cuts. So with the increase in cigarette taxes and airline ticket taxes, the bill is going to cost them $39 a year. So much for the poorest of the poor in this country. They not only don't get a cut, they pay more. 
Go to the next 20 percent, the people who make up to $22,000 a year. What do they get? Why, they get a whopping $8-a-year cut in their taxes--a few cents a week. 
If you combine these two bottom groups, you will see that the bottom 40 percent on average will see their taxes go up by $31 a year. 
Then go to the next 20 percent. The next 20 percent, the people who make $22,000 to $39,000 a year, they are going to wind up with a $171-a-year tax cut--less than 50 cents a day. 
So where is all the money going? 
Look at this chart for just one moment. The next 15 percent that, they get $1,163 a year. What does the next 4 percent get? The people who make $109,000 to $246,000 get $1,772 a year in tax cuts. And the top 1 percent, the people who make $246,000 or more, get $16,227 a year. 
So seventy-six percent of all the benefits of this bill go to the top 20 percent of the people in this country. That is a middle-class tax cut? That is to help the middle-class families of this country? 
This bill has had more public relations, more ballyhoo under the name of a middle-class tax cut. No wonder 54 percent of the people of the country say they favor this bill. And you know why? Because the question is asked, `Do you favor the balanced budget resolution that Congress is considering?' Well, of course they favor a balanced budget resolution. Who doesn't? What a travesty. Mr. President, I have been divinely hoping that negotiations between the President and the Republicans would reach an impasse, breakdown, with gridlock, because if we did nothing the 
budget would be balanced in 1998, 1 year from this moment. If somebody had said in 1993, `You vote for this omnibus budget reconciliation bill and we'll balance the budget in 1998,' we would have insisted they take a saliva test. 
When I think of all the good men and women who used to sit in the House and the Senate, and they are gone only because they had the courage to vote for that bill in 1993, which raised taxes on the top 1.3 percent of the richest people in America--1.3 percent--because a few courageous people in this body--Jim Sasser, Harris Wofford, two of the finest men ever to serve in the U.S. Senate, who are no longer with us. And a lot more people in the House are no longer with us--they had the courage to face up to something that was very unpopular at the time. But even on the outside they can take solace in the fact that they honored what they believed was a nonnegotiable demand by the people of this country for a balanced budget. 
Do you know what we did as a result of that 1993 vote? I am always reluctant to talk about this because I have so many good friends on the other side of the aisle, but truth has to be told. Not one single Republican in the U.S. Congress, in the Senate or the House, not one voted for that bill. And the Democratic party suffered at the polls as a result of that vote. 
A lot of people stood on the Senate floor and said the 1993 bill is going to bring about a terrible recession. So what really happened? Before we passed that bill, the deficit for 1993 was estimated to be $290 billion. And as a result of passing the deficit reduction bill, it turned out to be only $255 billion. In 1994, it dropped to $203 billion. In 1995, it was $154 billion. In 1996, it was $107 billion. For 1997, it is now calculated at around $45 billion, and many economists say it could be less. From almost $300 billion, in 4 short years, to $45 billion because a few people in this body had the spine to vote for something that was politically unpopular. Those people who lost their seats as a result of that vote are undoubtedly watching their hard-won victory being sacrificed on the altar of political expedience. The balanced budget of 1998 that is just about to elude us. 
You know, the economy, if it stays as good as it is right now through all of 1998, despite the foolishness of this bill, we still might balance the budget in 1998 if the economy stays good, but only for a nanosecond. Under the calculations of the bill, we are going to spend almost $300 billion more in deficit spending over the next 5 years, and the interest on that will be $15 billion--forever. That $300 billion goes right on top of the $5.3 trillion you see here. At the end of 5 years, instead of $5.3 trillion, that will be $5.6 trillion. At the end of 5 years, instead of $359 billion in annual interest, it could well be $375 billion. 
You want to do something for children? Don't saddle them with that kind of debt. 
The Senator from New Mexico pointed out some very cogent points a while ago with which I do not disagree. I favor the educational benefits in this bill. I favor the child health care provision which we are paying for with a cigarette tax. It isn't all bad. But it isn't all critical, not as necessary as a balanced budget. 
We are today going to grab defeat from the jaws of victory. The only gratifying thing to me about this whole exercise is it shows the hypocrisy of the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I always knew that was political, but it is a very effective political tool. It took a lot of courage because it was portrayed that if you did not vote for the constitutional amendment, you were portrayed as being against a balanced budget. The fact that we are about to pass a bill which will supposedly balance the budget by 2002 reveals the hypocrisy of those people who said, `You have to have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.' 
And those of us who voted for the 1993 bill to cut spending by $250 billion and increase taxes by $250 billion have something to be proud of because that act instilled so much confidence in Wall 
Street and the people of this Nation, the economy has been on fire ever since. The Nation thought the people here in Washington had finally stiffened their spines to do something that was right. 
I cannot believe we are in the process of postponing balancing the budget for 5 years--the very people who said, you must put it in the Constitution and who said they wanted a balanced budget more than anything in the world. Here it is within our grasp. And what is their solution? Postpone it for 5 years, spend another $300 billion in deficit spending. 
Mr. President, the needs in this Nation are truly great. We are the greatest Nation economically on Earth. We certainly are the oldest living democracy. We have the oldest Constitution in the world. 
Militarily, we are certainly the strongest on Earth, and well we should be the way we spend money on defense. But when I think about the needs of this country, if you absolutely have to spend this money, there are better things to spend it on. We asked the Department of Education what it would cost to provide every child in America with a college education--every one who would get a college education if it were within their financial means. It is very interesting, this tax cut is roughly $135 billion, and it would take $1 billion less--$134 billion--to provide a college education for every youngster in America that would want one. 
So the next time you talk to the most conservative groups in your hometown--the chamber of commerce or the Rotary Club--you ask them, do you think this country would be stronger if we educated with a college education every kid in America, or if we give a $135 billion tax cut to the wealthiest people in America? I can promise you that if you were debating that on national television, it would be 90-10 in favor of educating our children. 
So, Mr. President, I divinely hope that everything I say today turns out quite differently from the way I am predicting it. But I don't believe that is going to happen. If Barbara Tuchman were alive, she would certainly include this vote as one of the top follies in our Nation's history. Once again, we have managed because of political expediency to finesse the real problem. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have already spoken on the subject today. There are a couple of other things I would like to add. 
First of all, there is always a big constituency for tax cuts and I have never known a Member of Congress to lose a vote by voting for a tax cut. We lost a lot of good men and women in 1993 because they voted for a tax increase, which has reduced the deficit from $300 billion to an anticipated $40 billion this year. But they are not here. They honored what they thought was a demand by the American people for a balanced budget, clearly within our grasp. But, you see, there is a big constituency for tax cuts. There is always a big constituency for spending. There is no constituency for a balanced budget. There are those who have looked forward to that, as I have, for 22 1/2 years. When I was deciding whether I wanted to run again, that was one of the major considerations with me. 
There are two things that I think would reinstill confidence in the American people in the congressional system and in our democratic system, in our very political system. The two things that would do more than anything to build confidence in America would be to balance the budget, and, No. 2, to change the way we finance campaigns. I concluded that neither were going to happen in the next 18 months and probably wouldn't happen during the next 6 years if I ran and were reelected. That wasn't the only consideration. 
But here we are. In 1998--every economist in the country now believes we will probably balance the budget in 1998. So what are we going to do? No. No. We screamed about balanced budgets around here for 22 1/2 years that I have been around here. Now it is within our grasp and how do we treat it? Postpone it for 5 years. Don't do it in 1998, give away some goodies. 
And there are some goodies in here that I love. The educational part of it intrigues me. I love it. But here is something the American people have been clamoring for all of these years. We could postpone this for at least a year and provide some comfort to the American people in letting them know that we are really concerned about deficit spending. 
Let me ask you this. What in the name of goodness are we always talking about Greenspan raising interest rates for, depending on the inflation rate? Everybody is scared to death the inflation rate is going to go up a couple of tenths of a point, Greenspan will raise interest rates, and this glowing economy, almost unprecedented in the annals of the history of this country, will come to a screeching halt. There will be no balanced budget once this economy goes into decline. 
I yield myself 2 additional minutes, Mr. President. 
So, what are we doing? This is not a tax cut of the magnitude of 1981. Certainly in the scheme of things it doesn't even begin to match the tax cuts of Jack Kennedy in 1961-1963. But I tell you what it is, it is $135 billion infused into the American economy which could, which just could fuel the economy to the extent of a couple of tenths of a point in inflation. And if that happens, you can bet that the Fed will raise interest rates. And if that happens you can bet that this economy is going to start slowing and you will not see a balanced budget. 
The idea, I don't mind saying, Mr. President, I don't know how to say it any stronger--the idea of doing what we are doing today and postponing something that is so near at hand, a balanced budget--postponing it for 5 years is the height of irresponsibility. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to say to my very dear friend, Senator Feinstein from California, who is anxiously awaiting the floor so she can get into the ninth circuit debate, that I am going to object to moving to that amendment until this amendment is disposed of. 
Let me also say that I am prepared to enter into a time agreement, but not yet. 
Let me start off by saying that Rasputin was a piker compared to the National Endowment for Democracy. It took him a long time to die, and it has just taken forever for this boondoggle to die. 
I have heard so may people in this body lament the size of Government, the waste of Government, the terribleness of Government, and here is $30 million of wasteful Government spending. There was actually an effort to get NED's appropriation up to $50 million 3 years ago. 
I can tell you that, in this Senator's opinion, the National Endowment for Democracy is without question the biggest waste of money I can think of next to the space station. That is saying something. 
It is a cold war relic. Everybody in this body knows that the National Endowment for Democracy was started in 1983 as an answer to communism in the world. We were not only spending $250 to $300 billion a year on defense at that point--that was not enough to contain communism around the world--we decided to add $18 million to bring democracy to the world. We started this program with $18 million in 1983, and a year after that, it soared up to about $23 million; the year after that, $27 million, then $35 million. Then, finally, I was able to get it back to $30 million 2 years ago. And this year, in this bill, thanks to the very good judgment of our chairman of this subcommittee, Senator Gregg of New Hampshire, it was sacked as it richly deserved. 
Mr. President, we have been holding hearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee. And the headlines in the paper since January have been in anticipation of those hearings about foreign influence in American elections. I want to say that if China had had any judgment at all they would have consulted with the NED before they started trying to influence American elections. 
The National Endowment for Democracy has as good a record of meddling in foreign elections as any organization the Earth has ever known. They tried to clean it up a little bit. They used to be very overt, and made no bones about who they were giving money to. But they are still giving out money to influence foreign elections. 
One of the things that is the most intriguing of all is: Who do they give this $30 million to? 
At the expense of sounding terribly arrogant, I would just like to say that on the debate on the space station which occurred day before yesterday, I daresay if that debate were held on national television before an American audience of every voter in America, the space station would be dead, dead, dead, at this moment, by an overwhelming vote. But, unhappily, all the people who might be watching that telecast wouldn't be interested in those few jobs that NASA has put in their State. 
But now when it comes to boondoggles and giving away money, I invite my colleagues' attention to this: What happens to this $30 million? It took me 2 or 3 years for the realization really to soak in that this actually is the case. 
Out of the $30 million, first of all, 15 percent of it, 15 percent of it, or $4.5 million, goes for NED Administration. And if you look at the way the money is spent, you will find a lot of it going for first class airfare to transport people all over the world, people who every year will write letters to the people who are engaged in this debate. They will write letters about what a wonderful program NED is. 
You think of it. If a food stamp program had a 15 percent administrative cost, we would kill it dead. We would not tolerate that for a moment. But we are willing to put aside $4.5 million, 15 percent of this $30 million, and allow NED to use that for administrative expense. 
But that is not the worst of it. We give the money out as follows. Listen to this, colleagues. CIPE--that's a nice acronym, isn't it. CIPE gets 13.75 percent of the money--$4.125 million. Who is CIPE? I bet you never heard of them. CIPE stands for Center for International Private Enterprise, but they are really the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. This is a little offspring of the chamber of commerce, CIPE. We give them a neat $4,125,000 out of this $30 million. 
Let me ask you this: how much of that do you think they spend on administration? Bear in mind, 15 percent comes off the top for NED administration. Then you give the chamber of commerce $4.125 million, and what do you think their administrative expense is? 
Then to even things up, we give an organization called FTUI, to make things even we give them 13.75 percent, also $4,125,000, the same amount we give the chamber of commerce. Who is FTUI? The Free Trade Union Institute. Why, that's the AFL-CIO. You cannot give money to the chamber of commerce unless you are willing to balance it out and give the AFL-CIO another $4,125,000. And what do you think their administrative expense is? Lord only knows. I cannot find out. 
So you have the administrative expense of the chamber; you have the administrative expense of the AFL-CIO; you have the 15 percent for NED right off the top. 
We are not finished. Now we go to the IRI. Whoever heard of the IRI? Now, this is going to be hard for you to believe. I will tell you who the IRI is. That is the International Republican Institute--the Republican Party. Can you believe this, another 13.75 percent, $4,125,000. We have to be evenhanded. We have to give the chamber $4.125 million, have to give the AFL-CIO $4.125 million, have to give the Republican Party $4.125 million. 
And then we get down to the fourth organization, NDI. Who do you think NDI is? Why, you guessed it. It is the National Democratic Institute--the Democratic Party. And we are going to give them 13.75 percent. They get $4,125,000. I will say one thing. What do you think the administrative expense is for all those four organizations on top of the 15 percent administrative expense of NED? Who knows? The National Endowment for Democracy is an egalitarian group; they treat everybody the same. But some are more equal than others. 
Here is the portion for everybody else. After you get through giving it out most of the money to all these groups who we know will send members to the Senate every year to tell us how wonderful NED is so we will give them another $30 million the next year after they evenhandedly give everybody $4.125 million in exchange for writing Senators here saying how wonderful it is, they have $9 million left. That's what everybody else gets. 
Do you know what that amounts to? It comes to an average of $41,096 for all the grantees who are not part of the chamber of commerce, the AFL-CIO, the Democratic Party or the Republican Party. Everybody else, the other grantees--there are 218 of them for 1996, 218 grants made with the remaining $9 million, gets an average of $41,096. Now, ain't that something--218 grants. When you get past the big boys, the Republicans, Democrats, labor and the chamber, you have 218 grants, $41,096 each. What are they going to do with that? That will not even buy enough first class air tickets to get to the election in Cambodia or wherever. And 
what is the administrative expense for those 218 grantees? You talk about money well spent and saving the world through democracy. 
Mr. President, we spend on the Agency for International Development about $4 billion a year. And did you know that I am a great champion of that program? And do you know what that is for? That is to help countries help themselves. That is to help them generate electricity so they can develop. That is to teach them how to plant crops so they can feed themselves. And it is also designed to make those people feel kindly toward the greatest democracy of all, the United States of America. And about $450 million of AID's budget is for democracy-building projects. 
And then there is Public Law 480, popularly known as Food for Peace--over $1 billion a year. Do you know who favors that? The Senator from Arkansas. We help feed people who cannot feed themselves. Mr. President, Public Law 480 has been around as long or longer than any Member of the Senate, with a couple of exceptions, and it is designed to help people keep from starving. 
Do you know what else it is designed to do? It is designed to help them feel kindly toward the United States, that great citadel of democracy. 
Then, Mr. President, there is that $13 to $14 billion a year we spend on that terrible thing that the American people have such misconceptions about called foreign aid. And you know something else? I vote for that. I vote for foreign aid. Never made any bones about it. No. 1, it helps farmers because that money also buys food. It helps industry because people buy American products with the aid we give them. It is money well spent. 
Do you know what else we expect to get out of it? We expect people to want to be like us. We expect them to want to be democratic. We expect them to want to be free and enjoy the same kinds of freedoms we enjoy here in the United States. 
I have just finished listing for you all those billions of dollars we spend for what? To try to build democracy around the world. What good do you think this $30 million will do in changing China from a Communist nation to a free democracy? None. It is utter waste, $30 paltry million dollars that ought to be saved. It is nothing. 
You have the Voice of America. You have these radio programs to influence the rest of the world about the joys of democracy and how great the United States is. And $450 million for the Agency for International Development is for democracy building. This is nothing in the world, but in 1983, when Ronald Reagan was President and everybody thought the Communists were going to come up the Potomac River and get us any minute, we thought, well, we will just dump a little more money into this democracy-building business. 
You know something else. It was never intended--I want everybody to understand this. It was never intended that the National Endowment for Democracy would be a federally funded agency. We started it off with $18 million with the clear understanding that within a short period of time they were going to have to stand on their own feet with private contributions. We never intended for that to be another perpetual Government program. And so last year, 1996, do you know what their report shows? Out of $30 million, they collected from the private sector $541,000. And if I am not mistaken that is their high watermark. 
It is just like so many other Federal programs. It is a program that becomes self-perpetuating because a lot of people find it to their advantage. It is difficult when you think about how I was trying to save $100 billion, 2 days ago, on the space station. Here I find myself just as exercised, just as exercised about $30 million because it doesn't really matter. It is money that ought not to be spent. The taxpayers have a right to expect more of us. Can you imagine, Mr. President, can you imagine members of the AFL-CIO and the Chamber of Commerce sitting around the table with some people from a foreign country and trying to explain the joys of democracy, the Chamber member representing what democracy means to him, the head of the labor union telling what democracy means to him.  
Why, if those people on the other side were not confused beforehand----

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me echo the laudatory comments the Senator from Mississippi has just paid to the majority staff. I would like to also pay tribute to the minority staff as well as the majority staff. They worked extremely well with us. They were helpful to us as well as the chairman of the committee. On our side of the aisle, I want to especially thank Galen Fountain, who is seated at my left and who was my personal agricultural aide for many years before he joined the appropriations staff, and pay special tribute to him and Rebecca Davies, who probably know on a magnitude of about five times more about this bill than Senator Cochran and I do. We simply could not function here and get a bill like this through without the very able assistance of those people. But in addition to Galen, I also want to pay tribute to Carole Geagley and to my own personal staff member, Ben Noble. They have done a magnificent job. 
Again, my sincere thanks to Senator Cochran, who is the chief architect of this bill. He did a magnificent job. If you watched here, as always when these appropriations bills are coming through, you see the Senators all gathered around here pleading with Senator Cochran and me to accept this amendment and that amendment. We would love to accept them all. It is always that way in appropriations. But the money constraints keep us from doing that. But we like to help other Senators. 
As I said yesterday afternoon on the floor, it is not pork. Sometimes it is pure, unadulterated research from which the entire Nation benefits. But having said that, I think it is a good bill. We will do our very best to honor all the Senate's wishes in the conference committee. I think we will come back here with a good bill from conference.

<TEXT>
Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I first want to extend my sincere thanks to my distinguished colleague, the chairman of this subcommittee, who crafted this bill. He has done a magnificent job. He has always been unfailingly polite, courteous and thoughtful in the process. 
I do not want to take up the Senate's time by going into a full detailed statement of what we provided and what we did not provide. But I do want to say a few things that I have said in the committee and I have said in speeches in the last couple months regarding what I believe is a serious lack of funding for research in the area of agriculture. 
We have provided well over $1 billion in this bill for agriculture research, but it pales by comparison. And in spite of that commitment, I think I have a commitment to express my concern about the comparatively small amounts we provide for agriculture research. 
We live in a world with an ever-growing population. We live in a nation with an ever-increasing demand on our natural resources, including the conversion of arable land for urban growth, for highways, and shopping centers. We live in a world where our very survival is premised on our ability to produce more food with fewer inputs on fewer acres and with fewer risks to public health and the environment. 
In the face of all these challenges, it is inconceivable that we would not place a much higher premium on investments in the research vital to human survival, simply put, the research of how we are going to feed ourselves. 
We live in a nation that is blessed with abundant natural resources. We live in a nation blessed with a bounty of agricultural products currently capable of feeding ourselves and a good part of the rest of the world. We live in a nation that has lapsed into a complacency caused by the fact that our next meal has always been as close as the corner supermarket. It would not take many days spent in the back country villages of Latin America, the ravaged countryside of Central Africa, or the weathered, tortured steps of Mongolia to witness the lack of what we daily take for granted. I constantly admonish high school and college groups who are going out into the world to remember to count their blessings more often and their money less. 
Mr. President, do not misunderstand me. I fully support the efforts of Senator Cochran in providing the funds contained in this bill for agriculture research, but I am constantly dismayed and perplexed at Congress' willingness to spend 30 times more on weapons research than we do on guaranteeing our future food supply. We spend twice as much every year just on the space station as we do on agriculture research. 
I have often felt that truly meaningful agriculture reform is only one good famine away. But I also continue to hope that such a cataclysm will not be the event that brings us to our senses. 
Senator Cochran has done an excellent job with this bill within the fiscal constraints that bind all of us. He has properly balanced the needs of the research community with the other demands to which we must answer. This Nation looks to Congress, and I admonish Congress that we do not have forever to come to grips with the train wreck that is on the horizon and is absolutely certain to occur. We must begin laying the groundwork for an agricultural policy that allows our producers all the scientific advances we can develop if we are to grow more with less. We know that certainly we will need more and we will have less if we don't. 
One other comment I make regarding the need to bolster agricultural research. Just 1 year ago, this Congress ended most of the support programs that historically protected American farmers from the market forces that often were marshaled to their disadvantage through either the plagues of weather, the domain of foreign policy, or forces beyond their control. Now they are left with the tattered safety net that has brought prices declining, as they are now doing, and there is little break to their fall. 
One of the safety net remnants in hand is our agricultural research structure. As the cost of farm inputs skyrocket, we must find ways to reduce their application. As threats to the environment increase, we must find cost-effective protections. If we expect to continue spending less on food than any other developed nation on Earth, we must find ways to make its production cost less. 
More than simply a producer, there is not a better steward of the Earth than the American farmer. The farmer knows that his livelihood is directly tied to his care for the soil and water. This bill contains funding for programs designed to help the farmer continue what he practices naturally--conservation. For the first time in many years, this bill places no limitations on the mandatory conservation programs established in the farm bill. These include the Wetlands Reserve Program, the Conservation Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, and many others established to help farmers protect our natural environment. 
In the area of rural development, important areas of spending are protected and, in some instances, provided an increase. The Water and Sewer Grants Program, one near and dear to my heart, increased this year from the budget request of $438 million to $491 million. I want to especially thank Senator Cochran for engineering that. The section 502 Single-Family Housing Program was returned to a program level of $1 billion. In addition, the Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural Areas Program, one I am happy to say is housed at the University of Arkansas, important for the sustainable agricultural prices and products, is increased to $1.5 million. 
The bill provides nearly $4 billion for the WIC Program. We all know that is the program that provides a healthy diet for poor pregnant women and thereby increases the protein diet and the brain count of the fetus. This amount is an increase of nearly $200 million above the level we provided in the fiscal year 1997 bill. Noninclusive is the $76 million we put in the recent supplemental appropriations bill. Included in the fiscal year 1998 WIC appropriation is $12 million for the WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Program. That helps provide fresh produce for WIC participants. In other words, WIC participants can buy produce at the roadside vegetable stand, just as everybody else can, with their vouchers. 
For the Food and Drug Administration, this bill provides an increase above last year--an increase--and includes a 1-year extension of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act and a Mammography Quality Standard Act. Fees collected from these two authorities will provide an additional $105.2 million for the FDA. These funds are vital to protect Food and Drug supplies and to ensure the safety and efficacy of our pharmaceutical and medical devices. 
Mr. President, just as we too often take for granted the availability of food, we too often take for granted the safety of that food. It only takes a single outbreak of E. coli in fruit juice, or similar strains in other food products, to quickly bring us short as to how fragile our health can become in the hostile world of bacteria and microorganisms. Visit with one mother of a child who has known the horror of a food-borne illness and what it can do, and you will never take the safety of our food for granted again. The Food and Drug Administration, along with the Food Safety Inspection Service, stands as a guardian to protect our food supplies and the public health. This bill serves to help those agencies carry out those very important missions. 
The bill provides $14.5 billion to complete phase 2 for the FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research. This important facility is on the front-line of helping protect the health of American consumers. Once complete, this facility will be a cornerstone of the FDA's streamlining efforts to make Government more efficient and cost effective. 
There were several initiatives included in the administration's budget request, many of which included funding 
in this bill. The food safety initiative, vitally important to protect our food supply and help bolster consumer confidence in all meat, poultry and other products, has provided nearly full funding. The human nutrition initiative, though not completely funded, gets a substantial boost. 
Mr. President, let me conclude by restating, I am again most grateful to Senator Cochran for his unfailing courtesy and consultations and for the fine job he and his excellent staff have done in crafting this bill. To expedite matters, let me simply say we are all grateful for his fair and open consideration of all requests. I gladly join him in bringing this bill to the Senate floor and urge the support of all Senators in its passage. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me echo the comments of the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, Chairman Cochran. I subscribe to everything he said. I also want to especially thank the distinguished Senator from Kansas for his very, very kind, laudatory comments. 
Having said that, let me just say I am not going to object to the amendment either. I think, in a way, it is a little bit of a sledgehammer approach. But, by the same token, the Senator is entitled to the report he requested a very long time ago. It is a legitimate request, and the Department should have responded to it much sooner. 
The Department objects to the amendment, but I am going to, on behalf of this side of the aisle, say I will accept the amendment and I strongly encourage the Department to respond, so, possibly by the time we get to conference, we can deal with this amendment. But let the Department know in advance that unless there is a very firm commitment made, the Senator's request will be honored and the amendment will wind up in the conference committee report. 
So, I am going to clear this amendment for this side of the aisle.

<TEXT>
Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this bill includes the Rural Community Advancement Program which provides flexibility to tailor financial assistance to applicant needs. Through this program rural business enterprise grants are made available. 
As you are very well aware, I have pursued funding for the Arkansas communications project since March 1992. This project will provide a statewide communications and education network that will eventually include all Arkansas publicly funded 2- and 4-year institutions of higher learning, research and extension centers, cooperative extension county offices, many rural hospitals, and State and Federal Government office buildings. The network will include compressed video, TV/video production, and data networking. When completed, the project will serve the large rural population of Arkansas as well as provide linkages and educational support to our more urban areas. 
This committee first voiced its support for the project in the fiscal year 1993, and the committee has continued to note its support every year since. Unfortunately, the University of Arkansas Divisions of Agriculture, which is sponsoring this project, has endured mixed results in getting the Department of Agriculture to honor the wishes of this committee. Promises were made and broken until the project came to the attention of Under Secretary Thompson and her staff in Rural Development. She and they have offered invaluable assistance, and I am pleased to note that the division received funding for the first phase of the project earlier this year and is actively seeking funding for the second and third phases. I should also note that the division has already committed sizeable non-federal resources to the project while reducing the total cost by nearly one-third. Am I correct in noting that the committee still strongly supports completion of this project?

The division recently submitted a grant request to the Department of Commerce and it is my expectation that the Department of Agriculture will follow through with their offer of assistance and support. 
In addition to the Arkansas communications project, the Arkansas Enterprise Group has been trying to provide assistance for rural communities and smaller companies in Arkansas so that they can join the increasingly global and international environment. However, the small companies which the Arkansas Enterprise Group is trying to help grow do not meet the criteria required to move unaided into the export market. They also fall between the cracks for other programs that aid companies to export products. Am I correct in noting that the committee supports the Arkansas Enterprise Group in their business international exporting loan fund?

Mr. BUMPERS. Now, if we do not provide--we have imposed, in effect, a law that we are requesting the States to enforce. We passed a law saying to the States, you can't allow sales of cigarettes to anybody under 18, and we have not given them any money to enforce it. How does that play with the law we passed here either last year or the year before on mandates to the States with no money?

Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator will recall the distinguished Senator from Idaho, [Mr. Kempthorne], led the fight here to provide that the Federal Government in the future must pay the States for any mandates we impose on them and for which we do not provide any money. I am asking the Senator, why doesn't this come under the category of a violation, as long as we required them to enforce the `18-year-old' prohibition, but we haven't given them any money? Why is that not a violation of the law we passed here prohibiting mandates on local jurisdictions without money?

Mr. BUMPERS. Under the rule of thumb, I come from a State that has 1 percent of the Nation's population. When I was Governor of that State we used to always assume that under all the formulas, welfare and otherwise, we would get 1 percent, because we have 1 percent of the population. In this case, if we had $34 million and we put it out on that basis, Arkansas would get $340,000. 
I don't think that would be enough to even get the water hot, in enforcing this law.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am sorry the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, left the floor. He listed a number of what he called earmarks, and the implication was that any money in this bill earmarked for specific kinds of research or specific kinds of personnel in a particular State was--he didn't say it in these words, but that it was pork and that earmarks are automatically bad. I could not disagree more. Every earmark the Senator from Arizona mentioned tonight, listed tonight in the bill, he was absolutely correct about it. Every one of them were for research projects. 
I said in my opening statement this morning that it is a tragedy that in this country we have become complacent about our food supplies, and, yet, we are adding 2 million people a year in this Nation alone to feed, and almost 100 million people a year worldwide to feed. And at the same time in this Nation, as we add 2 million people to feed, we are also taking between 2 million and 3 million acres of arable land out of cultivation for airports, urban sprawl, housing, you name it. 
Now, it is quite obvious to me that when you spend about $1.2 billion for research--I don't know precisely how much is in this bill, but when you consider the fact that we spend $13 billion a year on medical research, which I applaud, $13 billion a year for NASA, all of which I applaud--except space station, of course--and $36 billion to $40 billion--I believe $40 billion we approved the other day to make things explode in the Defense authorization bill, without so much as a whimper from one person in this body--about $40 billion in research and development. 
I am not saying it is all bad. All I am saying is here is poor old agriculture which is going to be charged with the responsibility--and is charged with the responsibility--of providing a good, safe, reliable food supply for this country. The American housewife spends 10 cents of every dollar for food, the lowest of any nation on Earth. And to suggest that somehow or other these items in here simply because they earmarked are bad and a waste of money--I can tell you, for example, that the new poultry and meat inspection system which is being implemented right now as the ultimate in providing safe food for us to eat is the result of a very small appropriation to a consortium of the University of Arkansas, Kansas State, and Iowa State--one of the best bargains we ever got. And every dime of it was earmarked to start that program several years ago. 
Mr. President, I am about to get exercised. And I could go on with all the earmarks that have provided great research for this country that we have all benefited from. 
I know there is some pork in this bill, as there is in every bill. But I can tell you just because someone says it is for the State of Mississippi or the State of Arkansas doesn't mean it is bad. The truth of matter is we have reaped tremendous benefits from some of these earmarks. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is the sixth year that I have stood at this desk and lamented the fact that we have become inured to projects which have massive cost overruns if it means a few jobs in our State or if it means you can cast a cheap vote and not pay a price for it back home. 
Now, I have been here for 22 1/2 years, and I have watched this body time and time again proceed continuously to vote for such things as the space station whereas if it were a secret ballot it would not get 25 votes. The facts and the evidence are absolutely overwhelming against going forward with the space station, and yet because of the issue of jobs back home, it is very seldom that anyone casts a vote against it. 
Also, there is no political price to pay, even if you do not have jobs back home, hinging on going forward with the space station. There is no political price to be exacted against you for voting for something that people know very little about and have never honed in on. 
My wife, Betty Bumpers, a woman I admire very much for her courage, started a peace organization in 1981, and I said, `What you have done is just assured your husband's defeat in the next election.' She said, `Yes, and you men are going to get my children killed.' And so I had to dance around that issue until I ran the next time fully expecting to be confronted by my opponent about my wife's activities in the peace movement. 
Now, isn't it a strange dichotomy in America, that one has to be defensive about being for all the things that would promote peace. That is how strange this place is at times. 
Of course, Betty has been active in childhood immunizations all of her life, and all of my political life--she had started a program in 1972 to immunize all the children in my State, which had one of the lowest immunization levels of any State in the country. We immunized 300,000 children one Saturday. She was known then and is still known as the one of the foremost leaders in immunization programs in this country. I remember one day in 1973 some smart reporter said, `Senator, do you think your wife's activities'--he was referring to peace, of course--`Do you think your wife's activities are going to be a big detriment to you in your campaign?' I said, `Well, it will be among all those people who favor war and not immunizing children.' And I never got asked another question about it. 
I do not mean to sound arrogant about being willing to stand up occasionally for something I strongly believe in, but occasionally I chastise some of my colleagues who could save the taxpayers billions of dollars and hasten the day we balance the budget, but who refuse to do it because there is no political accounting for voting for the space station, particularly now when the rover is roving around on Mars. As a matter of fact, I know this is pure coincidence, but if you want to go over to the Dirksen Building, it just so happens that, at the same time we are considering the space station and the entire space budget in the Chamber, NASA has a thrilling show in the Dirksen Building for all the Senators to see of the rover roving around on Mars sniffing rocks. 
Let me say--and I have said this for 6 straight years--I favor the space program. I have never once lamented the fact that we have a shuttle program and that we have the ability to place all kinds of scientific and communications satellites in orbit. And in sending the rover to Mars, NASA is doing exactly what it should do, because that proves another point. We do not need a manned mission to do science on Mars. 
Mr. President, almost all the scientists in the country, virtually every Nobel physicist, virtually every scientific group in America, opposes the space station. Unfortunately, they don't have enough political clout to fill a thimble. I admire them, I respect them, but the truth of the matter is, they have very little impact on this body or the House of Representatives on what they favor or don't favor. 
One day on this floor, I said even Carl Sagan was opposed to the space station. Carl Sagan, whom I had known for several years--we weren't close friends, but I had been thrown in contact with him a few times--called to say that I had misstated what he believed. What he said was, `I believe the space station is a legitimate thing, a highly desirable thing, as a way station to get to Mars. But,' he said, to follow that up, something that I have always strongly believed, `it is not--it is not a wise expenditure of money if you are talking about scientific experiments to be conducted on the space station.' That is one of the reasons the American Physical Society and so many other groups oppose the space station. 
People around here are sometimes influenced by how somebody feels about it. I will tell you who strongly opposes going forward with the space station: The Concord Coalition, which was headed up by our now deceased, highly respected colleague, Paul Tsongas and by Warren Rudman, also our former colleague from New Hampshire. The Concord Coalition, Citizens Against Government Waste, the Cato Institute, the Progressive Policy Institute, the National Taxpayers' Union, and Citizens for a Sound Economy. 
Then, in the scientific community, listen to this: the American Physiological Society, the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, the American Society for Investigative Pathology, the American Institute of Nutrition, American Association of Immunologists, American Society of Cell Biology, the Biophysical Society, the American Association of Anatomists. 
Who comprises the American Physical Society? It is 41,000 physicists. Dr. Robert Park, a professor of physics at the University of Maryland at College Park, has testified time and again here about the folly of justifying the space station by alluding to the kind of scientific experiments they are going to do on it. 
Mr. President, my amendment says we will terminate the space station at a cost of $600 million and we will save $1.5 billion to put on the deficit. Sometimes my staff presents me with some alternatives. `Why don't we say we are going to put this $1.5 billion in savings into some other popular program?' I said, `I have been there and done that.' I remember when I first got into trying to torpedo the space station, I would have transferred the money over to Veterans Affairs. That is usually an item that causes Senators to jump under their desks. If you are going to give it to the veterans, most people around here will look very cautiously before they vote no. But I didn't get any more votes than I have been getting since. 
We have become so inured to cost overruns, we just simply cannot stop a big project once it is started. Only two things that come to mind that we finally did stop. One was the Clinch River breeder reactor, which incidentally was also my amendment. Howard Baker was majority leader. Maybe you think that wasn't an uphill battle. But the American scientific community began to rise up in arms, and the environmentalists threw a fit. So, finally we decided that we did not want to follow the breeder reactor method of generating electricity in this country and we finally killed it after I spent 4 years standing at this desk, talking about the folly of that project. We had already started digging ground down in Clinch River to build it. 
The other thing we terminated was the super collider. That's another one of my amendments. I guess the reason they happen to come to mind is that I happen to be the architect of killing both 
of them. The super collider, this massive hole in the ground in Texas, nobody really talked much about the science of the super collider. All they talked about was all the jobs it was going to create in Texas, which indeed it would have. 
Let me just, while I am on the subject of jobs, point something out. The space station--if you want to make it a jobs program go home and tell the chamber of commerce that it costs $140,000 for every job it creates. Take the same proposition to General Motors or anybody else: You come into our community and we will give you $140,000 for every job you create. They will be standing on line from here to New York to try to take you up on that offer. 
You think about the fact it costs $10,000 to $12,000 a pound for every pound of material we send to the space station. And now there is an estimate, if you have four astronauts on board, they can only devote 4 hours a day each to research-related activities. So, if you have four American astronauts, that's 16 hours a day that they could put into science. Do you want to know how expensive that is? Well, NASA says it will cost $1,300,000,000 a year to operate the station. So, it will only cost the taxpayers $230,000 for each hour the astronauts put in actually working on scientific experiments on the space station. Do you want to hear one better than that? The space station is to have a 10-year life and it will cost all-told about $100 billion. Figure that one out: $25 million a day is going to be the cost of keeping the space station up there. 
Do you have any idea, when we sit in the Agriculture Committee talking about research, how we have to grovel and fight and scratch and claw for every dime we get for research? Do you have any idea what $25 million will do? Do you know the National Institutes of Health can only fund one out of every four good scientific projects that are brought to them? And we are talking about honest to God research. Research on cancer, on AIDS, on arthritis--every conceivable kind of disease that afflicts mankind is handled through the National Institutes of Health, to which we give about $13 to $14 billion a year. And they can only fund one out of every four experiments. That is real science. You can book it. Do you know what real medical research could be done if we simply gave them the cost of one space shuttle flight? They could fund one out of every three proposals. 
Last week I conducted a hearing on immunizations. There is going to be a big to-do over at the White House tomorrow on the remarkable success we have had on immunizations. In a hearing last week it was revealed by some pharmaceutical companies, and the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, that we now face the possibility of eliminating measles worldwide, as we are about to eradicate polio worldwide. We now have new vaccines, even for children's earaches; even for dysentery. Last year we had 50,000 hospitalizations last year of children with dysentery, and 20 children died--but worldwide those figures are nothing. Worldwide, dysentery kills so many children--but not as many as measles. Does that shock you? Measles is still the biggest killer of children in the world; 1 million children a year die of measles. 
At the hearing they told us about all these new vaccines. For example, for infants--put a little something in each nostril of the nose and they will never get flu. You can also use that in combination with another vaccine which, as I say, will keep them from getting dysentery. 
I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll stand on my head on the top of this Capitol if you ever get anything even remotely close to those kinds of advances after you spend $100 billion. For 6 years I have listened to Senators come over here, they are my friends and colleagues and I don't denigrate their feelings about it, but when you start asking, `What are the scientific experiments we are going to conduct?' `Well, we don't know. We have to get up there and find out what we are looking for.' 
It was Dr. Nicolaas Bloembergen, of Harvard, who made the best statement I ever heard about research on the space station. 
Incidentally, he is adamantly opposed to it. I'll come back to that. I'm going to take about 20 minutes just reading quotes from the top physicists, medical doctors, you name it, about the space station, before I sit down. Do you know what he said about microgravity research, which is the big thing everybody talks about; that is research you do in weightlessness? He said, `microgravity is of microimportance.' That says it all. Why else would we be sending a station up there to do scientific experiments except it is a weightless situation? 
Another great physicist whom I will quote in a moment said, `It is the worst place to do microgravity research with men on board or women on board.' That is because, if you are looking for an experiment that requires weightlessness and you have people tromping around in the station and vibrating it, you lose the benefit. You would expect a 6-year-old to understand that. 
Mr. President, let me just bring you up to date. In 1996, the General Accounting Office to do a report on the space station. It was not the most devastating report I ever read in my life, and of course I was looking for something that I might hang my hat on that just might jar this place into action. But there were really no bombs in the 1996 GAO report, except they predicted that unless certain things happened certain other very undesirable things were going to happen, namely unless the Russians came through with their part of this project the cost was going to skyrocket. 
One Senator came to me in 1994 and said: `Dale, I think this cooperation with Russia is a tremendous idea. We can keep their space scientists busy and they won't be off in Iraq and Iran, building missiles for some of the rogue nations.' And he said, `You know, we have to help the Russians all we can. They have big problems.' 
I said: `That's right. But if we are going to send them $200 million for openers, just to say they will be a part of the international space station, I say send it to them in economic aid or food. That is what they need. They do not need to be participating in one of the biggest boondoggles ever conceived. What they need is something to help their people with their infrastructure, build industry, feed their people.' 
So what has happened, as predictable as night following day, is Russia has reneged. We gave them close to $200 million for openers to build the first section of the work they were supposed to do. We gave them that money. 
They were supposed to build the service module. There are nine modules on this space station. They were supposed to build the third one, but a very important one, called the service module, and they have not been able to come up with all the money, nor are they likely to. I will return in a moment to some of the consequences of that. 
But back to the GAO report. Congressman Dingell and I asked the GAO to update their 1996 report. Here is the update, which we received last night and which anybody else who wants it can get this morning. Here is what the GAO update says. If there is anything people around here detest, it is somebody going around telling them, `I told you so,' so I won't say it. 
Listen to this:  
The prime contractor's-- 
That is Boeing's---- cost and schedule performance on the space station, which showed signs of deterioration last year, has continued to decline virtually unabated. Since April 1996, the cost overrun has more than tripled. 
Let me repeat that: 
Since April 1996-- 
A little over a year ago-- the cost overrun has more than tripled and the schedule slippage has increased by almost 50 percent. 
Does it not take nerve to come in here asking us to go forward with a $100 billion project in the light of that? 
Financial reserves are dwindling with up to 6 years remaining until on-orbit assembly of the space station is completed. 
That is what we are looking at now. We still have 6 years to go before we even get that sucker assembled in space:  
. . . with up to 6 years remaining until on-orbit assembly of the space station is completed. NASA has already identified actual and potential resource demands that exceed the station's remaining financial reserves. 
As the French say, here comes the piece de resistance: 
NASA transferred $462 million from its science budget to the space station development budget in fiscal years 1996 through 1998. 
Why did NASA transfer $462 million from its science account to the manufacturing of the space station? To cover the cost overruns. And the $462 million comes out of the science budget. Either you are going to reduce the scientific experiments on this thing by $462 million, or NASA is going to come back to Congress and say we need $462 million more. Which do you think that is going to be? We all know what it is going to be, and this is just the beginning: 
It is also planning to transfer another $70 million in fiscal 1999 from the science fund to the station development budget. 
Mr. President, NASA says that to assemble and build the space station, the cost will be $17.4 billion, and within that are these scientific funds. They are taking money from Peter to pay Paul, but they are taking money out of the account that they say is absolutely essential to justify the space station, namely, the science that we are going to get. You can't have it both ways, or you can, too, in the U.S. Senate. 
Congress approved the transfer of $200 million this year. We approved a $200 million transfer from the space shuttle. I just told you that they have transferred $462 million from their science account over to the space station account. Now we are giving them authority to transfer money from the shuttle account, the manned space program that most people around here applaud, and are putting it into the space station. Why? To cover the cost overruns on the 
space station. It is the most traditional, time-honored shell game that any of us know anything about, and that is to cover the cost incurred because the Russians have been so late in coming up with their money. 
There is another $100 million pending in Congress for the year 1998. That is in the House bill; that is not in the Senate bill. But, in addition to allowing them to take $200 million out of the shuttle fund and put it into the space station, now the House has said, `We will give you another $100 million to transfer to the space station.' This is actually outside the $17.4 billion. The $462 million in science funds is inside the $17.4 billion and can only be classified as a whopping cost overrun. 
This is one of the most interesting things that the GAO report said: 
When NASA redesigned the space station in 1993. . . . 
You remember, President Clinton looked at a whole list of them and finally came up with what was finally called International Space Station Alpha: 
When NASA redesigned the station in 1993, it estimated that Russia, as a partner, would reduce program costs by $1.6 billion because the station's assembly would be completed sooner. 
It would be finished in June 2002 instead of September 2003, the proposition being that if the Russians came through, we would build it faster and, therefore, save $1.6 billion. 
Mr. President, those are not my figures, those are NASA's figures, those are NASA's statements. And this is what GAO said about it: 
NASA has recently acknowledged that completion of the station's assembly would indeed slip to 2003. . . . 
Fifteen months later than we have been told since time immemorial this thing would be finished. 
While NASA has not acknowledged the 2003 date, they have yet to tell us what the new milestone will be. And the GAO says: 
Consequently, most, if not all, of the reduced costs claimed by accelerating the schedule by 15 months would be lost by slipping the schedule by a similar amount. 
In short, now we are back to the old time schedule, and the $1.6 billion that NASA said they would save by bringing Russia into the program and, therefore, building it 15 months sooner than we would otherwise have built won't be saved. 
NASA has not told us yet precisely when they expect to have this thing finished, nor precisely what a 15-month slippage at this point is going to cost, though I can tell you, based on the conversations I had with people who know more about this program than anybody else, it is $2 billion. 
Mr. President, I tried to torpedo the space station since the memory of man runneth not. I have tried in almost more times than there have been design changes, new partners, and new promises by NASA, and until this very moment, NASA is trying to con the Senate by showing this magnificent film about Mars over in the Dirksen Building and still smoothly promising that everything is running on target, on schedule, and the only reason we know that isn't true is because GAO has done two studies that contradict NASA 180 degrees. 
We don't need a space station. The Mir is the seventh Russian space station. The Mir has been in orbit, how long? Eleven years. The Mir has been up there 11 years, and now it is in big trouble. I am not saying that is predictable. I will say this, and this is not to bash Russia--I believe in doing everything we can to help their economy and keep them viable--but their space program is not as sophisticated as ours. While I understand all the arguments for bringing Russia into this, I am not sure scientifically and from a safety standpoint it is good to do it. 
But the point I wanted to make is, again, I have stood on this floor for 6 long years and said show me, tell me what are the scientific achievements Russia has achieved in 20 years of having a space station in orbit. And I have been met by a deafening roar of silence. There are none. The only justification for a space station is as a way station to Mars. 
Mr. President, look at this chart, and I will say that in 1984, Ronald Reagan, I think it was in a State of the Union Address, said we were going to build a space station--that was in 1984; that has now been 13-plus years--we were going to build a space station for $8 billion and deploy it and operate it. That was the initial promise of the President. At that time, here were the justifications. Look at them. 
It was going to be a staging base, presumably to go to Mars. 
It was going to be a manufacturing facility. We were going to manufacture a new kind of sophisticated crystal in a microgravity atmosphere. 
It was going to be a space-based observatory. 
It was going to be a transportation node. 
It was going to be a servicing facility, presumably for people on their way to Mars. 
It was going to be an assembly facility, again, to assemble the parts of a space station to go to Mars. 
It was going to be a storage facility. 
And, finally, it was going to be a research laboratory. 
You can see from my chart how many of those exist today. Seven of them have been torpedoed, and only one remains standing. 
Go back to the original $8 billion that President Reagan said it was going to cost. Here is an update on that. I tell you, I cannot keep the grin off my face as I go through these things. You just cannot believe it, you cannot believe it, and yet Senators will come in here and vote for this thing. 
The President said $8 billion. Here is what we spent on the Reagan plan--$11.2 billion. That is gone. What we got out of that is so infinitesimal you might as well have thrown the money off the Washington Monument. It would have helped a few poor people. 
So when Bill Clinton became President, he said this thing is out of control, we have to have another look at it. So we have a big design--a design-off I guess you would call it. And they look at dozens of plans over at the White House about what kind of a space station it ought to be. 
Obviously, the first one was much too grandiose, going to be much too costly. So they come up with the International Space Station Alpha. And we are going to participate with Europe and Canada and Japan, and now of course Russia. 
And here is what the construction cost was going to be between 1994 and 2002--$17.4 billion. I have alluded to that figure several times already. 
Now, anybody who believes that the construction and development of the international space station is going to be $17.4 billion, you go ahead and vote for it. You have my permission. You certainly will not lose my friendship, if you actually believe that. But if you actually believe that, you haven't got enough you-know-what to be a Member of Congress. But if you believe that, go ahead and vote for it. 
The GAO had just gotten through issuing a report this morning saying that is nonsense. And here is the operating costs for 10 years, $13 billion. 
Mr. President, do you know the cost of this program and the cost of all the 83 shuttles it is going to take to get it up there and supply it? The cost is going to be staggering. You know, the cost of gold is $325 an ounce today. That is peanuts compared to what a pound of water will cost to supply these astronauts, just peanuts. It is like 33 times more to send a pound of water. Maybe not that much. I do not want to exaggerate too far. So here is your operating cost, $13 billion. 
Here are the shuttle flights needed to launch, service and use the station in space--$50.5 billion. Mr. President, let me tell you something about that. At present, that is 83 launches that are going to be necessary to deploy it and supply it for 10 years after it is deployed--$50.5 billion. That is calculated I think on the basis of the space shuttle, the flights running around $475 million each. 
I can remember when I used to get teary-eyed seeing that shuttle take off when they first developed it. Such a magnificent thing to see. One day somebody told me each launch cost almost $500 million, and my eyes dried up almost immediately. 
Here are just the related costs of the space station--$1.9 billion on these shuttle flights. Let me tell you, if you believe that 83 shuttles will leave within a 5 to 7 minute launch window without a hitch over the next 15, 16 years, you vote for it, if you believe that every shuttle is going to go up without a hitch, rendezvous with the space station without a hitch, take the needed supplies to the astronauts, all of that, and every launch launched within a 5 to 7 minute timeframe, which is absolutely necessary. And if you do not make it within that 5 to 7 minute envelope, you delay the launch and the costs soar. 
I have a chart here, Mr. President, about the cost of gold. I guess we can all relate to gold. Here it is. The present cost of the space station is estimated by GAO--incidentally, this is not Dale Bumpers; this is GAO--$94 billion. That is 25 times its weight in gold. And, as I said earlier, that is $25 million per 
day of operation. 
It is a jobs program. I said 140,000 jobs. Each job costs $147,000. Three States--California, Texas, and Alabama--they get about 78 percent of all the money. The other 22 to 24 percent goes to virtually every other State. There are only a handful of States that do not have a little piece of the action. NASA is not stupid. They took a leaf out of the Pentagon's book. And they put those contracts into almost every State. I think there is a little $50,000 contract in Arkansas on the space station. That is just not quite enough to influence me. It provides no commercial value. And it costs $12,880 to transport one pound of material to the station. 
Mr. President, let me now go to what some of the scientists say about this project. 
Before I do that, here is another little overrun. You cannot compute the cost on this--this is manhours--but I want you to think about this. In 1993, NASA said that the assembling of the space station would require about 311 hours of EVA--extravehicular activity. It is space walking. In 1993, they said it would take 311 hours of space walks to assemble it. Then they decided they miscalculated, and they moved it up to 434 hours. And then they decided they miscalculated it again, and in 1996 they said, `We miscalculated, and it's going to take 1,104 hours of space walking to assemble the station.' And now, just very recently, believe it or not, 1 year from the time the first launch is supposed to occur, they say it is going to take 1,519 hours. NASA has only miscalculated by 500 percent the number of hours it will take to assemble the space station. And their calculations on everything else are running pretty close. 
Mr. President, let me tell you what people who know a lot more about the science than I do are saying. 
Incidentally, I watched Senator Glenn yesterday. He is not just one of my very dearest friends, he came to the Senate with me in 1975. He is one of the finest men--I think just the finest, most decent man I have ever known. We do not disagree very often, but we disagree strongly on this. We battle back and forth in the cloakroom about it. 
He has circulated a brochure that ties the space station to research on aging. God knows, I ought to be interested in that. Well, ironically one space shuttle flight to the space station will cost almost as much as the entire $454 million budget of the National Institute on Aging. One space shuttle flight would finance the National Institute on Aging for 1 year. 
Now, you ask yourself, do you think you are really going to get anything about aging out of the space shuttle? What you are going to get is an expensive $450 million, and you are going to get nothing. If you gave it to the National Institute on Aging, you at least have an outside chance of something happening. 
Here are the editors of Discovery Magazine from May 1997, 2 months ago. Listen to this:  
There is no use belaboring the point. Only the naive or the vested still maintain that there is any good pragmatic reason to spend the tens of billions of dollars it will take to complete what started out in the early 1980s as Freedom and now endures as the International Space Station. . . . Is it possible to imagine a technological undertaking so enormous that could garner less respect from the scientific community? 
That says it all, but I am not going to quit. 
Here is what Marsha Smith, who was interviewed in Aerospace America in June 1995, said I visited with her in my office yesterday. She is the brightest person in this country on this subject. She does not try to tint it one way or another. She just calls it like it is. She is not unalterably opposed to the space station, for that matter. But I say this simply to demonstrate publicly my intense and high regard for her. 
I don't know of any breakthroughs that have come out of [Russian] space station programs in terms of new or cheaper-to-produce materials or scientific discoveries . . . . Mostly they have learned how to operate a space station for long periods of time. 
Now, Mr. President, I again issue the call. What have the Russians got for 20 years of having the space station in orbit that is worthy of the name `scientific'? 
Listen to what Tim Beardsley of Scientific American said in June 1996, a little over 1 year ago. 
The value of biological and health research in orbit has been challenged by Elliott C. Levinthal, a former program director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [that is called DARPA over at the Defense Department] . . . Levinthal, who has been a professor of genetics and mechanical engineering at Stanford University, asserts that no neutral committee handing out funds for basic research in biology would support microgravity studies. 
And that is all the scientific justification you can find for the space station--microgravity research. Anything else obviously you can do here on Earth. As a matter of fact, you can do this in the shuttle. You can even do it in unmanned flights. 
James Ferris of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in Scientific American: 
Nothing has come out of microgravity research to convince me that a material can be fabricated in orbit that is going to be better than what you can make on Earth. 
Why do we want to spend $100 billion to manufacture something we can do just as well on Earth, and for a fraction of the cost? 
Here is what the German Physical Society said. And incidentally, Germany is involved in paying for some of the costs. 
Except for investigations carried out on humans themselves, all experiments in this area of research can be carried out unmanned, without loss of precision. This also applies to microgravity. Therefore it is improper [it is improper] to use microgravity as an effective argument in favor of manned spaceflight. 
That statement was endorsed by the European Physical Society, all the physicists in Europe, the Physical Society of Japan--our physicists' counterpart in Japan--the Canadian Association of Physicists and the American Physical Society. 
So, Mr. President, there you have it. International space station Freedom, partly being paid for by the Japanese, by the European Space Agency, by Canada--forget Russia for the time being. And how do their physicists feel about it? There is the European Physical Society, the Japanese Physical Society, the Canadian Physical Society and the American Physical Society, and that takes just about every physicist in America, who says this is improbable nonsense. It reminds me of going to a doctor and saying, `Doctor, I have this hurting in my chest,' and he x-rays me and says, `It looks to me like you have cancer.' And I say, `Well, it may be, but I will go find a Senator to validate this. I'm not taking your word for it; I want to take the word of the U.S. Senate and see if I have cancer of the lung.' That is not far off. The scientists all oppose the space station. Yet, as I said in my opening remarks, it is so impossible to convince the Senate. 
Incidentally, when it comes to the American Physical Society, its spokesman in the past, as I said a moment ago, has been Dr. Park. Dr. Park said, in July 1993:  
It is the view of the American Physical Society that scientific justification is lacking for a permanently manned space station in Earth orbit. We are concerned that the potential contribution of a manned space station to the physical scientist has been greatly overstated and that many of the scientific objectives currently planned for the space station can be accomplished more effectively and at a much lower cost on Earth. 
Unmanned robotic platforms or on the shuttle. All he represents is 41,000 physicists in this country. He goes on to say, quoting Professor Nicolaas Bloembergen of Harvard--and I said earlier I thought he was a Nobel laureate, and he is, in physics--Dr. Bloembergen of Harvard, a Nobel laureate and physicist, summed it up bluntly in testimony before a Senate committee 2 years ago: `Microgravity is of microimportance.' 
How is it we know so much more here? After all, we are throwing $2.1 billion of the taxpayers' money at this project every year, and you saw the figures and where we are headed-- $94 billion today, Lord knows how many billions ultimately. 
I think there is an assumption, says one physicist, that any program that spends $15 billion per year is bound to produce something that society can use, but few of NASA's claims stand up. Indeed, an interim NASA study of technology transfer which became public in January acknowledged that NASA spinoff claims were exaggerated. That is an in-house memo that NASA's claims were exaggerated, including such famous examples as Velcro, Tang, and Teflon. Contrary to popular belief, the study found NASA created none of these. They merely publicized them. 
Here is what Carl Sagan said: `A space station is far from an optimum platform for doing science.' And the Space Sciences Board said it `sees no scientific need for this space station during the next 20 years,' and went ahead to say, `Continued development of Space Station Freedom . . . cannot be supported on scientific grounds.' 
Mr. President, I have two or three other scientists I will quote and then I will turn it back to the managers of the bill. Incidentally, I listened yesterday and I listened again today to all these gigantic, frankly, highly specious, spurious claims about how we will find a cure for this and a cure for that. If the doctors in the scientific community say that is hogwash, who are we to question them? Somebody to keep a few jobs in our State. 
Here is what Dr. Rosenthal said on cancer research: 
Statements have been made and published to the effect that vital cancer research would be done in space, and that is cited as a reason for supporting space station funding. We cannot find valid scientific justification for these claims and believe it is unrealistic to base a decision on funding the space station on that information . . . Based on the information we have seen thus far, we do not agree that a strong case has been made for choosing to do cancer research in space over critically needed cancer research here on earth. 
That was David Rosenthal, Harvard Medical School, testifying on behalf of the American Cancer Society. 
Dr. Shaun Ruddy, on behalf of the Arthritis Foundation: 
Space station proponents have indicated that the Space Station . . . will provide a `first class' laboratory . . . We used to have `first class' laboratories in universities and medical schools across the country . . . Reports by the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation have indicated that over 51 percent of the biological laboratory research is deemed inadequate for the conduct of research . . . Furthermore, the National Science Foundation report estimated that the capital construction backlog is approximately $12 billion . . . Should our priorities now be a `first class' laboratory in space, or correction of a longstanding deficiency in laboratories throughout this Nation?

<TEXT>
Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this morning, in my comments I quoted Prof. Elliott Levinthal, Professor Emeritus of the 
Stanford School of Engineering. This afternoon he faxed me some material which I would like to share with you. `NASA's present strategic plan is based on the future human operation of Mars and its eventual colonization, with projected costs of at least many tens of billions, or perhaps more realistically, hundreds of billions.' I want to thank Professor Levinthal for sending that to me because I could not agree with him more. 
As I said this morning, Carl Sagan corrected me the year before last when I said he was opposed to the space station. I stood corrected. What he said was that the space station had some merit as a weigh station to go to Mars, but to justify the space station on the grounds of medical experimentation was shaky indeed. Now, I have the utmost respect for Carl Sagan. He was a much revered person around here. But I disagree with him about going to Mars. 
It is not necessary to have a manned mission to Mars in order to explore Mars. We have already discovered that. I complimented NASA this morning on sending the Mars Pathfinder rover to Mars, which is doing a tremendous amount of research that may or may not be beneficial to us. Some of we laymen who are not astronomers have a very difficult time understanding some of this. But in any event, I don't believe we ought to spend the hundreds of billions that it will take to get to Mars with a manned exploration, and I don't think the space station ought to be launched with any--what shall I say--problematical assertions that it will cure cancer, or arthritis, or heart disease, or AIDS, or anything else. Almost every thoughtful person in this country who is in the medical or physics field thinks it is an absurdity to justify this on the basis of medical research. 
Professor Levinthal goes on to say: `Leaving aside colonization'--that is, of Mars--`do not be deluded by the thought that the space station is a useful step for the human scientific exploration of Mars. It is a poor investment. Exploration of Mars is a worthwhile and exciting goal, but it can be achieved most cost effectively with automated space craft.' 
He goes on to say: `I have been involved in consideration of the purpose of human missions since the start of the shuttle program. Committee after committee sought to find scientific, technical, military, educational, and industrial goals that could be cost-justified. None could be found . . .' 
I repeat, in all of the feverish search for a justification for the space station, whether scientific, technical, military, educational, or industrial, none of them could be justified by the tremendous cost, which I said this morning will almost certainly exceed $100 billion. 
Dr. Levinthal goes on to say: `The pressures the space station are putting on Russian investment is decimating Russian support of science.' 
Now, Mr. President, let me review this chart one more time about the cost of the space station. Do not be deceived. Do not be deluded by the way NASA chops its figures up. They chop it up into development costs; they chop it up into launch costs; they chop it up into operations costs. Don't worry about that. Just look at this figure right here--

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 additional minutes. 
This figure counts. It is $94 billion and soaring. We have finally reached the point where the General Accounting Office, this morning, says that cost overruns have begun and show no sign of slackening. 
What does it take in this body to get somebody's attention? This is not our money. I hear all these lamentations on the floor of the Senate about the poor taxpayer out there and trying to send his children to school and trying to make car payments and make his house payment and how we are going to provide this magnificent $135 billion tax cut for the poor, suffering taxpayer, while, at the same time, adding $94 billion to his tax bill to build a space station from which we will get no benefit. 
If that were just Dale Bumpers talking, you need pay no attention. But it is every physical society of every nation who has a dime in it--the Japanese Physical Society, the Canadian Physical Society, the European Physical Society, and the American Physical Society. That is virtually 99 percent of all the physicists in the world who oppose this thing and say we ought to be spending the money on legitimate medical research. You are not going to get a cure for warts out of the space station. 
Every year the National Institutes of Health send billions out in research grants.

Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
At this stage of the debate on these things it is always largely repetitious but some things are worth repeating. It does not change any votes sometimes, but it is therapeutic to me to say things more than once and then people who ignore it in my opinion do so at their own risk. But as I said this morning, it is a tragedy that the space station is what we call a freebie. You can go ahead and vote for this $100 billion boondoggle which will never provide any cures for any disease, will probably never even be used as a way station to Mars, that is opposed by every physicist in the world and not because it is totally worthless but because the money could be so much more effectively spent on other things. 
I pointed out this morning, and it is worth pointing out again, the cost of one launch of the space shuttle could pay to allow the National Institutes of Health to approve one out of every three applications for medical research instead of one out of four, just one launch, and there are 83 such launches to support the space station program. And every one of them is calculated to occur within a 5-minute window without a hitch. 
It is going to cost $94 billion in today's dollars and you assume that every one of those 83 to 90 launches is going to be split perfect. You think about it. Think about the enormity of such a promise. 
Dan Goldin testified before the Subcommittee of Commerce on Science and Technology: 
It is certain that the program does not have adequate reserves built into the total development estimate to address Russian contingencies, which I will address later. There is also the issue of the impact the Russian delay has had in pushing completion of the assembly sequence beyond 2002. 
You bet, October 2003 to be precise, a $2 billion cost overrun because Russia cannot come up with the money to build a service module. 
And he goes on to say, 
Clearly, the drawn out timeframe for development/assembly will increase program costs. The exact extent of this cost is being worked. 
Here is how they have worked it. Here is the way NASA has worked it. Here are the promises that have been made. 
Here is what NASA said on February 17, 1994:  
Russian participation reduces cost by $2 billion and allows science utilization significantly earlier than with the alpha station. 
Broken promise. 
Another promise. NASA said the first element launch would be launched in November 1997 instead of September, 1998. 
The reality. The first element launch is now scheduled for June, 1998. Broken promise No. 2. 
The space station laboratory will be available in February 1998. Reality: May, 1999. Broken promise No. 3. 
Promise. The space station will be completed in June, 2002. Reality: Now October, 2003. Broken promise No. 4. 
Russia's participation will save the United States taxpayers $2 billion. Now we are going to have to come up with $2 billion. Broken promise No. 5. 
Promise: Extravehicular activity, space walking, will be, in 1993, 350 hours they said; in 1994 it had gone up to 434 hours; in 1996 it went up to 1,104 hours; in 1997, 1,519 hours--a 500 percent increase. Broken promise No. 6. 
Those are the promises we have gotten from NASA, and the cost is just now beginning to soar. They have just taken $400 million out of the science program. There won't be any money left to do a scientific experiment. They took $400 million out of science to make up some of the shortfalls. 
They took $200 million out of the shuttle program and put it into the space program. The cost overruns are soaring, and GAO said this morning, in a report released this morning: No letup in sight. 
I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I will use my 3 minutes, and we will get this show on the road. 
Let me just say, in the 6 years I have stood at this position saying we ought to cancel the space station, for all the reasons I enumerated all day long, one of the opponents' arguments consistently has been that we are going to cure breast cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, warts, ingrown toenails, psoriasis, you name it. It reminds me of that old Huey Long story about the medicine doctor coming through Louisiana. He was selling Low Poplarhirum and High Poplarlorum. 
`What's the difference?' someone asked him. 
He said,'Well, the High Poplarlorum will cure anything from the waist up, and Low Poplarhirum will cure anything from the waist down.' 
They said, `Where do you get it?' 
He said, `We get it from the Poplar tree.' 
`How do you get a medicine out of one tree that cures everything from the waist up and the waist down?' 
He says, `Well, we take sap from the bottom half of the tree, that is Low Poplarhirum, and we take sap from the top of the tree, and that is High Poplarlorum, and that's the way it works.' 
Low Poplarhirum and High Poplarlorum reminds me of the debate going on about the space station today. It is going to cure everything under the shining Sun and it isn't going to cure anything. I will eat my hat--and I wish I was going to be in the Senate to do it--if it ever cures anything. That claim is not anything in the world but a hoax designed to perpetuate a $100 billion expenditure that if it were put into real research to cure breast cancer, to cure cervical cancer, to cure prostate cancer, it might get you something. It is going to get you nothing by putting $100 million into the space station. 
Read the GAO report I received this morning. I am not talking about the grandiose promise Ronald Reagan made in 1984 about how we are going to do it all for $8 billion. We have already thrown $11 billion away on the first space station before we abandoned it, and now we are headed for another $80 billion, $85 billion, and we are not going to cure anything. This project has no purpose in the world but to keep people working, to keep the aerospace and defense contractors all over the country working, and to explore what? 
The Russians have been up there 20 years. I, again, invite anybody in this body to tell me what the Russians have cured, what they have developed in 20 years of having space stations. They have had seven space stations; there is nothing new about that. A space station is a mechanical thing; it is not scientific. The Russians have been up there 20 years. I challenge anybody to tell me one single thing from a medical standpoint that they have gotten out of it. I can tell you the answer is nothing. 
We are going to continue pouring money down this just like we did the Clinch River breeder reactor, just like we did the super collider, until we finally woke up. The GAO issued a wake-up call this morning. For God's sakes, I say to Senators, why don't you listen to it?

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I will make this brief. I know everyone wants to get out of here, and I want to accommodate the membership. 
Last week, the Armed Services Committee accepted an amendment that capped the costs on the F-22 fighter plane. They, I think, correctly decided that the costs of the F-22 could very well go way beyond anything intended by the Congress. So, Mr. President, they accepted a cap on the F-22 fighter plane. 
All I am trying to do on this is do the same thing on the space station. I am using NASA's figures. These are not my figures. These are the figures that NASA says they can build the space station for and operate it. The amendment, as I say, is right where they say it is, but here is the reason I am doing this. The General Accounting Office says that since last year, the risk to the space station's costs in schedule have, in fact, increased. GAO goes on to say the station's financial reserves have also deteriorated significantly. 
Now, I think the people in this body who strongly favor the space station in good conscience and as a duty to their constituents and their own conscience ought to support saying at some point there ought to be some kind of a limit on how much we are willing to spend. I am using the figures that NASA has themselves put out: $17.4 billion to build it, $1.3 billion a year to operate it. The cap does not extend to a launch cost, only to the building and deployment and to the operating of it. 
That seems like a simple, straightforward amendment to me, Mr. President.

Mr. BUMPERS. I hardly know what else to say about this. The figures I am using are the figures that NASA says they can build and operate it for. Now, it is obvious from the GAO report that came out this morning that these costs are beginning to get out of control. There is a shifting from one account to another. There is even shifting from nonspace station programs to space station programs. 
All I am trying to do is to say, let's get it under control. There is not anything, frankly, written in stone about a cost cap amendment. Next year, if NASA comes in and says we are down $1 billion, we will certainly give it to them, if I am any judge of what is going to happen around here in the future with the space station. 
But here is what the GAO report said this morning, Mr. President: 
NASA's actions to reinforce its financial reserves and keep the program within its funding limitations has in some cases involved redefining a portion of the program subject to the limitations. Such actions make the value of the current limitations as a funding control mechanism questionable. Therefore, we proposed that the NASA administrator, with the concurrence of the Office of Management and Budget, direct the space station to discontinue the use of the current funding limitations. 
And they go ahead to say at the end of the review: 
Assuming that Congress decides to continue the space station program and wants to replace the current funding limitations, it should consider, after consultation with NASA, reestablishment in light of the current circumstances. 
Now, the truth of the matter is, this program is heading headlong out of control. There are very few people in this body that do not know that, that do not understand that, 
and I am offering this amendment simply because I am saying, if you are going to build a space station, for Pete's sake let's put some kind of a limitation on it. 
Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, who chairs the Commerce Committee, tells me that he is working with NASA and he wants to work with me on putting a cap on this. One of the problems I have and worry about is, are we simply going to put some language in--and I think Senator McCain shares my concern about the cost of this program. I certainly would welcome the opportunity to work with him, but I don't want a cap, and I know Senator McCain doesn't want a cap that has all kinds of escape mechanisms in it so the costs can continue to skyrocket and we can continue building this big boondoggle. My whole purpose is to say to my colleagues who believe in the space station--which I do not--that I know they share my concern about these costs that GAO says are sliding out of control. 
Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment. 
The amendment (No. 953) was withdrawn.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just thank the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Missouri. Let me add this caveat which might help them sleep better. A veterans' hospital in Little Rock told me they have five doctors they are going to lose. I am really offering this on their behalf. This is sort of a critical situation where these doctors are going to be forced to leave and go home. 
All this amendment says is that, in the future, the VA--not the doctor--could request a waiver of the visa requirement that they return home for 2 years before they can come back. That seems like a fairly laudable thing when you consider the medical shortages most VA hospitals experience. If you find when you get to the conference committee somebody objects because it may be a turf fight of some kind, I will understand that. I hope that doesn't happen. But I appreciate the accommodation you have given.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, one of the truly great ideas that somebody came up with back in 1872 was to establish the first national park. Ulysses Grant was President. Unhappily, that same year Ulysses Grant signed a bill called the mining law of 1872. But back to the point. President Grant established the first national park in this Nation. It has been a source of pride and usage and a great deal of euphoria for America's people ever since. We in the Senate and in the House profess our undying commitment to a National Park System second to none while we have routinely starved the park system to death. 
Now, US News and World Report, on top of report after report that has been issued over the past 10 to 15 years, in the current July 21 edition, has an article which I recommend to every Member of the Senate called `Parks in Peril'. `The national parks have been called the best America had. But their wild beauty and historical treasures are rapidly deteriorating'--repeat, rapidly deteriorating--`from lack of funds, pollution, encroaching development, overcrowding and congressional indifference.' 
Mr. President, these parks are being encroached on by development; they are being stifled by pollution. On any given day in the winter, the pollution at Yellowstone National Park from snowmobiles alone is equal to the smog in Washington, DC. And the infrastructure is falling down. Buildings are rotting, buildings are decaying, and some of the treasures such as Chaco Canyon in New Mexico, some of those ancient ruins, are falling down for lack of money to restore them. 
All this time, Mr. President, we allow the mining companies, the biggest mining companies in the world, to buy Federal lands for $2.50 an acre, take billions of dollars of gold off those lands and not pay the taxpayers of America one red cent. That is money that alone could reverse the deterioration of our National Park Service. We have grazing laws in this country which are just short of scandalous, in which we allow some of the biggest corporations in America to lease grazing lands from BLM for a song. And one of the worst tragedies of all is that we have a concessions policy where we allow the concession stands at national parks to be handed down from generation to generation. You cannot take one away from a concessionaire under existing law. 
Mr. President, the return now to the Park Service on concessions is about 6 percent. About the only park we have in our system with a concession, which was let 3 years ago on a competitive basis, is Yosemite, and last year Yosemite, the only park that has a concession policy that was competitively let, produced 37 percent. That one park produced 37 percent of all the return the Park Service got for all its concessions. 
We had a bill here that I sponsored that passed the Senate 99 to zip, went over to the House and died. If you were to pass another one today 99 to zip, it would probably go to the House and die, because this suits the policy of too many Members of Congress while our Park System deteriorates. 
I strongly recommend everybody read this. The polls consistently show that the people of this country are upset because we tolerate some of the kinds of corporate welfare I just described--rich people, the biggest corporations in the world, not paying their way. And oftentimes, because of the way we finance campaigns in this country, we can't stop it or do anything about it. Our priorities are terribly skewed when we allow some of these things to continue while the national parks, the greatest treasury we possess in this country, decline. We just passed a defense bill, $268 billion, and not an enemy in sight. There is not an enemy in sight; $268 billion, and we had one rollcall vote. I can remember when that bill would take 2 weeks to pass. 
So, Mr. President, I speak with a great deal of passion this morning because I chaired the National Parks Subcommittee for many years, and I did everything I could to reverse the policy that was so patently obvious to me back then, years ago, that we were neglecting our national parks and we were going to pay a price for it. One thing we have done is, while we added a lot of parks, we have never added any funding. We are either going to have to fish or cut bait. We either have to get rid of parks, which I don't think anybody in this body favors, or we are going to have to fund them. And finally, the last alternative is watch them fall apart before our eyes to the chagrin, dismay, disappointment, and outright animosity of the American people for our indifference and negligence to our National Park System. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Let me say, I could not agree with the Senator more, and I also say some of the damage that is occurring in the National Park System is not just to the infrastructure; that is, the buildings, which can be replaced 
and repaired. Some of the irreversible damage is being done to the natural beauty of the national parks, which cannot be undone. I could not agree more with the Senator that we have added a lot of land. I am not saying we did it wrongly. I am not saying we were in error when we did it. I am saying we can do both. We can have an expanded park system and we can fund it. If the American people understand anything, in my opinion, it is our skewed priorities here, what we spend money for. 
If you were to take a poll--not ask for an extemporaneous response, but say, `Which of the following do you consider the most important?' I daresay the National Park System and the maintenance of it for the enjoyment of all the American people would rank very near the top. We simply have not made a commitment. 
You recall under President George Bush we did a very extensive study on the National Park System, and they came back and said it would take--that has been 8 years ago, a little over, about 8 years ago--they said it would take $2 billion just to start doing the infrastructure. That had nothing to do with adding lands or anything else. They said, in order to bring our parks up to par right now--that was 8 years ago with 8 years of inflation added to it now--it would take $2 billion. 
As I say, everybody loves the parks. Everybody in the Senate, everybody in the House, would profess their undying love for the National Park System, but we simply are not putting the money where our mouth is. 
That is the only point I want to make this morning, and that is the point this article makes in U.S. News & World Report. I see the distinguished Senator who is now the chairman of the same committee I mentioned I chaired for many years. I will be happy to yield to him.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, we discussed this for just a moment the other day in the full Appropriations Committee, but here is my concern. I want to voice those concerns both for the Record and for a response by the chairman of the subcommittee dealing with weapons activities. 
Now, for the Record and people who read it and may not know, the Energy Department not only tries to develop solar energy and better ways to explore for oil and gas and that sort of thing, the Energy Department is also charged with the responsibility of developing and maintaining our nuclear weapons. They build them, they stockpile them, they guarantee to the people of this country their safety and reliability. They guarantee the safety of them for our benefit; they guarantee the reliability of them for the benefit of the Defense Department which is going to put these nuclear weapons on submarines, missiles, and so on. 
But I have been concerned about the amount of money we are spending on that. What I wanted to do was to engage the chairman in a discussion of why we are spending the kind of money we are on this project. 
For example, this year, 1997, the year we are in right now, we are spending somewhere around $120 million to $200 million more on the so-called DOE weapons activities account than we did in 1996. Senator Harkin and I offered an amendment last year to strike that or to lower it. I forget exactly how the amendment read, but we tried to cut this last year, as the chairman will recall. We got 37 votes. 
You know, I am tired of jousting with windmills around here. I have enough sense to know when you are going to prevail, when you have a fighting chance and when you do not. 
But in any event, this year the President requested--these figures blow your mind--the President requested $4.044 billion for this so-called DOE weapons activities account--$4.044 billion. And this bill contains $258 million more than the President requested. 
This is a very arcane account, very difficult for laymen to understand. I must say, I am a layman from the standpoint of the complexities of testing or trying to make sure that our weapons stockpile is safe and reliable. I am a layman in that regard. I am not a layman in regard to money. I understand that $258 million is a lot of money. When we appropriate $258 million more than the President requested--and the President asked for a fairly substantial increase--when we go above that by $258 million, then I think I am within my right and, as a matter of fact, my duty to raise the question of why we are spending this much money when you consider the fact that there is no Soviet Union. They do not exist anymore, and so far as I know, they do not represent a nuclear threat to this country at this point and, hopefully, never will again. By the same token, Mr. President, we do not represent a nuclear threat to the people of Russia today. 
If I had asked this question--I do not want to go too far afield from the specifics of what I want the chairman to address, but I daresay, in 1987, for example--the Soviet Union essentially folded in 1990, 1991; and for all the years after World War II until that point, the defense budget was driven, driven almost exclusively, by the threat of the Soviet Union. I daresay, if I had asked any Chairman of the Joint Chiefs during that period, from 1947 to 1948 until 1990, how much could we cut the defense budget if the Soviet Union suddenly went away, I would guess that the smallest number I would have gotten would have been $50 billion and the maximum number at least $100 billion. I am talking about from generals and admirals. 
So, all of a sudden, here we are 7 years after the demise of the Soviet Union, and the defense budget we approved in the authorization bill that we just passed yesterday is $268 billion. Now, I voted for it--but I felt it was way too much money--because there were some things in it that I thought were fairly important, and we are always trying to balance things. Anybody can pick one thing out of a bill they do not like and vote no. I dislike this so much I am tempted to vote against energy and water, but I am not going to vote against the bill because there are a lot of good things in it. 
I am not going to accord, indulge, myself the luxury of saying, simply because there are half a dozen things in there I object to I am not going to vote for it. There are all sorts of water projects and energy things that are very important to me. This is about a $21 billion bill. I am not objecting to the $4 billion in weapons development. I am only objecting to what I consider excessive increases. 
Now, having said all of that to the Senate, I am a strong believer in the test ban treaty. The Senator from Nevada may correct me on this, but I believe 1993 was the last year we had underground tests of nuclear weapons in Nevada. When we quit testing in Nevada, I considered that a hallelujah day in this country. I had been fighting for a long time, even before the Soviet Union disappeared, to stop nuclear testing, underground testing, in Nevada. I thought it was senseless. I thought there must be other ways that we could test and determine the 
reliability of weapons without actually setting off those explosions. 
Mr. President, here we are now. We are still talking about a comprehensive test ban treaty, which I strongly favor. We do not have it. There are a lot of people in this body who would not vote for it if the Russians unilaterally disarmed tomorrow. But I happen to think it would take us a long way further than we are right now down the path toward the kinds of, what shall I say, comfort and good feeling we have about the future of nuclear weapons. 
So, Mr. President, when I look at these figures, this $4.302 billion account, which is $258 million more than the President requested, considerably more, over $300 million more than the House bill provides--let me repeat that. While we are at $4.302 billion, the House is at $3.943 billion, or $350-plus million less than the Senate; and both the House and Senate authorizing bills are less--are less--than the Senate appropriations bill which we are considering on the floor at this moment. 
So, Mr. President, I intended to offer this amendment as much as for any other reason to engage the distinguished Senator from New Mexico in a colloquy and let him explain. I know he has an explanation. He is very knowledgeable on these things. Let him explain to the Senate why these rather unusual increases, when everybody else is taking a hit--there are a lot of water projects in this bill that he could not fund because they do not have the money to do it. Of course you couldn't. 
Before I finish, I ask the Senator from New Mexico, do the firewalls that we have in place apply to the Department of Energy's defense activities?

Mr. BUMPERS. Let me close with one observation, because I did not have the correct figure a while ago. 
Last year's bill, last year's Senate energy and water bill, 
the same bill we have on the floor right now, provided $270 million more than the President asked for and $300 million more than the House provided. So we had $270 million more last year than the President requested and $258 million more this year than the President requested. That is well over half a billion dollars in 2 years, as I say, when everybody else has suffered. 
So I ask the Senator from New Mexico if he would care to respond to my complaints about what I consider excessive increases in the DOE weapons development activities.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me say to both the Senator from New Mexico and to the Senator from Nevada, for whom I have the utmost respect and friendship, that I do not disagree with very much of anything either of them just got through saying. And they said it very well. I would like to say to the Senator from Nevada that that was indeed a courageous vote when he voted for the nuclear freeze, particularly as the Senator from Nevada. It was a very courageous vote. But, as he knows, correct votes around here are often very courageous. Sometimes we lose Senators because they cast too many courageous votes. It doesn't happen very often. Probably it ought to happen more often than it does. 
But, in any event, I compliment him on that. I have always been in support of the nuclear freeze. I have been for 2 1/2 years standing at this desk back here talking about the insanity of the number of nuclear weapons in both our stockpile and the Soviet Union's, now Russia's, stockpile when both countries always had hundreds of times more weapons than it would take to destroy the planet. So I have fought with some small measure of success to bring some sanity to the whole thing. 
I just close out by this question that, as I say, troubles me. And the reason that I came over here to offer this amendment to this bill which we are now debating, the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, is that it contains $4.302 billion for nuclear weapons, for weapons activities, and the uses, which the Senators have described, to provide for the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile. Nobody would question that for a moment. I mean we have enough problems about how we are going to dispose of all of this stuff. That is one of hottest debates we have had so far in the Senate: How we are going to get rid of nuclear materials. But here we have a $4.302 billion bill. And this is the thing that causes me some considerable concern: that it is $284 million above what the Senate authorizing committee just authorized yesterday. 
When I first came here, and up until recently, you could not appropriate more money than the authorizing committee authorized. And we are reaching the point where we don't need authorizing committees anymore because we routinely exceed what they recommend. 
So this bill is $284 million above the Senate authorized amount, $258 million more than the President recommended, $336 million more than the House authorized, and $359 million more than the House Appropriations Committee approved. 
Here are three authorizations, plus the President's request. And the President's request is supposed to reflect what DOD, the Defense Department, wants. We don't separate the two. When we talk about the President's request, we are speaking for the Defense Department. Here we are appropriating $258 million more than the President and DOD asked for. 
So here we are $250 million-plus above everybody--the President, the authorizing committee, the House authorizing committee, and the House Appropriations Committee. 
So I know the Senator can understand why that piqued my curiosity. 
I would be delighted to yield the floor to the Senator, if he would like to respond to that. 
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have the utmost respect for both managers of this bill, the chairman and ranking member. 
Let me just say that the Senator brought this up. I deliberately did not mention Sandia and Los Alamos and the fact that Nevada receives a substantial part of this money because I don't really care where the money is spent. This is an issue to me that transcends the parochial interests of jobs. It is not that that isn't important to the Senator. Of course it is. It is important to me when I am fighting for something for my State. But, as I say, there is something here that transcends that; that is, how much money we are spending on this. 
I tell you that I share the Senator's concern for the same reasons that the Senator stated. My only concern is whether or not we are appropriating way too much money to accomplish what is, indeed, a very, very legitimate end. 
Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is an amendment that Senator Coats and I have been talking to other Senators about. I think it is agreed to by both sides now. 
It simply says, regarding the F-22 fighter plane, the day before yesterday the Air Force said they would build the F-22 fighter, 339 planes, for $43 billion. We have spent so far a little over $18 billion in research and development of that plane. 
Senator Coats, in the Armed Services Committee, got a provision put in that $18 billion--they have not spent that much yet but that is what is anticipated to be spent on research and development. Senator Coats put an amendment in the bill to make that a cap, $18 billion. This amendment would put a $43 billion cap on the production of 339 airplanes. 
As I say, that simply says exactly what the Air Force says it would take to do it. I think it is a very healthy amendment. I think it is one that serves the taxpayers well, will serve us well and the contractors well. It is a commitment they are making and we are simply codifying that in this bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, several weeks ago I stood at this desk during the debate on the budget resolution and offered an amendment that I thought was an eminently serious, major, defining amendment on that bill. I have been here 22 1/2 years and I knew perfectly well that I was not going to prevail on that amendment. But I had pointed out during the course of the debate that in the 22 1/2 years I have been here, probably the most important goal I had hoped to see achieved during my tenure in the Senate was a balanced budget. 
I had, on several occasions, voted against a constitutional amendment to balance the budget simply because of my reverence for the Constitution and for my belief that economic policy has no place in the Constitution. I had always argued and will argue until my dying day that balancing the budget is a matter of will by the Members of the U.S. Congress, and to suggest that the only way we can screw up the nerve and stiffen our spines to balance the budget is to put it in the Constitution is demeaning in the extreme. 
So that is why in 1993 I voted for the reconciliation bill that raised taxes and cut spending. It raised taxes on 1 1/2 percent of the wealthiest people in America and cut spending by $250 billion over a 5-year period, all of which combined was supposed to reduce the deficit from what it would otherwise be by $500 billion over the ensuing 5 years. Mr. President, that 5-year period is not yet up, but in 1998 on the fifth anniversary of the passage of that bill, it will not have saved $500 billion, it will have saved $1 trillion and more. That bill is responsible for the deficit going from almost $300 billion in 1992 to what we thought was $67 billion until today. 
It has been a source of unbelievable satisfaction to me to see the deficit in 1993 go from $290 billion anticipated to $254; in 1994, to $205 billion; in 1995, $154 billion; in 1996, $107 billion; in 1997, anticipated to be $67 billion, and this morning's front page of the Washington Post says that because the economy is so good and people are paying taxes that the deficit this year will be $45 billion or less. That will be the smallest deficit we have had, as we lawyers like to say, since the memory of man runneth not. 
The reason I rise to speak, Mr. President, is not just to catalog that history with which all the Senators are all too familiar, but to point out another item that was included in that Washington Post story. It said if we can just get the House and Senate conferees to keep bickering for another year and not pass this tax cut, we could easily balance the budget in 1998. 
Two weeks ago when I offered my amendment to forgo tax cuts, I said we should forgo tax cuts, honor what I consider to be a nonnegotiable demand by the American people to balance the budget and balance the budget in 2001, maybe even 2000. And now this morning's paper says you do not have to postpone taxes to do it in 2001. If you postpone taxes, you can do it in 1998. Never, never in modern times have we been so close to actually doing what most of us say we want to do, and that is balance the budget. 
Now, Mr. President, I got a whopping 18 votes for my amendment 2 weeks ago. I am not going to call the names of the Senators that voted with me, but I hope people will look at the Record and see who had the courage, who had the vision and the spine to stand up 
on the floor of the Senate and vote for an eminently sensible proposal to balance the budget earlier, much earlier, than the bill we were debating. And 4 of those courageous 18 people were up for reelection next year. They certainly have my praise and my respect because they believe in the American people and they were willing to stand up and vote for a reduction of the deficit as opposed to a tax cut. 
If you ask the American people, would you favor this $135 billion tax cut over the next 5 years, or would you prefer a balanced budget over the next 2 years, I can tell you the answer would be 70 percent to 80 percent of the people would opt for a balanced budget. 
Mr. President, the 18 votes I got to postpone the tax cuts in order to bring about a balanced budget much sooner is the smallest number of votes I have ever received on an amendment since I have been in the Senate. And it was probably as good, as authentic and courageous an amendment as I have ever offered since I have been in the Senate. It could have changed the economic course of the country. 
Mr. President, the article in the paper this morning got one thing totally wrong. The article stated that neither the Democrats nor the Republicans are going to be able to take credit for the balanced budget. 
I take strong exception to that as a Democrat. Two of the finest Senators we ever had in the U.S. Senate lost their seats in 1994 because they stood up and voted for the 1993 budget which raised certain people's taxes. The House of Representatives fell to the Republicans in 1994 when Newt Gingrich became speaker and the U.S. Senate went to the Republicans and there was not one Republican in the House or the Senate that voted for that bill which has brought about this exhilarating chance to actually balance the budget. 
So to say that President Clinton has not been courageous in proposing the 1993 budget package is a terrible injustice and it is wrong. 
It is his legacy. It is the legacy of this President that he stood firm on deficit reduction in offering that bill, which cost the Democrats dearly at the polls the following year. So far as I am concerned, the stock market has been soaring ever since that bill was passed in 1993, despite the promises of some of the most distinguished Senators on the other side, who said that this is going to end the world as we know it, and you are going to see people out of work and more homeless people, and you are going to see a depression if we pass this bill. 
We passed the bill. The stock market took off because people were encouraged and finally believed that the people down here knew what they were doing and were finally going to screw up their nerve and give them a sound fiscal Government. It has been going on ever since, and that is precisely the reason we are within striking distance of balancing the budget right now. To say nobody can claim credit for that is a real stretch. It was President Clinton. It was not easy. Most of you will recall that the Vice President had to come over and sit in the chair and break a tie in order to pass that bill. Today, the American people are the beneficiaries. 
I hope that the conferees are unable to reach an agreement on this, because if they don't reach an agreement, we can balance the budget. If they do reach an agreement, Lord only knows what the results are going to be. All we know is that the wealthiest people in America are going to get a handsome tax cut and the budget is not going to be balanced. 
So, Mr. President, I rise tonight to set the record straight on what I think is an extremely important event. I was absolutely euphoric this morning to read that the deficit that was anticipated to be $127 billion this year was then calculated to be about $104 billion, and then calculated about 3 months ago to be $67 billion, and this morning calculated to be $45 billion. It is beyond our wildest dreams. Why would we not seize the moment to forego this tax cut and do precisely what the American people want us to do? It isn't too late. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, this amendment will prohibit the scoring of the sale of any lands from a national park or a national wildlife refuge or Forest Service lands. 
To my colleagues, I want to say, I have witnessed over the past 10 years an irresistible urge on the part of some of my colleagues to dispose of some of the national treasures of this country, even suggesting a commission to determine which lands, which national parks, we can do without and sell. 
This amendment is designed to do two things. No. 1, it is designed to discourage that by making it impossible to score the proceeds from a sale of national parks, Forest Service lands, or wildlife refuges in a reconciliation bill; and, No. 2, I want to say that I think it is a terrible practice. When I was Governor, I never allowed a one-time asset to be used in the budget. 
Finally, to those who would say, well, this will keep us from leasing ANWR, that is simply not true. You can lease ANWR. You can lease anything, wildlife refuge or otherwise, but you cannot use it as an asset in the reconciliation bill. 
I yield back such time as I may have.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me say first of all that in the Senate in 1981 there were only 11 votes cast against the proposal to cut taxes and increase defense spending to balance the budget--11 Senators. President Reagan's popularity was unbelievable, and there was a herd instinct that swept across this body. It was absolutely unstoppable. And in 1994 when we were going to balance the budget the deficit was up to $200 billion. 
I hate to say this. But, in my opinion, Mr. President, 18 people who voted `no' today will be more than justly and aptly vindicated when the year 2002 rolls around and we will not have a balanced budget or anything even close to it. 
I am chagrined and dismayed that today we are looking at a $67 billion deficit on October 1, and next year, by our own admission and our own actions, the deficit will go to $94 billion --almost $30 billion higher than it is in 1997. To me that is shameful and unforgivable. 
The American people have demanded a balanced budget as long as anybody can remember, and today we just forsook the opportunity to meet that nonnegotiable demand of the American people which they have laid on us for years. 
Mr. President, I forsook offering an amendment that I felt very strongly about this afternoon. I did it to accommodate our own majority leader who had a plane to catch, and there were a lot of other Senators. I had no disillusions about whether my amendment would pass or not. But I wanted to debate it for 1 minute, and I am perhaps better off taking 5 minutes now to say to whoever may be watching and the Members of this body, ask yourself this question. It goes right to the heart of my amendment. 
Do you think the Nation is better off providing a $135 billion tax cut, over 50 percent of which goes to the wealthiest 5 percent of the people in America? Do you think we are better off doing that, or do you think we would be better off providing a college education for the 5 million youngsters whom the New York Times says over the next few years will be excluded from a college education because of skyrocketing costs? 
I speak from experience. I spent 3 years in the Marine Corps in World War II. I came home where there was a compassionate, caring, understanding Government which provided the GI bill to my brother and me. I wouldn't be standing on the floor of the Senate today as a U.S. Senator if it had not been for that help from the U.S. Government. Some people think the Government has no obligation to help anybody. 
What I am saying is if I had my first choice it would be to put the $135 billion in savings on the deficit, and balance the budget by the year 2000, and no later than 2001. But if we are not going to do that, if we are going to take the $115 billion we cut out of Medicare and spend it on something, I say spend it on college education for youngsters who cannot go to college otherwise. 
Mr. President, the greatness of this country has occurred when Members of the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives had strong convictions about what we need to do as a matter of social, educational, and cultural policy--the GI bill, for example. It takes a giant leap of faith to believe that we can do this--educate every youngster in the country with a college degree. 
We found that the average cost of an education in a State-supported university is $7,000 a year. So we simply increased the Pell grant to $7,000. The income criteria would remain as it is now. If you were wealthy or partially wealthy, you wouldn't get the full $7,000. But if you had an income of below a certain amount, you would get the $7,000. We left the two tax provisions that are in this bill that we just passed intact. 
Mr. President, I want you to look at this chart so that you can see what I am talking about and where we are headed. 
Here are the percentages of people in certain income categories. This is the highest level of income in the country --86 percent of those people go to college. In the next quintile down here, 60 percent, a little less than 60 percent, in 1983 and today, almost 68 percent of those kids go to college. And you get down here in the low-income, and look what happens. It started up--down and up. And now it is down again. If you look at the New York Times article of this past week, you will see that this figure is going to head down. 
Mr. President, I am not going to take up a lot of time to say something that everybody knows that we ought to be doing. But I do want to say this. Mr. President, the high school graduates in this country in the past 20 years have lost 18 percent more of their income. When you hear people say the income gap in this country is widening, there it is. High school students lost 18 percent in the last 20 years. Dropouts have lost 25 percent. And, if it continues at the present rate, by the year 2015 high school students will have lost 38 percent of their income because they didn't go to college. 
If you want to live in a civilized society, it is this simple. If you want to live in a civilized society, one that is relatively drug free and crime free, if you want to live in a society and in a technological age, we don't have any choice about it. This has to come. 
It is one of those things that we need to debate and debate now, and we need to do it. We need to make sure that no child in this country is denied a college education anymore than today we would deny somebody a high school education. 
So I forsook offering that amendment even though my staff and I had spent untold hours gathering statistics and information. 
I want to conclude as I opened a moment ago. Once again, I ask my brethren in the U.S. Senate and the people of America to ask yourself this one question: Do you think we are better off spending this $135 billion on a tax cut which goes to me, upper-income people, and $12 a year to the stiff out there making $15,000 a year--$12 a year for him? The guy making $15,000 a year gets $12 a year out of this tax bill. 
The guy making over $200,000 a year gets $3,500 to $3,700. It is ironic; it does not mean anything to either one of them. To the man making $15,000, $12 does not mean anything in his life; to a man making $200,000, $3,000, or $3,500 does not mean much either. That is what we are doing instead of meeting our obligation. Ask yourself which is more important, that tax cut or educating the children of this country so we can live in a civilized society. 
I thank the Chair.  
Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have never heard so many stale arguments in my life. This is like saying we will give General Motors the steel to build cars if they will hire some people to do it. This is a simple question of giving the biggest mining companies in the world the taxpayer's resources. That is who we are talking about. This doesn't belong to the 10 Senators from the Western States. This gold and silver belongs to the taxpayers--the people I have heard talk about so many times on this tax bill, that `we are going to give a tax cut to the long-suffering taxpayers' and, at the same time, give away billions of dollars worth of gold, silver, platinum, and palladium that belongs to the taxpayers. 
This amendment has nothing to do with the gold companies' depletion, even on private lands. It has nothing to do with depletion on State lands. It has to do with the lands they got from the U.S. Government for nothing. And we are paying them to take it. We are giving them a depletion allowance to mine gold that we gave them. 
There is a lot more mining that goes on on private and State lands than goes on on Federal lands. They are not going offshore. They are not going broke. Here is the big ad by Barrick Mining Co. in the Mining World News: `Developing Your Gold Property to its Full Potential.' 
Work with a new partner, Barrick Gold. You may not have dealt with us before, but you should know we are the world's most profitable gold producer. 
And well they should be; they don't pay anything for it. This means $400 million to the taxpayers of this country over the next 5 years. They are perfectly willing to pay an 18 percent royalty on private lands. They are perfectly willing to pay 5 to 18 percent on State lands. They pay severance taxes, reclamation fees, and royalties to everybody under the shining Sun--except the taxpayers of the United States, who own it. 
Let me say to my colleagues. Each one of you who are defending this proposition, let me ask you this: You go home and tell your friends, your supporters--I am not talking about the mining companies, I am talking about the taxpayers--I want you to tell the people back home that if you had 500 acres of land and had $18 billion or $11 billion worth of gold under it--or in the case of Stillwater Mining Co. in Montana, $38 billion worth of palladium and platinum on 2,000 acres--if you owned it, and I came to you and I said that I am going to relieve you of all these billions of dollars worth of gold, I will get rid of it for you, what would you pay me? We can't pay you for it. We are just going to get rid of the gold for you. You would say, get thee hence to the nearest psychiatrist for a saliva test. I cannot believe that, year after year, we listen to these stale arguments about how people are going offshore, and they create jobs. So does some small struggling businessman that hires 10 people in your State, but you don't give him all of his resources to produce something with. 
Mr. President, it is time that this body stood up to its duty. This is not about the mining law. This is simply saying, in those narrow cases, where we gave them the land, and they are mining it and not paying a dime to the taxpayers of this country in any kind of a fee, we are saying, for God's sake, let's not pay them to take it. At least take the depletion allowance from them. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is the ninth year I have stood on this floor and tried to prick the conscience of the 
Members of this body about this last remaining egregious scam on the American people. Next year, when some of you are up for reelection, I expect you are going to see some 30-second spots on this. What is it your opponent will say? What is it that makes you want to give away billions and billions of dollars of the taxpayers' money and us get nothing in return? Why do you tell your Chamber of Commerce you will handle their money like it was your own? Anybody in this body would be disqualified from being a Senator if he answered the question I posed a moment ago, `Yes, I will let them come and take gold off my property for nothing.' Why, of course, you would not. 
This is a very narrowly drafted amendment. It is crafted not to discriminate. It simply says that if you mine gold on private lands, fine, get a depletion. Oil companies, coal companies, and gas companies are entitled to a depletion. But when you give resources of the U.S. taxpayers away for nothing, and then allow them to take a 15 percent depletion, which is worth $400 million of the taxpayers' money, and you turn around here in this tax bill and say we are going to give it back to you, don't give it away in the first place. For God's sake, colleagues, do your duty. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mrs. Merrill Catt, a speech therapist in the Weiner, AR, public school system and eight of her students who participated in a year-long project entitled `The Rice Paddy Kids'. This project was designed to teach economics and provide hands-on learning experience to the students who ranged from third to eighth grade and were receiving speech/language therapy and resource services. 
Because the students live in the heart of the rice-producing region of Arkansas, which is the leading rice-producing State in the United States, the project focused on the production and marketing of rice. In the initial phase of the project the students gathered information and knowledge about rice and its economic impact locally and nationally. The second phase of the project consisted of hands-on learning opportunities as the students planned, advertised, and produced products containing rice and marketed their products to the student body and the community. In addition to the applications of economic concepts and basic skills contained in each phase, curriculum activities were incorporated to improve the students' individual language deficiencies. The students concluded the project by planning and implementing a rice banquet for their parents, business supporters, teachers, school administration and community members. 
What I've just summarized in several paragraphs takes many long hours of hard work and dedication to plan, organize, and implement. This is the second economic project Mrs. Catt has successfully undertaken to expand the knowledge and capabilities of her speech and language students, and I commend her for her initiative and willingness to go the extra mile for the benefit of her students and school. In addition to teaching these students about rice, she has shown them what can be accomplished when the important principles of responsibility, cooperation, perseverance, and innovation are utilized. I also congratulate the eight `Rice Paddy Kids' for a job well done. Not only are these students the benefactors of the project but they are an integral part of its success. While educating and helping themselves, they also educated and benefited their school and community. 
There are many school systems in Arkansas that are larger in terms of student population and funding than the Weiner school system. However, the accomplishments of Mrs. Catt and `The Rice Paddy Kids' are a perfect example of how bigger is not always better. They have demonstrated a principle in which I firmly believe: being from a small town is no excuse not to think big and achieve great things.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, we are all speaking here at the indulgence of the managers of the bill because there is no time left on this bill. I will not delay it for long. 
First, I want to say that I have never been as happy with my decision not to seek reelection as I have been today. I have been voting on amendments that involve billions of dollars today with only a superficial or cursory knowledge of what I was voting on. I would not like to go home--and I don't speak for the rest of you but I expect I am speaking for the rest of you, too--I would hate to have to go home and explain to people what was involved in all of these amendments, particularly this one which I do not have a clue about. 
But we must not lose sight of the point that the distinguished Senator from West Virginia made in the opening part of his statement a moment ago. That is, it is the rule that is the tyrant here with 20 hours to debate this part of the reconciliation bill and 20 hours to debate the tax portion of it, which is monumental and most probably will be the most significant important legislation we will deal with all year--20 hours. We will wind up at the end of that 20 hours precisely the way we have with this one. There will be a long list of amendments down there. Maybe we will have another unanimous-consent agreement where you are allowed 60 seconds to explain a bill that involves $10 billion. 
We are not doing the people of this Nation a service as long as we allow this kind of a rule to put us in this kind of a straitjacket where we have to get up and openly confess that this system is not working as it ought to. 
So, I applaud the Senator from West Virginia for his comments. He is right on target. Fifty hours ought to be a minimum for the consideration of a reconciliation bill. 
I thank the Senator for making everybody aware of our shortcomings on this day.

Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, this is the 9th consecutive year that I have tried my very best to do justice to the taxpayers of the United States. I have heard an awful lot of talk in the last 60 days by people on both sides of the aisle about the $135 billion in tax cuts for those long-suffering taxpayers. I do not intend to debate the merits of the tax cuts tonight. 
What I want to debate is the cynicism, the contradiction, the hypocrisy of talking about doing justice to the taxpayers on one hand by giving them a massive tax cut, and at the same time allow the biggest mining companies in the world to take billions of dollars worth of gold off land that belongs to the taxpayers of the United States and not pay one red cent for the privilege and then turn around and give these same mining companies an enormous tax break which they never did anything to deserve. 
In 1872, Ulysses Grant signed the famous mining law of 1872 that encouraged people to go West and stake 20-acre claims. The 1872 mining law is still firmly intact. There are now over 330,000 claims that have been legitimately filed that belong to people who went out and simply drove 4 stakes in the ground every 20 acres and then went down to the courthouse and filed their claim. In addition, there are approximately 650 applications that have been filed with the Bureau of Land Management for patents on some of those claims which would permit the applicants to buy the land for $2.50 or $5 an acre. 
The people in the Senate do not pay much attention to this issue. They apparently pay little attention to the people watching C-SPAN because they are the ones who are getting the shaft. 
Madam President, can you imagine this scenario. Newmont Mining Co., one of the biggest mining companies in the world, has a gold mine in Nevada. They pay the owners of the land on which that gold mine is situated an 18 percent gross royalty for the gold they take off that land. However, when they mine on public, taxpayer-owned land, they do not pay one red cent to the taxpayers of this country. 
And you wonder why the people of this country are cynical. You wonder why the words `corporate welfare' were used so generously around here when we were looking for offsets for this massive tax cut, and this bill comes back to us from the Finance Committee with not a word about corporate welfare. 
Do you know what else these mining companies do? They find somebody that has a bunch of claims that they think have some potential, and they buy the claims and then they mine it. Then they go to the Bureau of Land Management and say, `We have commercial gold or silver on this land and we want to buy it, and we will give you the princely sum of either $2.50 an acre or $5 an acre.' 
Do you know what Bruce Babbitt, the Secretary of Interior, has to do? He has to, by law, give them a deed to that land. Here is what has happened just in the past several years. 
Barrick Gold Co. paid the U.S. taxpayers $9,000. Do you know what they got for that? They got almost 2,000 acres in Nevada with 11 billion dollars worth of gold on it. It belongs to the taxpayers of the United States. Do you know what the taxpayers are going to get for that $11 billion? Zip, zero, nothing. No royalty, no severance tax, no reclamation fee, and then they take a 15 percent depletion allowance on the gold they take out. We not only give it to them for $2.50 an acre or $5 an acre, we give them a depletion allowance for mining what they never paid for. 
In 1995, Faxe Kalk, a Danish company, bought land in Idaho containing 1 billion dollars' worth of travertine. Do you know what they paid the taxpayers of the United States for this land containing the $1 billion in minerals? They paid $275. 
There is an application pending at the Bureau of Land Management right now by the Stillwater Mining Co. for about 2,000 acres of Forest Service land in Montana. Stillwater will pay a maximum of $10,000 for that land. What do you think lies under that 2,000 acres of land? This is their figure, not mine: 38 billion dollars worth of palladium and platinum--$38 billion. Do you 
know who that belongs to? It belongs to the taxpayers of the United States. Do you know what the taxpayers of the United States are going to get in exchange for their $38 billion? You guessed it--the shaft. Nothing, not a penny. And people stand up and defend this thing as though it is some kind of a righteous cause. 
These mining companies do not mind paying private property owners a royalty. They pay the States a royalty when they mine on State lands. They also pay the states a severance tax. It is only when the land belongs to the taxpayers of the United States that they object. 
When you hear people in the coffee shops in your hometown talk about Government being sold off to the highest bidder, you cannot find a better case of it. The Halls of Congress and the Senate office buildings have been so full of lobbyists since I announced I was going to try to do away with the depletion allowance for companies mining on public land, you could not stir them with a stick. I can hardly get down the hall from my office because the Finance Committee office is between my office and the elevator. 
So what I am saying, Madam President, let's at least have the courage to tell the taxpayers of this country that we are not going to give the mining companies, after we give them lands for $5 an acre, a 15 percent depletion allowance to mine minerals they never paid for. 
When the oil companies buy a lease in the ocean, when the coal companies buy a lease on lands in the West, when the natural gas companies explore for gas on Federal lands, any time they find it, they pay a royalty for the interest in the minerals. They take a depletion allowance and they are entitled to a depletion allowance because, by definition, if you are depleting a capital asset, that is a legitimate thing to do when you paid for it in the first place. The oil and gas companies deplete oil and gas, and they have a right to do it. They paid a handsome price for it, and they are depleting an asset they paid for. These people paid nothing. 
What have the taxpayers gotten out of this besides not 1 red cent in royalties? Well, for openers, they have gotten 557,000 abandoned mine sites, 57 of which are on the Superfund list. The Mineral Policy Center says that the estimated cost of cleaning up the mess that these mining companies have left us is between $31 billion and $72 billion. 
I hate to be repetitive, but just to emphasize the point, let me go through it again. The mining companies give the taxpayers $5 an acre for gold. They take billions of dollars worth of gold off the land. They pay the taxpayers no royalty at all, they get a 15 percent depletion allowance; and then they leave an unmitigated environmental disaster, which is going to cost the taxpayers of this Nation between $31 billion and $72 billion to clean up. 
Madam President, I have announced that I would not seek reelection, and in deliberating on that decision, I got to thinking about debates, what would be debated, what would be said, who would say it, and how would you respond. And I thought, how would you respond to an accusation that you voted for allowing the gold and silver and palladium and platinum mining companies to continue raping and pillaging the taxpayers of this country--all the time you are talking about a big tax cut for the taxpayers because they deserve it? And how are you going to pay for the tax cut? You are going to pay for the lion's share of it by cutting Medicare by $115 billion. You can put any face on it you want. I didn't vote for it. I have no intention of voting for it. Take $115 billion off Medicare and that, in turn, will come off of services for the elderly, part of the most vulnerable in our society, and then you ask your opponent, did you vote for that? Yes, I voted for that. Well, this $115 billion that you cut in Medicare, what did you do with it? We gave it away in tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America. You didn't put it on the deficit? No, we didn't put it on the deficit. You are going to balance the budget by cutting taxes? Isn't that the same old line you gave us back in 1981 that gave us a $5.3 trillion debt? Then what if somebody said, how about those mining companies? I have heard Senator Bumpers, and I have read in the paper some of the things he said--for 9 years--about how the mining companies take billions of dollars worth of gold off of what is or was Federal lands, and they pay nothing for it, isn't that true? It is true. Nobody will deny it. And they don't pay 1 red cent. It gives corporate welfare a bad name. 
The Western Senators, which have gold mines in their States on Federal lands, ask what if you bought a mining claim from some nester that staked out 500 acres, and the mining companies pay him handsomely for it, aren't they entitled to a depletion? Now, that is a neat way to avoid the issue. It also makes this point. When you buy 500-acre claims, for example, from some old nester that has been sitting on them for 10 years, they not only pay him a handsome price for it, they pay him a royalty, or what we call residual, an override. Now, they are willing to pay State's royalties, they are willing to pay private owner's royalties, and when they buy this land from some old nester that staked it 10 or 20 years ago, they are willing to pay him a royalty. It is only if the words `U.S.' are on it anyplace that they don't want to pay a penny in royalty. 
The questions I ask every year, and the questions that never get answered, are: Why are you willing to do this to the taxpayers? Why are you willing to pay a royalty of 18 percent on private lands in Nevada? Why are you willing to pay an average of 5 percent on all private lands in the United States? Why are you willing to pay the States a severance tax? Why are you willing to pay the States a royalty on their lands? But when it comes to lands that belong to the taxpayers of the United States, you are not willing to pay 1 red cent? Everybody falls silent when you pose those questions.

Mr. BUMPERS. Well, Mr. President, all but the freshman who just came in here this year have heard this debate before. A lot of people here have heard this debate in spades over the years. The problem is identical to what it was 9 years ago when I brought it up the first time. It is the most egregious, outrageous scam being perpetrated on the people of this country. 
I have only got a year and a half left here, but I promise you, I am going to bring this up until the last day I am in the U.S. Senate. I am immensely offended by it. I cannot believe my colleagues have allowed it to continue. We have made one or two little modest gains--very modest gains. But the mining companies are fighting like saber-toothed tigers--they are standing in the hallways, they are in the committee rooms, they are all over the place--to protect the greatest sweetheart piece of corporate welfare in the history of mankind. 
I yield the floor.

We have two Senators from Nevada here, and as I understand it there are a couple more besides Senator Craig of Idaho, and Senator Murkowski has just finished his statement. I was just wondering--we have an hour each, but I was just wondering if we could, since this is in the evening if they could--I don't know of anybody else on my side. Senator Gregg is my chief cosponsor, and he is not going to be here this evening. I wonder if we could allow people to come in and speak as long as they want to tonight with the understanding we will have 20 minutes equally divided in the morning on the vote.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me first extend my sincere and profound gratitude to Senator Bond for creating and being the originator of this legislation. I am honored he has asked me to be his chief cosponsor. 
I just want to say for the Record and for those who may be watching, I remember when I was Governor of my State and my wife, Betty, was first lady. She had spent 2 years laying the groundwork for a statewide immunization program. It was a howling success. We immunized 300,000 children one Saturday without a single reaction. That evening I said, `Betty, you ought to take great pride in what you just accomplished today.' She said, `I do. Of course, this is good for your political career and it is good for the babies who were immunized today, but it is certainly no final solution because we will lapse right back into the lethargy we have experienced and watched for years with low immunization rates among children who are yet to be born.' She said until we institutionalize a program that can track each child's immunizations from birth through early childhood we will not have succeeded. Thanks to her efforts and many others, including Rosalynn Carter, and the program Every Child By Two, immunization levels in this country are now at an all-time high. 
The same principle applies in this case. Once we get this bill passed, and we will get it passed, it is imperative that we follow it up year after year after year so we do not lapse into the condition we are in right now where the rate of smoking among teenage women, pregnant teenage women, is going up. We got it down to 14 percent and now it is back up to 17 percent. 
If you ask that same teenage mother, what and whom do you love most, she loves mostly that fetus that lies inside her womb, and when that baby is born, she loves that baby above everything under the shining sun--above all else. 
So ask yourself, why would a woman, or why would parents smoke during pregnancy, and why would parents smoke after the baby is born? Every pediatrician in the country will tell you horror stories about sending children home after asthma attacks, only to see them come back with another asthma attack because people are smoking in the household. 
Senator Bond and I are asking for $10 million for this new initiative, an infinitesimal sum when compared to the savings it will produce. Hubert Humphrey stood at that desk right there. I never will forget the speech he made. `We don't have national health insurance. What we have is national sick insurance. It isn't worth anything until you get sick.' He told me about preventive programs that Ford Motor Company had instituted among all their employees and how much they were saving on health care costs through preventive medicine. 
Here we are now with a chance to save 10 to 100 times more than the paltry $10 million we will spend educating pregnant women in this country and telling them the consequences of asthma and low-birthweight babies. After the baby is born, one of the biggest single problems is sudden infant death syndrome. One of its causes is smoking around newborn babies. 
Mr. President, I am honored to join my distinguished colleague, Senator Bond, in pushing this. I hope we will be able to get hearings on this very shortly. Incidentally, I hope that the Centers for Disease Control will not just conduct outreach and education among pregnant women. I hope they will also work to educate the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Sometimes the very best professionals neglect and forget to tell pregnant women how to conduct themselves during pregnancy. I do not think that is a big problem, but I do think providers must be made acutely aware that they have this grave responsibility to at least tell pregnant women what they are up against and tell women what they must do when they go home from the hospital with a newborn. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. So anyway, Mr. President, the budget resolution calls for a $115 billion cut in Medicare, ostensibly to provide some solvency in the Medicare trust fund. 
The Finance Committee, in my opinion--in my opinion, we should not go forward with this budget and allow the people in this country who depend on Medicare for their very lives, we should not allow them to believe, as they have a perfect right to believe, that we are cutting $115 billion out of Medicare and, make no mistake about it, they will suffer. 
We say we are going to take it out of providers', hospitals', and doctors' hides. They are going to take it out of 
the patients' hides and the patients are going to get fewer services. 
So I do not want to go home and face my constituents and have them say, `You cut $115 billion out of Medicare, and that's all laudable as long as it goes into the trust fund to make the thing more solvent. But did you do that, did you put this on the deficit?' `No.' `Did you put it on child health care?' `No.' `Did you put it into education?' `No.' `What did you do with it?' `We gave it to the wealthiest people in America in tax cuts.' 
That is the accusation that every Senator should be prepared to face up to when he goes home this fall and in the election year next year. 
So what I am saying is, it is a laudable thing to try to make the Medicare trust fund solvent, but what we are doing here is using that $115 billion to provide $135 billion in tax cuts. We say, `Well, we're going to make up $50 billion of that; the net tax cuts will only be $85 billion.' What I am saying in my amendment is we require the Finance Committee to come up with a total of $115 billion in offsets to offset what we are cutting Social Security by. Otherwise, we stand fairly accused of using Medicare funds to cut taxes for the wealthiest people in America. 
Look at this chart. Here is the Medicare savings--$115 billion. That is the cut in Medicare. What we are going to do is we are going to use that as an offset to accommodate $135 billion in tax cuts. That is undeniable, unarguable, unassailable. We are using $115 billion of Medicare cuts to provide tax cuts. 
So what I am saying is, let us instruct the Finance Committee not just to put the airline ticket tax in at $32 billion over the next 5 years, but come up with enough additional offsets to offset the entire $115 billion in Medicare savings. That is not hard to understand, Mr. President. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, my second amendment is one I feel strongly about--both of these--but I want you to listen to this. 
It would delay the tax cuts that are provided in this budget resolution. We are going to face all of this later on in the reconciliation bill. I know that. But what we ought to do is delay the tax cuts until the year 2002. All I do in this amendment is I strike the first $63.3 billion of tax cuts over the years 1998 to 2001. 
You know what that does, Mr. President? It does not balance the budget in the year 2002. It balances the budget in the year 2001. Now, why would we not, after reading the paper this morning and seeing that the Treasury Department reaped a gold mine in April--the surplus in April of income versus expenditures was $97 billion. 
CBO has now said that the deficit could be as low as $65 billion come September 30. That is a remarkable achievement. 
On this floor in August 1993, we passed a bill called the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. I regret, Mr. President, not one single Republican voted for it. You know what the effect of that was? I told the President as far as I am concerned that is going to be his legacy. All these other things he is trying to accomplish, they are all laudable. I have no quarrel with them. But 5 solid straight years of real budget deficit reduction is going to be his legacy. 
But I will tell you how that legacy can be destroyed. That is to proceed with a budget that we have right here which cuts taxes by $135 billion for the wealthiest people in America, and revenues go down every single year--every single year. If we were to postpone these tax cuts until the year 2002, we could balance the budget in the year 2001. 
Let me tell you something else. If we do not strike while the iron is hot, we are going to regret it. I promise you, the assumptions in this bill that our economy is going to be as hot as these assumptions say it will be over the next 5 years is a very dicey situation. We have already had an unbelievable prosperity for the past 6 years. Nothing looks like it since Eisenhower was President. To assume it is going to continue another 5 years is the height of folly. You cannot depend on this budget to balance anything unless you agree with those economic assumptions, and I do not. 
I have spent 22 years in the Senate standing in this aisle, screaming my head off about budget deficits. In 1981, when Ronald Reagan was riding the crest the likes of which has never been seen since Franklin Roosevelt, the herd instinct swept through this body and all my screaming was for naught. It did not do a bit of good. 
I said--and I will send anybody a copy of the speech that would like to see it--you pass this budget and you are going to create deficits big enough to choke a mule. You cannot cut taxes, increase defense spending and balance the budget any more 
than you can lose weight on five chocolate sundaes a day. That is the five-chocolate-sundaes-a-day diet. And that is exactly what we are coming back to. 
What does it take to educate this body? If you do not learn from past experiences, what are you going to learn from? When Ronald Reagan left office 8 years later, the national debt--which at that time was $1 trillion and took 200 years to get to $1 trillion--when he left, all his 8 years later, it was $3 trillion. He had tripled the national debt because of the folly, the political folly, the political herd instinct that swept across this body in 1981. 
I am proud to tell you, Mr. President--a little self-serving--I did not vote for it. There are only 11 Senators who voted against the tax cuts. There were only three Senators who voted against the tax cuts and for the spending cuts. We could have balanced the budget by 1985 easily if everybody had voted the way those three Senators voted. 
So here we are, back at the same old stand: It did not work before, but it'll sure work this time. We will cut taxes, are going to cut taxes, going to increase spending, and bring you a balanced budget. 
While the deficit goes from $67 billion anticipated this fall, the fifth straight year, from $290 billion in 1992--$290 billion--to $67 billion this year, 5 straight years of deficit reduction, what does this budget do? Why, it takes it back up to $97 billion next year and $97 billion the following year and $83 billion the following year and $50 billion the following year. Then the following year a $1 billion surplus. 
I have some great land in the Everglades I would like to sell you if you believe that is going to happen. 
Mr. President, all we have to do is vote very simply to postpone the tax cuts. I am not saying do not ever cut taxes. But you are either for cutting taxes or for balancing the budget, but you cannot be for both and be economically sound in the process. 
So I am asking my colleagues to say, postpone the tax cuts until the year 2001 and balance the budget at the soonest possible date. Then you can argue all the other economic nonsense. But our first priority is to balance the budget. You are not going to do it with this budget. If you assume that the economy is going to stay like it is right now for the next 5 years--I do not know whether I will be here or not. I would just like to be around at the end of 5 years so I can say, I told you so. I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. I remember a great lesson when I was a boy about Joseph having a dream. Everybody in this body knows the rest of the story. Joseph dreamed there was going to be 7 years 
of plenty and 7 years of starvation. So he told the King of Egypt, if you want to survive, you better start saving everything you can the first 7 years. 
I want to relay that to every Senator in the U.S. Senate. I am telling you, if you have the 5 years, if you have the 5 years you are talking about here, do not assume that the deficit will continue to go down and we will start paying on the national debt, because we have never had prosperity for that length of time. 
I give you Joseph's admonition: Strike while the iron is hot and while the economy is hot. 
The Senator from New Mexico said I do not believe in tax cuts. I do not believe in using Medicare for tax cuts from the most vulnerable people in America, our elderly, who go to bed petrified every night fearing what their medical bills might be. I do not believe in using Medicare and I do not believe in tax cuts at the expense of balancing the budget. 
Every poll I have seen has shown overwhelmingly that people will take a balanced budget to tax cuts, and that is the option. As far as my liking taxes or not liking taxes, the present small business exemption for people who invest in small businesses, which the President endorsed in 1993, was mine. I am the author of it, trying to help small business. 
Right now, I have a bill up here in case we cut capital gains, and we are going to, to 19.8 percent--I reduced the capital gains on small business investments to half that, 9.8 percent. 
Mr. President, I used to have a little dachshund, a female dachshund. Betty and I worshipped that little dog, but we had a problem. We could not train her, could not train her to go outside. The only perfect analogy to that is the U.S. Senate. We cannot seem to train the U.S. Senate that you cannot cut taxes and balance the budget. I do not care how many times we do it. We did it in 1981 and paid a disastrous price, and we are about to do it again, and we will probably pay another disastrous price. We cannot resist the siren song of tax cuts. Politically, it is wonderful to go home and say, `Oh, yes, oh yes, I voted to cut your taxes, you bet.' 
`How did you do it?' 
And then you start obfuscating and trying to confuse the issue. You do not want to tell them you did it at the expense of a balanced budget. 
Mr. President, this amendment makes eminent good sense and there is not a Senator in the U.S. Senate--I take that back, there might be a few --who does not know that what I am talking about is pure common sense. It makes common sense in your life. It makes economic sense for the Nation to save up and to balance the budget, something the people in this country have been yearning for as long as anybody can remember. 
I have not announced whether I will run again or not. I do not mind telling you that two things that sort of make me want to be around here the next few years are that I would like to be here after investing 22 years in trying to balance the budget. I would like to be here when it happens. And the other thing I would like to be here for is when we change the way we finance campaigns. Why in the name of all that is good and holy we continue to cherish this absolutely outrageous system for raising money for campaigns, when every time you take a vote they rush and see whether somebody gave you money last year or the last time you ran, and how that affected your vote. Why would we not want to get rid of a system like that? 
If anybody believes this great Nation, the greatest democracy on Earth, with the oldest Constitution on Earth, can continue to survive when the people we elect and the laws we pass depend on how much money we put in it, is daydreaming. It cannot last forever. Those are two things that I would give anything in the world to see happen before I leave the U.S. Senate. 
So I plead with my colleagues, I plead with you, vote for common sense and vote to postpone these tax cuts and balance the budget in the year 2001. What is sacred about 2002? I have been hearing 2002 for I do not know how long. What is sacred about 2002? If you have a chance to do it in 2001, do it. That is what I am asking you to do. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. My first amendment simply says that the Finance Committee must come up with offsets of $115 billion to offset that amount which is the cut in Medicare. I think it would be unseemly and extreme if we have to go home and tell our people that we cut Medicare by $115 billion to make the system more solvent and at the same time tell them the only way we could cut taxes under this budget agreement was to cut Medicare by $115 billion. 
So, Mr. President, I earnestly ask my colleagues to seriously consider voting to simply say to the Finance Committee, do not force us to go home and tell our constituents that we cut Medicaid by $115 billion and we used every dime of it--every dime of it--to offset all these tax cuts, many of which go to the wealthiest people in America. 
It is indefensible. It is inexcusable. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, and my colleagues, what kind of a tax cut will you have if you do not use Medicare's $115 billion cut? The answer to that is, none, virtually none. 
Make no mistake about it, the Medicare cut is being used to fund these tax cuts. And without it there will be no tax cuts. It is just that simple.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is an amendment which keeps the deficit from soaring next year. This year's deficit is going to be $67 billion. This budget takes the deficit next year to $97 billion. In the year 2000 it is $97 billion. It starts coming down the last 2 years only because of the economic assumptions. 
You are assuming in this budget that the economy is going to stay as hot the next 5 years as it has been the last 5 years. And if that proves to be a false assumption you are going to see the deficit start soaring. 
I say strike while the iron is hot. 
In 1981 we bought into this same proposition, and in 8 years had a $3 trillion debt to show for it. 
Here we are back at the same old stand--cutting taxes and balancing the budget. That is the good old five-chocolate-sundae-a-day diet. It didn't work in 1981. It isn't going to work now. 
So I am saying balance the budget in the year 2001, not 2002. Postpone the tax cuts until 2002 and honor the American people who say they want a balanced budget a lot worse than they want a tax cut.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first of all, I want to compliment my good friends and colleagues, Senators Hatch and Kennedy, for producing what I think is a very good solution to an increasing, growing problem. I confess that I intended to offer legislation similar to this in the early part of the year, but I like this better than the idea for my own bill. 
We can debate and make all kinds of sophisticated arguments about why this is wrong and the impact on the budget and so on. I remind my colleagues that Winston Churchill once said that you can tell more about a nation by the way they treat their elderly and the conditions of their prisons than any other two things. He should have added children to that. 
I went to the dedication of a new $51 million Federal prison in my State this past Monday. All I could think about was the $16 million annual cost of that which would, indeed, produce a lot of jobs. But I also thought about how early intervention would have saved every one of those youngsters in that prison. Our priorities are so skewed. If we had that $51 million, or if we had that $16 million a year we spend on every inmate, if we had it spent on children at the ages of zero to 3, or zero to 50, whatever age you take, you can send people to Harvard for what we pay to keep people in prison. It is because of our neglect. If you ask the ordinary citizen on the street, `What do you think is most important for your children?' the first thing is education and the second thing is their health care. Anybody who doesn't understand that in this body is out of touch with America. 
I remember as a poor country lawyer in a town of 1,200 people--this is a personal story--my daughter had a condition that was very rare and could have been fatal--would have been fatal. We just happened to have a pediatrician who knew the greatest pediatric neurosurgeon in the world at Boston General Hospital. I had just made a $22,000 fee. So Betty and I were able to go. She had complications. We spent 6 weeks in Boston and used up my $22,000. But during the course of that, having her in the hands of the best pediatric neurosurgeon in the world, Betty asked me one day, `What do poor people do?' I said, `I will tell you what they do. They watch their children die.' 
Here is an opportunity for the Senate to do itself proud, for the Congress to do itself proud. You can make all the arguments you want to against this because this `t' is not crossed and the `i' isn't dotted. If we picked out some little flaw in every bill we voted on, we would never pass anything. 
There are a couple of things in this bill that are not terribly pleasing to me. But providing health care for 10 million children in this country who do not have it, you can't find a more noble undertaking by a political body. 
Mr. President, children without health care was, is, and will remain the shame of this great Nation until we deal with it. 
So I plead with my colleagues in the Senate to please America and do something that is really noble and laudable and worthwhile and will pay the richest dividends we have ever received. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Business Capital Gains Enhancement Act of 1997, which will make several important improvements to section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code, a measure I authored in 1993 to provide an incentive for investment in entrepreneurial efforts. Section 1202 provides a 50 percent exclusion for capital gains from qualified small business stock held at least 5 years. 
The purpose of section 1202 is clear. Because small businesses are inherently riskier than large businesses, most investors are reluctant to invest in the smaller enterprises. This, obviously, tends to create a dearth of capital for entrepreneurs. But maintaining a healthy investment environment for small businesses is extremely important for the well-being of our economy. Most new jobs come from small businesses, not large ones. From 1991-95, businesses with fewer than 500 employees created 22 million new jobs, while businesses of greater than 500 employees cut 3 million jobs. And it was because of this dynamic small business impact on our economy that Congress passed section 1202 with great bipartisan support in both chambers: we wanted to create a capital formation incentive for small business. 
Now, for two reasons, it has become crucial that we make certain improvements to section 1202. First, section 1202 is not adequate. The small business incentive I originally proposed in 1993 was considerably more extensive than section 1202. After years of discussions among entrepreneurs and tax experts regarding what would be helpful and workable, we had determined that the incentive should, for example, include companies of up to $100 million in assets, allow corporate investors, and not be subject to the alternative minimum tax. But because of budget concerns during the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, the proposal was scaled back to include only companies of $50 million or less, allow no corporate investors, and subject 50 percent of the benefit to the alternative minimum tax. The bill my cosponsors and I are introducing today will expand section 1202 to provide the kind of incentive originally envisioned and more. 
The second reason that today's legislation is crucial is to preserve the incentive in the face of other impending capital gains cuts which would effectively nullify it. As we all know, it appears that we are headed toward an across-the-board capital gains cut following the recent budget agreement between the Clinton administration and Republican congressional leaders. 
Ironically, an across-the-board cut could obliterate the small business incentive if the latter is not adjusted accordingly. 
Here is how that would happen. Under the GOP capital gains proposal in S. 2, the top regular capital gains rate will be 19.8 percent, while the top rate for small business capital gains will remain at 14 percent. In other words, an investor could buy stock in, say, Microsoft, hold that stock 1 year, sell the stock, and, if a gain were realized, pay a maximum tax of 19.8 percent. Alternatively, the investor could make that investment in, say, a new biotech firm, hold that stock 5 years, sell the stock, and, if a gain were realized, pay a maximum tax of 14 percent. The logical choice would be clear: the investor would choose the big business over the small business. After all, who would choose a risky 5-year small business investment over a 1-year Microsoft investment for a tax differential of only 5.8 percent? Clearly, a major across-the-board tax cut without a corresponding increase in the exclusion for small business investments will obliterate section 1202's effectiveness. Small business will be left without a viable capital gains incentive. 
Not only would the situation described above nullify the small business incentive for the future, it would be unfair to those who have already made small business investments based on section 1202--those who accepted the risk of investing in a small business stock for the promise of preferential capital gains treatment. We would be saying, `Thanks for taking a risk with your small business investment, but we've decided to change the rules. We're gonna give you about the same tax rate we give other people for their less-risky Fortune 500 investments.' As a matter of fairness to those who have already invested in a small business based on section 1202, we must maintain a substantial difference between small business and big business capital gains taxes. This bill will make that adjustment by increasing the exclusion for small business capital gains from 50 percent to 75 percent. 
Here is a list of all the improvements our legislation would make to section 1202. Increase the small business deduction from 50 percent to 75 percent; increase the asset limit for `qualified small businesses' from $50 to $100 million; make the incentive available to corporate investors; exempt the incentive from alternative minimum tax calculations; change the working capital spend-down period (intended to prevent 
abuse through inactivity) from 2 years to 5 years to allow companies to raise adequate capital before beginning to spend it; increase the per-taxpayer benefit limit to $20 million or 10 times investment. Presently, the limit is $10 million or 10 times investment; and allow the tax-deferred rollover of capital gains from one qualified small business to another. 
Although we have not yet received a Joint Tax Committee revenue estimate on this measure, it would appear from previous estimates to cost under $500 million over 5 years and under $1 billion over 10 years. Compared to the cost of an across-the-board capital gains tax cut and other major tax cuts being considered by this Congress, this is a pittance. 
Mr. President, section 1202 is the major, if not the only, capital formation incentive for small business in the entire Tax Code. It would be a tragedy and a slap in the face of America's entrepreneurs if we fail to maintain this measure in viable form. The bill we are introducing today will do that, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, on this beautiful Monday morning when there is absolutely nothing going on in the Senate or in the entire Congress, it is an ideal time to remind the Members of Congress and the American people that 125 years ago this past Saturday, Ulysses Grant, who was President of the United States, signed a bill called the mining law of 1872. This is now my ninth year of trying to get this law repealed. It is probably the biggest single scam that continues in effect in America today. 
In the past several years I have brought up numerous amendments to try to modify or repeal the mining law. Each time some of my colleagues, who do not have any hard-rock mining in their State, voted with western Senators to oppose my amendment. The western Senators always argue the reason they do not want to require the mining companies to pay a royalty for mining on public land and the reason they want the mining companies to buy this land for $2.50 an acre is because it creates jobs. That is absurd Mr. President. We do not tolerate that in the private sector. We do not tolerate it anyplace else in the public sector. We should not tolerate it here. 
Let me just refresh people's memory on how the mining law works. Under the law that Ulysses Grant signed, which was designed primarily to encourage people to move west, anybody who wanted to could go out on Federal lands and drive four stakes in the ground and claim 20 acres for the purpose of extracting hard-rock minerals. 
I never will forget when I described what an outrage this was to one of my former colleagues. I was trying to get him to cosponsor the bill with me. When I got through explaining it to him, I said, `Well, will you help me with this?' He said, `No, I am going out west and start staking claims. I didn't know you could do that.' 
If you drive four stakes in the ground you own 20 acres of minerals as long as you want to hold that claim. And you can file as many of them as you want. If at some point you find that there is gold, silver, platinum, palladium, copper--you name it, under that 20 acres, you go to the Department of the Interior, to the BLM. 
Let's say you have 100 acres, five claims, and you want to mine it because you think it has gold under it. If you can convince BLM that, yes, indeed, there is gold under it, they are obligated by law, and have been for 125 years, to give you a deed to that 100 acres for $250 or $500. Some claims go for $2.50 per acre and others go for $5.00 an acre. I will come back to that in a moment. 
The big mining companies usually approach these people that have staked claims and they say, `You know, we think this is a good claim. We will buy that claim from you and we will give you a royalty.' So the farmer in Arizona or Wyoming or Idaho or Montana says, `Here, take it.' The mining companies will usually pay him a substantial royalty. What do they pay the United States, who gave it to him for $5 or for $2.50 an acre? Absolutely nothing. 
Nothing has changed since 1872. The United States has not collected one dime of royalty on the more than 3 million acres that it has deeded away for either $2.50 an acre or $5 an acre. 
Mr. President, I cannot believe I am standing here for the ninth year trying to educate my colleagues on this. But I will say this. The news magazines, from `60 Minutes' to `Prime Time Live' to `20/20', they have all done it. And NBC just as recently as 2 months ago, did a segment on this. 
Is it not strange that we have no compunction about cutting $55 billion out of welfare, $16 billion out of Medicaid for the poorest children's health care in America and $115 billion from Medicare--you can say you are going to take it out of providers. If you take it out of providers, the beneficiaries are going to suffer. An assault, literally, on the most vulnerable people in America--the elderly, the poor, and the children--and allow the biggest mining companies on Earth to buy Federal land with billions of dollars worth of gold under it for $2.50 an acre. The Mineral Policy Center estimates that over the past 125 years we have deeded land containing $243 billion worth of minerals for which we received not one red cent. 
Anybody who thinks this is all conjured up, just check the facts, check with anybody you want to. I have heard every argument under the shining Sun to keep from doing something about this. So, we now have 600 patent applications pending. I have had some partial success in the last 3 years in my efforts to do something about this. We have put a moratorium on the issuance of any additional patents. But we have been doing it on a yearly basis. We first imposed the moratorium in 1995. This moratorium has been renewed the last 2 years. George Miller and I have a bill pending in both the House and Senate that would make that permanent--no more giveaway of the public domain. 
There is not a Senator in this body who has not gone home and told the chamber of commerce and the Rotary Club what a magnificent steward he is of their money, their tax money. And when they run, what do they say? `I'll treat your money like it was my own.' Really? Do they? 
You know, Barrick Resources, which is the biggest gold company in the world pays private landowners substantial royalties. But suggest they pay poor old Uncle Sam, who literally gave them the minerals in the land, suggest they pay him cent farthing, and they come unglued. 
No, we can't do that. 
How about the State of Nevada? Do you pay them anything? 
Oh, yes, we pay Nevada. We pay a severance tax. But Uncle Sugar? Just can't do it. It will cost jobs. 
You think about 260 million people in this country who own those minerals and Congress insisting that they be kept in the dark about what has been going on. Of the 600 patents now pending, we have literally stopped 235 of those. There may be no way legally that we can stop the others. Sooner or later those patents will probably be issued--hopefully for not a lot of gold. If my and George Miller's bill passes this year, there will be no more patents without royalties and reclamation fees mining companies will no longer be able to take a depletion allowance deduction on their tax returns. 
You think about these people getting depletion allowances. The very nature of depletion is to recover your cost of a depleting mineral. Your cost? They do not have any cost. They did not pay anything for it. How can you deplete something you did not pay for? So George Miller and I say, yes, in the future we are going to take this depletion allowance away from you. 
Mr. President, think about this, as we have gone home and told the people, `My No. 1 priority is to balance the budget. I will spend your money like it was my own.' On December 1, 1995, ASARCO received a deed to 349 acres in Arizona. 
Did you know Bruce Babbitt has no choice? It is not up to him. This is the law. He has to comply with the law. So he gives ASARCO a deed, for $1,745--$1,745, that is about how much a Senator makes in a week. For 349 acres they pay $1,745. Do you know the rest of the story? Underneath that 347 acres is $3 billion worth of copper and silver. Do you know what the United States will get in royalties, reclamation fees? Zip, zero, not a dime. 
And then on September 6, 1995, Faxe Kalk, a Danish corporation--incidentally, many of the biggest mining companies including Barrick are foreign. I do not have any objection to that. Barrick is a Canadian company. How would you like to be a miner and go up to Canada and say, `I want to buy a couple of acres of land with billions of dollars worth of minerals. I will give you $10,000 for it.' They would probably put you in jail for being insane. And yet that is what we do. And here is a Danish corporation called Faxe Kalk. They only wanted 110 acres. And Bruce Babbitt had no choice. The law required him to give this Danish corporation a deed for that land for $275, about 1 day's pay for a U.S. Senator. And what do you think it had under it? One billion dollars worth of travertine. So for $275 we gave them $1 billion, and what did we get in return in for the $1 billion? Zip, zero, nothing. 
On May 10, 1994, American Barrick, as I said the biggest gold mining operation probably in the world, received 1,800 acres of land in Nevada. They paid $9,000--$5 an acre--for that 1,800 acres and they got $11 billion worth of gold. 
The Stillwater Mining Co. in Montana has not received a full patent yet. They have what is called a first half certificate, but they are one of the companies that had to be grandfathered in the moratorium, and Stillwater wants about 2,000 acres in Montana. 
But Stillwater Mining Co: and this is in their prospectus. These are not my figures. This is what they say-- for 2,000 acres, for which they will pay $10,000--$5 an acre--they get $38 billion worth of palladium and platinum--their figures--and the U.S. taxpayer gets nothing. 
Mr. President, these things are literally unbelievable. I have made this speech here for 9 years, and I must say that while for a long, long time it fell on deaf ears, it is now getting to the point where Senators--and I do not want to make this a partisan issue, but Senators on that side of the aisle with the exception of six or seven have stood fast to continue this, and the time is coming because of all these news magazine stories where you are going to see 30-second spots next fall on how people voted to give away the public domain. I can see a spot now saying, did you know so and so voted to continue the giveaway of gold and minerals? Did you know we have given away $243 billion worth of gold, silver, platinum, and so on, in the past 125 years, and he votes to continue that. They haul out all the votes that we have had on amendments that I have offered on this floor just in the last 3 years. The Mineral Policy Center said of the $243 billion worth of gold, silver, et cetera, that we have given away in the past 125 years, if we had the kind of royalty which George Miller and I have in our bill the taxpayers would have received $12 billion. 
Mr. President, I would like to summarize the legislation that I and Congressman Miller have introduced. Mining companies would have to pay a 5-percent net smelter return royalty for operations on public land. Now, this is another dimension that I have not mentioned, and that is a lot of people in this country are mining claims on Federal lands that have not been patented. Once you patent it, they give you a deed for it and it is yours. But there are a lot of minerals being mined in this country on unpatented lands though they are Federal lands. They do not pay any royalty either. So that net smelter return is on unpatented lands and it is predicted to save $175 million over the next 5 years. 
A second part of the legislation is a claim maintenance fee. Until about 5 years ago, when you filed a claim, you had to submit some proof to BLM that you had done some work on it. You could go out there with a pick and shovel and work for about an hour, and then you sent it into the BLM and said I worked hard on my claim and I still haven't found anything. That was enough to renew it. 
About 4 years ago I finally got this body and the Congress to put a $100 annual fee on these claims, 20-acre claims. That is $5 an acre a year to hold the claim. We had 800,000 claims at that time. We now have 330,000, which shows you that people were just 
willy-nilly filing claims hoping that Barrick or some other big gold mining company would come by and make an offer for it. Isn't it interesting that very seldom does a major mining company ever find this stuff. They buy the claim from some old nester who has had it for 50 or 100 years. They do not go out and explore for it until after they buy the claim. Now, they have a pretty good idea of what is there, but what they do is they buy claims from a guy who has owned it for the last 20 to 50 years and give him a royalty and yet they say they cannot give us one. 
But in any event, our bill continues the $100 annual fee on existing claims, and we make it $125 on new claims. So if anybody goes out and files a claim under this bill for 20 acres, the new fee will be $125. And that is only on unpatented lands, of course. Then we have a reclamation fee that ranges on a sliding scale from 2 percent to 5 percent of net income depending on the profitability of the company. Mr. President, you cannot charge a royalty to somebody who already owns the land even though we gave it to them. You take American Barrick that just in 1994 got $11 billion worth of gold. It is theirs. You cannot charge somebody for mining on their own property. But you can charge a reclamation fee, and we calculate that is worth $750 million over the next 5 years. Do we need a reclamation fee? The Bureau of Mines says there are 250,000--listen to this--sites on BLM land that have been abandoned and need to be reclaimed, 2,000 claims in national parks, if you can believe it--abandoned, and the Mineral Policy Center says there are 557,000 mines that have been abandoned in this country on both public and private lands--557,000 mine sites that need to be cleaned up. Do you know what they estimate the cost of cleaning them up to be? Somewhere between $32.7 billion and $71.5 billion. 
So here we have given away 3 million acres that had $243 billion worth of gold, silver, platinum, and palladium under it, and what have we gotten in return? We have gotten 250,000 sites that we have to clean up on BLM sites and 2,000 in the national parks. Sometimes I have a hard time believing my own words. If I did not do so much research on this all the time, I would not believe it. So why not charge a reclamation fee and say we are at least going to start cleaning up these sites. 
Now, these people not only get the land for $2.50 per acre, they not only get $1 billion worth of gold for which they pay the U.S. Government not one cent, they also leave an unmitigated environmental disaster. Listen to this; 59 of the sites on the Superfund National Priority List are directly related to hardrock mining. Who could argue that we need to charge a reclamation fee to help reclaim the hundreds of thousands of acres that have been abandoned by the mining companies. 
And finally, Mr. President, I have already alluded to the fact that our bill contains a fourth provision and that is a depletion allowance repeal. I forget exactly what it is. I think it is 15 percent for gold, for silver and copper, and 22 percent for palladium and platinum. We have always allowed depletion on oil because it was a depleting resource, gas because it was a depleting resource, and, yes, a depletion allowance on private land would make some sense. But to allow people to get land from the U.S. Government for virtually nothing, leave us an unmitigated disaster to clean up, and then get a 15 to 22 percent depletion allowance to deplete a resource that they paid nothing for. That is absurd. 
Congressman Miller and I will be working very hard to pass this bill this year. I would like to think that the time has come when Senators did not feel they could just accommodate their good friends. They are my good friends, too. Some of the people I debate this with--and the debate could get very loud and raucous--are my best friends. It is kind of like trial lawyers. Trial lawyers fight all day long and go out to dinner together. I have done that, too. This is not aimed at anybody individually. This is aimed at trying to bring some fundamental fairness to what simply is so intolerable it cannot be tolerated any longer. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BUMPERS. It is my expectation that the funds that were included for the Rural Utilities Service in the emergency funding bill will be used for a variety of disaster-related purposes, including providing assistance to communities, such as Gettysburg, to address emergency drinking water needs. It appears to me, based on your description of the problem, that the city of Gettysburg could qualify for some of these funds.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, in 1866, Congress passed a mining law called Revised Statute 2477. Here is what it said: 
The right-of-way for the construction of public highways across public lands, not reserved for public uses, is hereby granted. 
That was the law until 1976 when we repealed it. And we repealed it because there are literally thousands and thousands of potential rights-of-way, which the States could claim for purposes of building a highway across Federal lands. In 1988, Donald Hodel, who was the Secretary of the Interior at the time, established a policy. Listen to this: 
Under that policy, a right-of-way could be established by mowing high vegetation, by moving a few rocks, by filling in low spots. 
The State of Alaska has passed a law making every section-line in the State a right-of-way, over 900,000 miles. Here is the kicker, Mr. President. These rights-of-way would cross national parks, wilderness areas, national monuments, and other protected areas. These highways cross all of those areas that we have since taken out of the public domain and made national parks and other reserved areas. 
If we don't pass this amendment, every State--but particularly Alaska, Utah, and Idaho--will have the right to build roads on every one of those claimed rights-of-way, according to the language of the Stevens amendment. This issue is not an emergency. To hold the people in the Dakotas and Arkansas and other States hostage for something as foolish as this is, would be foolish in the extreme.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, for Members of this body who have not dealt with this issue on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, this is a slightly complex amendment. I am going to simplify it as best I can. We have had several hearings in the Energy Committee on it, but it deals with an issue that sounds so bizarre you would not believe it was actually on the statute books of this country. 
In 1866, Congress passed a bill which has become popularly known as R.S. 2477, Revised Statute 2477. What that law did, as part of the 1866 mining law, was to validate public highways built across unreserved public lands. 
That does not mean much, so here it is. The United States owns 350 million acres of land in the lower 48 States. Since 1866, we have set aside millions and millions of acres in wilderness areas, national parks, monuments, all kind of things since 1866. But bear in mind, the R.S. 2477 statute said `unreserved lands,' so that meant all of the public lands the United States owns that have not been set aside for another purpose. The effect of that, of course, was, from 1866 until 1976 when it was repealed, anybody who claimed a footpath, almost a cow trail, a sled trail, hiking trails, almost anything would qualify as a highway under the language in this bill. 
A lot of highways were built under these R.S. 2477 rights-of-way between 1866 and 1976, and we are not contesting a single one of those. 
What we are saying is, the provision put in this bill by the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] simply says we are going to let State law determine what is and is not a public, valid right-of-way. 
This, admittedly, is primarily an Alaska, Utah, and probably Idaho issue. It does not affect my State. There are some of the Western States that have these rights-of-way. But in any event, here is what the law said as we passed it in 1866. `[T]he right-of-way for the construction of public highways across public lands, not reserved for public uses, is hereby granted.' 
As I say, that includes dogsled trails, that includes footpaths, it includes any kind of a path. And there are literally thousands and thousands of them that have been claimed. 
Mr. President, I will come back to how the language in this bill will work in just a moment. But listen to this. The State of Alaska has passed a law making every section line in Alaska a right-of-way and subject to having a highway built on it. I am reluctant to say this, but if you build on just half the rights-of-way that Alaska is claiming, you would not be able to travel. There would be too many roads to get around. 
In any event, I want to make it crystal clear that this amendment has nothing to do with existing highways that have been built under the 1866 law. 
Mr. President, there have never been regulations crafted to deal with this issue. In the 1930's there was sort of a half-hearted regulation, but not really anything. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BUMPERS. Now, Mr. President, I want to make another point crystal clear, and it is this: When I said a moment ago that the effect of this amendment would allow State law to determine what constitutes a valid existing right-of-way, it would take away the Secretary of the Interior's ability to determine what was a highway. In short, all of these thousands and thousands of so-called R.S. 2477 right-of-way claims all over the West would become valid. 
Now, bear in mind, there is another facet to this, and that is the Secretary in January of this year set out a policy which effectively repealed a policy established by Donald Hodel when he was Secretary of Interior in 1988. The Hodel policy--it is not a regulation; we have never had a rule or regulation, it was simply a policy statement--was that just about anything could qualify as a highway. 
Now, whether the Hodel policy stated that the States shall have exclusive rights to determine what a right-of-way is, I do not really know right now, but I can tell you, if section 310 passes, State law will determine what is going to happen to thousands of rights-of-way in this country that cross national parks, wilderness areas, monuments, and any other land in the West that was set aside after these claimed rights-of-way existed. 
Let me give an example. Assume that there are 20 rights-of-way that the State of California would claim cross Yosemite National Park. They claim those rights-of-way were established before Yosemite became a national park. It was unreserved Federal land before, and these rights-of-way were across that Federal land. Later on, we establish Yosemite National Park. Under this section, if the Stevens language stays in this bill, which has absolutely no business being in this bill, but if my amendment is defeated, that means that California law will dictate what highways can be built across Yosemite National Park--not the National Park Service, not the Federal Government, but the State of California. 
Think of all the thousands of rights-of-way that could be claimed in Alaska. Mr. President, just for openers, here are some of the claims that have been filed. These are not all the claims that Alaska, Utah, Idaho, and other States have as to what constitutes a valid right-of-way. These are the ones that have actually been filed with the Secretary of Interior and requested to be declared an existing valid right-of-way on which they can build a four-lane superhighway, if they desire. Alaska has 256 claims on file, but they have God knows how many--thousands that they could claim. Idaho has 2,026 on file, and Utah has 6,173 claims filed in the Secretary's office. Those are a lot of potential highways across Federal lands, and the Federal Government could not stop them no matter what kind of highway they wanted to build. 
When I started off telling you how bizarre this was, just think about that. When we held our first hearing in the Energy Committee on what to do about these so-called R.S. 2477 rights-of-way, I may have been dense, but it took me a long time to understand that we were really talking about something serious. I never heard of anything so bizarre in my life. Yet, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee--we all represent our States, and I am not holding him guilty of anything. I am just saying the rest of us do not have to follow suit. He is chairman of the committee and he puts this in a supplemental appropriations bill designed to aid areas hurt by natural disasters, including help for the people of Arkansas. There is $6.5 million for debris removal in streams as a result of a tornado on March 1 in Arkansas. There is $3.5 million in this bill to allow an all-black community just outside Little Rock to tie into the Little Rock sewer system. Virtually the entire community of College Station was wiped out, a community of less than 500 people, and they cannot build new homes or borrow money to build new homes until they get on the sewer system. And 
the chairman, very graciously, and the committee, very graciously, accepted my amendment to put $3.5 million in there to accomplish that. How many nights did we look at the Dakotas and Minnesota, which was a veritable lake? 
Mr. President, do you know the name of the bill we are considering? It is the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. The R.S. 2477 issue is no emergency. The language I am trying to strike was put in there and it had nothing to do with any kind of disaster or emergency. It was put in there to accommodate primarily the States of Alaska, Utah, and Idaho. I have nothing against any of those States, but I tell you what I do have, I do have a strong feeling about protecting the citizens of this country and the Federal lands which they all own. Some of it is in my State--admittedly, not as much as in Alaska and some Western States--but every single Member of the U.S. Senate has a solemn obligation, occasionally, to stand on their hind legs and say no to such things as this. 
Every Senator has or will have a letter on his desk from Secretary Babbitt saying he will strongly urge the President to veto this $8 billion bill if this provision is left in it. Why wouldn't he? My point is, why are we, U.S. Senators, holding the people of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota hostage to an amendment that should not be on this bill? It is not an emergency. It is not even an appropriations measure. 
Mr. President, I get terribly exercised about things like this because I think I have a solemn duty to bring this to the attention of the Senate. In January of this year, Secretary Babbitt, not popular with Western Senators--but that has nothing to do with this amendment. What it does have to do with this amendment is whether or not we are going to allow every single State who can identify a pig trail that was used by human occupants any time between 1866 and 1976, across lands that have subsequently been made national parks, monuments, and wilderness areas, whether we are going to allow those States to determine that those trails are now highways and then build highways on them with no input from the Secretary. 
So Secretary Babbitt, in January of this year, issued a policy--not a rule, not a regulation, but a policy. Here is what his policy said. It defines a highway to be `a thoroughfare used by the public for the passage of vehicles carrying people or goods.' Now, Secretary Babbitt's policy also allows for the abdication of State law to the extent consistent with Federal law, which, of course, makes Federal law dominant, as it should be. 
Nobody is trying to punish Alaska. Nobody is trying to punish Idaho. Nobody is trying to punish Utah. What we are trying to do is say these sacred parks and monuments that we have developed over the years--Yellowstone, Yosemite, Bryce Canyon, Saguaro, you name it--you cannot let the States just walk in and willy-nilly start building highways across those places. If you do not vote for my amendment, that is precisely what you are voting for. 
Mr. President, I hope the Senate will pay attention to this issue--as I say, this is an arcane issue. Most people in this country do not have a clue that a law such as R.S. 2477 ever existed. I want to get help to the people of my State who have been devastated by tornadoes. I want to get help to people in California who have suffered from floods, to the Dakotas and Minnesota, one of the most awesome things we have ever watched on television. This bill is designed to help them. That is what a compassionate, caring government does. 
One of the reasons I voted against the constitutional amendment to balance the budget is because it would have prohibited the Congress from appropriating money to help people who had suffered that kind of disaster because it would unbalance the budget. You could not do it without a 60 percent vote of both Houses, and if you did not get it, they just suffered. That is what would happen a lot of times. 
I am not going to belabor this. I have made the point as well as I can. I see the junior Senator from Alaska on the floor. I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I had a Senator ask me earlier if I felt that I was right about this amendment. Let me answer that question for any Senator who would ask the same question. I have never felt more comfortable with a position in my life than I do on this. It has nothing to do with Alaska or Utah or Idaho. What it has to do with is saying this language of the senior Senator from Alaska, No. 1, has no business in this bill; No. 2, if it did, it is a terrible amendment; No. 3, men and women of good will could sit down and work out a sensible policy for the Department of the Interior and require them to report back to us with regulations or something else. 
But under the existing law, what the amendment of the Senator from Alaska does is to return the determination of whether these thousands and hundreds of thousands of miles of claimed rights-of-way constitute a highway within the definition of the Hodel policy. It is a question of whether or not we are going to allow rights-of-way simply because they were claimed to be there before 1976 when we repealed R.S. 2477, whether we are going to allow the use of those rights-of-way to cross wilderness areas, national parks, monuments, all kinds of protected Federal areas. 
I submit to you that the people of this country, if they knew 
the substance of this debate, that we were actually considering the Stevens amendment to this bill, if they knew what the implications of that were, they would be up in arms. I cannot believe--not to denigrate my good friends from these Western States who have a deep and abiding interest, an understandable and deep and abiding interest, in this issue--I cannot believe that more than 3 percent of the people of this country would condone granting applications for highways across these areas because there was some kind of a footpath or a trail or something else, even vegetation that had been tromped down. 
Under the Hodel policy in 1988, Donald Hodel had a policy that said: If you have cut high vegetation, you had a lot of weeds and you cut them down, that constitutes a highway. 
Have you ever heard anything as ridiculous as that in your life?

Mr. BUMPERS. Let me answer the question this way, Senator. I did not hear a single soul complain when Donald Hodel established his policy in 1988. It is only the Babbitt policy of 1997 that seems to be objectionable. 
There is no question, if you want to raise the question about the authority of the Secretary to issue a policy, if Secretary Hodel has the right to issue a policy, why does his successor, Bruce Babbitt, in 1997, not have the right to reverse that policy? 
Let me go ahead and say that the Senator quoted the Hodel policy correctly, but he did not go quite far enough. Here is what Donald Hodel's policy said about the requirements needed to prove what constitutes construction of a highway: `Construction is a physical act of readying the highway for use by the public according to the available or intended mode of transportation, foot, horse, vehicle, et cetera.' Horse--that is right--vehicle, foot, those all constitute highways. 
His policy goes on to say, here are some examples of what constitutes construction of a highway: `removing high vegetation.' Go out and cut the weeds, it becomes a highway. `Move a few large rocks out of the way,' it becomes a highway, or `filling in low spots'--all of those may be sufficient to show construction for a particular use. 
Now, Senator, let me ask you a question, does that make any sense to you?

Mr. BUMPERS. He revoked a policy that said any time you mow high weeds, apply to us and we will give you a right-of-way to build a four-lane highway over that footpath. Move a few rocks out of the way, we will consider that a highway and allow you to build on it. Fill in a few low spots, we will make it a highway and you build it. Even if it is across a national park or across a wilderness area or across a national monument, a historic area that we have set aside. Can you think of anything more insane than giving States the right to build highways across Federal lands no matter where they are, simply because somebody mowed some high weeds or because somebody moved a few rocks?

Simply because somebody drove a covered wagon or group of covered wagons over land heading west, or it was a footpath used by people who walked on it, to suggest those paths now constitute a highway, simply by mowing weeds on it, by moving a few rocks and showing that you did some construction, how foolish can we be?

Mr. BUMPERS. I want to make two points, one to the junior Senator from Alaska. When he talks about how Bruce Babbitt did all of this behind closed doors last year--with no consultation--last year, the Senator will recall that we tried our very best through a public process to come up with a definition of these roads. As a matter of fact, the Secretary went through the process 
of trying to develop a rule as to what a road was, issued it for public comment, got over 3,000 comments, and the Senators from Alaska went ballistic and said, `No, we do not want any part of that. We are not about to let you.' You remember when we blocked him from proceeding further with that. 
Then you come here today saying this should have been done in a more sensible way, when it was the Senators from that side of the aisle who stopped him from doing it.

Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator has no right to complain. He says to the Secretary, `No, no, no.' He should not come to this floor squawking, because he stopped the Secretary from trying to come up with some kind of a sensible rule. 
So, in 1997, and I have been trying to get to this for about 15 minutes, here is the policy that the Secretary of the Interior issued. It is a good, sane, sensible policy. If the Stevens amendment on this bill stays in, he torpedoes this policy of 1997, and we go back to the abomination called the Hodel rule. 
Now, you choose. If you think the Hodel rule was right--as I say, by moving a few stones, mowing a little grass, anything to try to make it look like you have been doing a little construction, or you listen to the policy developed by Secretary Babbitt, and here is the first item: 
An entity wishing the Secretary or any agencies of the Department of Interior to make a determination as to whether R.S. 2477 right-of-way exists shall file a written request with the Interior agency having jurisdiction over the lands underlying the asserted right-of-way, along with an explanation of why there is a compelling and immediate need for such a determination. 
Surely, nobody objects to that. 
The request should be accompanied by documents and maps that the entity wishes the agency to consider in making its recommendations to the Secretary. If, based on the information provided, the agency does not believe a compelling and immediate need for the determination exists, it should, without further examination, recommend the Secretary defer processing until final rules are effective. 
That is the policy, `until final rules are effective,' and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. 
No. 2, `The agencies shall consult the public land records, maintained by BLM to determine the status of the lands over which the claimed right-of-way passes. If such lands were withdrawn'--that means the Federal Government took the lands out and made a wilderness area of them, or a national park or some other Federal purpose; that is what is called reserving the lands--`if they determine that these lands have been withdrawn by the Federal Government or otherwise made unavailable pursuant to R.S. 2477 at the time the highway giving rise to the claim was allegedly constructed and remained unavailable through October 21, 1976, the agencies will recommend the Secretary deny the claim.' 
Now, all that says is, if this was not a claim for an existing right-of-way prior to the time we repealed R.S. 2477, it should be denied. Nobody would argue with that. That is the reason we repealed R.S. 2477, was to stop the nonsense. 
No. 3, `If the lands were not withdrawn, reserved or otherwise available'--now, that means that the Federal Government had not taken the land and used it for some other purpose such as a national park, `the agency will examine all able documents and maps and perform an on-site examination to determine whether construction on the alleged right-of-way had occurred prior to the repeal of R.S. 2477 on October 21, 1976.' 
Again, the agency will deny the claim if it had not been a right-of-way prior to the repeal of 2477. 
No. 4, Highway: `The agency shall evaluate whether the alleged right-of-way constitutes a highway.' 
Here is the key to this whole thing. `A highway is a thoroughfare used prior to October 21, 1976.' 
That is the date of the repeal. An alleged right-of-way constitutes a highway if it was a thoroughfare prior to the repeal of 2477. 
If the agency determines that the alleged right-of-way does not constitute a highway, the agency will deny the claim. Why shouldn't they? That is the reason we repealed it. We don't want any claims coming in on highways that were not in existence at the time we repealed the law.

All he is saying is that in this ruling the State law will apply as long as it is consistent with Federal law. To do anything else, to issue a rule of any other kind, gives the States carte blanche over all unreserved Federal land. They will decide what a right-of-way is. They will decide which ones they want to build roads on. 
Finally, `The agency will make recommendations on the above-described issues to the Secretary, and the Secretary will approve or disapprove of those recommendations.'

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I don't think many minds are being changed with this debate. I don't see any reason to pursue it because we have a 180-degree difference of opinion on it. I personally think that the law is fairly clear on it. The policy of Donald Hodel is clear. He didn't consult with the public. He consulted with the two Senators from Alaska and the Governor of Alaska, and perhaps some other Senators from the West, which is understandable. The only reason I know that is not because I know it for a fact. It is just that I know he issued a policy that was very pleasing to those Senators.

Mr. BUMPERS. I have to make this point one more time. The Senator talks about Don Hodel consulting with everybody. Bruce Babbitt had 3,000 comments from the public. Why is it that Don Hodel with a few Republican Senators and Congressmen around him developed a policy--why was that so wonderful with a few people sitting behind a closed door to decide the policy, and Bruce Babbitt gets 3,000 comments? And what happens? The first thing that happens is an amendment on an emergency supplemental, which has absolutely no business being there, to stop him from implementing a ruling. Three thousand people have commented on it. 
It just depends on whose ox is being gored. We all know that.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, as a part of the Earth Day celebration, I am, once again, introducing legislation to reform the concessions policies of the National Park Service. This bill is very similar to a bill I sponsored in the 103d Congress--listen to this--which passed the Senate 90 to 9 and passed the House 386 to 30, but it is not yet law. It repeals the 1965 Concessions Policy Act which has been over a 30-year-old outrage. 
My legislation would establish an open competitive process for awarding concessions contracts in units of the National Park System. It will be a competitive process for the first time. These contracts are very lucrative the way they are let under the 1965 act, and the American people are getting shafted and have been for a very long time. 
Instead of putting the money that we get today back into the Treasury for general purposes, under my bill, the money we get from the contracts will go to a special account for the use of the National Park Service, and Lord only knows every study shows they need it. 
This will be the 18th year that I have worked to reform the concession policies of this country. The very first oversight hearing I ever held upon becoming chairman of the Parks Subcommittee in 1979 was on this very issue. One has to have a lot of patience to operate around here. 
Since that time, there has been no telling how many reports, hearings, markups, floor debates there have been. Everybody agrees the existing law ought to be changed, but in 18 years, with the most diligent efforts I can put into it, it has not been changed, simply because the park concessioners have more clout with some Members of the Senate than have I. They have more clout than the American people have with the U.S. Senate. 
Mr. President, let me just tell you what has been happening. 
In 1995--that is the latest year for which we have complete information on these concession contracts--in 1995, the United States received just under $16 million in franchise fees on gross concession revenues of $676 million, a whopping 2.4-percent return. 
These contracts are almost handed down from generation to generation. They probably put them in their will and give them to their first-born son. It is almost impossible to undo one. But the U.S. taxpayer had a 2.4 percent return on $676 million of national park concessions fees last year. 
In all fairness, let me add this. Under the existing law, a concessioner can also make improvements in the parks in consultation and agreement with the National Park Service. He can make improvements, he might even build a new hotel--all kinds of things like that--and he is entitled then to take that into consideration as a part of his fee. But even when you add that in, even when you add in the amount that concessioners spend to improve the park, which, incidentally, is to their benefit because it invariably increases revenues, that increases the amount we received to $40 million on $676 million, still only a 5.9-percent return. 
You can invest in a T-bill and do as well, but this is our land, our property, the reason tourists go there and spend their money, because it is a park that Congress, in its infinite wisdom, established. Any property owner in the United States should ask yourself this question: Would you lease your property out for that kind of return when it was producing that kind of revenue for the lessee? You would not even consider it. 
A 5.9-percent return we are getting now is better than we have received in the past, but listen to this, just to show you how ridiculous the current policy is. You will recall that Matsushita bought MCA, which owned the Yosemite Park and Curry Co., the concessioner at Yosemite. So Matsushita, when they bought this company, inherited the concessions contract at Yosemite, which produces the most concessions revenue of any park in the United States. 
This will show what happens when you have competition. The people in this place, incidentally, are supposed to believe in capitalism. They believe in competition. They believe if you leave it to the marketplace, everything will work out just hunky-dory, except, it seems, for mining and concessions. 
So, here was a contract that Matsushita gave up, and whoever got the new contract was going to have to pay off a $62 million note. 
What happened in this contract, Matsushita gave up the contract, the National Park Foundation took it for 1 day just for transition purposes, and then Delaware North bid and was awarded the new contract, the first time, I believe, in the history of the National Park Service, since the old law, that a contract had been let competitively. 
Would you like to know what happened? The year before this contract was let, the taxpayers got a return from the Yosemite concessions operations of three-quarters of 1 percent. And the first year--the first year--Delaware North had it under the new, actually competitively let contract; on over $80 million of gross revenues, the taxpayers received about a 16-percent return. 
Why, Mr. President, do we continue to beat this dog about how important it is to rebuild these facilities in the parks and give a concessioner credit for it and all that? 
My bill eliminates the anticompetitive measures of the 1965 act, but it also recognizes that all concessions are not the same. 
People come to me and say, `How about the small operators? They're struggling to make ends meet.' Under my bill small family operations grossing less than $500,000 a year would retain a preference to renew their contracts--so would outfitters and guide operators. Even though they are not a major share of the revenue, we probably exempt 80 to 90 percent of the concession operations because most of them are admittedly rather small. But my bill ensures that there will be open competition for the large contracts which generate over 90 percent of the total concessions revenue. 
As I have already pointed out, the revenues that we get under this bill will go straight into a special account to be used by the National Park Service, similar to the entrance fee legislation just enacted last Congress. 
Mr. President, one of the major changes that is made in this bill is the elimination of what is known as possessory interest. And here is the way it has been working. A concessioner goes to the National Park Service--this is just a hypothetical case--and says, `We want to build a hotel for $10 million.' They work out the deal and the Park Service approves it. 
What happens at that point is, they start depreciating that hotel. Any businessman does that, of course. So the concessioner starts depreciating this $10 million hotel over a 30- or 40-year period, whatever the IRS requires--let us assume it is a 40-year depreciation--and at the end of 20 years he has depreciated $5 million and has $5 million left to recover. 
Under existing law, he is entitled to receive whatever he can get for that hotel. If he surrenders the contract, or is kicked out, or for any other reason, loses his contract, he can receive literally the fair market value of the hotel, which may very well be $15 million. He only paid $10 million, he has a tax deduction of $5 million, and he can turn right around and sell it for $15 million and make that an obligation of the next concessioner. 
How much nonsense can you put in one law? You think about that. Now, you talk about a bird's nest on the ground, that is possessory interest. 
Mr. President, there is one other provision in the old law that is equally as egregious. And that is the preferential right an incumbent concessioner gets to renew his contract. Another hypothetical case--you have a 15-year contract, we will say, in Yellowstone National Park. At the end of the 15 years, the Park Service will put out a notice to anybody who might be interested to let them know if they would like to bid on the concessions operation at Yellowstone. 
So let us assume that I would kind of like to have the Yellowstone contract, so I go to the Park Service and say, `I would like to bid on this.' And the Park Service says, `That's just jakey. You go ahead and bid. Tell us what you would give us for it.' But let me tell you something, whatever you bid, the guy who has the contract now is entitled meet your bid, and if so, he gets it. 
You tell me, why would I spend a half-million dollars or whatever it takes preparing a bid on something as significant as the concessions in Yelowstone National Park, knowing that the person who has that contract now need only meet my bid? 
He may have paid a 2-percent return to the Federal Government last year. I may be willing to pay 10 percent. And the incumbent 
concessioner knows what the contract is worth. So he comes in and says, `Well, I'll give you 10 percent, too.' So I ask you, if you are a businessman, who in his right mind is going to go out there and spend a lot of money preparing a bid, knowing that the person who has the contract right now only need match your bid? 
I hear a lot of talk on the floor of the Senate about good old capitalism and good old competition and how it solves all problems. This is the most egregious policy I can imagine and yet it has been going on for years and years. 
But if we pass this bill it will not go on any more. 
Mr. President, we have made some progress through the efforts of the administration. However, they have gone about as far as they can go just doing things by regulation. They cannot do very much more. But I give a lot of credit to Bruce Babbitt and President Clinton for at least trying to bring some equity into this without changing the law. 
But you know, we have a lot of Senators here who have good friends who had the concession contract on some park in their State for 40 years, and they just cannot see fit to change the law. 
You know, the other night I was watching some show on NBC about mining and how egregious our mining policies are. I have worked on that for about 8 years. And I think this year may finally be the year because it is getting to be a kind of a political hot potato for people who are not from mining States to continue to allow that kind of ripoff, rape, and pillage of the taxpayers. But I can tell you it is not a bit worse than this concessions policy we have had for all these years.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, in 1982, when this body adopted the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, we set, as the distinguished chairman of the committee has said, the amount the utilities would pay to build a permanent repository at 1 mill per kilowatt hour. In 14 years, we have collected $8 billion. The total cost of the program is $34 billion. The utilities' share of that cost is $27 billion. So we are looking for the 1 mill fee to produce $27 billion. The defense program's share is $7 billion. The interest on the excess that sits in the Treasury is expected to make up the balance. 
In 14 years, the Secretary of Energy has had the discretion, which we gave the Secretary, to raise this 1 mill fee to whatever it would take to pay the utilities' share of the program's cost. In 14 years, he or she has never seen fit to raise it. There is no point in tinkering with it now because it is working fine. 
If there ever was a case where we are trying to fix a problem that does not exist, this is it. Leave the law as it is. We are adding $2 billion to the $27 billion cost now with the Murkowski bill. That is going to up the ante $2 billion. One mill is fine for now. The utilities are happy with it. It is producing the amount of money we want. There is absolutely no reason for this amendment. I do not think we will have to raise it, but we might. 
Mr. President, I yield back such time as I have.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I compliment my distinguished friend from North Dakota on his very prescient remarks, which I think are right on target. I listened to a lot of the debate today on the question of taxation, and I must say I find it puzzling. I do not really mean this, but I say quite often that I wish everybody had the opportunity to live through the Depression. My brother and sister and I were lucky. We had something to eat. We also had devoted parents and that makes up for a multitude of problems. However, not everyone is as fortunate. Some people need a helping hand. 
Nobody likes the idea of taxes. I coughed up a sizable amount yesterday to the IRS. I did not particularly enjoy it. But I have never begrudged the taxes I paid, even though, as a U.S. Senator, I see a lot of waste. I see money misspent. I see priorities misplaced. And sometimes it is kind of a bitter pill to swallow. But I can not accept the idea that some Senators that have propounded today that somehow there is something unholy and evil about paying taxes. As Justice Holmes said, taxes are 
necessary `to make our society a civilized one.' To complain about the taxes we pay in order to live in a civilized society is unfathomable to me. 
My brother, who is my best friend, does not like to pay taxes. I keep reminding him the thing he and my sister and I had that a lot of children did not have when we were growing up, is that we chose our parents well. A lot of children do not have that luxury. The fact is that the Federal Government has done a tremendous amount of good with our tax funds. I think about the house we lived in and the fact that the water well was only about 10 steps away from the outhouse, and people died of typhoid fever in the summertime and we could not figure out why. All of a sudden, Franklin Roosevelt was elected President, the first President of the United States who began to treat the South as a part of the United States and not as a conquered nation. So, we began to get paved streets, running water, indoor plumbing, electricity, natural gas, housing, medical help, free shots against typhoid fever and smallpox at the schoolhouse, by a nurse paid for by those insidious taxes that we pay. 
Mr. President, if I could just list all of the things that have happened since I was 10 years old, that have made us the great Nation we are, not one single Member of the U.S. Senate would take any of them back--not one. I am thinking about the housing programs we have, the farm programs we have, the medical research that we do, the medical help we give people. I think about the bank insurance fund. If we had not had the FSLIC fund when the S&L's were all going broke, you think about what a catastrophe that would have been in this country. That is what happened during the Depression, the banks went broke. And my mother, who had carefully saved $1,100 selling cream and eggs and chickens on Saturday, lost every nickel of it when the bank went under. And she grieved about it until her dying day. 
Who would turn their back on the environmental improvements we have made in this country? Mr. President, 65 percent of the streams were unfishable and unswimmable. Now 65 percent are swimmable and fishable, and nobody here wants to do anything but go to 100 percent clean water and air for our children and grandchildren yet to come. 
I could go on with many other things the Government has done to benefit us all. For instance, we have dammed the rivers that used to flood every spring. My mother and father used to go down to the Arkansas River every April, see people straggling along the road who had lost their homes and all their possessions, pick them up, take them home, keep them for a couple of nights until the water receded, and take them back to the area they had called their homes. We dammed the Arkansas River. It not only provides navigation but recreation and flood control. And people in those same areas of Arbuckle Island do not have to worry about it anymore. 
And now some in Congress want a constitutional amendment that would require a two-thirds vote to raise taxes. You could not even correct a mistake with less than two-thirds of the vote. You could not close a tax loophole with less than two-thirds of the vote. It would favor the wealthy, who would be assured their taxes would never go up. And it would be a terrible disservice to the people who rely on Government services--yes, even welfare recipients. Like I say, everybody did not have Bill and Lattie Bumpers for parents. 
We talk about family values. I have the three greatest children and the greatest family a man could have. I know all about family values. I put mine up against those of anybody in the world. Yet you and I know there are a lot of children in this country who would be better off almost anyplace than where they are. 
So, I believe in helping these children. We keep on building more prisons and spending $25,000 a year for every person we 
incarcerate, and if we had given that child an education at roughly half the cost, he would not be in prison. When I was Governor I used to go to the prisons and talk, sit and have lunch with them, interview them, talk to them. I never met one with a college degree, though there probably were a few. I never met one who owned his own home. I didn't meet very many who did not come from a broken home. 
Mr. President, I stand here on April 15 and we are still without a budget. Instead, we are wasting the peoples' time with a debate between the Democrats and Republicans about taxes. So far as I am concerned, the whole country loses with that debate. If you really want to restore confidence in the American political system and you want to stop the alienation of people's attitudes toward Congress and what goes on here, do two things: Balance the budget and change the way you finance campaigns. Anybody who thinks a democracy can survive when the laws we pass and the people we elect are totally dependent on how much money we put on it is dreaming. 
And, if you want to stop alienation and really cause people to dance in the streets, balance the budget. In 1981, Fritz Hollings, Bill Bradley and Dale Bumpers were the only three Senators who voted for Ronald Reagan's spending cuts and against his tax cuts. I can show you absolute documented proof, if everybody had voted that way we would have had a balanced budget in 1985. But, no, the herd instinct swept across this body and we voted for those massive tax cuts that guaranteed the budget was going to go out of control. And it did. Just as I screamed from this very spot in 1981. 
Here we are, back to the same old stand. It reminds me of trying to housebreak my little dog. I just could not do it. His memory was just too short. And he is not alone. The memories of people in this body are awful short, too. Nobody seems to remember how we got an additional $3 trillion in debt from 1981 to 1992. 
So, it is nonsense to talk about a two-thirds vote to raise taxes. Even the Articles of Confederation, which started out by saying you have to have 9 of 13 States agree to raise taxes before you can do it, had to be changed because they knew that would not work. 
Mr. President, I have tried to make two points today. As I have said many times before, if it had not been for a generous, compassionate, caring Government, who had taxes to pay for my education on the GI bill, I would not be standing here right now. I have been trying to pay back this great Nation, the oldest democracy on Earth, with an organic law which we call the Constitution; next to the Holy Bible the most sacred to me. And every time we get in a tough political spot somebody says, `Well, let's amend the Constitution.' When I think about some of the people here trying to tinker with what Ben Franklin and James Madison and John Adams and Alexander Hamilton did, crafted the greatest document and delivered under that document the greatest Nation, the greatest democracy on Earth, and people are constantly trying to destroy it, undo it--I shudder when I hear some of my colleagues wanting to undo what the greatest assemblage of minds ever assembled under one roof did to bring this all about. 
What do they want to do? Make it impossible to raise taxes because the rich would have to pay. I am not going to be caught voting to cut Medicare and welfare and Medicaid and have somebody come to me and say, `Did you use it for balancing the budget?' 
No. 
`Did you use it for education, so that everybody can have a college education?' 
No. 
`Did you put it into housing? The environment?' 
No. 
`What on Earth did you do with it?' 
Why, we cut taxes for the wealthiest 5 percent of the people in America. That is what we did with it. 
I will be 6 feet under before you catch me voting for something like that. 
I just came over here to say that the citizenry of this country, when you stop and talk to them from the heart, if not the head, talk to them from the heart and the head, let them know we are the luckiest people alive. 
Yes, I paid a lot of taxes yesterday, and I did not like it, but I will tell you what I do like. I enjoy living in a civilized society where the crime rate is down, where the unemployment rate has been dramatically reduced, where inflation is under control, where people have jobs and where some Senators are trying to figure out a way to educate every child in this country who wants it. 
So, no, I am not voting for any of this nonsense that would require a two-thirds vote to raise taxes. That is not a democracy. I consider myself just about the luckiest man that ever lived, No. 1, because of my parents and No. 2, because I got elected to the U.S. Senate after serving my State as Governor for 4 years. Why? It is the greatest place in the world to keep faith with humankind, to give other people the same kind of chances you had. 
So I am very fortunate to be an American, and I did not begrudge the taxes I paid yesterday, just as I never begrudged the taxes I have paid, and I think most of the Members of the Senate agree with that when they stop and really reflect on it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the pending second-degree amendment caps the fee paid by the utilities for nuclear waste disposal services. That sounds simple enough, but to understand the amendment we must first understand the funding provisions in both the Murkowski substitute, which the pending amendment amends, and how both will affect the nuclear waste program's current funding mechanism. 
One of the fundamental principles of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is that the full cost of disposing of nuclear waste should be borne by the waste's generators. In the case of the military waste, that means the Treasury and the taxpayers. In the case of commercial power plant waste, that means the utilities and their ratepayers. 
The existing nuclear waste program will cost about $34 billion. Of this amount, the utilities are responsible for $27 billion and the defense program is responsible for $7 billion. 
Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the utilities' share is recovered through a fee on electricity generated by nuclear power. The 1982 law set the fee at 1 mill, which is one tenth of a cent, per kilowatt-hour. 
Congress assumed in 1982 that the fee would need to be adjusted from time to time for inflation, to meet higher than expected costs, of if the number of plants paying the fee changed. Thus, the existing law gives the Secretary of Energy the power to adjust the fee. 
The Secretary has never used his adjustment authority. The fee remains at 1 mill despite 14 years of inflation and despite GAO concerns that the fee is not recovering the program's full cost. DOE admits that the fee will only collect about $19 billion of the $27 billion the utilities will owe. DOE is counting on interest on the unspent balance in the Nuclear Waste Fund to make up the shortfall. The utilities will contribute even less than $19 billion if any nuclear power plants shut down before the end of their useful lives, as many are expected to do as the electricity industry becomes more competitive. 
Because of budget scoring roles, the fees collected from the utilities do not offset spending on the program. As a result, the nuclear waste fee takes in more money than is appropriated to the program each year. In fiscal year 1997, for example, the utilities are expected to pay $649 million compared to $182 million appropriated to the waste program. 
The Murkowski substitute tries to get around these budget constraints without violating the Budget Act. The approach taken in the substitute, while convoluted, works. First, the substitute preserves the existing 1 mil mandatory fee. Second, it creates a new offsetting fee, which will be set at whatever amount is needed to recover the amount appropriated to the program each year. The amount of the offsetting fee will fluctuate from year to year. To prevent double recovery from the two fees, the amount of the mandatory fee will be reduced by the amount of the offsetting fee collected. Thus, the combined fees may total more than 1 mill but will never be less than 1 mill. 
The substitute eliminates the Secretary of Energy's existing authority to adjust the fee, but it makes up for it by allowing Congress to raise the fee to keep up with program spending through the annual appropriations process. 
The Murkowski substitute requires the Secretary of Energy to propose an increase or decrease to the mandatory 1-mill fee if he finds that the combined fees are collecting too little or too much money. The Secretary's proposal would not take effect until approved by a joint resolution adopted under expedited procedures. The expedited procedures provided under the substitute waive Budget Act points of order. 
The Domenici first-degree amendment reinstates any applicable Budget Act points of order. That's only fair. 
The Murkowski second-degree amendment, however, has nothing to do with the points of order restored by the Domenici amendment. The Murkowski second-degree amendment caps the combined total of the two fees in the underlying substitute at 1 mill. 
The Murkowski amendment repudiates the full-cost recovery principle of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and shifts part of the cost of the nuclear waste program from the utilities and their ratepayers to the Treasury and the taxpayers. 
How much of the program's cost will be shifted to the taxpayers is unclear but the 1-mill fee will certainly be inadequate to pay the program's full cost. GAO already says it is inadequate. DOE says it will be inadequate if future interest rates are not high enough to offset the current shortfall between what the utilities will pay--$19 billion--and what their share of the program will cost--$27 billion. The underlying bill, S. 104, will increase the cost of the program by $2 billion for interim storage. Competition will cause utilities to shut down some nuclear plants before the end of their useful lives, thereby decreasing the amount of the fees paid. 
Under current law, the Secretary of Energy can correct any shortfall by raising the fee, but S. 104 and the Murkowski substitute strips the Secretary of that power. Even under the Murkowski substitute, though, Congress could still correct any shortfall in future appropriations acts. But the Murkowski second-degree amendment forecloses any opportunity for DOE or Congress to address a future shortfall except by joint resolution. 
The pending amendment fundamentally alters the bargain the Government struck with the utilities in 1982. That bargain was that the Federal Government would take on the responsibility for disposing of the utilities' waste in a permanent repository and, in return, the utilities would pay the program's full cost or the repository program and, in the meantime, fulfill their responsibility for storing their own waste at their reactors until the repository was ready or else pay the Government extra to store it at a Federal site. 
The nuclear industry and its Republican supporters have made much of the sanctity of the nuclear waste contracts. They have complained loudly about DOE's inability to meet the 1998 waste acceptance date in the contract and have alleged the Government owes the utilities billions of dollars in damages for this failure. 
The Murkowski substitute already rewrites the bargain struck in 1982 by making the Government responsible for temporary storage. The Murkowski second-degree amendment further alters the bargain struck in 1982 by relieving the utilities of their obligation to pay the full cost of the now expanded program.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is fairly simple and will only take about 10 minutes. 
Mr. President, last July a D.C. circuit court ruled that the Waste Policy Act of 1982 required the Department of Energy to take the utilities' nuclear waste in 1998. The utilities and the public service commissions brought two separate actions, and the court consolidated them. They argued that DOE was clearly under an obligation to take this waste in 1998. And the court ruled in their favor saying--this is good news for my adversaries on this amendment--`In conclusion, we hold that the petitioners' reading of the statute comports with the plain language of the measure. * * * Thus, we hold that section 302(a)(5)(B) creates an obligation in DOE, reciprocal to the utilities' obligation to pay, to start disposing of the [nuclear waste] no later than January 31, 1998.' 
You may think that the utilities have all the best of it as a result of that decision, and they may very well have. But as you know, there is a case pending now in the D.C. Circuit in which the utility companies are seeking a judgment seeking to have the fees that they are paying put in escrow. I am not sure what they get out of that. But the purpose of this amendment is very simple. The District of Columbia Circuit right now has this action of the utility companies under consideration. As I said, the utility companies are asking that the fees they are paying, which is hundreds of millions of dollars a year, be put in escrow. And in my opinion, in order for the court to rule on that, the court is going to have to again look at the contract--not the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which they interpreted in last July's decision--bear in mind we are talking about two different lawsuits. Last summer, in July, the court was interpreting the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. This time, in my opinion, they have to look at the contract and see if the contract that was negotiated pursuant to that act requires the Department of Energy to take this waste. 
So here is my amendment. It is written in the mother tongue, which is in English, so everybody here ought to be able to understand it. This is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. It states that it is the sense of the Senate that the Department of Energy's failure to meet the January 1998 deadline was caused by Congress' failure to appropriate funds the program needed and other Government actions beyond DOE's control, and that the court should take the contract's provisions on excusable delays into consideration when it rules on the pending lawsuits. 
As I said, that is the mother tongue, and it is not hard to understand. Look at the contract. See what the contract says. Is the United States, or the Department of Energy, under the terms of the contract, excused for its inability to take this waste in 1998? Bear in mind that court last summer did not find DOE liable for a breach of contract. A breach of contract is the failure without a legal excuse to perform the contract. All you brilliant lawyers here understand that. We have a contract. That is what the court is going to be construing. This is a sense of the Senate calling to the court's attention some language that was in the contract. And I have not heard this debated one minute since this debate started. The question is, was there a failure to have a permanent repository ready to take this waste in 1998? Was that their fault? I submit that it was not. But that is not what we are debating here. That is my opinion. My opinion is, and I really defy anybody to say otherwise, that the reason they didn't have it ready is because the Government didn't appropriate the money fast enough to do it. 
Listen to this. Here is what the contract says. The Government will not be liable `for damages caused by a failure to perform its obligations' under the contract `if such failure arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence' of DOE. 
That is simple enough. Anybody can understand that. The contract goes on to state that `acts of the Government'--that is us, colleagues--`acts of the Government' that `cause delay in 
scheduled acceptance or transport' of utility waste shall be an excusable failure by the Department of Energy. 
It says that DOE shall notify the utilities of such a delay and `the parties will readjust their schedules, as appropriate, to accommodate such delay.' 
I don't know how many lawyers there are in the U.S. Senate. But I promise you there isn't a lawyer here worth the powder of blowing you know where that hasn't had cases exactly like this. All contracts provide for excusable delays. What do you do if you have a delay that is beyond your control? What if you have a tornado blow a project away while you are right in the middle of it? Normally you would have insurance to cover that. That is normally covered by contracts. Here they simply say, if there is any justifiable reason for the DOE not being ready to take this fuel in January of 1998, that is a legitimate excuse and that includes actions by the Government, and the actions of the Government was we didn't appropriate the money to get the repository built. Now the utilities are coming in and saying, `We don't care about the language of the contract. We want you to take it, or put our money in escrow.' 
There have been all kinds of figures. I am not going to debate the amount of money involved here. I have heard a lot of figures thrown around about what this is going to cost the Government by not taking this spent fuel, and those figures are so exaggerated, if you look at the details of what the cost is likely to be, it is exaggerated by a magnitude of about 300 percent. 
But it is not correct for Senators on the floor of the U.S. Senate to suggest--indeed, openly state, as I heard some do--that this is already a done deal and that DOE has already been found liable. That is not true. The contract is now under consideration by the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, DC. I submit to you that if anybody is to blame it is us. We are the ones who kept DOE from being prepared to take this. 
So, Mr. President, I think it is only appropriate. After all, we are not trying to interfere with the judicial proceedings. We are simply saying it is a sense of the Senate that this language which I just read to you should be very carefully considered by the court. There not only is not nothing wrong with that, there is everything in the world right about it. And the court is going to interpret the contract, and here is the clear language of it. 
I say in my sense-of-the-Senate amendment that the court should take the contract's provisions on excusable delays into consideration when it rules on the pending lawsuit. 
Why wouldn't it? DOE didn't put that language in there just to make the contract a little longer. They put it in there so that they would have an out if there was an excusable delay. There has been an excusable delay. All I am saying is it is the sense of the Senate that we ought to call that to the attention of the court. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I came to the U.S. Senate in 1975. At that time, the nuclear debate was raging full blast. `Shall we or shall we not build more nuclear-electrical-generating plants?' I just finished 4 years as Governor of my State. And we had built two nuclear plants up on the Arkansas River. I believe the total cost of both of those plants was $400 million. It was represented to me at the time, as Governor, that that would be by far the cheapest power we would ever know anything about. 
But after I came to the Senate and began to investigate the feasibility and the advisability of taking this country down the 
nuclear path, I quickly came to the conclusion that I would resist any additional nuclear plants. There was another highlight on the front burner called the Clinch River breeder reactor to be built on the Clinch River down in Tennessee. 
I remember in 1981, the Republicans took over this place, and Howard Baker, the Senator from Tennessee, and one of the finest men ever to serve in this body, became majority leader. I was trying to keep any additional nuclear plants from being licensed--and it was not a tough chore. A lot of people had made up their minds at that point that the nuclear option was not a good one. I fought for about 4 years to kill the Clinch River breeder. 
But I was up against the majority leader. And as everybody here knows, as the old revenuer said, when they announced United States versus Jones, he turned to his lawyer and said, `Them don't sound like very fair odds to me.' And it was not very fair odds to go up against the majority leader on the Clinch River breeder, which was going to be built in his beloved Tennessee. 
Howard Baker could always just pull out that one extra vote he needed. The vote was always close, but when you are majority leader, you know, you can just call somebody over and say, `I need your vote,' and you usually get it. 
Finally, one year I was ahead by about six or seven votes as the votes were being cast, and I think Senator Baker decided that he was done for, and he turned everybody loose that had committed to him who did not really like the idea of the Clinch River breeder reactor and were only voting for it to accommodate him. He turned them loose, and I think we won that day by about 70 to 30. Happily, that was the end of the Clinch River breeder. 
I had a group of people from France in my office this afternoon, some politicians and some deeply involved in the electrical industry. They wanted to talk about the new concept of restructuring the electricity industry in this country to go to retail competition. They are doing this in France. They are doing it in Germany and doing it all over Western Europe. And they wanted to talk to me about my bill. 
One of them said, `Senator, we understand that you are the Senator who killed the breeder reactor.' 
`Mais oui.' 
He said, `If you had it to do over again, would you do it again?' 
`You bet.' 
France is heavily dependent on breeder reactors. But they are also in the business of reprocessing and using MOX to generate power, and so on. I guess I am digressing a little bit to say about the breeder reactor, it is dead, dead; and I am glad it is dead. 
The reason I did not like the breeder reactor is the same reason I did not like nuclear power, period. It is wonderful. It is the cleanest power you can have. You see that nice, clear white smoke coming out of those smokestacks in Russellville, AR. And you know there is nothing polluting about that plant. 
But if you look inside, if you look inside the plant and you see those fuel rods, you have to ask yourself, since these things are going to be radioactive for thousands of years, how do you dispose of them? That is the reason I turned against nuclear power. I could not figure out a way on Earth that we were going to environmentally, acceptably dispose of those fuel rods. 
So now, Mr. President, we are here today debating that very proposition and 35,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel created by the electrical generating companies of this country and thousands of tons more by the Pentagon. It has to be disposed of. And we have been laboring with the question of how we are going to do it. As we lawyers say, `Since the memory of man runneth not.' We are doing our very best to keep faith with the people of this country and dispose of it in a way that they will be able to sleep at night. 
Let me tell you one other thing. If we dispose of it the way the Senator from Alaska proposes right now, we may be transporting that stuff all over the country two or three times. And, you know, I live in a little town of 2,500 people, Charleston, AR. You are being addressed right now almost entirely by the South Franklin County Bar Association. I was about the only lawyer in town--it is so little. But if I were a lawyer in Charleston, I would be very apprehensive about all that nuclear power coming from Russellville, AR, right up Highway 22. And the Presiding Officer knows exactly the location I am talking about. Coming right up Highway 22 through Charleston, AR, headed for Yucca Mountain. 
So, what did we do? In 1982, we passed a bill called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. A good bill. We said to the electrical industry in this country, the nuclear electrical industry, that you pay a fee to the U.S. Government every year. We will use your money to find and develop a permanent repository for this nuclear fuel. 
We passed the bill. The deal was cut. We started collecting the fees. Both sides operating in ultimate good faith. No shenanigans. You pay us a fee every year and we will use it to find a site. We found a site called Yucca Mountain in the home State of my good friend, the junior Senator from Nevada. 
I am on the same side of the Senator from Nevada. And if it were Arkansas instead of Nevada that they were putting it in, I would be like him sitting in my seat on this floor 24 hours a day trying to keep faith with my constituents and saying, what have we done to deserve 35,000 tons of nuclear waste dumped in our backyard? And I am sad about that. It is one of those things. Somebody has to do it. 
So we find Yucca Mountain and everybody says this is the best possible site--not the perfect site, may not be the site ultimately chosen--but it is the site we are choosing to start spending this fee the utilities are paying us. 
So, what have we done since 1982? We have dug a 5-mile hole, a tunnel in Yucca Mountain in anticipation of it ultimately being decided that it is by far the best place to locate this spent fuel. We have spent $4.8 billion on that 5-mile hole. And we are going to spend a lot more before it is perfected. 
But, Mr. President, the reason we stand here today debating this bill is this. We said to the utility industry, we will take your fuel--we being the U.S. Government, the Energy Department--we will take this 35,000 tons of spent fuel and we will start taking it in about January 1998. That is coming up. It will be here before you know it. 
Now, the utilities have been operating in good faith, too. They have been paying their fees in anticipation of getting rid of this stuff which they are storing onsite at their nuclear plants. 
Again, the Presiding Officer, I know, has been to those two nuclear sites in Arkansas. 
Some of it is lying out in dry casks. Some of it is in water. But it is stored on site. We have 110 nuclear generating plants in this country and 76 storage sites. For example, we only have one storage site in Russellville, but two generators. That is not uncommon in this country. 
So we have the 110 nuclear generating plants generating more and more spent fuel and storing it at a considerable cost to them. There is no denying this is very expensive to the utilities. So they say: A deal is a deal. In 1982 we said we would start paying you, and you said January 1998 you would start taking the fuel off our hands and we could quit building all the facilities and storing it. 
It is kind of ominous. Most Senators, I suppose, have been to the nuclear plants and looked at those things. You look at the pool of water, it has a very strange color, and the nuclear rods are in that water. I have never seen a real dry cask they put it in. My legislative director has a small mock-up model of a cask they put it in. What they will be doing, if all goes through according to S. 104, they will take that fuel out of water and put in the steel casks. The casks are big, they are expensive. They will put those fuel rods inside those casks, those that are not already there, and they will start transporting them from all over the United States to Nevada. You lucky dog. They will be transporting them to Nevada in those casks. 
What the Senator from Alaska says, `We will pour a gigantic concrete slab and we will carry that stuff out there to Yucca Mountain.' Not inside the mountain. This is somewhere around Yucca Mountain. I do not know where. We have the 5-mile tunnel built. We have a little more boring to do. But we will pour the concrete slab, transport the fuel out there, and just leave it out there in the open. 
Now, this sounds simple, but it is a pretty expensive undertaking. What it means is if S. 104 passes and the President vetoes it and we override his veto, it will cost about $4 billion over the next 5 years instead of the $2 billion we are planning to spend on the permanent repository. 
Mr. President, I tell you something interesting that has nothing to do with the debate. If, in August of next year--bear in mind there will be a determination made next August on whether or not Yucca Mountain is suitable. Incidentally, the reason we are here today is because the dates are at cross purposes. We have to start taking the fuel in January, but we do not know whether Yucca Mountain will be determined to be suitable until August of next year. So we are required to start taking the stuff 8 months before we know whether Yucca Mountain will be the ultimate repository. Now, if it is, if next August we find it suitable, there are still a lot of licensing procedures to go through, but basically we are in fat city. Everybody will be happy because Yucca Mountain has been determined to be suitable, and we will take all this waste that S. 104 wants to take out and put on a concrete slab. In the year 2010 we will start taking it and putting it in that hole, that tunnel in the mountain, and we will seal that sucker up. You think about it. We will put 84,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel in this tunnel in Yucca Mountain and seal that thing. No guards and no monitors walking up and down hallways, putting a Geiger counter on it and see what the radiation is that is coming out of it. We will seal it up forever. 
Now, before I get to the end of this tale, let me go back a moment and say this stuff is going to be in Yucca Mountain for thousands and thousands of years. And you know why? Because that is how long it is radioactive. You know what we are debating here today? Ten years. We are saying we cannot wait 10 years to make sensible decisions that affect the lives of every man, woman, and child in America. We have to do it right now because the utility industry is unhappy. They want us to take it now and transport it to Yucca Mountain and get it out of their back door. If they would have listened to me 20 years ago, they would not have a problem because they would not have all that waste. I was not that 
powerful then. I am not that powerful now either. 
But think about this: We are talking about planting 84,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel in Yucca Mountain, to be reposed for thousands and thousands of years, and S. 104 says we cannot wait 10 years to find out. We cannot wait until August of next year to determine whether or not Yucca Mountain is a suitable repository. This is a monumental decision. We are not talking about the Kentucky Derby. We are talking about thousands of tons of lethal spent fuel and how we will dispose of it safely so the American people can sleep at night. 
I share the concern of the Senator from Alaska about disposing of this stuff. I am not trying to drag my feet. Everybody knows we have to dispose of this stuff. We are talking about what is the best way to do it. What is in the national interest? What is sensible? What is the safest way to do it? 
It is tragic that the Energy Department has to renege on its agreement, but it cannot help it. It was not their fault. It really was not anybody's fault that we did not get this all done by 1998. But the Energy Department says certainly if it is found suitable, we believe we can start taking this stuff by the year 2010 and doing it properly and in a way that everybody will find to be suitable and satisfying. 
So what happens under this bill? If Yucca Mountain is found to be unsuitable next August, you have to go ahead and build this thing anyway, this interim storage site, unless the President of the United States finds an alternative site and Congress approves that alternative site all within 2 years. If anybody believes you can do that, hold up your hand. That is an absolutely impossible condition in S. 104. The President cannot find another site and get Congress to approve that site within 2 years. We have been working on Yucca Mountain forever, and now we are in a posture of finally concluding a happy end to this situation. But even if Yucca Mountain is found to be unsuitable, S. 104 of the Senator from Alaska will still require that every pound of nuclear waste in this country be transported to Yucca Mountain, even though that is not going to be the permanent repository site. 
So what happens then? We find another permanent repository site. We will load it all up and bring it back through Charleston, AR, once again. That will make the citizens happy. They already had the daylights scared out of them bringing the fuel through their hometowns once. Now they will get it again. So why take it in the first place? Why not at least give the administration and the utility industry an opportunity to work out some kind of an arrangement whereby we will pay them--they are suing us now, and frankly they have a good lawsuit. I do not deny that. They have a good lawsuit. We agreed to take it in 1998, and we cannot do it. So we will have to pay. 
So my question is why not pay them to leave it where it is for a few months until we can make a decision about the suitability of Yucca Mountain and proceed the way we have been proceeding? 
Now, Mr. President, let me just close by making something of a confession. It is tempting to me to support this proposition. I would not vote for S. 104 under any circumstances, but the concept set out in S. 104 makes it very appealing and very attractive. As I say, I would not vote for an interim storage site right now because we are coming up on the time when we will know with some degree of certainty whether or not Yucca Mountain will be the place. Can we not wait? America, this is the central question. Can we not wait 10 years to determine that this is the safest place in the world and the best place in the world to store this stuff for thousands of years? What is 10 years in the scheme of the thousands of years that this stuff will be stored there? 
The options are not good either way. I do not blame the utilities for wanting to get rid of the stuff, but I do not blame us for not wanting to take it. It is folly in the extreme for us to take that stuff out there and spend an extra $2 billion to put in a concrete slab when we know, or will know next August almost to a reasonable degree of certainty, a year from now we will know whether or not we will be able to use Yucca Mountain, and if we are, would it not be infinitely better to transport that fuel one time--not twice, not three times--one time, to put it in a site in which we will all feel comfortable? 
Mr. President, I know there are plenty of votes in this place to pass this bill. I know the President will veto it when it is presented to him. We will see what happens after that. I am trying to call for a degree of sanity and reasonableness and saying I would like to get rid of it, too. Nobody has any stronger desire to get rid of this nuclear waste than I have. 
The Senator from Nevada and I will probably be on opposite sides next time. If Yucca Mountain is found to be suitable, you can bet I will vote to put it there. I have not supported the Senators from Nevada because I like them, because they are friends; I supported them because I thought they were right. I have supported the Energy Department and the administration's position on this because I think they are right. 
I am asking my colleagues, I know they are getting a lot of pressure on them both from the industry and the party and different people, but I tell you something, when you start playing politics with this issue, I plead for my colleagues to remember, people may disagree with you, but they like people who stand up for what they believe, even when it is not popular. People sometimes say to me, why do you guys not screw up your nerve and do something right, something courageous for a change? I hear that all the time. Do you know what they mean by courageous? Unpopular. If it is popular, it is not courageous. 
Here is a bill that is very complicated, and the American people are not homed in on it. The people here know what they are doing. I am asking, for Pete's sake, listen to this debate and do what they think is sensible, in the best interests of the country. 
I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow Arkansan who is soon to retire after a long and distinguished career in Arkansas agriculture. 
Jack G. Justus has devoted 44 years of service to Arkansas agriculture as a county agricultural agent and as a staff member of the Arkansas Farm Bureau. Under Jack's leadership as executive vice president for the past 15 years, the Arkansas Farm Bureau has nearly doubled in size to more than 200,000 members. 
`Progressive Farmer' honored Jack Justus as its 1996 Man of the Year in Service to Agriculture. Throughout his career, Jack has served on numerous boards and commissions, including the Future Farmers of America Foundation, the 4-H Club Foundation, Arkansas State Fair, and other groups committed to the improvement of life for farm youth and the rural community. 
Mr. President, on June 1, 1997, Jack Justus will retire from his administrative duties at the Farm Bureau. This native Arkansan, life-long resident, product of our State's educational system, and dedicated public servant is certainly deserving of a long and satisfying retirement. 
Our State has benefited greatly from Jack Justus' stewardship and I know I join literally thousands from all across our State who join me in saying thank you.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me say before I begin my remarks on a separate subject, that the majority leader is absolutely right when he talks about the necessity for developing a system of disposing of high-level nuclear waste in this country from our nuclear powerplants. 
I, when I was Governor of Arkansas 22 years ago, wondered how on Earth we were going to deal with that. That was the reason I was always opposed to building more nuclear plants when we had not figured out how we were going to decommission the ones that we had and dispose of the nuclear waste that was coming out of them. So it is one of the most difficult, knotty problems I have ever faced. 
I am ranking on the Energy Committee and we have wrestled with this at length over the years. This is no time to debate it, except to say it is one of the most awesome, difficult problems I have ever been confronted with.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my colleague in the House, Speaker Gingrich. For those of you who think that I must need a saliva test for saying that, here is why. It was earlier this week in a press conference, that Speaker Gingrich made a very responsible statement. He said that this Congress should forgo tax cuts until we balance the budget--an eminently sensible, unassailable proposition insofar as I am concerned. 
I expected him to get the reception he got. Some of his very best friends in the House jumped on him and said, `You have betrayed us.' Thirty House Members sent him a hot letter, saying, `What on Earth are you thinking?' 
I don't know what he was thinking, but I assume he was thinking the same thing I was thinking, and that is that the snake oil of cutting taxes and balancing the budget makes no sense whatever. We have tried it. Ten years from now or 20 years from now, when memories have faded a little further, I would rather expect people to say, yes, we can cut taxes and balance the budget. But we are, really, only 4 years away from the end of George Bush's tenure as President; we are 16 years away from 1981 when the U.S. Senate took leave of its senses and passed a massive tax cut on the proposition that if we would do that and simultaneously balance the budget, which was at that moment $87 billion out of kilter, that we could balance the budget by 1984 if we just bought into this proposition that we needed to cut taxes monumentally to stimulate the economy. 
But I am again happy to report to my colleagues I did not buy that snake oil. There were 11 Senators--believe it--11 U.S. Senators who said, `This is crazy. It will never work. It makes no sense whatever. It violates economic principle, violates normal sanity.' But we went ahead and did it, and I will never forget that fall day when President Reagan, at Rancho Mirage, signed the bill in front of about 100 television cameras, saying, `You have given me the tools. Now I'll do the job and nobody will be left behind.' 
Here is what happened. Twelve years later, we had accumulated $2.5 trillion in additional debt to go with the already $1 trillion debt that we had incurred during the first 200 years of this country's history--actually less than that. But from the date we adopted and ratified the Constitution in 1789, until the day we passed that tax cut in 1981, the debt had accumulated to less than $1 trillion. Twelve short years later, we had increased that trillion-dollar debt by $3 trillion, and the national debt at that time then became $4 trillion, and we have been striving to dig ourselves out of that hole ever since. 
Mr. President, 3 or 4 weeks ago I was walking out that door to go back to my office and one of the most conservative Republican Senators in the U.S. Senate, who happens to be a good friend, came over to me and he said, `I'll tell you, Dale, confidentially, I've never seen things better. The economy is as good as it ever gets. A lot of things are going right in this country.' I almost fainted. I said, `I could not agree with you more.' 
I sometimes wonder why people are not dancing in the streets. Since 1992 we have taken the deficit from $290 billion to $107 billion in 4 short years. The unemployment rate in this country is the lowest in years. Some economists say you you cannot get it much lower than 5.3 or 5.4 percent. Interest rates are at a manageable level. And this morning, everybody who read the Washington Post saw a feature story about how the deficit is continuing to go down. 
Let me back up. The President sent his budget over here and he said: In 1997, the deficit will be about $127 billion. It will be about the same in 1998. This morning the newspaper reports that because of this economy, enjoying the longest sustained growth since Dwight Eisenhower was President, even CBO, which is very conservative in their projections, says the deficit this year is going to be down to $115 billion. But other very reputable economists say, no, you are underestimating the taxes the people of this country are going to pay this year because the economy is doing just fine.They say, we believe the deficit will be under $100 billion. 
I am the eternal optimist. I like to believe that last statement, that the deficit will be below $100 billion, turns out to be true, in which case we will have done something that is unprecedented in this country. We will have had 5 sustained years of deficit reduction. 
Do you want the economy to continue as it is now and have this sustained growth that we have been enjoying? I will tell you a simple way to do it. You send a message to the American people that the U.S. Congress has come to its senses, and decided to forgo tax cuts of any kind until the United States budget is in balance. 
Then tell them, on top of that, this year's deficit is not going to be $99 billion; we're going to further reduce it to $90 billion or $85 billion. I can tell you, Wall Street will jump with joy. 
Why would we be considering tax cuts of $193 billion, almost $200 billion? Why would the U.S. Senate be considering a $200 billion tax cut over the next 5 years and $508 billion over the next 10 years? Why are we considering that when we know that a tax cut of that magnitude is going to stimulate the economy? And why do we want to stimulate an economy that is perking along so well that Alan Greenspan keeps Wall Street on edge every day saying, `If this economy gets any hotter, I'm going to raise interest rates'? That is the constant threat every time the Federal Reserve Board meets, the threat of higher interest rates. 
You cut capital gains taxes, and I promise you it will not be long until you will have an interest rate increase from the Fed. You cut these other taxes to the tune of $200 billion over the next 5 years, and I promise you interest rates will go up. Alan Greenspan will see to it. And if interest rates go up, the market will drop and economic activity will drop. So why would we insist on making a crazy economic decision to stimulate an economy which is moving along sharply? 
I see statements in the press every morning of some politician saying, `Well, people know how to handle their money a lot better than Washington. It's a lot better to leave it in their pocket than send it to Washington.' I understand that, and I understand that if you are looking for applause, that statement is a good way to get it. But I also understand that we have a golden opportunity that does not present itself often, and that is to honestly balance the budget and give the people of this Nation a night's sleep like they have never had before. 
The Senator from New Mexico offered two budgets this afternoon. One was the President's. I said many times on this floor, I am not enamored with the President's budget. I am not enamored with any budget which does not reduce the deficit this year and next. The Senator from New Mexico is getting very close to singing my song. You like bipartisanship? You like for Republicans and Democrats to agree? The Senator from New Mexico probably is not trying to curry my favor, but he is getting awfully close to doing it with his resolution which says no tax cuts until we get to a balanced budget using CBO's figures. 
Mr. President, the Budget Committee has been deliberating, and I think they have been making some progress, incidentally. They even think they have the deficit down to $111 billion now, and if they are that close, I think it is absolutely imperative that we improve over the 1996 deficit by cutting it below $107 billion this year and below that next year. 
One of the things about the proposal of the Senator from New Mexico is that when we reach that happy day--when we are in balance--then half of any surplus will go to reduce the cuts made in nondefense discretionary spending. That is education, law enforcement, environment, health care, medical research. It is all the things that make us a great nation. But the Senator from New Mexico very carefully has focused on making cuts in nondefense discretionary spending. Well, what is wrong with asking the Defense Department to help out? Why in the name of all that is good and holy would we, in 1996, insist that the Defense Department take $9 billion more than they even asked for? 
I sit on the Defense Appropriations Committee, and I am telling you, I get absolutely nauseated at times. You take the F-22 fighter plane, which we do not need, I promise you--and I am going to stand at this desk and maybe lose another battle on the F-22--but when you start talking to me about building 438 airplanes at $180 million each to compete with a Russian airplane that is not even on the drawing board, let alone being off the drawing board, and at a time when we are building 1,000 advance F-18's which will be as good, or better, than any plane that could possibly challenge us for the next 20 years, and then follow that in 2015 with a joint strike fighter--no, they want to fill in what they say is a gap with a plane, Mr. President, that costs $180 million a copy, 438 of them. 
Would you like to know how much the estimated cost of the F-22 has gone up in the past year compared to what we were told in 1996? $15 billion. $15 billion in 1 year. God knows what it will be by the year 2006 or 2007 when we start building these airplanes. We will not be able to afford them, I can tell you that. 
I am simply saying that we should look at what we are going to cut. The Senator from New Mexico has a $100 billion cut in Medicare. And what about Medicaid? I do not know whether we are cutting Medicaid $9 billion or $22 billion. You hear conflicting numbers on that, but bear in mind what these programs are. Medicare is health care for our elderly; Medicaid is health care for the poor, the most vulnerable of all our children. 
Last year, we cut welfare recipients' food stamps, everything, for the poorest people in the country, $55 billion. Mr. President, I am not going to go home and tell my constituents that I voted to savage the most vulnerable people in our population, the children and the elderly and the poor, and that I voted to give the money to the wealthiest 5 percent of the people in America. 
And I promise you, if I were running against somebody that had done that, I could make that case in spades and be absolutely certain of my ground. 
I did not vote for the welfare bill last year. I was one of the 21 people that did not. You can call me a bleeding heart liberal. You can call my anything you want to. But when this body starts saying the only way we can balance the budget is by giving the Pentagon billions they did not even ask for and cutting Medicare by $100 billion, and depriving the poorest children in the country of Medicaid to the tune of $22 billion, and making $55 billion in welfare cuts--you see, I would have to say I never went to Methodist Sunday school as a boy, but I did. I believed those Methodist Sunday school stories about my obligation to my fellow man. You hurt your fellow man, you insult God. 
So I am not going to do it, whether you want to talk about religion or whether you want to talk about common sense, whether you want to talk about what has made this country great. One thing that has made this country great is our commitment to the elderly. We reduced the poverty rate among them from 25 percent to 12 percent since 1950. We ought to keep doing it. We ought to come to our senses. 
I intend to sit down and visit with the Senator from New Mexico and talk seriously with him about this. I am not negotiating on behalf of the President or anybody else. But I want to applaud the Senator from New Mexico this afternoon because he has made a very important statement that a lot of people on that side will disagree with. But I think he is on the right track. I think Newt Gingrich made a very important statement earlier this week, and I applaud him for it. 
Mr. President, I appreciate having the opportunity to make these statements. I have been intending to do this all week and had such a schedule I could not do it. But I am feeling better tonight about the direction we are headed than I have in some time. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.

Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator. No. 1, Mr. President, as much respect as I have for a number of Members of the Senate--and we have some very bright people in the Senate--there isn't anybody here, really, that I want tinkering with what James Madison, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, and all of the rest of those brilliant people, the most important assemblage of brilliant minds under one roof in the history of the world, did. Not only do I not want anybody tinkering with it, I do not want to adopt something as sloppily crafted as this amendment is. 
As Senator Byrd has said time and time again, it is not even constitution-like language. It doesn't provide for a simple majority vote to unbalance the budget in case of depression. It doesn't provide for a simple majority vote in case we know we are going to war, as we did in Desert Storm. You would not have spent an extra dollar, under this amendment, to prepare for Desert Storm. You could not spend an extra dollar to have prepared for World War II, which everybody knew was coming, if it unbalanced the budget. 
You talk about a minority, listen to this, Mr. President. With 435 House Members, 100 Senators, if we want to unbalance the budget, it is going to require 60 percent of both Houses. Let's assume that every single House Member, all 435, vote aye to unbalance the budget, bring it over to the Senate, and let us assume that 59 Senators vote aye to unbalance the budget, 41 obstreperous Senators--494 people favoring unbalancing the budget and 41 Senators oppose it. It will not be unbalanced. 
What else? If we can't resolve the thousands of questions that this amendment leaves to be answered, then nobody has an answer and you go to court. Yes, coffee shop bantering is, `I'm so tired of the courts making laws. I just want them to interpret the laws.' Well, they are going to have to make a lot of laws if we are foolish enough to adopt this one. 
In 1993, the Republicans in this body had an opportunity to do something courageous. The people back home always say, `Why don't you people screw up your nerve and do something courageous?' You know what that means? It sometimes means unpopular votes. `Why don't you screw up your courage and vote for something that is worthwhile, even though it is unpopular?' Well, happily, 50 Democrats did just that. Al Gore, the Vice President, broke the tie and the debt went down because of their courage. Everybody on that side prospered because they said, `I'm tired of taxes.' Do you know what they are proposing now? With a sanctimonious look on their faces, they are saying, `We want a balanced budget amendment.' What else? We want to cut taxes $238 billion over the next 5 years. We tried that snake oil in 1981, and we got a $3 trillion addition to the national debt. 
What is the deficit going to be if we adopt a capital gains tax, which costs $33 billion the first 5 years, $133 billion the second 5 years--and who does it go to? The wealthiest people in America; 67 percent of it goes to the richest 1 percent of the people in America. How are we going to pay for it? Cut Medicare. Think of it. Cutting Medicare $100 billion to $200 billion in order to pass a tax, 67 percent of which goes to the richest 1 percent of the people in America. I will say one thing for the people on that side of the aisle. They are not covert about it; they are overt. Make no mistake about it, I have just told you precisely how it will work. 
So, Mr. President, I am hoping that everybody holds fast. If we can beat this amendment today, which I think we can do, the American people are going to begin to hone in on it, and by this time next year, you won't even have it brought up. It will be just like term limits. It is going to go the same way term limits went. That never was a good idea, and it is dead now. 
So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will stand fast. I understand the politics of this. The majority leader was willing to tinker with this amendment. `I will fix it. Will anybody vote for it if I change this?' `Will somebody else vote for it if we change that?' That is how political it is. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the Constitution of the United States was adopted in 1789. It will be 208 years old this coming summer. In that period of time, there have been more than 11,000 efforts to amend the Constitution. And to the eternal credit of this body and the American people, only 18 times out of the 11,000 efforts have we amended the Constitution. Of those 11,000 efforts, I consider the amendment pending before this body to be the most unworkable, unenforceable, totally political amendment ever to be foisted off on an unsuspecting public. 
I have never heard as many questions answered with `I don't know.' Who will enforce this amendment? `I don't know.' What will be the courts' role, if any, in enforcing this amendment? `I don't know.' And I am speaking for the authors of this amendment when I say, `I don't know,' because they don't know. Who has standing to sue? `I don't know.' 
Who has standing to challenge the assumptions that we make that we have a balanced budget? `I don't know.' It reminds me of Abbott and Costello and `Who's on First?' And if we have a crisis--a crisis that is not yet a military conflict, but may become one, such as previous to World War II, such as previous to Desert Storm, the constitutional amendment says you have to have 60 votes to unbalance the budget, even though you are headed, almost certainly, toward war with another nation. 
There are no provisions in here to take care of a national emergency that is not yet a military conflict or a declared war. It has been said time and time again, but it bears repeating, that we have had 5 declared wars in the history of this country and about 200 military conflicts. 
Can the courts raise taxes? `I don't know.' Can the courts demand a cut in spending? `I don't know.' If a court orders Congress to raise taxes or cut spending and we don't do it and can't get the 60 votes to do it, what happens then? `I don't know.' Can the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court go to the White House and say to the President, `Mr. President, you are charged with executing and enforcing the laws of this Nation. We have ordered Congress to do a number of things in order to come into compliance with this constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and they have refused to do it. Now, do your duty, Mr. President, send the troops over that Hill and hold bayonets to the backs of the Members until they do it.' Now, that is farfetched, of course. But how many times have I heard the lamentation on this floor about the courts being intrusive and intervening where they have no right to intervene? 
Yet, Mr. President, this is a popular amendment. It is popular in my State and across the country. But it is not as popular as it was 2 years ago. It has gone from about 74 percent to 57 percent approval. If you ask about Social Security it only has a 27 percent approval rating. I don't like casting unpopular votes. I have cast my share of them. 
I think one of the reasons the polls have consistently showed this to be popular is twofold. First, when you ask people whether you favor a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, all they hear is `balance the budget,' and everybody is for that. Perhaps, there is another group who, like most of us, revere the majesty of the words in the Constitution and they think because of our reverence for the Constitution throughout history, if you just put it in the Constitution, it will be self-fulfilling. It would never occur to them how sloppily crafted this constitutional amendment is. It would never occur to them that it isn't even constitutional language. It would never occur to them that nobody can tell you how it's going to work. 
This amendment makes a mockery of that great, revered document. Now, some people who find this to be very popular and highly desirable may take umbrage at some of the things I say. But I have voted against it every time I ever had a chance. But do you know something else? I think one of the things that has stood me in pretty good stead with the people of Arkansas is that I have always trusted them. When I voted for the Panama Canal treaties--and I can tell you, nothing even comes close to that as far as unpopular votes are concerned--I survived it, and it was a correct vote. Very few people in this body would reverse that vote. 
Put your trust in the people, vote against this constitutional amendment, and don't have any fear of going home and talking sense to your people. They understand it. Not one person on that side of the aisle is going to vote against this nonsense--not one. How I miss the towering courage of Mark Hatfield in this body. 
Let me tell you what the Bumpers-Feingold amendment does, Mr. President. It is simple, ingenious in its simplicity, and it does the same thing the constitutional amendment would do but it takes Social Security off budget. We commit the constitutional amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, to the Budget Committee, with instructions to come back here with amendments to the Budget Act almost identical to this amendment. 
Did you know, Mr. President, that you can't raise taxes and you can't raise spending, and you can't appropriate money until the budget resolution has passed this body? If you want to change the Budget Act, if you amend the Budget Act, do you know what you have to do? You have to get 60 votes. We passed that with 51 votes. Strangely enough, you can pass something with 51 votes that later requires 61 votes to undo. What does our amendment do? As I say, it refers Senate Joint Resolution 1 to the Budget Committee and instructs them to amend the Budget Act with language almost identical to the constitutional amendment requiring that outlays shall not exceed receipts by 2002. 
The constitutional amendment says you may or may not enforce the amendment. I just got through covering that. The Bumpers/Feingold amendment would prohibit Congress from passing a budget resolution if it isn't balanced. As I just said, there is a prohibition on the passage of appropriations bills and tax bills without 60 votes. 
The constitutional amendment says there is no requirement for action until 2002 at the earliest. Do you know what that means? The drafters of this amendment put a provision in there saying 2002. So we have 5 free years. We don't have to do anything for 5 years. Those are freebies. Most people here will have left or will have been reelected in 5 years. 
Our amendment says you have to do it now. Face the music now, not 5 years from now. Come up with a budget that puts us on a glidepath to a balanced budget by the year 2002. If the States have not ratified this constitutional amendment by the year 2002, you have maybe 2 more free years where you don't have to do anything. 
Our amendment says start now and balance the budget by the year 2002. 
Do you know what else it does? It leaves our precious Constitution intact. The best part of this is that it does not trivialize the Constitution. The mandate for a balanced budget is just as tough under this amendment as it is in the constitutional amendment. 
Mr. President, in 1993 every single Republican voted against a proposal to reduce the deficit dramatically. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation bill of 1993 required the Vice President's vote because the vote was tied 50-50. And among the 50 who opposed it, every Republican and about 6 Democrats. At the time we voted the deficit for 1996 was projected to be $290 billion. As a result of that bill, and the economic growth that came from the confidence that gave, the people of this country knew that we were serious about deficit reduction, instead of a $290 billion deficit it was $107 billion. 
Mr. President, what is going on now? The President submitted a budget to us which I am not very fond of. I do not like to say that. He is a good friend and has been for 20 years. But I would not have come with a single tax cut, not one. And I would have submitted a budget that took the deficit from $107 billion in 1996 to well under $100 billion in 1997 to show the American people that we were on a glidepath to a balanced budget and we were not going to back off. 
The President's tax cuts are not nearly, though, as big as the Republicans. The Republican tax proposal will cost $193 billion. Think of that, $193 billion over the next 5 years. And $508 billion over the next 10 years. 
Do you know where they get $100 billion to offset that? Medicare. Do you think that I am going to go home and tell the people in my State that I voted to cut Medicare $100 billion so we could have a $193 billion tax cut the next 5 years? I would need a saliva test to do that. I am not going to do it, and I am not going to vote for these tax cuts. It is the height of irresponsibility to come in here and talk about cutting taxes $193 billion taking $100 billion out of the hides of people on Medicare. They say, `Oh. We are not going to raise the Medicare premiums.' No. But if you think you can cut Medicare $100 billion and not cut services to the elderly, go talk to the HMO's and tell them how they are going to make up for the $100 billion we are going to cut. They are going to cut services. That is how they are going to do it, while we have a capital gains tax that cost $33 billion over the next 5 years and $130 billion over the next 10 years. Where does it go?--67 percent of it to the richest 1 percent of the people in this country. `Oh, yes. We are going to cut taxes and balance the budget.' 
Mr. President, it is so cynical to get a serious, somber look 
on one's face and talk about deficits and propose cutting taxes by such massive amounts. We tried that in 1981. 
Mr. President, I don't know how many books there are on that stack down there. I have been looking at that for the last week ever since we started debating this constitutional amendment. Do you know what I would recommend? I wish the distinguished floor manager would take that stack of books and weigh them, put them on a scale and weigh them. And then take the national debt of $5.2 trillion, and divide those books up according to how much deficit by poundage came under Ronald Reagan and George Bush administrations. That would make an interesting thing for the film companies to film. I promise you that when you take Ronald Reagan's and George Bush's deficit over the 12-year period that they served this country and you are going to get about 1 foot for all the Democrats and about 6 feet just for that 12-year period. Do you know why? Because we had the massive tax cut in 1981. And I say once again. I was one of the 11 Senators that said, `You pass that and you are going to create deficits big enough to choke a mule.' Eleven out of 100 stood up and called that 1981 bill what it was, the most irresponsible thing we have ever done in the history of the U.S. Senate. You talk about mortgaging the future of our children. That is when we went from $1 trillion in debt that we had accumulated over 200 years to $4 trillion in 12 years; a little over $4 trillion. Think of it. Talk about irresponsibility. 
So I have spent an inordinate amount of my time since I have been in the Senate trying to do sensible things to balance the budget. I keep getting run over by a Mack truck called `tax cuts' and `spending increases,' particularly in defense. You just do not get a somber look on your face while you are voting for the biggest spending increases of the year called tax cuts. 
Just yesterday the Center for Budget Priorities came out and strongly recommended that the U.S. Congress forget tax cuts until we balance the budget. There is all the time in the world to cut taxes. Republicans say, `Well, that is a liberal organization.' Warren Rudman, with whom we all served 12 years in the U.S. Senate, is no liberal. He heads up the Concord Coalition, and the Concord Coalition jumped on that study yesterday like a chicken after a June bug, and said, `We agree with every word of it.' All you have to have is a little common sense to agree with it. You have to understand. You can't cut taxes and balance the budget. 
I have only voted for one constitutional amendment during my tenure in the Senate. And sometimes that is unpopular back home. But do you know something else? I talk about trusting the people. Do you know what the people want more than anything else today? Like Coca-Cola says, they want `The real thing.' They want to know how you really feel. Stand up for what you believe. Harry Truman told me one time, `Just tell them the truth.' So that is what I did. 
There is not even anything in the constitutional amendment that would allow Congress to raise spending with less than 60 votes for a depression. I am a Depression child, one of the few left in the Senate. I am telling you we did not have anything. We did not have paved streets; we did not have gas; we did not have electricity; we did not have health care. As I said, we had a two-holer out back when most people just had a one-holer. We did not have anything. 
As I have said before in this Chamber, I had pneumonia twice before I was 6 years old and all my parents could do was pray. Today that hardly requires much more than a visit to the doctor's office. And people tell me how they hate Government. They do not hate antibiotics. They do not hate measles and mumps serums and vaccines. 
They do not hate the fact that we live a lot longer than we used to because we pour a lot of money into NIH to do medical research for us. They do not hate being able to go on an airplane anyplace in the United States in 4 hours. They do not mind driving down a highway with six lanes on it going 60 to 80 miles an hour. They do not hate REA that gave electricity to rural America. They do not hate the Department of Agriculture for water and sewer systems for rural people. And I could stand here for another hour listing things Government has done, and not a person in this body would vote to undo a single one, although they were highly controversial at the time. Don't you remember how doctors hated Medicare? I can remember how Social Security was a socialist program and TVA was a Communist-inspired program. 
Under the constitutional amendment if we face another depression--it is certainly not out of the realm of reason--you have to get 60 votes here to start putting people back to work like Franklin Roosevelt did. All of the rich people in the country said Franklin Roosevelt was the worst thing that ever happened in this country because he was borrowing money to help people. Do you know what he said? `It is an unfortunate human failing that a full pocketbook often groans more loudly than an empty stomach.' 
Hurricane Hugo, where we spent $5 billion in South Carolina alone; the earthquake in California, for which the cost is incalculable and will continue to be, it would take 60 votes--41 obstreperous, really fundamentally conservative people could say, no, we are not going to unbalance the budget because there are a bunch of people living and dying who should not have been living over a fault anyway. 
Mr. President, this amendment has the potential for creating more mischief, more chaos in this country than anything we have ever considered. And even though it looks as though my side has the necessary 34 votes to keep this thing from going into our precious Constitution, I want to keep talking about it until the American people understand what is at stake.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I will be very brief. A lot of people want to catch airplanes, and I do not want to discommode anybody. But let me close by saying the Senator from Utah has suggested that the constitutional amendment would be so much more effective than my amendment. 
But I ask the Senator from Utah, what provision in the constitutional amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, is more effective than mine? We cannot ignore the Budget Act; 60 votes is 60 votes, whether you are trying to get 60 votes to comply with the constitutional amendment or whether you are trying to get 60 votes to comply with the Budget Act, as my amendment will provide. 
Let me tell you what one of the differences is. Under my amendment, if you cannot get 60 votes, you shut the Government down and you wait for the people here to come to their senses and get the Government open, as we did the year before last. Under the constitutional amendment, if you cannot get the 60 votes, you shut the Government down and go down to the Supreme Court and wait for them to act. Not only is that time-consuming and outrageous, but you are also cutting the three branches of the Government of the United States to two. 
One of the reasons we have this big deficit, which everybody laments--let me say it once more--is because we talk one way and act another. We talk about how we are going to get the budget balanced, and how terrible it is that we cannot get our spending under control, and then we turn around and cut taxes by massive amounts. It is the worst form of snake oil I have ever seen in my life, yet we keep buying into it. We bought into it in 1981, and now we are getting ready to buy into it again. 
All I am saying is, under my amendment, you have everything you have under the constitutional amendment. It is just as tough to comply with--really, tougher--and we exclude Social Security. 
I guess everything is said that needs to be said, so I will close and let the Senator from Utah move to table my amendment.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce three bills which are intended to reform hardrock mining on public land and recover, for taxpayers, lost revenues resulting from the patenting process under the 1872 mining law. 
The 1872 mining law was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant during a time when our national policy was to encourage the settlement of the West with the enticement of free land and minerals. However, 124 years have now passed and the mining law has become a relic. Rather than serve the interests of the public, the mining law gives away billions of dollars worth of land and minerals to mining companies for practically nothing. 
While there are many flaws with the 1872 law, some of the most outrageous include: allowing the sale of public lands and minerals for $2.50 to $5.00 per acre; allowing the mining of valuable minerals without a dime in royalty payments to the taxpayers for those minerals; allowing patented land bought for $2.50 an acre to be resold at market prices--sometimes thousands of dollars per acre; and not adequately protecting the environment. 
Our attitudes toward public resources have changed since the 19th century and so have most of our public policies. While the mining law has been amended indirectly over the years, its basic provisions remain unchanged and are in dire need of reform. Over the years numerous private, government and congressional studies have recommended either revising the mining law or repealing it completely. One of the most thorough modern studies of the mining law was conducted by the Public Land Law Review Commission during the 1960's. The commission's work formed the basis for the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 [FLPMA]. In `One Third of the Nation's Land--A Report to Congress and the President' the commission stated: 
The general mining law of 1872 has been abused, but even without that abuse, it has many deficiencies. Individuals whose primary interest is not in mineral development and production have attempted, under the guise of that law, to obtain use of public lands for various other purposes. The 1872 law offers no means by which the Government can effectively control environmental impacts. 
While the Public Land Review Commission and many others have called for comprehensive mining law reform for some time now, Congress has failed to respond. At a time when the public is clamoring for a more efficient government and a government that treats the taxpayers with dignity and respect, the 1872 mining law instead condones the giveaway of public lands and valuable minerals worth billions of dollars for practically nothing and which permits long-term environmental degradation of our public lands. 
In the last four Congresses I introduced legislation which would have comprehensively reformed the mining law. On each occasion the mining industry went to great lengths to successfully ensure that the 1872 mining law would not be comprehensively reformed. However, Mr. President, as we continue to strive to balance the Federal budget, the day of reckoning for beneficiaries of corporate welfare is getting closer. Eventually, Congress is going to enact real mining law reform. 
The legislation I am introducing today is an effort to seek to protect the interests of the very people that Members of Congress purport to represent--the American people. One hundred twenty-four years after Ulysses Grant signed the mining law the time has come to bring our Nation's mineral policy into the present. 
As always, I am willing to work with people on all sides of this issue in an attempt to develop a solution amenable to all. However, I will not be a party to the efforts of those who, in an effort to end debate on the subject, attempt to enact `sham reform' legislation drafted by the mining industry. 
The problems of the mining law and the proposed solutions contained in the three bills I am introducing today are described more fully below. 
Under the existing mining law, a patent-fee simple title--to a mining claim on Federal lands may be obtained for the purchase price of $2.50 an acre for a placer claim--or $5 an acre for a lode claim--a price which has not changed since 1872. During the last 124 years, the Government has sold more than 3.2 million acres of land under the patent provision of the 1872 mining law, an area similar to the size of the State of Connecticut. This is a giveaway--pure and simple--and is directly contrary to the national policy enunciated in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act--that, in most cases, public lands should be retained in public ownership. 
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that $5 an acre is far less than the fair market value of the patented land and the minerals thereon. In 1994 we witnessed one of the biggest taxpayer ripoffs in the history of the mining law when the Federal Government was forced to grant patents to a subsidiary of a Canadian-owned mining company. In exchange for 1,800 acres of land in Nevada containing more than $10 billion in gold, the Federal Government received the princely sum of less than $10,000. Mr. President, believe it or not, the taxpayers stand to do worse in the very near future. The Stillwater Mining Co., which is jointly owned by Chevron and Manville, has applied for patents on approximately 2,000 acres of Forest Service land in Montana. In exchange for $10,000, the company will receive fee title to land containing, according to Stillwater's own reserve estimates, $35 billion worth of platinum and palladium. 
Congress finally took action in 1994 by imposing a 1-year moratorium on the processing of new patent applications and those applications that were still in the early stages of processing. This moratorium has been renewed the last 2 years, albeit after an effort was made by Senators from the West to repeal it. 
Under the Hardrock Mining Royalty Act of 1997, which I am introducing today, mining claim holders would no longer be able to patent their claims. The sale of Federal lands for $2.50 or $5.00 an acre would be permanently halted. 
In addition to allowing the sale of lands for far less than fair market value, the mining law also permits corporations to mine valuable minerals from public domain lands without paying a nickel in royalties to the landowner--the taxpayers. While oil, gas, and coal producers all pay royalties to the U.S. Treasury for production on Federal lands, the Government doesn't receive anything for hardrock minerals produced on Federal lands subject to the 1872 mining law. 
The hardrock mining companies contend that they would be forced to shut down operations if they were required to pay royalties to the Federal Government. However, these same companies find themselves able to pay royalties for mining operations on State and private lands. In fact, the Newmont Mining Co. pays an 18 percent royalty on land acquired from private interests on a portion of its gold quarry mine in Nevada's Carlin Trend. Ironically, a hardrock miner operating on acquired Federal lands pays a royalty to the Federal Government while his counterpart on lands subject to the mining law pays nothing. There is no justifiable reason for this difference. 
Billions of dollars' worth of hardrock minerals are extracted from the public lands. It is absolutely unfair to the taxpayers of this country to permit hardrock mining companies to enjoy the same tax breaks as others, while failing to adequately compensate the public landowners. The legislation I am introducing today seeks to remedy this result. First, the Hardrock Mining Royalty Act of 1997 would require the payment of a royalty of 5 percent of the net smelter return from mineral production on public lands. Because the royalty would not apply to minerals extracted on lands already patented under the mining law, the Abandoned Mines Reclamation Act of 1997 would required mining companies operating on patented land to pay a net-income-based reclamation fee. Finally, because it makes absolutely no sense to permit mining companies to take advantage of a mineral depletion allowance when they are using taxpayer land without compensating the taxpayers, the elimination of double subsidies for the Hardrock Mining Industry Act of 1997 would repeal the depletion allowance for mining operations on land subject to the 1872 mining law. 
Originally, the mining law required claimants to certify that they performed 100 dollars' worth of work on their mining claims each year in order to maintain their claims. Because many claimants were not serious about mining their claims, Congress replaced the work requirement with a $100 per claim maintenance fee. In conjunction with the administration's proposal the Hardrock Mining Royalty Act increases the fee for new claims to $125. 
Mr. President, past mining activities have left a legacy of unreclaimed lands, acid mine drainage, and hazardous waste. More than 50 abandoned hardrock mining sites are currently on the Superfund national priority list. Some estimate that it could 
cost taxpayers upward of $70 billion to clean all the abandoned mining sites. 
The legislation I am introducing today would create an abandoned mine reclamation fund to help reclaim the many hardrock mining sites which have been abandoned. Money for the fund would come from the royalties and holding fees collected under the Hardrock Mining Royalty Act of 1997 and the reclamation fees collected under the Abandoned Hardrock Mining Reclamation Act of 1997. 
Mr. President, the mining industry knows that the public is slowly learning about the 1872 mining law and the associated atrocities and believe me, the industry is worried. As they have done in the past, I suspect the mining industry will once again raise a smokescreen by proposing so-called reforms. For instance, the mining industry has proposed that instead of paying $2.50 or $5.00 an acre for patents, that instead they pay the fair market value of the surface, regardless of the value of the minerals located on the land. While the concept of fair market value is certainly a good one, it is absurd to argue that the Stillwater Mining Co. would really be paying fair market value if they paid for the surface--probably worth less than $100 an acre--and ignored the value of the platinum and palladium--estimated to be $35 billion. Mr. President, if you or I ran a company which sold land for such fair market value, we would be fired in a New York minute. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to beware of such sham reform.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, while I and a number of my colleagues will come to the floor in the days ahead to introduce specific proposals affecting our Nation's parks and public lands, I would like to talk very generally about the environmental and natural resources agenda of the 105th Congress. My hope is that we have learned from the lessons of the last Congress and will not once again attempt to undo the most effective and progressive network of environmental laws in the world. 
Over 25 years ago, with overwhelming bipartisan support, the National Forest Management Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Clean Water Act were enacted into law. 
Today, as a result of those and other laws passed with strong support from both sides of the aisle, people are more actively involved in management of their public lands, more people are using public lands for recreation than ever before, our air and waters are cleaner, hunting and fishing is better, our Government is more open about the effects of its actions on the health and safety of families and local communities, and rare species such as the bald eagle and grizzly bear are thriving. 
By protecting our natural resource heritage, we have become a wiser, stronger, and healthier Nation. 
At times we have a tendency to overlook the value--our moral and ethical obligation--to pass on healthy lands and waters to our children's children. How else can we explain efforts in the last Congress--and proposals by some of my colleagues today--to rewrite, overturn, or significantly weaken the protections afforded all Americans by these laws? 
In this regard, I was encouraged by the recent words of Mike Dombeck, the new Chief of the Forest Service. His first day on the job, Chief Dombeck said:  
More and more, people are realizing that their jobs and professions, the quality of the water they drink and the air they breathe--the very fabric of their lives --are dependent on the land that sustains them. 
Dombeck told his employees that this Nation's environmental laws: 
. . . represent the conservation values of mainstream America. Do not be disturbed by the debate surrounding their execution. This is background noise to a complex society and healthy, properly functioning democracy. There is an ongoing debate in this Nation over how national forests and rangelands should be managed. That's just fine. In fact, it is healthy. Debate and information are the essence of democracy. The people we serve, all of the American people, are now more fully engaged in defining how their public land legacy should be managed. 
The new Chief succinctly stated what we inside the beltway sometimes forget, `We cannot meet the needs of the people if we do not first conserve and restore the health of the land.' This Nation is blessed by a public land legacy that is the envy of the world. Our taxpayer-owned lands are the refuge of last resort for vanishing species. Moreover, these lands enable our children to experience the solitude of wilderness, pristine clear lakes, and a hunting and fishing experience unexcelled in pure delight anywhere else. 
Last year many Members of Congress were shocked by the outrage of our citizenry over the efforts to dramatically cut the EPA budget. In 1960, 65 percent of our lakes and streams were neither swimmable nor fishable. Today 65 percent of our lakes and streams are swimmable and are fishable, and I can tell you, our people want that progress to continue until we reach 100 percent. I applaud Chief Dombeck's views and encourage my colleagues to allow him the time and resources to make the policy and personnel changes needed to achieve his critically important vision. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, tonight the President will address the Nation on the State of the Union. I do not know precisely what the President is going to say, particularly about the economy and about the budget, tax cuts, the deficit, crime, education, the environment, and so on. I am sure he will address each one of those things and more. 
But I would be less than candid with my colleagues and my constituents--and I would be less than honest with myself--if I did not voice some concerns about what I have been reading about what the Republicans want in the way of tax cuts and what the President wants in the way of tax cuts, what the President wants in the way of Medicare cuts, and what the Republicans want in Medicare cuts, what kind of incentives we want for our children to attend college, what kind of a tax cut we want for so-called middle class people. 
So let me address those issues seriatim and say, first of all, it is my understanding that the proposal which has been in the public domain for some time now to cut Medicare by $138 billion over the next 6 years will probably be fairly well applauded. Nobody is going to object to any proposal that makes the Medicare system sounder and gives our elderly Medicare recipients a better sense of security. Anything we can do to cause the American elderly population to sleep better at night because they know the Medicare system is sound and will be sound for the foreseeable future is a highly desirable goal. 
Now, having said that, I think the Republicans will want to cut Medicare more than $138 billion. And I am not saying they are right or wrong. I do not know what the figure ought to be. I might support additional proposals to do anything to make the Medicare system sounder than $138 billion will make it. 
But having said that, I am puzzled by how you achieve a balanced budget while you are cutting $138 billion in Medicare, which alone would go right on the budget deficit over the next 6 years, I believe it is. 
But we do not stop with that. The Republicans do not stop with it and the Democrats do not stop with it. 
The Republicans have a proposal of a tax cut which they call the middle class tax cut. It is designed to provide a $500 tax credit for each child in the family, but it is not refundable. 
That means that if you are making $30,000 a year, and you pay $1,500 in taxes, you would get $1,500 back if you have three children--$500 for each child. 
But if you happen to have a $30,000 income, and six children, and you do not pay any tax, you get nothing. 
So the simple question must be asked, who needs a tax cut more, the parents with three children or the parents with six children? 
Move on down the ladder to $25,000, move on down the ladder to $20,000, a single mother with one child who is working as a waitress in a Senate cafeteria. Her tax bill is $1,000, we will say. She would get $500. But if she had three children and was still paying $1,000, she would get $1,000, but nothing for the third child. 
The third scenario: If she has children and is paying no 
tax, she gets nothing. And on top of that, as the Presiding Officer will tell you, and recall, we cut the earned income tax credit last year, which is so beneficial to the mother who is a waitress in a Senate cafeteria that I just described because she is entitled to an earned income tax credit by staying on the job and off of welfare. 
No less a person than Ronald Reagan said it was the greatest incentive for staying off welfare he could think of. Every President since that thing first came into effect has said that this is one of the best incentives to keep people off of welfare we have. That is to say, `If you stay on the job all year long, don't get on welfare, and if you make less than $28,000 a year, we'll give you a sum of money at the end of the year, as high as $2,000.' 
So what are we doing here? What kind of social policy is it? Forget economics. What kind of social policy is it when we give money to people who have one or two children and pay income tax, give no money to people who work and pay no income tax because they have enough dependents to keep them from paying taxes and maybe whose income was cut this year because we cut the earned income tax credit? What kind of fairness is that? 
So, Mr. President, I am troubled about the so-called $500 tax rebate for all your children. It is not refundable. Only if you pay taxes do you get it. Obviously, the people who are hurting most are not paying taxes because they do not make enough money. 
Then we have this proposed capital gains tax cut. As I read the Republican proposal, CBO scores it to cost $33 billion over the next 5 years and $111 billion over the next 10 years. And who do you think gets the majority of the benefit? Why, it is the people who own stock in Microsoft and Intel and IBM. It is the people who are big investors in the stock market. 
The rate of 28 percent on capital gains may be a tad high. There is probably nobody in this room who would quarrel with that. But if you are trying to balance the budget, which we have been doing a magnificent job of for the past 4 years, why do we want to muck it up and start cutting taxes, which is absolutely guaranteed to start the deficit back up again? 
We tried that in 1981, cutting taxes massively, increasing defense spending massively, and winding up today with a $5.2 trillion debt. This is the slowest learning crowd I have ever seen. It is worse than trying to housebreak a dog I had one time. We just could not do it. 
So what are we doing talking about these massive tax cuts and balancing the budget at the same time? It has never worked, and it never will. Where did all this talk get started? If you are going to cut taxes, cut taxes for people who honestly need the money. 
If you cut capital gains, with 75 percent of the benefit going to people who make over $100,000, where is it going to go? Probably into the stock market. The mutual funds are putting $15 billion a month into the market right now. Who here believes that the stock market can absorb those kinds of investments? Everything that goes up has to come down at some point or another. But I am talking about the Republican proposal. 
And now the President is going to announce tonight apparently a proposed capital gains tax cut for people who have homes worth $500,000. 
If you bought a home 20 years ago for $100,000 and you sell it today for $500,000, under the proposal of the President you would not pay a nickel tax. 
I remember many years ago when we passed an exemption for homeowners to exclude $150,000 of the price tag. You could do that one time in your life, a $150,000 exclusion. If you had a $500,000 home that you had paid $100,000 for, you not only get your $100,000 cost back, you can add $150,000 to that and you have $250,000 capital gains on which you would pay a 28 percent tax. The President's proposal is that if you have a $500,000 home and you sell it for $500,000 there is no tax, no matter what you paid for it. You may have paid $25,000 for it and it may be worth $500,000 today because somebody wants to build a McDonald's where you are living, no tax. Now, Mr. President, would you like to know how many people in this country have a home that is valued in excess of $500,000? The answer is 1 percent. The President's proposal of a $500,000 exclusion will take care of 99 percent of all the homeowners in America. I do not know what the cost of it is supposed to be. 
These things are all laudable. I never lost a vote voting for a tax cut. When you tell people you are for tax cuts, everybody applauds. If there is anything people want to hear, it is that they are overtaxed, they are overregulated, they are overeverything. I understand their frustration. 
But let me ask you this: When you have an economy that grew at 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996--that is a staggering growth rate--with an inflation rate of 2.2 percent, about as low as you can ever get it, Treasury bills at 5 percent as of yesterday, the unemployment rate as low as it ever gets, in short, you have an economy that is performing absolutely magnificently, and the deficit has gone from $290 billion in 1992 to $107 billion, a 63-percent reduction in 1996, what are we going to do? We are going to start pandering again. Why can we not focus on that deficit? The people of this country have a nonnegotiable demand that we balance the budget. 
Do you know why a lot of people are going to vote for the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States? Do you think it is because they think it is sound economic or social policy? I do not like to denigrate other people. It is arrogant to do that. But I can tell you one reason is because they have seen the polls. I know what the polls show. One of the reasons the polls show so many people want a constitutional amendment to balance the budget is two things. No. 1, they think a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and a balanced budget are the same thing. A constitutional amendment does not guarantee you anything. Yes, it does, too: It guarantees you chaos. It is the biggest political scam ever perpetrated and foisted off on an unsuspecting public that can bring nothing but utter chaos to this Nation down the road. 
Do you know something? People did not elect 100 Senators to come up here and vote however the polls show every time. They elected people to come up here and to think, to read the Constitution, understand the sacredness of the Constitution, understanding that every single little problem that comes up ought not to be solved by tinkering with that sacred document. I have never voted for a constitutional amendment. I thought in 1984 when I voted against that great constitutional amendment of prayer in school that I was serving my last term in the Senate. Do you know something? I went home and I went from one end of the State to the other explaining to the people of my State what that meant, how the school boards could pick the prayers the children would say and tell them how many times a day they would say them. What kind of nonsense is that, giving up the greatest religious freedoms we have to the local school board? Do you know what? I had the fundamentalists and the mainliners and everybody clapping and cheering because they did not want that either. But at least I did not hesitate to talk to them about it and tell them where it would lead us. 
So I do not have any hesitancy today in coming to the floor and saying I am very apprehensive about all the tax cut proposals. Why are we going to cut $138 billion from Medicare and turn right around and give it away in tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America? That is not my idea of responsible legislation. That is not my idea of a responsible economy. If you want a balanced budget, now is the time to show it, and do not tell me you will hide behind this constitutional amendment and go home and say, `I did my part. I cut taxes and then I voted for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.' 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Electric Consumers Protection Act of 1997. This bill provides for the transition toward deregulation and competition in electricity generation. 
While very few people, including myself, find a discussion of the electric utility industry and the many laws and regulations governing the industry exciting, the fact is that electricity is an extremely important commodity which affects everyone on a daily basis. Any event that increases or reduces electric rates can impact: First, the lives of the poor and those on fixed incomes that depend on electricity to heat their homes in the winter and cool them in the summer; second, the price of goods we buy every day; as well as, third, the competitiveness of our factories. In addition, decisions made by electric generators often have a direct effect on our environment as well as our national security. 
So, it is not at all inconsequential that the electric industry, which has remained relatively static for the last 60 years, is about to undergo a fundamental change. Instead of the traditional vertically integrated local utility, which generates power at its own plants, transmits that power over its own lines, and sells that power to all consumers in a particular area, consumers will soon be bombarded with all sorts of offers from companies competing to become their power supplier, and other entrepreneurs will be seeking to buy large blocks of power to serve certain kinds of consumers. Naturally, these changes are bound to create considerable apprehension among utilities, their shareholders, and consumers. 
Mr. President, there are some who would prefer that we maintain the status quo. However, it is becoming increasingly certain that competition is inevitable. At least six States--California, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Massachusetts--have already enacted legislation or promulgated regulations providing for competition. A number of other States have established proceedings to determine how to move toward competition. In all, more than 40 States have either ordered, or are examining the possibility of requiring, deregulation of the retail electric markets. 
Theoretically, introducing competition among electric power providers should produce greater efficiencies and lower electric rates. Certainly large industrial consumers of electricity would see significant reductions in their energy bills, but I am more concerned about the potential impact on residential and small commercial consumers--the biscuit cookers as we call them in Arkansas. Generating 
companies may be less eager to compete to serve these customers, especially those located in rural areas. This reduced bargaining power could also end up causing residential and small commercial customers to pay for those costs arising from the transition to competition--that is, stranded costs--costs that industrial consumers can more easily avoid. 
I believe it is the role of both Congress and the States to ensure that the biscuit cookers also benefit. It is not enough to simply proclaim that the days of the utilities' vertically integrated monopolies are over. We also have a solemn obligation to be fair to utility companies that have been operating in reliance on the ground rules we all created over the last 60 years. This will require a careful balancing of competing interests. Everyone will benefit by restructuring if it is done properly, and I consider this an absolutely essential result. 
Mr. President, I am introducing this bill to begin the debate in the 105th Congress about how best to promote an orderly transition to a competitive retail electric market. This legislation is designed with the goals of allowing all consumers to enjoy the benefits of competition while not penalizing utilities for prudent decisions they made under the previous regulatory system. 
There is significant debate over whether Congress should even pass legislation on this subject. The argument that the States should decide these issues certainly has some merit. After all, retail electric service has generally been the domain of the States, although requirements imposed at the Federal level by both FERC and Congress have had a direct impact on retail rates and service. 
But I personally believe a State-by-State approach could produce a lot of unintended consequences which would limit the benefits associated with retail competition. Electric generation markets are becoming increasingly regional and even multiregional. What happens in one State can have direct and indirect impacts on consumers and utilities located in another State. Utilities operating in more than one State can be subjected to conflicting regulatory regimes which could impact the way they operate their systems and the electric rates paid by consumers. 
This phenomenon is best illustrated by the multistate utility holding companies registered under the Public Utility Holding Company Act [PUHCA}. I have had a lot of experience with registered holding companies because two of them serve my home State of Arkansas. These holding companies generally plan for, and operate, generating facilities on a systemwide basis for the benefit of 
customers in the entire region served by the company. If restructuring proceeds on a State-by-State basis, these holding companies would find themselves subjected to different requirements which could negatively impact consumers. 
For example, the Entergy System serves retail customers in parts of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Arkansas. If Louisiana and Texas were to order retail competition and Arkansas and Mississippi decided to delay competition, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for Entergy to operate a system of generating facilities designed to serve a particular load over a four-State area. It is quite possible that consumers in Arkansas and Mississippi would wind up paying more for their service. Entergy's captive customers in Arkansas and Mississippi could be further disadvantaged to the extent Entergy were to become financially imperiled as a result of the retail competition orders in Texas and Louisiana.

Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the Public Confidence in Campaigns Act of 1997 for Senator Murray and myself. We chose that title because the purpose of the bill is to establish public finance of political campaigns in this country. 
The McCain-Feingold bill, of course, is the topic right now. That is the one that the press talks about. That is the one that everybody in the Senate is looking at. I am for the McCain-Feingold bill--and I have the utmost respect for the authors of the bill--but I can tell you that the McCain-Feingold bill is only a small step in the right direction, if the people of this body are really interested in reversing the pervasive cynicism about the political process that is abroad in our country. 
Everybody knows that the money game is out of control in politics. Contributions during the last 2 years--that is, soft money and hard money combined--was up 73 percent from 1993 and 1994. You think about it. A 73-percent increase. I have no reason to believe that the increase will not be another 50 to 100 percent in the 2-year cycle prior to the year 2000. Why wouldn't the American people be cynical? The average Senate race today costs $4 million. I have never spent more than $1.5 million, not because of choice but because I am a lousy fundraiser. I never had it. But the average Senate race is $4 million. In California, $20 to $25 million is now typical for each of the candidates. 
More and more millionaires are running for Congress because it is obvious that money dictates the outcome. Ninety percent of the people who are elected to Congress spent more money than their opponents. That means if you are a millionaire, or if you have the ability to raise more money than your opponent, you have a 90-percent chance of being elected. That is what the statistics show. The Congress is supposed to be a microcosm of America. There are at least 25 to 35 millionaires in the U.S. Senate. There are hardly 25 percent of the American people who are millionaires. 
In 1995 and 1996, 400 corporations, labor unions, and individuals--400--gave the two major parties $100,000 or more in soft money. I repeat: Soft and hard money to the political parties is up 73 percent in 2 years. Even the stock market has not gone up that fast. And rightly or wrongly the cynicism of the American people about our political system is reflected in the small number of people in this country who contribute to campaigns. Why? Because `Joe Lunch Bucket' out there has this nagging suspicion that $100,000 contributions, $500,000 contributions, or even $5,000 individual contributions, are completely out of his league. He knows that his $10 or $15 is going nowhere. That is the one of the reasons he does not bother to vote. He has no confidence in his own ability to participate and make a difference, the very foundation of a democracy. And `Joe Lunch Bucket' knows that people who give $100,000 are not giving money out of patriotism and altruism. 
For the whole process of Federal election in the last 2 years the parties and the individual candidates spent $2 billion. That is a staggering sum of money. Campaign spending 20 years ago when we started reforming the system was a mere fraction of $2 billion. 
This morning, yesterday morning, every morning you pick up the Washington Post and the New York Times, and you'll see a story in there about the influence of money. It isn't just soft money given by Indonesians or aliens. The Times last week had a story showing that Members who vote right on particular issues get five times as much money later on from the people who benefit from that right vote than they had gotten in the past. 
As long as we finance campaigns the way we are financing them now, the Post and the Times will continue to have a field day, and the Members of Congress will be like gladiators in the arena for the amusement and enjoyment of people who like to watch the battle. I am not being critical of the press for reporting these stories. All I am saying is that democracy is threatened by cynicism. 
The formula for voluntary limits in the McCain-Feingold bill is a step in the right direction. It's the same formula we have in our bill: $400,000 plus 30 cents for the first 4 million eligible voters in your State; 25 cents for every eligible voter over 4 million with a minimum of $950,000 and maximum of $5.5 million. My State of Arkansas would get the minimum, $950,000, in a Senate race, and a maximum of $5.5 million would apply in California. And the figure of $5.5 million as a maximum is not an inducement for a Senate candidate in California to accept public funding and comply with that kind of a maximum when they are spending $20 to $25 million each in California. But let us admit it: Even $5.5 million is an obscene amount of money. That is what you get if you voluntarily limit the amount of money you are going to spend. If you agree, if you are from Arkansas, to accept $950,000, in the general election you will get full funding from the U.S. Treasury. And I will come back to where the money comes from in just a moment. 
Mr. President, there is a fundamental question being asked in this country. And, if it isn't being asked, it ought to be; that is, how long can a democracy survive when the laws we pass and the people we elect depend on how much special interest money is put into a campaign? And consider the fact that the candidate with the most money wins 90 percent of the time. That speaks volumes. When you consider the fact that if you vote right on a bill that benefits somebody, and you get five times as much money from that somebody as you got in the past, that speaks volumes. Of course, our democracy is threatened when we continue this money game. 
There is a study by the Library of Congress--and anybody who is interested in it, if they will drop me a line or call me, I will send them a copy of it--of campaign finance in 19 nations. And other than the United States only 1 of the 19 nations, Malaysia, finances campaigns with private contributions. 
We are the only Western nation that finances campaigns with private contributions in this way. 
Mr. President, we may not pass this bill, but until a public finance bill passes, the media will continue to have a field day, and you can expect a story, not because you did anything illegal or unethical, but you can depend on a story anytime you vote on a major piece of legislation if anybody who benefited from that gave you money in the last election in any significant amount. And the people will harbor those same suspicions. 
Why would the people of this body and the House of Representatives not want to get rid of such a system? They are the ones who are most vulnerable, to say nothing of the destruction of our democracy. Even under the McCain-Feingold bill, which I will support, you still are going to have special interest money, and it is not going to eliminate the basic problem, which is cynicism about what that money buys. 
So, Mr. President, it is an interesting thing that the people of this body--and I have talked to a number trying to recruit cosponsors, Republicans and Democrats--almost without exception say, `I know public financing is where we are going, but not yet. Later.' 
Why later? McCain-Feingold has gotten all the attention, and perhaps McCain-Feingold is the most we can hope for this year, but it is time to start the debate on the public finance legislation that everybody in this body knows is absolutely essential to our future. It is going to pass. I may not be here when it passes, but I can promise you it is going to pass. 
Everybody is playing the stock market today. The market has been on a roll, up about 30 percent in 1996. You cannot lose. Just put it on anything, they say. You cannot lose. I will tell you of a better investment than putting your money in the stock market, and that is to put your money into this Congressional Election Campaign Fund we are proposing and take special interest money out of the political process. You talk about a return on your investment. That will be the biggest return America ever got on every dollar it puts in. 
People in the coffee shops of America do not do as they used to. One time about 2 years ago, I was in my hometown in the coffee shop where I used to drink coffee in this little town of 1,500, 2,000 people, and the subject came up with some of my old coffee-drinking buddies about public financing. The first thing I heard was, `I don't want my tax money going to politicians to finance campaigns.' And I gave that friend of mine a lesson in 103-A civics and 103-A economics. No. 1, he has a civic duty to participate, which he does not do. He is not giving any of his private money, which is his right, and he does not want his tax money to be used, which is an abdication of his responsibility and an abdication of everything he believes about campaign finance because he is willing to let the rich people and wealthy organizations of the country give the money and yet it causes the very cynicism he exemplifies and that we are trying to remedy. 
Why would the people of this body say `later' to public finance? Admittedly, 10 years ago, only 27 percent of the people believed public financing of campaigns was a good idea. But it has worked beautifully since 1976 for the Presidential campaign, and it will work for us. Why would it not? And why would Senators in 1997 be afraid to vote for public financing of campaigns when 68 percent of the people in a Mark Mellman Poll this fall said they favor the law in Maine, the only State in the Nation which has passed a full public funding campaign bill. And 68 percent of the people, when you explain the Maine bill, say, `I favor it.' And 65 percent of the people in this country in a Gallup Poll said they favored banning all private contributions and believed in 100 percent public financing of campaigns. 
Let me describe the details of the bill very quickly and then I will introduce the bill. 
First of all, it establishes a Congressional Election Campaign Fund. And here is the way it works. When you file your tax 
returns today, there is a provision there which says that if you would like to direct $3 of your tax payment to the Presidential campaign fund, check here. It does not cost you a thing. You think about that. It does not cost you a thing; it is deducted from your taxes, and yet people are declining all the time to check the $3 contribution box even though their taxes are reduced by $3. It is really Federal funds. And yet we have to constantly prop people up and tell them it is their patriotic duty to contribute to that. 
I found it very healthy in the last campaign to know that Senator Dole and President Clinton were using money in equal amounts. They were not out asking for private contributions. Each one of them said, `I will participate,' and each one of them received about $60 million, and they got along just fine. 
Under our bill, you can give $10, if you want, $3 to the Presidential campaign, $7 to the congressional campaign. As I said, that $10 contribution will pay you bigger dividends by far than any investment you ever made in your life. You will not have to worry why somebody voted for or against a bill; at least you will know they did not do it because somebody gave them money in the last campaign or has promised to give them money in a future campaign. 
And, in addition to the $10, we allow Americans to add on to their tax payment a contribution to the Congressional Election Campaign Fund. Wealthy people--and there are about 5 times as many millionaires right now as there were 10 years ago--would be allowed to give up to $5,000 to this campaign fund just because they are patriots. Up to $100 of this add-on is tax deductible. And if their spouses join in it, they have a $200 tax deduction. It is not much, a small incentive. But wouldn't it be wonderful if all the people worth $1 million, $5 million, $10 million in this country, or even those of ordinary means, would contribute $5,000 to that fund just because they love the country, believe in democracy and want to see it thrive? 
We also have a provision that, if the fund runs dry, Congress will appropriate the deficiency. If Congress refuses to appropriate the deficiency, then everybody will be reduced on a pro rata basis. 
Let me repeat. You do not qualify for this money unless you agree to limit your spending according to the formula that is set out in the bill. How do you get to the general election for full funding, since we have primaries before the general? Well, we will participate in that, too. And here is the way we do that. You can spend 60 percent of what you can spend in a general. 
Back to my home State of Arkansas, let us assume we are eligible for $1 million. We can spend 60 percent of that in the primary, or $600,000, and, of the $600,000, you must raise 50 percent of that, or $300,000. So, to that extent, you still have to go out with your tin cup and raise $300,000. Contributions are still limited to $1,000, just as they are under existing law. But before you can even qualify for primary money, you have to raise $25,000 in $100 contributions from within your State. That is not harsh. Anybody in the State of Arkansas, or any other State, that cannot get 250 people to give $100 does not have any business running. He is not credible. But, once you raise $25,000, then you become eligible for 50 percent Federal funding in the primary. 
We eliminate totally soft money. Soft money is what the investigation of contributions to the DNC is all about. When you consider the fact that soft money contributions and hard money contributions to the parties is up 73 percent--get rid of it. Who needs this investigation we are getting ready to launch here in the Congress? You think about all the people's business that we need to be conducting, and what are we doing? Holding an investigation about all the Indonesian money and alien money. Not only do we eliminate soft money, we say that no illegal alien, or even a legal alien, can contribute, unless they are eligible to vote. Nobody--nobody can contribute in these campaigns unless they are eligible to vote. I think that is about as good a test as you can find. 
Let us assume, in the next election, I say, `OK, I am going to limit my spending to $1 million.' That is the limit under my bill for this State. And I agree I will limit my spending to $1 million. My opponent, who happens to be worth $100 million says, `You have to be kidding. I am planning to buy this election. I have $100 million to do it with.' Then, for every dollar he spends above $1 million, we will match up to 100 percent, which would be $2 million. 
If you are running against a man or a woman who is willing to spend $10 million of his or her own money, I think you could win. I can tell you a story of a Governor's race in Arkansas in 1970. There was a young, good looking, dynamic man running for Governor down there who spent $300,000 dollars and beat somebody who spent $3.5 million. 
You can shame people. You can shame people for spending too much money of their own. Sometimes shame is not enough because, as I have already pointed out, 90 percent of the time the candidate who spends the most money wins. So maybe our bill is not perfect on that score, but it will exact a political price from those who seek to buy an election by outspending a candidate who accepts these limits. 
And, on independent expenditures, the bane of the Nation, these unnamed, unseen people who run television ads calling you every scurrilous name under the shining Sun, they don't mention the name of the guy running against you, they just tell the voters what a terrible guy you are--using whatever is a hot issue at the time, `He voted to burn American flags'--they never mention the opponent. Under our bill, if you have an independent expenditure of $1,000 or more, you have to report it within 24 hours, and if you spend more than $10,000 on independent expenditures, we will match that for the poor guy who has volunteered to limit his spending. The only difference between our bill and McCain-Feingold on PAC's is that we allow a $2,000 PAC contribution, and McCain-Feingold only allows $1,000. The current level is $5,000. 
Let me elaborate just a moment on that. I am not a person who thinks PAC's are inherently evil. I think any time a group of people who get together and contribute to a fund because they would like to have some influence, rather than just giving $10, $20, $50, $100 apiece, they ought to be allowed to do that. 
As I have already said, we only allow people who can vote in this country in Federal elections to contribute. And, if you agree to accept Federal funding, $10,000 is the maximum amount of your own money you can spend. And our bill takes effect in all elections after December 31, 1998. 
Mr. President, while my bill is not perfect, we have been working on it for 4 months. We have met through staff conferences. I have talked to other Senators. I can tell you, the time has come to deal with public finance. I guess the best way to close--I think about a movie, one of my three or four all-time favorite movies, `To Kill A Mockingbird.' Gregory Peck was a country lawyer, and I guess I relate to it because I was a country lawyer. You remember, he was defending a black man charged with rape, who was totally innocent, in a small Southern town. The case was charged with racism. 
He made the most eloquent speech to the jury in his closing argument, and he finished by saying, `For God's sake, do your duty.' I cannot think of a better way to end this statement to my colleagues. The time has come to do our duty to salvage, to save our democracy.
