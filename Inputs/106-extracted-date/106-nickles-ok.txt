   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, everyone has been focused on the Presidential election. It has been one of the most drawn out Presidential elections in U.S. history. Another election came to conclusion recently, and that was the Senate race in the State of Washington, one of the closest Senate races in many years. It took weeks to discern. 
   Our friend and colleague, Senator SLADE GORTON, was defeated. I want to make a couple comments concerning our colleague, Senator GORTON. 
   I had hoped he would not lose this race because he is a friend of mine and, in my opinion, he is one of the most outstanding Senators we have had. 
   By way of a little history, I was elected with Senator GORTON in 1980. Both of us were freshman Senators. He was formerly an attorney general. He gained some attention nationwide in that he and his family bicycled all the way across our country. It shows they are a close family and individuals with endurance and athletic talent. 
   He is an outstanding Senator. He lost reelection in 1986, unfortunately. A lot of people lost. It was a tough year. That was certainly one of the toughest losses we had. I remember stating at that time when Senator GORTON lost that he was a Senator's Senator. I hated to see him lose that race. He showed great endurance and came back in 1988 and won and also won reelection in 1994. As I mentioned, he was just defeated in a very close race in 2000. 
   Senator GORTON has served 18 years in the Senate. In his last two consecutive terms, he was chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee and worked on a couple of different 
   Appropriations subcommittees. He did an outstanding job with the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee which has enormous responsibility. He handled that with great skill and in a bipartisan way. 
   People ask: Can the Senate function? Can we work in a bipartisan manner? I look at Senator GORTON and his leadership on the Interior Subcommittee, working with Senator BYRD and Senator REID. He has proven it can happen and has shown how it can happen and should happen. 
   He is an outstanding Senator. He has handled his defeat with great class. There was a recount, and he congratulated MARIA CANTWELL as the victor. We are proud to call him our colleague and our friend. Certainly he will be missed in this body; certainly his leadership will be missed in the State of Washington.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, Senator BOB KERREY from Nebraska, as most people know, was a former Governor of Nebraska. He has completed two terms in the Senate. I, for one, hate to see him leave the Senate. I have had the pleasure of working with Senator KERREY on the Finance Committee. He has shown great courage. 
   He is a person who has been willing to talk about difficult issues: Curbing the growth of entitlements, Medicare, and Medicaid. He worked on the commission that was also chaired, I think, by Senators BREAUX, FRIST, and THOMAS, and was an outstanding member in saying: Let's make some of the tough choices; let's make some of those tough choices now. 
   He is a person who has been willing to reach out and work in a bipartisan fashion, such as on personal savings accounts for Social Security, reforming Social Security. 
   He has courage. He has conviction. He has shown it time and time again with his service in the Senate, with his activities in the Senate and outside the Senate. 
   Everyone knows he is a Medal of Honor winner. I think of him as a competitor, as a friend, as a colleague. Some of us jog on occasion. Senator KERREY jogs and jogs quite well. That is very inspirational because he also has an artificial leg. 
   He has a great personality. I think he has made a great contribution to the Senate. He has helped improve the quality of the Senate, and certainly he will be missed. I think he has announced he is going to be a university president. That will be very much to the gain of that university. He will be sorely missed in the Senate. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York for his leadership, as well as Senator ROTH. 
   This is an area where we have worked in a bipartisan way with the administration. It is important on international trade work. It is important that we avoid countertariffs that could possibly be enacted. I think it is good  news. I am glad we were able to get it passed. I am glad we could have some bipartisan cooperation. I think in many respects that is due to the leadership of the Senator from New York and the Senator from Delaware. I compliment both for their leadership, and I am pleased we are able to pass this legislation today. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, one, I wish to respond to my colleague and my friend from Oregon. He is my friend. We happen to have a disagreement on this issue. We have a difference of opinion, a rather pronounced difference of opinion. I heard several things in his statement that I want to correct. I almost don't know where to start. 
   First, let me touch on a couple of things on procedure. This is so wrong procedurally and should not be in this bill. 
   Again, he is my good friend, but he has known all along I would try to get this bill on the floor. Yes, it was put in the tax bill. I tried to put it in the appropriations bill. We ended up putting it in a tax bill. Is that the best way to legislate? No. 
   I might tell my colleagues and my friend from Oregon I tried about half a dozen different ways to pull the bill up, to have it be an amendable state, to offer my colleague from Oregon or others a chance to have relevant amendments, and those offers were always rejected. So now we have the bill before the Senate. 
   I might also mention, if one is complaining about this procedure, then we shouldn't have any problem with the Commerce-State-Justice because the administration is trying to put an amnesty provision that doesn't belong on the Commerce-State-Justice bill. 
   It did not pass either the House or the Senate, and is totally extraneous to the conference. 
   Senator BYRD had one dealing with trade that was on an appropriations bill. It should not have been. It was inserted. 
   At least this bill did pass the House by over 100 votes. It did pass the Judiciary Committee. It has had hearings. It has been marked up. It has had 42 cosponsors--maybe my friend and colleague from Oregon has been able to convince one or two to get off. Senator LIEBERMAN is still a principal cosponsor, to my knowledge. He testified in favor of this legislation, as have I. So this legislation is not new. It is not a surprise. 
   My colleague from Oregon has sent several letters to all colleagues saying what is wrong with the legislation. I have sent several letters to all of our colleagues saying he was incorrect. So everyone knows about this bill and everyone knows at some point we are going to have a debate on it. I hope it will be passed. 
   Let me touch on a couple of issues that were brought up. My colleague from Oregon said if this bill is passed it is going to tell a million people in Oregon who voted for this on a ballot initiative, a referendum, that their vote does not mean anything. I disagree with that. This bill does not overturn Oregon's law. I want to be very clear about this. This bill does not say anything about making Oregon's law null and void. What this bill does is it deals with pain and pain management. The bill does say: Oregon, you cannot overturn Federal law. It doesn't say quite that. Federal law, the controlling law, is the Controlled Substances Act. That is a Federal law. It passed in 1970. It controls very strong drugs, I tell my friend from New York. These are deadly drugs. They are strong drugs. They are under Federal control. They are not under State control; they are under Federal control. It is a Federal Controlled Substances Act. The State of Oregon cannot pass a law that changes a Federal statute. 
   I make the analogy, Oklahoma might say let's legalize heroin. Oklahomans might pass that in a referendum, but it doesn't make heroin legal. It is still against the Federal law to use heroin. These are federally controlled drugs. They are deadly if they are used in very large quantities, but they are also very helpful. They can help alleviate pain. Unfortunately, we have a real problem in pain. I heard my colleague from California mention she knew a friend who was in enormous pain. We all have friends or families or have known people who are suffering and suffering greatly. I want to alleviate their pain. That is one reason why this bill was created.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, my colleague was reading a few letters. Incidentally, he kept talking about the American Cancer Association. I do not think they ever wrote a letter saying they were opposed to the bill. He made it sound like they did. I do not know if they did. He has one that is maybe questionable on the bill. 
   We have dozens which spent a lot of time supporting us. The National Hospice Association, the group that takes in individuals in their later years, particularly in the years where they are close to death, supports this bill. So the allegations that this might have a chilling impact is hogwash. To make an allegation that this might be offensive to States rights is absolute hogwash. That is not correct. 
   We are not overturning Oregon's law. Oregon cannot overturn Federal statute. Do we want to repeal the Federal Controlled Substances Act? The Federal Government has been controlling these strong drugs before that act. There was another act that passed years before, but the Federal Controlled Substances Act is what I am amending and clarifying that legitimate medical purposes includes pain management. 
   What is wrong with that? It also says assisted suicide is not a legitimate medical purpose. Think of that. We have had a Federal statute on the books since 1970 to control very strong drugs because we know they are deadly, we know they are hazardous. So the Federal Government passed a law regulating these drugs. 
   The State of Oregon said: Let's legalize assisted suicide, and we will pretend that is a legitimate medical purpose. The Drug Enforcement Administration said: No, it is not. The Attorney General wrote a letter that it is in 49 States, but it is not in Oregon because we did not prohibit assisted suicide. 
   The Controlled Substances Act says these drugs can be used for legitimate medical purposes. It did not say anything about assisted suicide. So the Attorney General comes up with this weird analysis: Maybe it's not prohibited. The Drug Enforcement Administration before her said: No, assisted suicide is not a legitimate medical purpose. The Drug Enforcement Administration is right, and they have been the ones enforcing this law for the last 30 years. 
   Oregon should live under the law just like every other State in the Nation. In 49 States, you cannot use these drugs right now--you cannot use them in Arkansas or in any other State in the Nation because they are Federal controlled substances and they can only be used for legitimate medical purposes. You cannot use the drugs in assisted suicide except in Oregon because the Attorney General says maybe it is OK. 
   The law says you can use them to alleviate pain but not assisted suicide. We put that in the bill. I mention that to my friend from Nevada and my friend from Oregon. It is awfully important that people understand the substance of this legislation, and this  legislation would not have a chilling impact. We would not have all these organizations from the American Medical Association to the American Hospice Association supporting this bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to review the letters Senator WYDEN and I have provided to further complement their knowledge on this issue. I urge them to review the materials we are printing in the RECORD, and I urge them to support this bill. 
   I am proud of the fact that 40-some colleagues, maybe 38 now--maybe a couple names were removed--support this bill; Democrats and Republicans support this bill, including Senator LIEBERMAN, who testified with me on a couple of occasions on this bill. I look forward to its adoption and enactment this year. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

   Mr. NICKLES. One, I thank my colleague from South Dakota, the minority leader, for his statement. I think that would be a great idea. We need to pass these conference reports, and send them to the President. Somebody said, there is a veto threat on one or two of them, and on Commerce-State-Justice. I think there is some work going on right now, and some things could happen that would make it possible for that bill to be signed. 
   I do not know if the President has threatened to veto the tax bill. Regardless, we need to get these completed. It would be great if we could get them completed today or on Monday or Tuesday, but if we could do it today, I think it would be in the interest of all of our colleagues. Certainly, I know Senator STEVENS doesn't think it would be humanly possible to get the Labor-HHS bill out before Tuesday, but if we could clear everything else but for the Labor-HHS bill, that would simplify all of our work. I think it would be a real positive thing for our colleagues. So I would be happy to work with my friend and colleague to try to make that happen. 
   Senator STEVENS suggested, knowing that Labor-HHS could not be completed until Tuesday for a vote, extending the time for the continuing resolution until Tuesday so we do not require everyone to be here. A lot of us will be here Saturday and Sunday and Monday. But to be, one, respectful of religious holidays on Saturday and Sunday, and to accommodate people's schedules, is there support on both sides to amending the continuing resolution--and saving taxpayers some money so we do not have to go through performance sessions--to amend the CR to make it go through Tuesday?

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment both my colleagues and say that everybody who has an ox in the mire, who is working on the appropriations bills, on BBA adjustments, or on the tax bill, ought to stay here until we have those bills totally complete--that includes Saturday, Sunday, and Monday--and have our colleagues come in and vote on Monday or on Tuesday. I just don't think it behooves us to have the entire Senate in on Saturday and Sunday. I will be here. I might be watching the football game on Saturday. But for those people who are directly involved in the negotiations, they need to be here, period. We need to get these wrapped up. 
   I also heard my friend from South Dakota address several issues that remain and if we give him everything he wants, we can go home. That is not going to happen. But we might as well find out that is not going to happen on Friday or Monday or Tuesday as have it continue. I look forward to working with both my friends from Nevada and South Dakota on the remaining bills. We have about four bills left--five, if you count bankruptcy and split the appropriations. We need to finish them one way or the other. We need to vote on them and dispose of them. I will work with my colleagues. 
   I would appreciate serious consideration to assist our colleagues to extend the CR. You mentioned the President stated he always wanted a 1-day CR. All that is going to do is cost the taxpayers money to have the entire Senate come back in and vote on Saturday and Sunday. We need to have the negotiators stay here Saturday and Sunday and complete the work.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I heard my colleague from New Jersey making a very eloquent statement concerning the violence in the Middle East. I certainly share his concern and his wish that peace will be restored amongst the Palestinians and the Israelis. 
   I also heard him compliment the President on his efforts. And I compliment the President on his efforts in trying to contain the violence. But I am critical of the administration for a couple of things. I am critical of the administration for not vetoing Security Council Resolution 1322, which passed the Security Council on October 7. We could have vetoed this resolution. It was a biased resolution. It was an unbalanced resolution, a resolution that criticized Israel and did not criticize the Palestinians. The Palestinians have been very involved in creating a lot of the violence. This is a one-sided resolution. This administration did not veto it, for whatever reason. 
   Now the United Nations is considering another resolution, from what I understand from press reports and so on, that very strongly condemns Israel and is somewhat silent on the Palestinians.

   Mr. NICKLES. But it is interesting, the second statement says it:  
   Condemns acts of violence, especially the excessive use of force against Palestinians, resulting in injury and loss of human life.  
   No. 3, it:  
   Calls upon Israel, the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by its legal obligations..... .  
   It does not say for the Palestinians and it does not say for Mr. Arafat to abide by its obligations, and it does not talk about the Palestinians and their use of force. 
   I heard my colleague from New Jersey talk about the fact that Palestinians had a couple of Israelis who were murdered. 
   So my point is that the President of the United States should have urged our representative at the United Nations to veto this, use our veto in the Security Council to veto this very unbalanced, very biased, very anti-Israel resolution. And they did not do it. I think that was a mistake. 
   Now we see more violence. This recent attack on the U.S.S. Cole on October 12 killed 17 and wounded dozens. I think many of us were shocked by that. I heard some of the statements by the Secretary of State, by the Secretary of Defense, by the President: Boy, we're going to hold those people, those terrorists, those cowards who committed this cowardly deed and killed innocent U.S. soldiers, accountable. 
   Well, Mr. President, I have heard those words before. In many cases in past history, those words have been a lot stronger than our deeds. That bothers this Senator. I look back at some of  the terrorist activity that has happened in the Middle East over the last few years directed at the U.S. citizens and soldiers, and I am thinking: Wait a minute, I have heard those exact same words: We are going to hold these people accountable. And I look at what has happened. 
   In 1993, we had President Bush--at that time he was former President Bush. He traveled to Kuwait in April of 1993. He was there April 14 through 16. The Kuwaiti Government captured a van loaded with 180 pounds of explosives. This was an attempt to assassinate former President Bush. This administration launched 23 cruise missiles to show they were really upset about that, most of which hit in the sand; some may have hit the targets, or at least they are saying that--but a pretty mild response. 
   Again, was it directly targeted at those people who were directly responsible, or was it the United States kicking up and showing, well, we are a little peeved about this? Did we hold those people directly responsible who tried to assassinate President Bush? The answer is no. Did we capture those people who were directly involved in that? I believe the answer is no. 
   If the intelligence community knows more about this than I do, I would be happy for them to inform this Senator. But I do not believe the individuals who were directly involved in that terrorist activity were held accountable, that they were tried, that they were punished for that action. 
   What about the bombing of Khobar Towers? This happened June 25, 1996 as a result of a car bomb. The destruction looked very similar to the bombing in Oklahoma City, another car bomb that blew up the Federal building in Oklahoma City and killed 168 people. The car bomb outside the Khobar Towers killed 19 Americans, and it wounded 364. 
   I remember the President, I remember the Secretary of Defense, I remember the Secretary of State say: We will not stop until these cowards are brought to justice. 
   How many people have been brought to justice from the Khobar Towers bombing of 1996? The answer is, no one. The answer is, one person has been arrested. He is now in a Saudi jail--one person. A lot more than one person was responsible for the Khobar Towers bombing, a lot more than one person. 
   What has been the result? Have we held people accountable? No. That was the most massive terrorist attack against military personnel, certainly since the bombing in Lebanon. What did we do? Well, basically nothing. Basically nothing. 
   What about the bombings of the Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania? That was August 7, 1998. Bombs exploded at the U.S. Embassies in both Kenya and Tanzania, killed 252 people, including 12 Americans. Again, we heard this President, this Secretary of State, this Secretary of Defense say: We will hold them accountable. What did we do? Once again, we lobbed some cruise missiles, and we hit, I guess, a terrorist camp in Afghanistan. 
   I guess the principal terrorist we were aiming at was not there. Maybe some people were killed. Maybe those people were directly involved in the bombing; maybe they weren't. That is not very targeted, in my opinion. We also bombed a pharmaceutical plant that we may be making significant payments on because people determined maybe it wasn't directly involved. I don't know. 
   My point is, this administration has made very strong statements that we are going to hold people accountable for attacking U.S. facilities, U.S. soldiers. We did it again with the U.S.S. Cole. Frankly, we haven't done it. Our country hasn't done it. Maybe we lobbed some cruise missiles and maybe we directly or indirectly hit some people who might have been responsible, but it is a little questionable. 
   I think it almost sends a signal of weakness, if we don't hold people accountable. I think the rhetoric has been good. I think the language has been good. I don't think the results have been good. I think if there is a U.N. resolution that is biased and anti-Israel, it should be vetoed. I certainly believe we should find out those people who are responsible for the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole, and we should hold them accountable. We should find the people who are responsible for the bombing of the Khobar Towers, and we should hold them accountable. They should pay a penalty, a price, and, frankly, that has not happened. 
   I see my colleague wanting to speak.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I didn't hear total disagreement. I think I heard my colleague say he agreed with me that the administration should have vetoed the U.N. resolution that strongly condemned Israel and was silent about Palestinian violence. We agree. 
   I think he also said he agreed with me that we should be very assertive in trying to find those people responsible for the Khobar Towers, for that bombing that was so damaging, that killed 19 Americans, wounded a couple hundred others. We haven't had success. He is critical of the Saudi Government. So am I. 
   The point being, our language and our rhetoric in some cases has exceeded our results. When we had two American embassies that were bombed, what did we do? We lobbed a few cruise missiles. We don't know if those hit the people who were directly responsible or not. 
   The point is, if you are going to hold people accountable, you want to hold the people who are directly accountable for committing the crime against American citizens who killed American citizens, and we haven't done that in the two latest cases of terrorism. Frankly, if you don't hold them accountable, I think that sends a bad signal. 
   I would agree with my colleague from New Jersey, we should certainly hold people accountable for the U.S.S. Cole. Likewise we should hold people accountable on Khobar Towers and on American embassies, and that hasn't happened yet. That was my point.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to comment on the Agriculture conference report that just passed overwhelmingly today in the Senate. It already passed the House and it will be going to the President to be signed. In my opinion, there are a couple of provisions in this bill that really should not have been included and are serious mistakes that may come back to haunt Congress or will require Congress to change their actions. 
   One of them deals with private contracts. I happen to believe very strongly in private contracts. I came from the business sector, the private sector. When Congress interferes in private contracts, it ought to have a good reason. It ought to know what it is doing. Frankly, it should hardly ever do so. In this case, we put some language in this bill that I venture to say very few of our colleagues--maybe only a couple--even know it exists or what its ramifications will be. 
   There is language in the Agriculture conference report that doesn't deal with Agriculture but deals with reimportation of drugs. Yes, we debated reimportation language on the Senate floor, but we didn't debate this contracting issue. 
   Senator JEFFORDS offered an amendment dealing with reimportation of drugs. However, the amendment offered by Senator JEFFORDS contained some serious flaws, which led me to oppose the amendment. For example, the original Senate language included a provision that would have established two separate standards for drugs that were sold in the United States. One standard, which is current law, with regard to drugs that are manufactured and sold in the U.S. And a separate, and in my opinion, inferior standard for drugs that are imported or reimported into the U.S. Fortunately, the conference agreement corrected the flaws of the original Jeffords language and will require that all drugs, including those imported by businesses other than the manufacturer, must fully comply with Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. This means that every importer must ensure that all safety standards which are included in a new drug approval application (NDA) are fully met for every drug which is imported into the U.S. Additionally, the conference agreement retained Senator COCHRAN's amendment that perfected and improved the Jeffords amendment to require that the Secretary ensure that if drugs are imported, U.S. safety standards will be used to ensure that these drugs pose no risk to the public health and that consumers will benefit from any potential savings prior to this law going into effect. I supported the Cochran amendment and I am pleased that this bill included that language. 
   However, in conference, new language was added that was not in either the House bill or the Senate bill. It wasn't in any of the language adopted on the Senate floor. This language states: 
   No manufacturer of covered products--[prescription drugs]--may enter into a contract or agreement that includes a provision to prevent the sale or distribution of covered products under this subsection. 
   What does that mean? Well, it means that this Congress could either abrogate or direct contracts which don't meet this new federal test. I think that is a serious problem. This could make it illegal for a patent holder to insert a clause into a private licensing agreement with a foreign distributor that prevents a foreign distributor from reselling that product for any reason. 
   This proposal could prohibit any private agreement that limits or restricts the sale of drugs, including quantities, territories, resale conditions, or other normal terms of commerce. 
   I think this Congress is inappropriately intruding into commerce in ways that we don't have any idea what we are doing, what the ramifications may be and may in fact be unconsitutional. But that's not all. Additionally, the language we have adopted would direct the U.S. Government to sanction companies that 
   structure their business relationships with foreign distributors in a manner inconsistent with the legislation. A lot of these businesses have been doing business with people to resell their drugs, and we are going to say they are not doing it right so we can fine them. We may in fact require them to sell to anybody. Can they resell in any way they want to? Not according to this language. So a manufacturer can lose total control of its products and this may at some point result in a number of counterfeit drugs and other safety problems. How is this type of provision consistent with the basic concept of private property and freedom to contract? It is not. It really makes no sense. Have we had any hearings on this? No. If you restrict this kind of contract for pharmaceutical companies, why in the world can't you do it for any other contract? So somebody says, wait a minute; this just deals with pharmaceutical products. Frankly, if Congress can insert itself into contracting language, are we going to do the same thing on contracts between auto dealers or other private business. 
   There is a little bill floating around that would try to do that. We can do it on other contracts where maybe we deem we have superior wisdom to all the business groups out there or anybody who has a contract, that we know better. What does this language mean? What is its impact? We are going to go and give the authority to fine somebody if they don't comply. Wow. This is in an appropriations bill. It didn't come through the Judiciary Committee or a committee composed of people who work on contracts or work on judicial issues. We are setting up that kind of a program, and I am embarrassed for us to do that.  
   This type of legislating sets a horrible precedent for other businesses as well. It is not appropriate for this Congress to force American manufacturers to sell their products to consumers that they do not want to sell to under contract terms that the federal government approves. This type of requirement is unfair and lacks common sense. I predict it will raise serious constitutional questions as well and may interfere with the exercise of intellectual property rights. It is unfortunate that this language was included in this bill. I think this is a serious mistake. 
   It is somewhat similar to another mistake, in my opinion, included in this bill, which is title X, the continued dumping and subsidies offset. It is a brand new provision. It is a provision inserted in the Agriculture conference. It deals with subsidies and with dumping. Those are trade issues, trade sanctions, usually handled in the Ways and Means Committee in the House and the Finance Committee in the Senate. This didn't go through either. I will tell my colleagues this provision could not pass the Finance Committee. It could not pass the Ways and Means Committee. 
   This runs directly contrary, frankly, to free trade and the idea of trying to expand trade. This says if you have a dumping complaint, and if you happen to win, the benefits go back directly to that company, directly to the individuals involved. So there is a reward and incentive that if you file a dumping complaint and win, you will receive benefits. This encourages lawsuits on dumping because you can win the ``lottery.'' Here they come. It doesn't make sense. It is probably not WTO consistent. This says ``consistent with the rights under the World Trade Organization.'' I venture to say that it is not consistent with WTO rights in any way, shape, or form. It will probably be thrown out by the courts. 
   Why are we doing this? I am on the Finance Committee, and did we have a hearing on this? No, we did not. Did the Ways and Means Committee have a hearing on this? I don't believe so. But all of a sudden, it is inserted into a conference report which is not amendable. Some colleagues say they don't like this process. I don't like this process either. I think it is bad legislation. I think it can come back to haunt us, and we could be talking about 
   hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars from this provision alone. 
   Again, how many colleagues are even aware that this is in the bill? We have committees of jurisdiction, such as the Judiciary Committee, that should be dealing with contracts and they should have handled this contracting issue. My guess is that they would have scrubbed it and done a better job. The Finance Committee, which deals with trade, would totally reject this idea of rewarding people if they file successful dumping lawsuits. 
   Mr. President, it is with regret that I say there are other aspects of this Agriculture appropriations bill, which has grown substantially, that bother this Senator. We would end up passing a bill that increases budget authority over the President by 22 percent in outlays and 24 percent in budget authority. That bothers me. It bothers me when we see growth in the discretionary portion of this bill to that extent--to be growing at 24 percent I don't think is affordable or responsible. I could go on. 
   Also, there are expansions of entitlements. I remember earlier this year when we passed emergency assistance, and we busted that. We busted it big time. I understand there are a lot of problems. We had a drought as bad as anybody. Texas suffered from a drought and so did we. This is fiscally irresponsible, in my opinion. And because of the provision dealing with dumping and the abrogation of contracts, or the changing of contracts, and the total cost of this bill, regretfully, this Senator had to vote against the Agriculture conference report. 
   I see my colleague from Alabama is here. I am prepared to wrap up. How long does he wish to speak?

   The unanimous consent request that you are now making is to take up and pass the bill that passed last night, without objection.

   Mr. NICKLES. I compliment my friend from Arizona because, one, you are showing flexibility. I compliment you because you have stated what your preference is. You have your preference in the bill that passed out of the Commerce Committee, of which you are the Chair and Senator HOLLINGS is the ranking member. But you are also saying, if I cannot get that, realizing that we are on overtime right now and we are running out of days, you are willing to say, let's take the House-passed bill. The House-passed bill passed unanimously. That does not happen all that often around here for legislation that is this significant. 
   The Senator from Arizona is saying he is willing to take it and pass it. It is the same bill that the administration says they want. And it will become law if we can get this consent agreed to.  
   So I compliment my colleague from Arizona. I hope our 
   colleagues would possibly even reconsider and let us pass this bill tonight or tomorrow.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would like to announce for the information of the Senate and the public that a legislative hearing has been scheduled before the Subcommittee on Energy Research, Development, Production and Regulation.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I commend Senator STEVENS for his leadership and work on this important bill. Clearly, America has a continuing need to maintain a robust, well equipped military that is capable of defending freedom and preserving the peace. This bill advances the Department of Defense and our military services toward this objective. 
   One element of this bill involves the U.S. Army's innovative effort to improve the Operation and Support cost of our M-1 Abrams main battle tank and the new Crusader Mobile Artillery system. For several years, the Army has recognized that the maintenance and support cost of the present M-1 tank was excessively high. Concurrently, the Army was developing the next generation of mobile artillery systems--to be called the Crusader. 
   Late last year, the Army made a bold decision to pursue a consolidation of the engine component of both the M-1 and Crusader program. This consolidated effort is called the Abrams-Crusader Common Engine (ACCE) program. By consolidating the engine procurement for both vehicles, the goal is to reduce the costs to the Army for both vehicles. 
   Mr. President, I noticed that the Senate version of this bill reduced the amount of funds available for the ACCE program by $48 million. I learned the committee had concerns over the Army's interest in developing a new engine for these two vehicles. This conference report, however, restores $20 million to the ACCE program. I would ask the chairman of the committee if the restoration of this $20 million reflects a change in the committee's view of the program or do you remain concerned that the program is too costly and adds concurrency to the Crusader system?

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for that explanation. It is encouraging to once again recognize that the Chairman--while a vigorous advocate for a robust defense capability--is constantly vigilant to ensure that the money we spend for defense is also a sound investment. 
   The Army's initiative to re-engine the M-1 is a good idea. Maintenance and fuel costs associated with operation of the M-1 are very high; perhaps as much as 60 percent of the M-1's total O&S cost. Replacing the current gas turbine engine with a more fuel-efficient and reliable engine has the potential to save substantial amounts for the Army. However, the cost to develop a new engine could be quite high. There is even one press article citing a Defense Department official indicating the development costs could approach a half billion dollars. So, while the Army initiative is a good one, the costs associated with the program are prohibitive. 
   Regarding the Crusader program, the engine selection will be critical to the overall performance and success of the vehicle program. If the Army were to proceed with the consolidated ACCE program, it is clear that concurrency in the Crusader program would be higher than if the Army selects an engine already developed and currently in production. 
   As a final question for the Chairman, does the cut reflected in this conference report for the ACCE program indicate a lack of support for the M-1 re-powering effort or the Crusader system?

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to amend provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 relating to remedial action of active uranium and thorium processing sites. On October 24, 1992, President Bush signed the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) into law. Title X of EPACT authorized the Department of Energy to reimburse uranium and thorium processing licensees for the portion of the costs incurred in the remediation of mill tailings, groundwater and other by-product material generated as a result of sales to the federal government pursuant to the Atomic Energy Commission's procurement program. 
   The Title X reimbursement program has worked very well. The licensees have completed much of the surface reclamation at the Title X sites. However, increasingly stringent remediation standards and groundwater decontamination programs have significantly increased the cost and time necessary to complete remediation at many sites. Under current law, in order for a licensee to be eligible to recover the federal share of remediation costs incurred subsequent to December 31, 2002, the licensee must describe and quantify all costs expected to be incurred throughout the remainder of the site's cleanup in a plan for subsequent remedial action. This plan must be submitted to the Department of Energy before December 31, 2001 and approved prior to December 31, 2002. 
   This bill would amend Title X to extend the date, from 2002 to 2007, through which licensees can submit claims for reimbursement under the procedures now in place and extend the date until December 31, 2007 that licensees must submit their plans for subsequent remedial action to the Department of Energy. This legislation does not seek any increase in the existing authorization. It merely provides the time necessary to prepare the plans on a more informed basis and avoid the unintended hardship which would likely result from the 2002 deadline.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, in all likelihood tomorrow we will be sending the President a bill to eliminate the marriage penalty for most Americans. I urge the President to sign this bill. 
   This bill will provide tax relief for millions of married couples. For individuals or for couples who have incomes of $52,000, they will see their take-home pay increase by a total of about $1,400. Some of my colleagues on the Democratic side have said that is a tax cut for the wealthy. It is not. I don't consider a married couple who have an income of $52,000 particularly wealthy. We want to eliminate the marriage penalty and allow them to keep more of their own money. They should not be taxed at a 28-percent rate. 
   That is what our bill does. Our bill says we should double the 15-percent rate on individuals for couples. Right now, people who have taxable incomes of $26,000 as individuals pay taxes at 15 percent. We are saying married couples should pay taxes at 15 percent at twice that amount, up to $52,000. That only makes sense. If you tax individuals at 15 percent up to $26,000, for couples it should be double that amount, $52,000, except that present law taxes couples at 28 percent beginning at $43,000. 
   So if couples have taxable income above $43,000, they start paying 28-percent income tax. If they happen to be self-employed on top of that, it is 28 percent plus 15.3 percent Social Security and Medicare tax. That is 43.3 percent. In most States, they have income tax rates of another 6 or 7 percent, State income tax. That is over 50 percent for a couple with taxable income of $44-$45-$50,000. That is too high. 
   Congress has passed a bill--both the House and the Senate, identical bills--that says let's double that 15-percent rate for couples, the individual rate for couples, so the taxable income will be 15 percent up to $52,000, 28 percent above that. 
   Again, I urge the President to sign it. It is not tax cuts for the wealthy; it is tax cuts for all married couples who have incomes of $43,000, $52,000, or $60,000. The amount of benefit, maximum benefit, is about $1,400. 
   I urge the President to sign that bill.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I think the world of my colleague from New York, and I am very grateful. 
   I want to make a couple comments. First, I compliment Senator ROTH. This is really his proposal. He is greatly responsible for making this happen. He introduced this in the Finance Committee, and it is going to pass today. I hope, and will even say I expect, it will become law. It will be a shame if it doesn't become law. 
   I also compliment Senator HUTCHISON for her leadership, Senator BROWNBACK, Senator ASHCROFT, Senator SANTORUM, and Senator ABRAHAM. They have been working tirelessly on this. They have been pushing in caucuses and conferences. They said: We need to pass marriage penalty relief. We have a chance to do that today. I thank the House leaders for doing it. 
   I heard some people saying they are against this. I heard my friends speak against it. They kept saying it is $290 billion. It is not. We are voting today on a $90 billion tax cut, period. Those are the facts. If it is to be extended--and I hope it will be--Congress is going to have to pass another bill, and it is going to have to be signed by a President, a different President. That is another action. That may happen 3 or 4 years from now. I hope it does. We will have to see what the circumstances are at that time. The bill we have before us is $90 billion. 
   I read the President's letter--at least it came from his Secretary of the Treasury--which said: We provided significant marriage penalty relief. In his bill, in his budget proposal, he has a $9 billion tax increase for next year--not a tax cut, a $9 billion tax increase. His marriage penalty relief over the next 5 years is $9 billion. It doesn't do it. It won't work. It won't happen. He has more tax increases in the first year than tax cuts. Over 5 years, he has a net tax cut of only $5 billion. 
   We are going to have a surplus of $1.8 trillion in the next 5 years, $4.5 trillion over the next 10. The only tax cut we are talking about right now is marriage penalty relief totaling $90 billion. That figure loses people.  
   Let's talk about what it means for families. Some people say this targets the wealthy. That is not true. People are entitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to their own facts. The fact is what we do is double the standard deduction, $4,400 for an individual, $8,800 for a couple. The fact is, people pay taxable income up to $26,000, an individual at 15 percent. That is $26,000. We say for couples, that should be $52,000. We double it for couples, whether both are working or not. We don't penalize stay-at-home spouses. The Democrat proposal provided no relief for stay-at-home spouses. We say the 15-percent bracket should be twice as much for couples, income adjusted, as it is for individuals. So we don't penalize people if they happen to stay at home. 
   We provide tax relief for millions of American families. How much? It is a couple hundred. By doubling the standard deduction, that is a couple hundred dollars for all married couples. Then by doubling the 15-percent rate, that equals the $1,125, if somebody makes up to $52,000. That is the maximum benefit. The maximum benefit is basically $1,125 if somebody makes up to $52,000. It is weighted towards the low-income people, middle-income people. There are millions of American families with one or two wage earners making $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, who will save $1,300, $1,350, if this becomes law. The only reason it won't become law is if the President vetoes it. 
   I urge the President to sign this bill and provide marriage penalty relief as he said he would.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senators COCHRAN and HARKIN for their assistance in getting this proposal included in the Agriculture Appropriations bill for FY 2001. The biomass program is a collaborative effort between Oklahoma State University and Mississippi State University. 
   We are now 56 percent dependent on foreign oil. It is projected that by 2020 we will be more than 65 percent dependent on oil from foreign nations. Such dependency is a major threat to our national security. We need to make every effort possible to reduce and curb this dependency. This program will aid us in this effort. 
   The effort between these two universities will focus on the continued development of a unique gasification-bioconversion process at OSU that utilizes biomass including crop residues, underutilized grasses, and plant byproducts. 
   Those conducting the research consist of a senior team of nationally recognized experts in biomass production, feedstock harvesting and processing of technologies, environmental impact assessment, and biochemical process. 
   I ask my colleagues for their support of this unique opportunity for Oklahoma, Mississippi and for the nation.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise to report on an agreement reached today between Senator INOUYE and myself regarding the Fort Reno Agriculture Research Station at El Reno, Oklahoma. 
   Our agreement delays any decision on the ARS until the next Administration. It also preserves the right of Congress to play a role in the future of the ARS. Our agreement ensures that any decision made about the research station will be made based on the merits of the work performed there rather than a decision based on November political considerations. 
   The agreement should not be read to mean that the research station will be eliminated, nor that the lands at Fort Reno should or will be returned to the Cheyenne-Arapaho tribe of Oklahoma. 
   I do not want the status of the Agriculture Research Station to be influenced by presidential politics, which has been the case in the past. This agreement will help prevent the future of the research station from becoming an election-year tool and better protect both the tribe and the research station from pressures surrounding the November election.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments by my friend and colleague from Michigan regarding the death of our friend and colleague, PAUL COVERDELL. 
   Yesterday was a very, very sad day for the Senate. I was at this desk when the majority leader announced that PAUL COVERDELL passed away at 6:10 yesterday. Majority Leader TRENT LOTT was a very close friend of PAUL, as was I and many other Senators. This is a tough, trying time because we lost a very good friend and an outstanding Senator. It is sad to see the vacant chair right behind me that PAUL COVERDELL sat in. It demonstrates an enormous void his death leaves behind here in our body. 
   I had the pleasure of getting to know PAUL COVERDELL for the last 8 years. He did an outstanding job. PAUL COVERDELL was the type of Senator who would do any work assigned, and often times, work not assigned. He was the type of Senator who could enlighten the room, the type who could work with all Members and make things happen. He was the type of person who would be willing to take on tough tasks and always say yes, and  take them across the finish line. He was the kind of person you would want to have on your team at all times. 
   PAUL was the kind of person who really added a lot to this institution. It makes me proud to say he was my colleague. He contributed so much in so many ways. His death is an almost unspeakable loss for us, for the State of Georgia, and for the country. 
   He showed great leadership on a lot of issues, with a hallmark brand of analysis and execution that identified a challenge for our conference, pulled out all the views among our colleagues, and built consensus and success to the betterment of not just our party, but our country. For example, take primary and secondary education--something overlooked for many years. He focused on that in the last few years, and headed up a task force that cut across committee lines, seniority lines, and philosophical lines, to bring us together. He wanted us to do positive things to improve education across the nation. He successfully blended our different viewpoints together, and together we painted a vision on education that not only do many Americans support, but holds out real hope for change and improvement when it comes to educating our kids for the challenges of the 21st century. Further, many elements of his efforts brought along our colleagues across the aisle. 
   Or, take our war on drugs. Senator COVERDELL has worked hard with colleagues to address this challenge, here in the United States, and with the House and the administration to carry the fight overseas. In waging those battles, we came to realize that he was intense, he was serious, dedicated, and sincere. He was also successful, and many families today and in the future should be gratified in his success. 
   And these are just a few examples of the many areas where PAUL placed his tremendous energies. He was so involved in so many different issues, I even teased him last year. I said, ``We are enacting all Coverdell legislation, all the time'' because he had his name and fingerprints all over so many things were doing, because he was so proactive in trying to come up with positive solutions to challenging problems in education, or fighting the war on drugs here and overseas, or spending the country's money wisely, or returning the tax surplus to the people. 
   PAUL also didn't hesitate to join us in standing up on behalf of the Constitution, our system of checks and balances, of keeping the order we stand to defend. From the beginning to the end of his time in the Senate, rarely a day went by when he did not cast a thoughtful eye on the activism and activities of the executive, cognizant of the vision of our Founders who believed in a limited central government. 
   When you got to know him, you would discover that he had a real intensity, a keen curiosity to learn, understand, grapple with issues great and small. And he had such a great, congenial working spirit that made all of us better, that built us all up. His personality was infectious, his energy was admirable, his thoughtfulness was considerable, and his friendship was valuable. 
   We want to let PAUL's wife Nancy know that she is very much in our thoughts and prayers. We are comforted by the fact and have great confidence in the fact that PAUL COVERDELL now resides in a wonderful mansion, eternally. Our sympathies and prayers go with Nancy, and to the Coverdell family. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate passed legislation providing tax relief for married couples. We passed a bill that basically eliminates the marriage penalty tax for most married couples. The cost of the bill was $55.6 billion over 5 years and over ten years. The cost of the bill was incorrectly reported in several newspapers despite the fact that on the floor of the Senate and in a press conference later, we stated clearly that the bill that we passed was a 5-year bill, and the cost of the bill was estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation to be $56 billion. You wouldn't know that if you read the New York Times. 
   In today's paper: ``Senate Approves Tax Cut To Help Married Couples. Clinton Threatens Veto.'' That much is correct, but the next line says, ``$248 billion measure would aid even those who do not pay marriage penalty.'' 
   I  dispute that claim, because it is absolutely false. The $248 billion cost they attribute to our bill is false. It is not correct. 
   In the article, the second paragraph says the vote was 61-38; eight Democrats joined Republicans to approve the measure which would reduce income taxes for nearly all married couples by a total of $248 billion over 10 years. 
   The facts are, the bill that we passed was $56 billion over the next 5 years and the next 10 years. Maybe some people didn't know that. Maybe if some Senators knew that they would have voted differently. I don't know. I want accuracy. I want people to know the facts. 
   The Washington Post had an article as well, and it had a chart that bothers me. The Washington Post headline said the ``Senate Votes ``Marriage Penalty' Relief.'' That statement is true. Then it says, GOP continues tax cutting drive and the President threatens to veto it. It talks of the bill being $248 billion and included a chart from the Citizens for Tax Justice. The chart asks the question: Who would benefit? It says the benefit for couples who make between $50,000 and $75,000 is $344. That is not correct. 
   The Citizens for Tax Justice has a reputation of being quite a liberal group. Regardless, they are entitled to their own opinion, but they are not entitled to their own facts. I want my colleagues and the American people to know what the facts are. Under the Senate-passed bill, people who have taxable incomes from zero to $43,000 could get a maximum tax benefit from earned income credit changes of $527, and a maximum tax benefit from the standard deduction adjustment of $218, for a total maximum tax cut of $745. For couples with taxable income between $43,000 and $52,500, they also have a standard deduction tax cut worth $218, and because of changes to the 15 percent income tax bracket they could also get a maximum tax cut of $1,125, for total maximum tax relief for married couples earning up to $52,500 of $1,342. These are facts about the bill we passed. 
   The Washington Post chart says people who make $40,000 to $50,000 have tax relief of $148. I believe the facts are that it could be as much as $1,342. There is a big difference. 
   Citizens for Tax Justice happens to be wrong. I don't know if they are using some unreasonable type of income classification that greatly inflates income so that everyone seems rich. That's what the Clinton administration does when it wants to attack our tax cuts. I don't know what they are doing. It bothers me. Maybe it shouldn't. Maybe I am a stickler for facts. We should stick to the facts. 
   We passed a tax bill yesterday that I believe will become law. If the President will sign it, married couples with taxable income of $52,500 will get $1,342 worth of tax relief. That is a fairly significant tax cut. For the local paper the next day to say that couples making between $40,000 and $50,000 get $148 is wrong, way wrong. It is $1,000 off.

For some people to imply the bill we passed was $248 is factually incorrect.

   Mr. NICKLES. I don't have all day. I need to run, but I would like to make a comment. I don't know where the Senator got his chart, but I am telling him that factually any couple that made $52,000 under the bill we passed yesterday, the Republican bill, with 8 or 9 Democrats who voted with you, would get tax relief exactly--exactly as I announced on the floor or I will eat the paper. It is $1,125, plus $212, and that is 1,300 and some odd dollars, not $300. So the Senator's chart is factually incorrect.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this amendment would basically say there would be no new national monuments unless authorized by an act of Congress. 
   Under the Antiquities Act, this administration just this year declared 2 million acres to be national monuments. 
   I happen to be a fan of national monuments, but I think we should have local input. We should have the Governors say whether or not they are for it. We should have local communities testify before Congress. We should have some input. Right now, that is not happening. 
   Prior to the last election, the President stood at the Grand Canyon and declared 1.7 million acres in Utah a national monument. This year, he declared 2 million acres. In contrast, that compares to 86,000 acres by Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Bush. President Johnson declared 344,000. This President has already declared 2 million acres this year. 
   I think Congress should have some input. We should authorize it by an act of Congress.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the announcement the majority leader just made that our friend and colleague, PAUL COVERDELL, passed away at 6:10 p.m. today is a very sad statement. PAUL COVERDELL was an outstanding Senator from the State of Georgia. This is Georgia's loss, but it is also a loss for all of our country. 
   I join with my colleagues in expressing our sympathy to Nancy Coverdell, to the Coverdell family, to all the friends and associates of PAUL COVERDELL, for he was truly an outstanding Senator. He served this body with great distinction, with great humor and leadership. Frankly, he was a leader in everything he did, certainly in the Peace Corps and his service in the Senate. He will truly be missed, not just by Georgians but, frankly, by all Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this amendment basically says: Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no funds shall be used to establish or expand a national monument under the act of June 8, 1906, the Antiquities Act, after July 17, 2000, except by an Act of Congress. 
   What I am trying to do is to make sure we don't have additional national monuments declared by this administration without some congressional input. 
   I will insert a copy of the Antiquities Act for the RECORD. It was passed in 1906. The Antiquities Act states:  
   The President of the United States is authorized, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments, and may reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.  
   That is the Antiquities Act. 
   This administration, particularly this year, has added millions of acres under the designation of national monuments without congressional authorization or approval, without consent of Governors, without consent of local entities. I am saying there is another process. I happen to serve on the Energy Committee with Chairman MURKOWSKI and others. We pass land bills all the time. I urge the President, if he wants to pass or declare something a national monument, send it to Congress. We are happy to look at it. We are happy to pass it. This is a committee that works in a bipartisan fashion. We pass land bills all the time. This week we are supposed to mark up 17. We do that in a bipartisan fashion. 
   I also will include for the RECORD a comparison of lands that have been added as national monuments during all the Presidents. 
   This Antiquities Act passed under Theodore Roosevelt in 1906. It is interesting to note, Theodore Roosevelt, who was quite the conservationist, made some very significant additions to the national monuments, the total acreage of which was 1.5 million acres. President Clinton has done more than that this year alone. As a matter of fact, President Clinton has already designated 3.7 million acres. He has done more than any other President of the United States, with the exception of President Carter, who added a lot of land in the State of Alaska. 
   It is also interesting to note that the State of Alaska Senators had amended the Antiquities Act to say no lands should be made into a national monument that exceeds 5,000 acres unless there is an act of Congress. That doesn't apply to the rest of the country. 
   This administration, while they had designated 1.7 million acres in the first  7 years, in this year, since January, has already declared 2 million acres a national monument. There is some talk that there are additional monuments in the works. If there are, great. If this amendment passes--I hope and expect that it will--I am sure Congress will be happy to receive the request from the President. We will review it. We will consider it. We will have hearings. We will go through the legislative process. We will hear from the Governors. We will hear from local entities. We will make a decision, as the process should be. 
   I believe the President's actions, particularly this year, have greatly exceeded what is called for in the Antiquities Act. Again, in the Antiquities Act, it says, that the area:  
   ..... in all cases should be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.  
   We should abide by this law. When the President has added 2 million acres this year alone, I don't believe he is in compliance with it. I think Congress has a legitimate role. If not, are we going to allow the President to declare wilderness areas, millions of acres? 
   My point is, I may well agree with the President on every single designation he has made, but the process needs congressional authorization. It needs congressional input; it needs congressional hearings. It needs input from local officials and people who are directly impacted. 
   I hope our colleagues will support this amendment. I appreciate the leadership of my friend and colleague, Senator GORTON of Washington, and also Senator BYRD. I used to chair the subcommittee. It is a challenging subcommittee, one which the Senator from Washington and the Senator from West Virginia have handled with a great deal of professionalism and expertise. I compliment them on their efforts. I urge our colleagues to supports this amendment. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a list of Presidents and what they have added to the national monuments under the Antiquities Act.

   Mr. NICKLES. I mentioned all of the Presidents. President Clinton has greatly exceeded the amount of new additions compared to any President, with the one exception of President Carter. To give a comparison, President Ford added 86 acres in national monuments in his tenure as President. President Reagan and President Bush added zero. Teddy Roosevelt added 1.5 million acres; William Taft, 32,000 acres. I could go on down the list. My point is, the amount President Clinton has added this year alone exceeds what almost any other President has done. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a copy of the Antiquities Act.

   I know the chairman of the subcommittee wants to address this and perhaps other issues. 
   One other comment: The President did this first in September of 1996 prior to the election. I know my colleague from Nevada might remember this because he did it with a press conference overlooking the Grand Canyon, talking about the addition of a new national monument, except the monument he was talking about was not in Arizona, not in the Grand Canyon; it was actually in Utah. It was the Grand Staircase National Monument, 1.7 million acres. It happened to have billions of dollars of raw materials. 
   Interestingly enough, the Utah Governor was not consulted. The Utah congressional delegation was not consulted. People in the community were not consulted. We had a massive land grab, power mineral grab--you name it--by the President of the United States for a photo op for election purposes that, in my opinion, may have been granted but needed congressional input and authorization. That is the purpose of the amendment, to make sure this type of thing does not continue without at least some input from other local officials. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this amendment that my colleague from Iowa has offered amends the Fair Labor Standards Act but it has never had a hearing before the Labor Committee. It has never been marked up by the Labor Committee. It is legislation that would make the trial lawyers very happy because it authorizes unlimited punitive and compensatory damages for discrimination cases brought under the Equal Pay Act. In fact, it would authorize remedies not available in any title VII discrimination case or Americans with Disabilities Act case because damages under those statutes are capped. It would also make it easier for trial lawyers to create class action lawsuits. It is bad legislation and it does not belong on this bill. I encourage my colleagues to support the point of order and reject the amendment. 
   Mr. President, I make a point of order that the amendment offered by my colleague from Iowa is not germane to the underlying bill and would, therefore, result in a section 305(b)(2) point of order under the Budget Act. I, therefore, raise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I look at my colleague's amendment, and he says for health care we will make it a tax credit. That means it is more valuable than wages; that means it is more valuable than any other expenditure for an employer. 
   We passed several tax provisions to encourage employers and individuals to buy health care. We passed that with the Patients' Bill of Rights. We passed it with minimum wage. The amendment of my colleague from Illinois, in my opinion, is misdirected and very expensive. We have not had a hearing in the Finance Committee. I think it happens to be bad policy. It says for this type of expenditure, it is more important than any other that an employer would make. 
   I make a budget point of order under section 305 that it is in violation of the Budget Act.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of my colleague, I will speak on the marriage penalty for a few minutes and then go into the wrap-up. 
   Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues, several of whom have worked very hard to make sure we eliminate the marriage penalty. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON of Texas, SAM BROWNBACK, Senator ASHCROFT, and Senator SANTORUM have been pushing and pushing to eliminate one of the most unfair  penalties in the Tax Code, the marriage penalty. Now we have a chance to do that. We are going to vote on that on Monday. We are going to pass it--at least I hope we do--and I hope the President will sign it. 
   The President said in his State of the Union Address that we need to eliminate the marriage penalty. He didn't propose it. He had a little something in his budget but very little. We have taken that and we are now considering a bill to basically eliminate the marriage penalty. A lot of people don't know what that is. It says that if people file a joint return, they pay more than they would have paid as single individuals. Some people say: Wait a minute. The Republican proposal, or the proposal we passed out of the Finance Committee, does more than that; it has a marriage bonus. 
   We say that we should basically double the income tax brackets for individuals and for couples. So if they are married and file jointly, they end up getting twice the income tax bracket before you step into the next bracket as 
   individuals. That is really pretty simple. But it is as fair as it can get. It is the right thing to do. 
   To give an example, we have several brackets in our Tax Code: 0, 15, 28, 31, 36, and 39.6. Actually, the maximum rate was 31 percent before President Clinton came into office. In 1993, he and Vice President Gore passed a tax increase to move the maximum rate up to 39.6. They also eliminated deductions and also took off the cap on the Medicare tax, which is another 2.9 percent. So they basically raised the maximum rate up to 43, 44 percent. 
   As you jump into higher tax brackets, each income level, you are penalized under the marriage penalty. As an individual, you pay 15 percent up to $26,000. You would think a couple would go into the next bracket until it is double that amount. That would be $52,000. An individual pays 15 percent up to $26,000. So for a couple, when they go into the next higher bracket at 28 percent, that should be at $52,000. That is not the case. 
   If you look at the Tax Code, a married couple filing a joint return goes into 28 percent not at $52,000 or $50,000 but at $43,000. So what that means is that the married couple is paying an additional rate of 28 percent on all income between $43,000 and $52,000. That is the marriage penalty. We would eliminate that. Whether there is one wage earner or two wage earners in the married couple, we eliminate that penalty. Another way of saying it is, we take the $26,000, on which you are paying 15 percent, and we double it. So if it is $26,000 for an individual, it is $52,000 for a couple. We do the same thing on the 28 percent bracket. So we eliminate this penalty. 
   Another way of looking at it would be, if you have a principal wage earner and, say, he or she makes $40,000, and a spouse makes $20,000, under present law, the spouse that makes $20,000 pays the same income tax rate as the principal wage earner. That is not right. They should not be paying a tax rate of 28 percent. They should be paying at the 15-percent rate. So we are doubling the tax. The present Tax Code almost charges double for the wage earner that is making $20,000 just because they happen to be married to a spouse who makes $40,000. That is wrong. It needs to be eliminated, and we do eliminate that in this proposal. 
   I have heard some of my colleagues say they are going to offer a Democrat substitute and change that Democrat proposal. 
   I compliment my friend and colleague from New York, Senator MOYNIHAN. I have the greatest respect for him. He says the way to solve it is to make individuals file as if they have individual returns. What does that mean? 
   If you have an income of $40,000 or $20,000, there would be some tax relief. But what if you have a situation where somebody earns $60,000? There is no tax relief. Or if you have an income that is $50,000, there is no tax relief. You are paying a 28-percent bracket on any income between $43,000 and $52,000. So they get penalized. They doesn't solve that problem. 
   I hope I am not being too confusing. Maybe it is kind of wonkish, but we are penalizing couples in the U.S. today for being married to the tune of an average $1,200 to $1,400. That is wrong. We have a chance to fix it. We should. I believe we will fix it on Monday. 
   I am pleased. This week was a good week. We passed a bill to eliminate the death tax. That is good news for small business. It is good news for farmers and ranchers or anybody who is trying to build a business. They would like to know they can build the business and not lose half of it when they die. 
   The tax rates right now on the death tax range from 37 percent once you get past the deductible to 55 percent and in some cases 60 percent. If you have a taxable estate of $10 million, you have a marginal rate of 60 percent. That is too high. A lot of people do not know that. Some press people said to me: I think you misstated it. 
   The facts are, if you have a taxable estate of $10 million to $17 million, you pay a rate of 60 percent. That is way too high. We have taken care of that today. The only thing that will stop that from becoming law is President Clinton. He can sign it and we can eliminate the death tax and replace it with a capital gains tax. That is fair and equitable across the board. It is something we ought to do. It is the fair and right thing to do. 
   Next Monday we can eliminate the marriage penalty. People shouldn't have to pay more taxes because they happen to be married. People shouldn't be bumped into higher categories because they happen to be married. We shouldn't be charging couples for marriage. They shouldn't be penalized for being married. 
   We basically double the tax schedule for couples. To me, it is the fairest thing to do. You don't penalize somebody because they are working or not working. We don't penalize married couples. We have a chance to eliminate this gross inequity. 
   We have taken care of one today on the floor of the Senate by eliminating the death penalty. On Monday, we can eliminate the marriage penalty. 
   I compliment my colleagues, and especially several of our Democrat colleagues who were with us. Nine Democrats voted with us on final passage. We passed a bipartisan bill. It was bipartisan in the House with an overwhelming vote of a 2-to-1 margin. There was a good margin today in the Senate--59-39. Frankly, I hope that number will grow. We had several Members absent today, several of whom maybe would join us. 
   Again, I compliment Senator LOTT, and also Senator ROTH, for bringing the bill forward this week. Next week, we have the opportunity to provide real tax relief for businesses, for families, and for married couples. I think that is some of the most positive news for taxpayers in a long, long time. 
   I am going to proceed to several unanimous consent requests to help expedite consideration of these matters before the Senate next week.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would like to put all Members on notice that just under 40 amendments were filed on the marriage penalty reconciliation bill. Those votes will occur in stacked sequence beginning at 6:15 p.m. on Monday. Therefore, all Senators should prepare for a late night session on Monday with a lot of recorded votes.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I concur with my friend and colleague from Nevada. I think for a lot of these amendments recorded votes are not necessary. A lot of these amendments will fall on procedure because they won't be germane to the reconciliation bill. 
   I will work with my friend from Nevada energetically to reduce the number of amendments on this side, as I am sure he will on the other side, to see if we can't expedite the matter and finish this reconciliation bill to provide marriage penalty relief for married couples, and hopefully complete it on Monday evening. 
   Mr. President, as a reminder, stacked votes are scheduled also for 9:45 a.m. on Tuesday with respect to the Interior bill. Therefore, Members should plan to stay in or around the Senate Chamber for those stacked votes on Tuesday morning as well. It is our intention to complete the interior bill on Tuesday and move to other matters. 
   We are going to have a busy couple of weeks. We had a fruitful week this week. We passed the Defense authorization bill. We almost completed the Interior bill. We completed the repeal of the death tax bill. This has been a good week. We have 2 more weeks prior to the August recess, which are going to be very aggressive. Next week we plan to take up the energy and water appropriations bill and the Agriculture appropriations bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes from leader time. 
   Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments concerning the proposal, but also on the issue. I, for one, am disappointed that we had to file cloture on a motion to proceed to take up this bill. That took a long time. I am disappointed to see that now we may have a list of 10 amendments on each side, most of which have very little, if anything, to do with the underlying issue of estate tax repeal or reduction. 
   In other words, it is unfortunate, but a lot of people want to play politics, or they want to have a lot of different amendments that have nothing to do with this issue. 
   The American people want tax relief. They want to eliminate one of the most unfair taxes in America. Some people ask: Why are you doing this? Doesn't it only apply to 2 percent of the American people? The tax applies to a lot more than 2 percent of the American people. A lot of people aren't aware of the fact that they may well have to pay the tax. It is a very punitive tax. 
   Again, I have heard my Democrat colleagues say they are willing to increase the exemptions so we can increase the number of people who pay zero and, therefore, make the problem go away. The tax doesn't go away. 
   We are dealing with this tax on death. The Federal Government is saying, if you die and you happen to have an estate right now above the exemption amount, the Federal Government is going to come in and take at least 37 percent of what you have left if you have a taxable estate. If you have a taxable estate of $1 million, the Government wants 39 percent; if it is $3 million, 55 percent. That is pretty high. If you have a taxable estate of between $10 million and $17 million, the rate is 60 percent. 
   What is fair about that, whether it is 1 percent or 10 percent of the American people paying it? What is fair about the Government taking 60 percent of somebody's business or their property, for which they worked their entire life. For the Government to come in and say, ``We want over half of it''? Absolutely nothing is right about that. Where is the justice in society, even if it is only one person? Shouldn't we have a Tax Code that is fair for all? Is it fair to say 1 percent or 2 percent or 5 percent, we are going to take half of your property? Is that justified? 
   I thought Government was supposed to protect our property not confiscate it. An individual should not be subject to extra burden because they have been successful. Maybe you start a small business and it grows, and you have no interest in taking the money out of the business. You want it to grow. You want your kids to take over or maybe your grandkids to take it over. 
   There are millions of businesses in America today where the second or third generations want to grow, build, and expand. They are not trying to sell it so they can hand their kids a lot of wealth. They want their kids to have a business where they can continue to grow it, employ more people, and provide a product and a service. Then Uncle Sam comes in and says: Sorry you are too successful. We want 50 percent or 60 percent of what you have. 
   That is currently the law. If we adopt the Democrats' substitute, it will stay that way. 
   Last year, only 902 out of 47,000 estates, as pointed out by Chairman ROTH, qualified as small businesses or as family farms. A whole lot of farms and a whole lot of businesses that think they would qualify for the exemption will find out that the IRS has written these regulations pretty tight, and they don't qualify. All of a sudden, their business is hit with a very high tax. Let's say a restaurant business is bigger than $5 million. Say you have a couple of restaurants in Denver or maybe in Delaware and 
   you build a nice restaurant worth a couple million dollars. You work hard every night. Maybe you have two restaurants, and the net value of the estate is $6 million. Uncle Sam is going to come in and say, under the Democrats' proposal, maybe we will give you a $2 million exemption, but for $4 million of it, you are going to be taxed. 
   Do you start the tax rate at 18 percent? No. Under the Democrats' proposal, you start at the taxable rate of 37 percent. By the third million dollars, you are at 55 percent. The tax that you are going to owe is $1.5 million. The restaurant doesn't have it. How do you pay? You have to sell it. Instead of somebody being able to keep that restaurant and pass it on to the third generation, you have to sell it because you do not have the $1.5 million you owe in taxes. It may be worth $3 million, but you do not have $1.5 million in cash. Now you have to sell it, and the Government is responsible for destroying a business. Maybe someone else will pick it up; maybe not. Maybe the person who picks it up doesn't have the same interest in the employees or the same real interest in the business. Who knows? 
   My point is that Government shouldn't be confiscating property because somebody dies. 
   The proposal that passed with overwhelming bipartisanship in the House, by a two-thirds majority, two to one, said eliminates the death tax. Let's make it taxable when the property is sold. When someone dies, his or her children should be able to inherit the restaurant. If their kids want to keep operating the restaurant, they should not be taxed. The tax should be incurred when the restaurant is sold. It should be taxed at a capital gains rate of 20 percent instead of 55 or 60 percent. 
   That makes more sense. When they sell it, guess what? They have the cash. They can pay the tax. The tax rate is reasonable. It makes sense. It is 20 percent, not 55. 
   So the idea that we are going to exempt this greater percentage of the estate doesn't eliminate the unfairness of the tax. It doesn't even do what President Clinton said that he may be willing to do. The President, spoke to the  Governors on July 10, just a couple of days ago, and said: ``We provided some estate tax relief in 1997. I really didn't think it was enough. I think there should be more.'' 
   I was involved in the conference in 1997. I will tell you that Secretary Rubin totally opposed this measure in estate tax relief throughout the entire process. Assistant Secretary Summers was also completely opposed to it. For the President to say he really wanted to do more is factually incorrect, or maybe his Treasury Secretary was not representing his interests. Maybe his Assistant Secretary of Treasury, Larry Summers, who at that time in 1997 said, ``In terms of substantive arguments, the evidence is about as bad as it gets. When it comes to the estate tax, there is no case other than selfishness.'' 
   That was Larry Summers position in 1997. That was when we were negotiating the tax bill in 1997, on which the President now says he wanted to do more. I find that to be very interesting. 
   The President also said to the Governors--``I mean, you could argue the rates are too high because they are higher than the maximum income rates now, and that is something that didn't used to be the case.'' 
   That is right. The maximum estate tax rates that I just mentioned go up to 55 percent and 60 percent for the biggest estates, because we phased out the gradual phasing in of the rates. For a taxable estate between $10 million and $17 million, the rate is 55 percent; above $17 million, it is 60 percent. 
   The maximum personal income tax rate is 39.6 percent--actually it is higher than that because the President eliminates other deductions and exemptions and has no limit on Medicare tax--he is implying he would be willing to reduce the maximum estate tax from 55 to 39.6. That is a step in the right direction, because rates are the problem. 
   The Democratic proposal does not effect the rates. It only increases exemption. If we have an estate beyond that exemption--and there are millions of farms and ranches and businesses above it; they are $2 million, $4 million, $6 million--they are hit with the rate. Because of the unified credit, you are taxed at 37 percent. 
   What we did in the Republican proposal that passed the House, was change the unified credit to an exemption. Once a person is above the exemption amount, they begin paying estate taxes at 18 percent, not 37 percent. The bipartisan proposal that passed the House, that we will vote on, that Chairman ROTH has been pushing, gives tax relief for people who pay estate taxes; they start paying at 18 percent instead of 37 percent. We changed the credit to an exemption and that benefits the lower value of estates that are taxable. 
   This rhetoric that we are exempting the big estates is hogwash. Big estates pay capital gains when those properties are sold. They will pay when that property is sold--not when someone dies. That rate will be 20 percent. That makes sense. The tax is paid when the property is sold, not when someone dies. 
   Too many people are faced with the very unfortunate circumstance which I faced when my dad died. I was young. My father passed away, and we had a manufacturing company. The book value of that manufacturing company was zero. The Government claimed it was worth a lot. We fought the IRS for 7 years over the value of the company. We ended up writing a big check and settling with the IRS. The Government wanted a big chunk of the Nickles Machine Corporation. They said it was worth much more than we did. How do we know what the value is unless we sell it? The Government was trying to force us to sell the company. 
   I am afraid this is happening today in millions of cases all across the country. People are aware that this may happen, so they start planning: What shall I do? Maybe I will start giving stock to my kids. Maybe the kids want to be in the business, maybe they don't want to be in the business. There are schemes. People who have big estates create foundations. They do all kinds of things to avoid the tax. 
   There are millions of Americans who don't know the tax is coming. If they do, they are worried about it, or they contain their plans, or they don't grow their businesses. That is yet another negative consequence of the death tax. They say: Why should I grow this business? I will pass away, and the Government will get over half. Why should we ``grow it'' if the Government is going to take half of it? 
   As a result many new jobs are not created. Many economic transactions do not take place because of the Government's heavy hand coming in. That is in addition to the fact that they taxed the property when it was originally received or as it earned income year by year. 
   This is one of the most unfair taxes on the books--maybe the most unfair tax we have on the books today. It needs to be repealed. An exemption will not cure the problem. It may garner support from some groups, but it is not adequate. Anybody who reads the definition of ``farm'' and ``business'' will realize they do not qualify for the exemption. 
   The Democrat substitute is not feasible and it should not pass. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Democrat substitute and vote in favor of the Roth amendment. 
   I hope we will be voting on both before too long and I hope those are the only two votes we have on this bill. I understand we may be voting on twenty amendments regarding taxes in general. I think we should be considering amendments relevant to estate taxes only. These extraneous amendments do not help the process, they just slow it down. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, if it is a refundable credit, we have now turned a tax cut into a spending bill, I would assume spending billions of dollars. 
   Again, we haven't had a chance to review the amendment. We haven't had it scored. We will review it. We will find out if a point of order lies against it. I happen to think that one does. We will find out when the chairman of the Budget Committee makes that decision tomorrow. If it is a refundable tax credit, it is a spending bill. 
   This is a way for Uncle Sam to be writing checks. This is a way for us to be spending more money. I question the wisdom of doing that, especially without a chance to review it and consider it.

   Mr. NICKLES. If you are making it a refundable credit, you are making this more of a priority than health care. You are saying this is a more important item than food, in some cases, because you are having the Federal Government write a check to pay for it. We don't do that with health care. 
   I understand your desire to do some things for child health care. We happen to agree with much of that because we passed it last year in the bill the President vetoed. But now you are trying to make it refundable by having Uncle Sam write a check for it. I personally think you are going too far with that amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I mention to my colleagues, I think everyone is aware the minority leader yielded 5 minutes to his colleagues on each of these minutes. I do not like to do it, but it is important to point out some of the facts. I appreciate my colleague from Texas pointing them out. 
   This amendment and the Vice President's proposal is one of the riskiest, maybe one of the most deceitful I have seen in my years in Congress. It basically says we should have double accounting of interest. It says we are going to take the interest savings from debt reduction and apply that to Social Security, as if we are going to make Social Security more solvent. It would not do that. 
   I will give some quotes from people who studied the proposal. One is from David Walker, Comptroller General of GAO:  
   [The Clinton-Gore proposal] does not come close to saving Social Security.  
   The proposal he is referring to is the Clinton-Gore proposal.  
   Under the President's proposal, the changes to the Social Security program will be more perceived than real: although the trust funds will appear to have more resources as a result of the proposal, nothing about the program has changed.  
   Dan Crippen, Director of CBO:  
   Those transfers would have no effect on the ability of the Federal Government to meet the obligations of those programs. The transfer would not, as some have asserted, strengthen Medicare or Social Security. At most, they might have the opposite effect of imparting a false sense of security.  
   It is double accounting. 
   I have a statement from CBO's ``An Analysis of the President's Budgetary Proposals for Fiscal Year 2001.'' On page 67, it talks about the interest savings transfers to Social Security. It says:  
   The Social Security trust funds already receive credits for interest on their accumulated balances under current law.  
   They already get interest on the surpluses. That is already current law. 
   It continues:  
   The proposed transfers would simply add extra interest credits on top of those that would be provided anyway..... . The transfers themselves would have no economic significance because they would flow out of one government fund and into another.  
   If we want to say we are making the Social Security fund more solvent by adding more IOUs, we should do what the Senator from Texas did. Why stop at $100 billion? 
   I read that the Senator's amendment will add $250 billion annually after 2015. Why not right now? Let's just add $5 trillion. We have about $10 trillion of unfunded liability in Social Security. Let's just say we have a Government IOU, $10 trillion. It is fully funded. In the year 2012 or 2015, there is going to be a shortage. There is going to be more money going out than coming in, and those IOUs will not be able to pay one check--not one. 
   At that point in time, the Government is going to have to borrow more money, raise taxes, or cut benefits. In other 
   words, we have not changed the program, and putting in more IOUs will not pay one benefit, will not pay one Social Security check. If my colleagues are interested in the solvency--my colleague is saying let's also increase benefits; let's increase retirement benefits; let's increase survivor benefits; let's increase benefits for people not paying into the system and increase survivor benefits, none of which had hearings before the Finance Committee. 
   Talk about being irresponsible and playing politics with Social Security. This amendment does it in the worst way. This amendment needs to fail and, frankly, the Vice President should be ashamed of this proposal. I hope our colleagues will vote against it, and I urge our colleagues to vote against it tomorrow morning. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, maybe my colleague from Iowa did not understand what we voted on earlier. Earlier we voted on repeal of the tax on Social Security which was passed by the Clinton-Gore administration, passed by Vice President GORE because he broke the tie, passed by every Democrat, but not one Republican voted for it. We had 58 votes, I believe, in the Senate to repeal it today. Those are the facts. 
   There was a tax increase on Social Security that passed in 1993, and it was passed by every Democrat. Today we had an overwhelming majority who voted to repeal it. Those are the facts. 
   Now we have an amendment before us that says let's double count interest savings even though we count the interest on Social Security surpluses. Let's double count and let's pretend that is going to make Social Security more solvent and, in the 
   process, let's add a whole bunch of new benefits and see if we can't buy more votes and tell people we are going to give them something even though they know it is not going to happen. It has not been considered in the Finance Committee and Ways and Means Committee. Even though they know it is irresponsible and Social Security has big problems coming up in 13, 14 years, they say: Let's put more IOUs in and pretend it will make it more solvent. The budget experts say it will not work. The President in his own budget statement said it will not work. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, a few comments. Our colleagues are proposing a tax credit for long-term health care. The Senate has passed that in a couple of bills. We passed it on minimum wage. We passed it on the Patients' Bill of Rights, giving an above-the-line deduction. 
   There is a difference between a deduction and a credit. By a credit, they are saying: You should pay no taxes whatsoever. We are saying: You should get a deduction. There is a difference. With a credit, you are saying that is a better priority. The Federal Government has decided that is a better priority than your health care because people don't get a credit for their health care deductions. We are going to say this is more important. 
   I think it is equally important. As a matter of fact, the bill we passed said we should have an above-the-line deduction for health care and for long-term health care costs. We want to encourage both. But to say that one is more important than the other, as this bill does, by saying that long-term health care is more important than health care insurance, is a mistake. Most people would say they would rather have health care. 
   I noticed my colleague added expensing for self-employed. I am sure my friends are aware that I am very much a proponent of that. We have led the fight to make that happen. Incidentally, we have already passed that as well. We passed that on the minimum wage bill. We passed it on the Patients' Bill of Rights. I assure my colleagues, before any minimum wage bill passes, this is going to be part of it. 
   What my colleagues are not telling people is, they are including with it an amendment that basically guts the estate tax provision that we have in this bill. You go in and tell employers: We want to make sure that you pay estate taxes. And if you pay estate taxes, your minimum rate, the beginning rate, under the Democrat proposal, is 37 percent. If you have a taxable estate of $2 million, you will be paying 37 percent. I don't think they would think that is  a very good deal. Small businesspeople would say: You didn't do me any favors. 
   I urge my colleagues, at the appropriate time tomorrow, to vote against this amendment. 
   I yield back the remainder of our time.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the way I look at the Tax Code, I think it should be fair; it should be uniform. It is interesting to hear people say: This tax only applies to 2 percent, so let's sock it to them. They have been enormously successful. So what is the right rate? Is it 55 percent or 60 percent, as it is on Americans today? Are my colleagues aware of the fact that if you have a $10 million taxable estate, the death tax is 60 percent? 
   I know my colleague says he picked a higher figure, $100 million, and that is only 55 percent. Incidentally, he didn't mention it in his comments, but he also eliminates the stepped-up basis. That means you will have a much greater capital gains tax. So you have a 55-percent rate and you have capital gains. It is a really heavy hit. Uncle Sam will get over half. 
   What is fair? It is easy to demagog and say those guys are supporting tax cuts for the wealthy. That is hogwash. What is fair? If somebody works their entire life and has enormous success and builds up a company--and say it is worth $100 million, which is great--and the principal dies and their kids want to operate that plant, they don't want to sell it. Uncle Sam is entitled to 55 percent of it? I don't think so. What is 
   fair about that or uniform about it? I don't think it makes sense. Maybe they want to continue that. 
   I can think of a lot of businesses--for example, Bechtel Construction is one of the world's premier construction companies; it happens to be a private business. I am sure it is worth a lot more than this. If the principal owner dies and his kids want to run it, the Government can say, no, we want half. What is right about that? Maybe I shouldn't mention anybody by name. They have never contacted me on this issue. 
   My point is, where is the Government's right to say that? He said we are squandering ``our'' resources. How is that the Federal Government's resources? They are the ones who built up these companies, but the Federal Government is entitled to take over half of it when somebody dies? Don't say, well, those estates are getting away from taxes because, under our proposal, when the property is sold, they pay capital gains. That rate is 20 percent; it is not 55 percent. To me, it is a lot more manageable. That is a taxable event just as it would be on any American. But it is basically when the property is sold, not when somebody dies. 
   We want to eliminate the death tax for all Americans, not just wealthy Americans. They should not have to pay a tax on death. The taxable event would be on the sale of the property--when and if they sell the property. The kids would receive the property and keep running the business; there is no tax. If they sell the business, there is a tax. They pay capital gains. 
   Under my colleague's proposal, they pay a whole lot more tax because he eliminates the stepped-up basis as well. You keep the extra high rates, and you also have no stepped-up basis and capital gain. So you hit them really hard. 
   Why don't we just make it 100 percent? Let's just eliminate anybody who accumulates wealth that happens to be over $100 million. Then we won't have  the entrepreneurs; we won't have the Microsofts; we won't have the Oracles or the other high-tech companies; we won't have the young entrepreneurs who are building and expanding these businesses in our country. 
   You can go to a lot of countries that don't have taxes on estates. It is pretty easy today to start a new business in high technology. You can go to other countries easily because they want the entrepreneurs; they will welcome them in because they realize that is the engine of a growing economy, and it is fantastic, so they will give great benefits. 
   We have one of the highest estate taxes in the world. Some of my colleagues say: Let's only have it on the wealthy, successful people; we will really sock it to them. I think that is really unfair. The Tax Code should be uniform and fair. As a matter of fact, I think of the Constitution where I read that the Tax Code should be uniform. Now when people say we have to increase the exemption so much that we will sock it to the wealthy, the rates already at 55 percent--60 percent for some Americans--that is way too high. We say, wait a minute, the Tax Code should be uniform. Let's eliminate the tax on death on all Americans--not just wealthy Americans but on all Americans--and have the taxable event when the property is sold on wealthy Americans as well. They can pay 20 percent just as any other American does. 
   To me, that is fair, uniform and, frankly, would probably raise more money because wealthy people have figured out lots of ways to get around estate taxes--through foundations and other little gimmicks. They hire lots of attorneys and successful people and pay them lots of money every year to make sure they pay no tax. 
   It would be very interesting to know how much money is utilized--some say wasted--but generated to avoid this tax or how many businesses aren't expanded to avoid this tax. 
   If my colleague's amendment would pass, how many successful people would flee to another country to expand their business and grow their business so they would not be faced with the situation where they worked their entire life for success, and they happen to die, and Uncle Sam says: Thank you very much; we want 55 percent. Thank you for your efforts, but those are ``our" resources. Ours? The Government didn't build that company, but the Government is entitled to over half of the estate. The power to tax is the power to destroy. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment at the appropriate time tomorrow.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, again, I want to be very clear. I can think of a female entrepreneur in Oklahoma building a business. It has been very successful. She built it basically from scratch. I am going to guess it is worth $100 million. For this hypothetical example, it is worth $100 million. I bet it is. This business has worldwide sales in pies. She will know who I am talking about. They have had great success. 
   The value of that company probably 20 years ago was probably less than $1 million. Today, for this purpose, it is worth $100 million. 
   Let's say she is the sole owner of the company and she dies. Under the Democrat proposal of my colleague from Wisconsin, the tax would be 55 percent. Once you get to the higher levels, you don't get to phase in. That is $55 million--55 percent. 
   Under his proposal, also you would lose the stepped-up basis, which is kind of complicated. Basically, it means you go back to the zero basis of what it was. 
   Since the value was almost $1 million, or nothing, 20 years ago, you are going to have to pay another 20 percent on top of that. For this $100 million corporation, say, her sole survivor who wants to inherit this company and keep it running has to pay a tax bill in the neighborhood of about $75 million out of a $100 million company. 
   What is right about that? What is fair about that? Nothing, zero. 
   Again, taxes should be uniform. They should be fair. 
   This amendment is written to demagog. This amendment says: 
   Yes. These tax cuts are really going to benefit people making even over $100 million. 
   My point is that the Tax Code should be fair and uniform. If we are not going to have death taxes, they should not apply to anybody. Conversely, if we eliminate the tax on death for everybody, including the people over $100 million and under $100 million, all would pay capital gains. So when and if that business is sold there would be a capital gains tax. It would be 20 percent. If you have a $100 million business, or gain in property, and they sell it, the Federal Government would get $20 million. 
   Isn't that enough? Why in the world would my colleague think the Federal Government under present law and under my colleague's proposal should get over 50 percent? Why would the Federal Government be entitled to 60 percent or 75 percent of that business under his proposal? He taxes them twice. 
   Under the proposal of my colleague from Wisconsin, the estate would pay twice: once at the death based on the appraised value, and again when the asset is sold without a stepped-up basis. 
   You couldn't be more unfair. If you are going to go to 75 percent, why don't you make it 100 percent? 
   This idea of it being the resource of the Government when somebody dies belongs in the Kremlin. It doesn't belong in the United States. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I remind my colleagues from Illinois and North Dakota, we have rules in the Senate, and that is to go through the Chair. The dialogs are interesting, but we are supposed to go through the Chair, and that has not happened in a while. 
   I want to correct some of the factual misstatements that were just made. My colleagues said we want to bring up the repeal of the death tax and offer no amendments. That is not correct. We have told our friends on the Democratic side that we will allow them to offer a substitute. They can have relevant amendments. We are willing to enter into time agreements to pass this bill. Frankly, what they want to do is unload an agenda they cannot pass. 
   My colleagues mentioned that we will not allow them a debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We already voted on it a couple of times. We voted on it last year, and we voted on it twice in the last month. The problem is they have a flawed proposal that will not pass and cannot pass. 
   We voted on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We voted on minimum wage. For them to say, instead of voting to repeal the death tax, which we are hopefully going to do, they have a lot of other things on which they would rather vote--we have given them votes on almost every issue that has been mentioned. On the death tax, we have said--and I will propound a unanimous consent request--we will have an amendment on each side; we will have three amendments on each side; we will consider their alternatives. 
   My colleague from Illinois said let's have an exemption, not change the rates; let's vote on this issue. We are willing to do that. The problem is our colleagues on the Democratic side really do not want a tax cut, period. 
   We are trying to eliminate the death tax so there will not be a tax on death. What there will be is a tax on the sale of the property when whomever inherits the property sells it. We will eliminate the taxable event on someone's death. This is a very significant and I believe one of the most positive things we can do if we want to help the economy, if we want fairness. 
   We are trying to help the small business people, the Democrats say; the Democrats are willing to do that. Hogwash. I used to run a small business. I did not want it to be small; I wanted it to be big. I do not know if it would meet the Democrats' definition. A lot of us really do believe we should eliminate the tax on someone's death and turn it into a taxable event when the property is sold. If individuals who receive this business or receive this property do not sell it, there will not be a taxable event. When they do sell it, there will be a tax, and that tax will be capital gains. That tax rate is 20 percent, not 39 percent, not 55 percent. 
   I want to correct a misstatement just made. We are willing to enter into time agreements. We are willing to consider  relative amendments, substitutes. If they want to have a substitute that has an exemption, fine; let's vote on it. If they want to vote on an alternative, let's do it. We are willing to do it. But to say we are not willing to consider amendments and that it is ``take our proposal that passed the House''----

   Mr. NICKLES. In a moment I will. 
   The facts are, the cost over 10 years, which is the most we ever use, is $104 billion. I heard them say it is $750 billion. I do not know from where they are grabbing these figures. If we use that kind of analogy, it would be fun to see how much the tax increase of 1993 cost because if this tax cut is $750 billion over the next 20-some-odd years, I would hate to think how much the cost of the tax increase the Democrats passed in 1993 is. 
   The facts are, the estate tax repeal is $104 billion over the next 10 years. That is what passed the House. Hopefully, that is 
    what the Senate will pass today, tomorrow, or in the near future.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I regret our colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle have decided to once again try to turn an issue, an important issue, Patients' Bill of Rights, into a political theater and not legislate, not come up with reasonable compromise. Instead, they want votes. They want to try to score points. I find that to be unfortunate because we are working very hard to try to come up with a responsible product. 
   A compromise in the conference committee is not easy on this issue because the differences between the House bill and the Senate bill are significant. They are significantly different in cost and scope and liability. We are trying to bridge those differences. It takes time, it takes compromise, it takes both sides working together. 
   We made a lot of progress with our colleagues on the Democrat side, in spite of what my good friend from Massachusetts says, a lot more progress than 2 out of 20 items. We agreed on an appeals process. Maybe not on every single last letter, but by and large we agreed on the appeals process. We invited the press in; we came to an agreement. It took about 2 months. I thought it should have taken a week. The reason why it took 2 months is because our friends on the Democrat side always kept wanting a little bit more. That is tough negotiating. I am not faulting them for that. But they are the reason why it took 2 months to come up with an appeals process. We basically agreed with it. 
   I just have to make a mention on scope. When they say: Wait a minute, their bill only applies to 50 million and our applies to 161 million; it should apply to everybody--our plan applies to everybody covered by ERISA. That is the plan we are amending, every employer-sponsored plan. 
   I know the Senator wants to overrule the State of Massachusetts State employee plan, he wants to regulate State individual plans--he wants national health care. I compliment him. He is being consistent. He always thought the Federal Government could do it better than States, and he always wanted the Federal Government to do it instead of States. I disagree with that. We have a disagreement. That is one of the items we were wrestling with in conference. 
   Now we have an amendment. 
   We tried to do this in a big fashion last year. They had their amendments. We had a lot of votes on amendments last year. Senator KENNEDY lost. We had an amendment on scope. We debated that last year. The Senator from Massachusetts lost. The majority of the Senate said: No, we don't want the Federal Government to take over State regulation of insurance. We don't think HCFA is very good at administering the insurance. They have a hard enough time in Medicare. Do we really want them to regulate State insurance? The Senate said no. The House said yes. We were negotiating that. 
   Incidentally, that is one of the things we are negotiating as we speak. But my colleagues on the Democrat side didn't wait for the conference. Two weeks ago they said: Let's ignore the conference. Let's just adopt the House position. In spite of the fact we have reached a bicameral agreement on a lot of patient protections, including the appeals process which, for my colleagues' information, is the backbone of the bill. It is the most important thing in the bill because if you do a good job in the appeals process, you don't have to go to the courthouse. 
   The patients who need care, whether it is the cleft palate that my colleague continues to show in the picture--they are going to have an appeal under the bill that we have. They are going to get care. It is going to be decided by a medical expert totally independent of the plan. That is going to be a binding decision. The person who is denied health care is going to have an appeal and is going to get the health care they need when they need it; not just go to court.

   Mr. NICKLES. No, I will not yield. I have a lot of comments to make. Maybe I will yield at a later time. 
   Instead of waiting for the conference to work, my colleague from Massachusetts put the Patients' Bill of Rights on either the Department of Defense authorization bill or the Defense appropriations bill. 
   There is no way in the world that bill is ever going to come out of conference. It was nothing but political theater. It disrupted the conference. I told him and my colleagues and I planned on having a conference that day with my Democratic colleagues. No, they engaged in political theater because maybe some people wanted to have a headline that said: ``Senate defeated Patients' Bill of Rights.'' We moved to table the amendment. The vote was 51-48. It accomplished nothing but headlines for my colleagues. 
   Two weeks after the vote, we have another Patients' Bill of Rights. Maybe we will have several and do them piecemeal. Maybe we will do one on scope and one on patient protections. 
   I tell my colleagues, this is not the way to legislate. We are on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. Everyone knows this bill is not going to come back--maybe it will; maybe we will pass patient protections and put it on Labor-HHS. My colleagues put minimum wage on bankruptcy. Frankly, it is a complicated effort for both bills. Minimum wage did not belong on bankruptcy and patient protections does not belong on Labor-HHS. 
   Are they seriously legislating? No. Did they come up with a serious legislative proposal? They have a two-page proposal on scope. What is the amendment offered by my friend from North Dakota? He has an amendment which deals with scope. 
   My colleague talked about all these patient protections. Guess what. They are not in his amendment. His amendment basically says: We want the Federal Government to set standards, and, oh, States, you have to meet these standards. If not, the Federal Government is going to take over. 
   This little amendment, which looks innocuous and is like a thematic statement, says we are going to have the Federal Government design, mandate, and dictate benefits, and, States, if you do not meet these dictates, we are going to have the Federal Government take over; HCFA will take over; you will have to follow the HCFA standard. 
   This is the GAO report: Implementation of HCFA. The headline says: ``Progress slow in enforcing Federal standards in nonconforming States.'' We have a lot of States not conforming with existing laws where HCFA is supposed to have control--ask any of your doctors. Some people profess they want to be helpful to doctors. Ask the doctors. If we adopt the Dorgan amendment, we are asking HCFA to take over State regulation of health care. That would be a disaster. That would not improve quality health care. That would duplicate State regulation, confuse State regulation, and have Federal regulators who do not have the wherewithal or the talent--they say so themselves. They say in this report they do not have the talent; they cannot do it. They are not doing it in existing law. 
   They have three areas in existing law they are supposed to enforce, and they are not doing it. This is the GAO report saying this, not DON NICKLES. It is fact. And we are going to give them regulation over State health care? That is absurd. I know some people want national health care. They want the Federal Government to regulate health care in the States. I do not. I think it would be a serious mistake. 
   What about scope?

   Mr. NICKLES. I want to continue before I lose my train of thought. 
   What about scope? The scope proposal in our bill applies to every single ERISA-covered plan. Every employer-  sponsored plan would have an external appeal because that is ERISA. It has Federal remedies. 
   We also included in this proposal a cause of action, a cause of action liability. In case the external appeal overturns the HMO and they do not pay, we say you can sue the HMO. We did not have that in the bill before. We did not have liability. We compromised. 
   Some say the conference has not done anything. We made a concession. We have liability in our proposal so patients can sue HMOs. It turns out that a lot of our colleagues want to sue more, on every case. They want to turn this into an invitation for litigation. We do not. 
   We do have cause of action. We have remedies allowing patients to go after the HMO, and, frankly, the employer, if acting as the HMO, if they are the final decisionmaker, if they are the ones denying health care, if they are the ones causing injury, harm, damage, or death, because of their decision to deny health care, they can be held liable. My point being: We have moved forward in the conference. We have made compromises. We have been working. 
   This is not the way to legislate: We will put, at 5 o'clock on a Thursday afternoon, on the Labor-HHS bill and say we are going to do part of patient protections, we are going to pick out a piece of it, a very significant piece. Maybe we will do another piece tomorrow. 
   That is not the way we are going to do it. We offered a significant comprehensive proposal, one that deals with scope, liability, patient protections, one that has an appeals process that will apply to every single employer-sponsored plan in America. We are going to give everybody a chance. 
   You will not be voting on a real patient protections bill, not the one Senator DORGAN offered as a two-page amendment. We have an amendment pending that is 250 pages that has real patient protections and one we have been working on for over a year. 
   Frankly, over half that language--maybe over 70 percent of that language--has been negotiated with our colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle. It had tentatively been signed off by Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate. It has patient protections. It has an appeals process. We have a significant proposal. We do not have two pages. We have a Patients' Bill of Rights. We have remedies and cause of action where someone can sue an HMO or sue a final decisionmaker if they are denied health care. We have a good proposal, and I hope my colleagues will vote for it and against the Dorgan proposal. 
   We will have up-and-down votes on both proposals, on a bill on which neither one belongs. That is not my choice. I told my colleagues on the Democratic side that I will agree to a time certain and a vote on both of these proposals sometime--July, September. I am happy to do that. No, they want to score points. They want press conferences. They are not interested in patient protections. They are interested in press conferences and political theater. 
   They are not interested in helping patients. If they were interested in helping patients, they would be working with us to resolve and compromise in conference. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Maybe they will have theater, but we are going to give people substance on which to vote. 
   Last time, when my colleague from Massachusetts offered basically the House-passed bill--let's adopt the House position--we said no, and we tabled it. We saw the headlines: ``Republicans Defeat Patients' Bill of Rights.'' Guess what. Today we are going to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. We are going to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights and give every single patient in America who happens to be in an employer-sponsored plan an appeal. If they are denied health care by an HMO, they will have an appeal, done by a medical professional, an expert, using the best medical evidence available. It is a binding decision. 
   If for some reason that appeal is not adhered to nor complied 
   with, they will have a right to sue. They can sue their HMO, they can sue the final decisionmaker, if it is a self-funded, self-insured employer, if they make a decision to deny health care. They can sue them in those circumstances. We are offering real patient protections. 
   Time and again I have heard: We have to have patient protections where there is remedy against HMOs denying health care. We do that in this bill. We do not want people going to court; we want them to settle it in the appeals process so they get health care when they need it, not through the court system when it is too late. We want to resolve those cases. We want people to get health care. 
   On the patient protections--about which my colleague says the Senate does not do anything for the firefighter in Massachusetts, we want patient protections--we just do not think we are protecting patients by coming up with some facade that the Federal Government is going to take care of them when we know it cannot, and have the Federal Government basically preempt State law with national health insurance. 
   Look at the countries with national health care. Do they have the quality of health care that we do in this country? The answer is no; absolutely not. People think we can draft these patient protections in Washington, DC, and do a better job than the States. I happen to disagree. I will give some examples. 
   The States have done a lot with patient protections. We should not ignore that. We should encourage it and compliment it. We should encourage them to do more. It would be presumptive. 
   We negotiated access to emergency room care; direct access to pediatricians; provider nondiscrimination; direct access to specialists; continued care from a physician; timely binding appeals to an independent physician; agreement on direct access to OB/GYNs; agreement to improve plan information; agreement on access to out-of-network physicians; agreement on open discussion on treatment options with physicians; agreement on access to prescription drugs; and agreement on access to cancer clinical trials. 
   We have made a lot of progress. My colleagues say we have not done that. Are we going to say the language we drafted is so much better than anything the States can do and so we have to supersede their language? Some people think we are the font of all wisdom. I do not agree with that. It is absurd for us to say that. 
   States have been issuing patient protections. Forty-three States have already passed patient protection bills way ahead of the Federal Government. 
   I think it would be presumptuous of us to say: We are going to draft something. We know it is better. And States, you must comply. If you don't comply, the Federal Government is going to come in to regulate. 
   That is a serious mistake. I do not want to do it. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the proposal that I have submitted on behalf of myself and several others who have worked for over a year and a half to put together. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of that. And I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Dorgan-Kennedy amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

We do not say we should design plans written by the States for State employees or for city employees or individuals. Those have always been regulated by the Federal Government. They have never been regulated by ERISA, and they aren't regulated by them in our bill, either.

   Mr. NICKLES. To respond to a couple of comments, my colleague read from a Norwood letter that said the Republican conferees are not addressing liability. We have liability on the floor of the Senate. Mr. NORWOOD is not a conferee. Maybe he didn't know what he was talking about. We have liability on the proposal. Granted, there was not liability in the Senate bill we passed. There is on the bill we have before the Senate. 
   When we talk about scope, we have scope that applies to 131 million Americans in the appeals process and liability that they can sue their HMO. 
   To read a letter by a Congressman that says the conference is not doing anything, they don't have liability, and we have 
   liability is a little misleading.

   Mr. NICKLES. I will give my colleague an additional minute. 
   Let me say, I know he holds up a lot of photographs. I think that is a crummy way to legislate. But I will say that every single example he mentioned would be covered by external appeal. Those decisions would be made by medical experts. We even put in language that they would not be bound by the plan's definition of ``medical necessity.'' They would be covered. 
   Pass the bill. If you want those kinds of examples to be covered, pass the bill. We are going to give you a chance to vote on it tonight. I might mention, my colleague from Tennessee says: We have a bill that is a Patients' Bill of Rights-plus because we provide a lot of things for people who cannot afford it. We provide an above-the-line deduction to buy health care, so more people can buy health care. The Democrats' proposal is going to uninsure millions of Americans. 
   We should not do anything that is going to dramatically increase the price of health care and uninsure millions of Americans, as their proposal would do. We also don't think HCFA, that glorious Federal agency they are trying to empower, should be regulating all health care in the States. 
   I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Texas. I know sometimes it upsets people when we come out and say: Wait a minute, we are breaking the budget. 
   I work with the Senator from Texas on the Budget Committee and he happens to be right. I also compliment my colleague from Pennsylvania, who is managing the bill. As the Senator from Texas mentioned, no matter what is in this bill, many people--particularly on the other side--say it is never enough. No matter what is in there, it is never enough. The Senator from Pennsylvania put in more money than the President requested for education, and we have had four or five amendments saying let's spend billions more. It is never enough. No matter what, we more than matched the President. 
   The bill we have before us has outlays greater than the President requested and it is still not enough. 
   I happen to be one who is, I don't want to say a wonk on numbers, but I am really picky on numbers. I think we ought to be accurate on numbers. I asked people before, by how much does this bill grow? The Senator from Texas just says it grows by a fifth. He understates the growth by just a tad. The growth in this bill is 20.4 percent in budget authority according to CBO. That is a lot of BA growth. Some people say we are growing other areas of the budget, and that is true. No other area of the budget is growing nearly as fast. The Defense appropriations bill we already had before us and passed, if my memory serves me correctly, was growing at 7-point-some percent. That is a lot. It is a big increase. This is growing almost three times as much in budget authority. 
   People ask: What does that mean? It means the money we authorize to be spent; we are committing the Government to spend that amount. 
   What are outlays? Sometimes outlays are easier to figure. The growth percentage in outlays is not quite as much. The growth percentage in outlays is 12 percent. The Senator from Texas wants to take off $2.4 billion because that is an offset. That is, frankly, a faulty offset. It is only in there so we can have more money in real growth in outlays, in budget authority, in commitment to growth spending. 
   There is actually $4.9 billion in outlay offsets. The Senator from Texas might have been able to do the full $4.9 billion. I know he can do $2.4 billion, but there is $4.9 billion in offsets. I believe the chairman of the Appropriations Committee said we will drop those offsets. 
   The real program growth--and this is what we are talking about in BA--is $104.1 billion. That compares to last year's $86.5 million in budget authority. That is a growth of 20.4 percent. That is a lot. 
   If we adopt the amendment of the Senator from Texas, the growth will still be in excess of 17 percent. Granted, I know it will cause some consternation. I know the members of the committee will have to reshuffle and limit the growth of the spending in commitment to 17.5 percent. I happen to think that is doable. Maybe it is not the easiest thing in the world because we made commitments to grow spending more than the President did in this area or that area. Certainly, 17-percent growth is adequate, sufficient, and responsible. 
   As to the bill before us, one can only say it complies with the budget if they take into consideration $4.9 billion of offsets which, frankly, will not happen.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, let me just make an observation. I hear the threats that they are going to filibuster this amendment. This amendment deals with Labor-HHS appropriations. The Senate has the right to vote on whether or not we are going to spend the money in the Department of Labor to implement regulations that have a dramatic impact on business, on workers. We have a right to vote on it. The House voted on it; the Senate is going to vote on it. 
   We have voted on this amendment in one way or another almost every year since 1995. This is not a new issue. So now some people are saying, wait a minute, we are not going to take this tough vote. Didn't we just have a vote on hate crimes? I think we had two. Didn't we have a vote on campaign finance? Some people didn't want to vote on those two issues on this side of the aisle. Didn't we vote on a Patients' Bill of Rights? 
   Really, what the minority is saying is, we want to vote on our issues, but not on an issue that is relevant. Every amendment I just mentioned was not relevant to the underlying Department of Defense authorization bill. But still we ended up allowing those votes. We didn't have to. Now we have a relevant amendment to the underlying bill, Labor-HHS, the Department of Labor appropriations bill. We think the administration is going too far in the proposed regulations which they planned on having effective in December--these regulations the Clinton administration is trying to run through without significant hearings and without oversight and real analysis of how much it would cost. 
   Here is an example. On cost alone, the Department of Labor said--OSHA said--this regulation will cost $4 billion. The Small Business Administration, which they control, said the cost could be 15 times as much, or $60 billion a year. This Congress is not going to vote on a regulation that could cost $60 billion a year as estimated by the Small Business Administration? The private sector estimates range to over $100 billion per year. Wow, that is a lot of money. Shouldn't we vote on it? 
   Are these good regulations or not? Are we going to be able to stop them or not? Do we want to stop them? What are the regulations? They deal with ergonomics and with motion. OSHA--the Occupational Safety and Health Administration--is saying: We want to have some control over motion, and we think maybe this is harmful, and therefore we are going to control it. It may mean lifting boxes, or sitting at your desk, or anything minuscule, or something large. 
   The Department of Labor is coming in and saying: You need a remedy, you need to change the way you do business, because we know how to do your business better, and if it increases costs, that is too bad--not to mention the fact that they say we are going to change workers comp rules in every State in the Nation. I wonder what Senator BYRD from West Virginia thinks about changing workers comp rules in West Virginia. 
   I used to serve in the Oklahoma legislature. I worked on those laws and rules in our State. Are we going to have the Federal Government come up with a reimbursement rate of 90 percent when our State already passed a workers comp rule of 67 percent? Does the Federal Government know better? 
   My suggestion is that my colleagues from Arkansas and Wyoming, in introducing this amendment, have every right to offer an amendment that says: We are going to withhold funds on 
   this regulation. We don't want a regulation to go into effect in December without us having additional time to consider it, without knowing how much it is going to cost. Maybe it should be postponed or suspended; maybe we should let the next administration deal with it. Let's vote on it. 
   For people to say, wait a minute, we don't like this amendment, so we are going to filibuster--there are probably a lot of amendments I don't like. Are we going to filibuster all of those? I think that would be grossly irresponsible. We need to let the Senate work its way.

   Mr. NICKLES. The original rule came out, I believe, in 1995, and it made very little sense. The latest proposal had over 600 pages. The business community and others who looked at it said it was not workable. The Department of Labor has come back and said let's revise it and make it more workable. Did they show us results? No. They said let's overrule the States' workers comp. 
   If this went into effect--and I don't think it will, so maybe that is why people don't want to vote on it. But does this Congress really want to overrule every States' workers comp law? I don't think so. I think it would be a mistake. 
   To answer the question, this administration has been trying to promulgate this rule for about 5 years. We have been successful most of those years in putting in restrictions to stop them. Unfortunately, we didn't get it in last year. To me, it was one of the biggest mistakes Congress made last year--not stopping this administration. Now they are trying to promulgate the rule, I might mention, right after the elections, right before the next President. I think a delay is certainly in order.

   Mr. NICKLES. I think he asked me. They may have been working on this Department of Labor takeover of, I don't know what--workers involvement. But they issued the rule on November 23 of last year--a rule that has 600 pages. They may have been working on it for 10 years, but I doubt that. This administration hasn't been in office quite that long. But with enormous expense. 
   I think, again, we should have a vote. To give an example, I came from manufacturing, and we lifted and moved a  lot of heavy things. I don't really think somebody from the Department of Labor could come into Nickles Machine Corporation and say: Hey, we know the limits on what somebody can lift as far as pistons and cylinders and bearings are concerned. Therefore, we suggest you put a maximum on it. Or maybe every Senator--everybody has a machine shop, or every Senator has a bottling company. Somebody comes into the Senate every day and loads the Coke machines and the Pepsi machines. 
   This rule says that you can't lift that many cases; that you can't lift two cases at once, or one case, or maybe you can only lift a six-pack or something. The net result would be an estimate that bottlers would have to hire twice as many people. Maybe this is an employment bill. 
   My point is you could increase costs dramatically with draconian results without even knowing what we are doing. 
   I think a delay and not to have a regulation with this kind of economic consequence coming right after the election and right before the swearing in of a new administration makes good sense. 
   Let's postpone this until the next administration. 
   I thank my colleagues for their efforts. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I congratulate and compliment my friend and colleague from Wyoming, as well as the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. HUTCHINSON, because they have offered an amendment that is one of the most important amendments we are going to vote on this year. The Clinton administration is trying to push forward an ergonomics rule that will have a draconian, negative impact on every single business in America. 
   I want all my colleagues to know if this amendment is not adopted, if this ergonomics rule goes forward, there will be significant costs. Employers will be coming up to you asking: Why did you do this to me? I have some bureaucrat coming in and telling me how to run my business. 
   I have a quote given by the individual who wrote these regs. She said:  
   I love it; I absolutely love it. I was born to regulate. I don't know why, but that's very true. So as long as I am regulating, I'm happy.  
   And she came up with the largest regulation in OSHA's history on business. The Small Business Administration estimated it will cost $60 billion a year, 15 times the cost that OSHA said. People in the private sector said it will cost over $100 billion a year. And the administration wants this to go forward right after the election, right before we have a change of administration. 
   Senator KENNEDY said this has been studied. Congress passed, in 1998, $890,000 for a study by the National Academy of Sciences. They are going to complete that study in January. We should let them do it. We should base this regulation on science, real science, not on a political agenda. They want to cram through an extensive regulation where bureaucrats are telling employees how to run their business, and to do that right before the election, before the next administration, will be a serious mistake. 
   We need to stop it, and the way to stop it is to adopt the Enzi amendment. I say to my colleagues, this is probably the most important free-enterprise, private-sector initiative you'll vote on this year: If this year you believe business should be making decisions, support the amendment. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Enzi amendment.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, just briefly, this amendment would transfer $100 million away from the Colombian aid into the Department of Justice to be used for drug interdiction, for counternarcotic activities including and especially to combat methamphetamine production and trafficking, which is rampant throughout the United states, and also to use this money to enhance policing initiatives throughout the country in drug hotspots. 
   I appreciate the cooperation of my colleagues and hope we will have an affirmative vote on that.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Arkansas, Senator HUTCHINSON, for his contribution to this debate. I want to make a couple of comments. 
   If we adopt the Murray-Snowe amendment, we will be turning military hospitals worldwide into abortion clinics. That is what it is about. 
   I heard somebody else say: We have to protect the constitutional right to choose. It is not the right to choose. The question is, are we going to turn military hospitals into abortion clinics? 
   I also heard the comment: The military supports this amendment. I would like to ask General Shelton that. I would like to ask Secretary Cohen that. I would like to ask former Secretary Dick Cheney that. I would like to ask Colin Powell that. I doubt that would be the case. 
   What about this constitutional right? I heard ``safe legal abortions.'' When did Congress pass a law? I do not believe Congress ever passed a law saying women have a right to an abortion. The Supreme Court came up with a decision in Roe v. Wade that ``legalized'' abortion, and by legalizing abortion they overturned State laws. 
   The majority of States--almost all States--had restrictions on abortions. The Supreme Court, in its infinite wisdom, said: States, you do not know enough, so we are going to legalize abortion. 
   I personally find it offensive anytime the Supreme Court goes into the lawmaking business. I read the Constitution to say Congress shall pass all laws--article I of the Constitution. It does not say, laws that are kind of complicated, Supreme Court, you go ahead and pass. 
   Now people are trying to take, in my opinion, a flawed Supreme Court decision and say we are going to turn that into a fringe benefit. Certainly, the Supreme Court did not say that, but my colleagues are saying: We want to have the right to have an abortion in government hospitals; this is a fringe benefit; let's pick it up, it is going to be paid for by the taxpayers. 
   These doctors, who are Federal doctors, are going to be trained to do what? Provide abortions. What is an abortion? It is the destruction of a human life. We are now going to turn this Supreme Court decision into a fringe benefit? The Supreme Court never said this was a fringe benefit. The Supreme Court never said the Government had to pay for it, or the taxpayers had to pay for it. 
   Who pays that doctor's salary? Who is going to train that doctor? Who is going to train the nurse? Who is going to make sure the facilities are there? The taxpayers are. The Supreme Court never said you have to turn this into a Federal paid fringe benefit at Federal expense. 
   I heard somebody else say this is not a debate about paying for it; they are willing to pay for it themselves. They do not pay for the training of the doctors. They do not pay for the building of the facilities or having the facilities there, and all the expenses associated with it. 
   Basically, they are asking that the Federal policy be to turn our military hospitals into abortion clinics with the acceptance, with the acknowledgment, with the prestige of the U.S. Government, that this is a procedure we will supply, as if it is just an ordinary fringe benefit. 
   It is dehumanizing life. It is devaluing life. It is just a fringe benefit? It is a destruction of life. We are going to have the taxpayers do that? We are going to mandate all military hospitals worldwide become abortion clinics? 
   We are going to mandate basically that these doctors, when they are recruited to go into military training, have to also be trained to perform abortions? I think that would be a serious mistake. I urge my colleagues, at the appropriate time, to vote in favor of the motion to table the Murray amendment. 
   Again, my compliments to my friend and colleague from Arkansas.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to respond to my colleague, first to say I very much regret our colleague from Massachusetts is bringing this amendment to the DOD authorization bill. I heard the minority leader say we want to pass the DOD bill, but there is certainly no evidence of that when you introduce this bill, totally extraneous to DOD, campaign finance, and other unrelated matters. It appears as if defense doesn't matter. We have an unaccomplished agenda. 
   Have we voted on these matters before? Yes, we have. Senator KENNEDY is basically saying let's pass the House-passed bill. We are now in conference. I am somewhat resentful of some of the statements that were made by our colleagues. They said the conference was a charade. Tell that to the members of the conference who have worked, Members and staff, over 400 hours this year--probably more time spent in this conference than any other conference, maybe, in years. 
   They said there is intransigence on the part of the Republicans. Not so. Republicans have made significant compromises and adjustments in willingness to try to see if we cannot close the gap on two extremely different bills. The House passed a bill called the Norwood-Dingell bill. Now we have Senator KENNEDY saying, we don't care what is going on in the conference, let's just pass the House bill. He tried to pass it before in the Senate. It was not successful. I doubt he will be successful today. As a matter of fact, if he did not have this amendment on the floor today, we would probably be in conference, trying to work out some of the differences. 
   So we really have to ask ourselves, are the Democrats interested in an issue or political theater--and that is exactly what this is. This does not change a thing. Senator KENNEDY a couple of weeks ago said, ``I am just going to warn you, maybe I'll have to take it to the floor.'' I said, fine, you are going to find out the House can probably pass Norwood-Dingell again and it will not pass the Senate. Does that help resolve the differences? I don't think so. 
   We made an offer. I heard some comments made: Well, that offer was a charade; or it wasn't any good, or didn't mean anything. We made some compromises. The only thing we have heard back--we didn't get a written response. All we heard is verbally, it did not do very much. 
   Wait a minute, we have done a lot. If you are interested in patient protection, we have done a lot. We have agreed that everybody who has an employer-sponsored plan would have an external appeal. If they are denied health care by their HMO, they have an external appeal, an independent appeal decided by physicians, that would be binding. If for some reason the HMO would not agree to that binding decision, they could be sued. 
   Let me read to you Senator KENNEDY's comments in the beginning of the discussion. This is Senator KENNEDY:  
   I think the overriding issue--and others have spoke about it, is really whether we are ultimately going to have the important medical decisions which affect families in this country made by the doctors and by the families and the medical professionals, or whether they will be made by a bureaucrat. That is really the heart of it. There are other provisions that are relevant to that and to making the basic and fundamental right a reality, but that is really the heart of the whole situation.  
   We have done that. Senator KENNEDY said we haven't agreed upon anything.  But we have agreed that doctors will have the ultimate decision. 
   An independent appeals process, independent of any plan? We have agreed upon that. He says that is the main thing. Now he is saying that is not good enough. 
   I am just very displeased, I guess, that language be used that there is intransigence, we had no choice but to bring this to the floor. If anybody wanted to pass a bill and have it become law, this is the last thing they should do. And have press conferences blasting the process. This process has been open. This process has been bipartisan. This process has tried to reach across and bridge differences and compromise. Yet they say, we don't care what you have done. As a matter of fact, did they offer the compromise, an appeals process that has been agreed to by Democrats and Republicans? No, they came back and said, we want the House bill, an inferior product compared to what we have agreed to in the appeals process, far inferior. 
   It is the same with some of the patient protections. We have strengthened patient protections upon which we have agreed. Did they offer that? No. They want to go back to the House. It is an insult to the Senate to say: We have a conference, but we are not going to take anything from the conference; we will disregard the Senate; we are just going to take the House position. 
   Any chairman of any committee should think about that: Yes, you are working on a conference; we will insist we adopt the other body's position, as if it is superior. What about the other body's position? What about the Norwood-Dingell bill? That is bipartisan; people know it has unbelievable unlimited liability. 
   We are criticized because we want to exempt employers. 
   I yield myself an additional 4 minutes. 
   In the Senate bill, we have liability against HMOs, but we protect employers. Senator KENNEDY says that is not good enough; we want to be able to sue employers. 
   As a former employer, if we make employers liable for unlimited punitive damages, class action suits, the whole works, we are going to have a lot of employers saying: I don't have to provide health care; I will drop it. Employees, here is some money; I hope you will buy health insurance. 
   Some employees will and, unfortunately, a lot of employees will not. We will have a dramatic, draconian increase in the uninsured. 
   The Norwood-Dingell bill, by CBO estimates--and I think it is grossly underestimated--increases health care costs, one estimate, by 4.1 percent; another estimate of the Democrat bill is over 6 percent. Health care costs are already going up 10, 12, 14 percent. Add another 4 or 6 percent on top of that. We are talking about a 16-, 18-percent increase in health care costs, and we will have millions more join the ranks of the uninsured. 
   We absolutely, positively should draw the line and say: Let's not do anything that does damage to the good health care system we have. It is not perfect, but we should not be passing legislation that is going to increase the number of uninsured. We should not be passing legislation that is going to dramatically increase the cost and make it unaffordable for a lot of Americans. 
   We passed legislation in this body and the House that makes health care more affordable. We passed tax provisions giving every American, not just those who work for a large corporation, tax benefits, tax deductions. That is positive. That is the reason we called our bill Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. 
   We want to make health care more affordable for all Americans. We want to increase the number of insured Americans. Unfortunately, the Kennedy bill, the Norwood-Dingell bill will do the opposite; it will increase the number of uninsured. We do not want to do that. We want to do the opposite. We want to help people get insurance. 
   The legislation before us has no provision to help finance health care costs for those people who do not have it. We did in our bill. We had it in the House bill that passed the House. 
   I have one other comment. The President said he would veto the bill that passed the House and he would veto the bill that passed the Senate. People say: The President will sign this bill. The President stated he would veto the bill that passed the House, and the President said he would veto the bill that passed the Senate. Unfortunately, a lot of people are more interested in politics and maybe political theater and seeing if they can scare people. Maybe they think that will be to their political advantage. I very much resent that. 
   I want to pass a good, constructive Patients' Bill of Rights bill this session, this year. The sooner the better. Keep out the politics. Let's see if we can pass a bill that has a good external appeals process; a bill that does keep HMOs accountable. Let's protect employers. Let's not do something that will increase the number of uninsured. Let's not do something that will damage the system. I am afraid the process our Democratic colleagues are pulling right now is going to be very disruptive to the conference. 
   I am going to pledge we will pass a bill out of conference this year, and I hope it is one both Houses will pass and the President will sign that will increase patient protections for all Americans and also keeps health care affordable and attainable for millions of Americans. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. For the information of my colleague, Dr. NORWOOD is not on this conference. Dr. NORWOOD may or may not know that we worked very hard to come up with the appeals process to which we basically have agreed. Dr. NORWOOD may or may not know that we agreed basically on a lot of patient protections. He may not know we spent weeks on the appeals process. We negotiated in a bipartisan fashion. 
   I think to refer to somebody outside the conference trashing the conference is a little extraneous. The conferees know that we worked in a bipartisan way to come up with the appeals process. 
   Ask Dr. FRIST. Ask other people who participated in the conference. To have an outsider say, ``Oh, we haven't done much, it is time to pass the House bill,'' I think is disingenuous.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would like to inform my colleague, he is incorrect. He said, if we gave every other employee what the Federal employees have. Federal employees cannot sue their employer. Federal employees don't have a right to appeal. Federal employees, if they appeal, they appeal to the OMB, their employer. Federal employees, including Senators, do not have the right to sue. You cannot sue. To say, if we just give everybody else what we have, is factually incorrect. 
   When my colleague said we have had all these meetings and we only agreed to two things, one of the reasons people say the conference did not go anywhere is that our Democratic colleagues never say yes--even if we give them a yes. We have not quite got around to agreeing. 
   But, frankly, in conference, I might say, we agreed to access to emergency room care, direct access to pediatricians, provider nondiscrimination, direct access to specialists, continued care from a physician. We have agreed almost entirely--maybe not to the last dotting of the ``i'' or crossing of the ``t''--to the appeals process, to an independent physician, which is really the whole crux of the bill, the most important thing. 
   Why did that take so long? Because we negotiated it. We negotiated with the Senator from Massachusetts. We negotiated with Congressman DINGELL. We negotiated with their staffs. We went over every single letter, every single word, every single paragraph. And then people say: Oh, we have not agreed to anything. Maybe that is the reason we don't have a conference--because you won't agree to anything. 
   Who is not agreeable? Who is not moving? It is a little bit frustrating, a little bit disingenuous to say: Oh, nothing is happening. Where did those 400 hours go? I will tell you, there were hundreds of hours--and 400 is conservative--time spent by staff and by Senators trying to come up with a positive agreement. 
   Some people do not want one. I think the very fact that we are here today means people do not want one. They would rather have theater. They would rather have an issue. I was planning on having a bipartisan, bicameral conference this afternoon--on Thursday, as we have done for the last several Thursdays--to work on these very issues. 
   The people say, oh, some people want to have an issue on the floor, as if they think that is going to help the progress. It is not going to help the progress. That is unfortunate. 
   I am going to continue to try to see if we cannot pass a positive, bipartisan, bicameral bill. But, frankly, I do not think the efforts that have been made today are helpful to the process. I think it undermines the process. 
   Again, I tell my colleagues, I cannot think of any other instance where you have had an ongoing conference where people said, oh, let's just adopt the House bill, even though we made significant concessions. We worked and we have negotiated. They say, oh, let's just pull out and adopt the House bill. That is a real slap on the Senate, not just the Republicans in the Senate, but that is a real slap on the entire Senate. 
   It is going to be interesting to see how committee chairmen vote. Two people can play this game. Maybe there will be a conference in the future where it is said: Oh, let's just adopt the House bill. We like it better. I think that undermines the whole nature, frankly, of the legislative process. 
   I again urge my colleagues to vote to table the 
   Kennedy amendment.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank Senators FRIST, GRAMM, HUTCHINSON, ENZI, GREGG, and JEFFORDS for serving on this conference committee, and also Senator COLLINS who worked with us on the task force. I also very much appreciate the work they have done today on the floor. 
   If we don't table the Kennedy amendment, there will be millions of people who will be without health insurance. That is because it will dramatically increase the price of health care. There are results from actions. If we act to open up all health care plans and all employers to unlimited liability with punitive damages and class action lawsuits, we are going to have a lot of people dropping health care plans. 
   Those are just the facts. 
   The GAO says there is going to be a 4, 5, or 6-percent increase on top of the 10 or 12 percent that is already occurring. A lot of people can't afford it. They will drop their health care--plus the fact that the Norwood-Dingell bill, and the Kennedy bill they are trying to pass right now, have unlimited punitive damages. 
   I have letters from Ford, Wal-Mart, from IBM, big companies with some of the best health care plans in America, saying they will cut benefits or reduce the benefits to individuals, maybe even drop coverage, if we pass that bill. We shouldn't do it. We shouldn't do things that will cause harm. We should not pass legislation that will increase costs. We should not pass legislation that will increase the number of uninsured by 2, 3, or 4 million. That will be a serious mistake. 
   We should give the legislative process a chance to work. It is not working by saying we will pass the House bill. 
   I move to table the Kennedy-Daschle amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Montana that I have no objection, as soon as we run it by the two leaders. If they want to postpone the vote for 30 minutes, fine. 
   For the information of our colleagues, we have a vote scheduled at 12 o'clock. I think some people are trying to go to luncheons and different things. For scheduling purposes, it may be postponed until 12:30. That is perfectly fine with this Senator. 
   I want to make my comments on the marriage tax penalty. 
   I compliment my colleagues from Texas and Kansas for their leadership in trying to eliminate the so-called marriage tax penalty. We have a chance to do that. We have to get to the amendment. Some people do not want to get to the amendment. If we get to the amendment, we can have relevant amendments. 
   I understand some people have different ideas of different ways of eliminating the marriage tax penalty. Fine. Let's consider them and vote on them. 
   I think the way the Finance Committee--I happen to be a member of the Finance Committee--reported it out is the preferred way to do it. 
   Very simply put, we have a tax bracket right now that is very complicated. But we have different brackets. We have a zero bracket, a 15-percent bracket, a 28-percent bracket, a 31-percent bracket, and a 39.6-percent bracket. Thanks to President Clinton and Vice President GORE, the rates have gone up. 
   People shouldn't be penalized because one spouse works or two spouses work. They shouldn't be penalized under the system because they are married. 
   Right now you can have one spouse working, say making $40,000 and in the 28-percent bracket. Another spouse is making $20,000 and presumably would be in the 15-percent bracket, but right now under current law that $20,000 by one spouse is taxed at the 28-percent tax bracket. It costs them 
   about $1,400. That is unfair. We eliminate that in our proposal. 
   We double the 15-percent tax bracket. Individuals making up to $26,000 pay 15 percent in tax. We double that. We say if it is 15 percent in taxes at $26,000, let's double that for couples and make that $52,000. That will save them about $1,100. We double the exemption. The exemption right now is $4,400. We say double that. That should be $8,800. We double it. That saves a couple hundred dollars. 
   That is where we get the marriage tax penalty figure of about $1,400 for a couple, if their income combined is $52,000. Let's do that. 
   I have heard President Clinton say he wants to get rid of it. But his proposal doesn't get rid of it. It may be good rhetorically. It may be good on the campaign stump. But there is no substance. 
   The President does not eliminate the marriage tax penalty. As a matter of fact, the President doesn't cut taxes. He doesn't want tax cuts. I respect that. 
   He has a tax increase for this year. President Clinton's budget proposal increases taxes by a net of $9 billion in the year 2001. Over 5 years, the President has a proposal for a net tax cut of a measly $5 billion. Keep in mind that the Federal Government is going to be taking in about $10 trillion over that same 5 years. But he would only allow for such a small percentage that it won't even show up. 
   We are trying to give tax cuts to taxpayers who are married and penalized under the system. We do that basically by doubling the 15-percent bracket and eventually doubling the 28-percent bracket. One working spouse that makes a lot less is not thrown into a higher bracket. 
   We also don't penalize the stay-at-home spouse. We basically double the individual brackets. We do that right away so we don't discriminate against somebody if they make a sacrifice and say they want to stay home with the kids. If this is a tax bracket for individuals, we say double it for couples. 
   It is the fairest system you can come up with, and it is tax relief for American couples. It is significantly greater than that proposed by the President. 
   But I hope this Congress will pass it in a bipartisan fashion as we did by eliminating the Social Security earnings penalty. We passed that earlier by an overwhelming margin. The President signed it. Some of us had been pushing that for years. 
   Some of us for years have been pushing to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. We have a chance to do that. We need to have our colleagues vote in favor of the cloture motion at 12 noon or at 12:30 in order to make that happen. I urge my colleagues to do it. 
   If colleagues have alternative ways of dealing with the marriage tax penalty they wish to have considered, I think we are happy to vote on those. 
   I thank my colleague from Kansas for yielding me time, and I thank my colleague from Texas, Senator HUTCHISON, for her leadership. 
   I hope today within the hour we will make giant strides and ultimately pass it before we leave this Congress. I hope in the next day or two we pass a bill that would eliminate the earnings marriage tax penalty on married couples. 
   I thank my colleague for yielding me 5 minutes.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am going to speak on the underlying bill. Shortly, I think the majority leader will be in to make a motion on the bill. 
   First, I wish to compliment Senator ROTH, in his leadership, and the Finance Committee, for reporting out a good bill. It is my hope we will be able to pass this bill in the next couple of days to provide relief from the so-called marriage tax penalty. Married couples need relief. We need to pass it. 
   I have heard the President say he is for it, although he has not come to the forefront. I think Senator ROTH, chairman of the Finance Committee, has come up with a good proposal. I am going to talk a little about that. But I also compliment my colleague, Senator HUTCHISON, who has been fighting for this for the last several years. 
   I believe this year we have a chance to make this law. I hope we will have bipartisan cooperation to make it happen. I compliment the House for their leadership in moving forward to make it happen. 
   The President recently invited many of us down to the White House for the signing of the bill to eliminate the so-called Social Security earnings penalty tax. If you were a working senior between the ages of 65 and 70, and you had an income above $17,000, for every $3 that you earned, you would lose $1 of Social Security. We eliminated that penalty. The President signed it. I am sure he was taking credit for it. I did not make the signing ceremony. He invited me. That was nice. 
   But we acted together. We eliminated an unfair provision in the Tax Code that for years many of us thought was unfair. We eliminated that. That is now the law of the land. 
   Now we are looking at another provision, the so-called marriage tax penalty. It needs to be eliminated. It needs to be eliminated now, this year, not 20 years from now, and not in some token way that is only verbal, as the President has proposed. 
   I believe my colleague, Senator ROTH, and many of us on the Finance Committee, have taken the right step to eliminate this unfair tax. 
   What we have done is, we have said we should double the 15-percent tax bracket for couples. It should be twice as much for couples as it is for an individual. 
   Many people say: What do you mean by that? Individuals who have a taxable income of up to $26,000, they pay 15 percent. Above that taxable income, they pay 28 percent. What we are saying is, if it is 15 percent for $26,000 earned by an individual, it should be twice that amount for a couple. So a couple could have income of up to $52,500, and that would be taxed at 15 percent. 
   What is current law? Current law is, for a couple, the first $43,850 is taxed at 15 percent, and above that amount it is taxed at 28 percent. So there is $8,650 which is actually taxed at 28 percent. What is the difference? That is a difference of $1,125. 
   If you have a couple making $52,500, the bill we have before us would offer them relief of $1,125. That is just on the rate change. 
   We also double the standard deduction. Basically, the standard deduction is $7,350. That would increase to $8,800. That is a savings of $218 for a couple in the 15-percent tax bracket. 
   So again, we are offering tax relief by simplifying the code, saying let's double the 15-percent bracket for couples, as compared to individuals. And let's double the 28-percent bracket so we provide that relief through the code. 
   I think it is important. I think it is fair. I think it provides relief for married couples, and it also does not penalize someone if they happen to be a stay-at-home spouse. We do not discriminate against them either. Maybe it is a farmer who has a spouse who does not receive earned income in the form of a check but yet they still work. They work on the farm. They work on the ranch. They work raising kids. We provide them a modest amount of tax relief as well. 
   I think the bill we have before us is a good bill. It is one that provides tax relief for middle-income Americans. 
   It is one that eliminates the marriage penalty for all practical purposes so we don't find discrimination in the code. 
   I will give a different example. You have a married couple with two differing incomes, where one income is $40,000, maybe one is taxed or has income of $20,000. Let's say the $20,000 is earned by an occasional worker who might work one year but might not work the next year. The practical impact is that $20,000 is added to the $40,000 income, and they are taxed at a higher bracket, the 28 percent, instead of 15 percent.  
   For that additional work they do under the present code, they are penalized by paying at their spouse's highest tax bracket. That is current law. We want to change that. The bill we have before us does change that. 
   I compliment Senator ROTH. I urge my colleagues not to play games. Let's make this law. Let's have a signing ceremony at the White House in another couple of weeks. Let's have Democrats and Republicans and even the White House take credit for it. It is a positive change. It is a good change. It is a needed change. It is a change that should become law this year. It is an accomplishment on which all of us can congratulate ourselves and say we got something done: We eliminated the Social Security earnings penalty, and we eliminated the unfair marriage penalty. 
   Married couples should not be penalized to the tune of $1,400 a year for the fact they are married. That is a fact; that is what is happening under the present law. We should eliminate that. We do that with the bill that is before us today. I urge my colleagues to support it when we come to that time. I hope we will pass it by tomorrow. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we voted on this amendment in November. It didn't pass. What we did pass on November 9 was the Domenici amendment. It passed 54-44. It was an amendment that would increase the minimum wage not over 13 months, as proposed by Senator KENNEDY, but over 28 months. In addition, we provided for some small business tax relief, those businesses that would be negatively impacted by a big increase in the minimum wage. We did that. That passed. 
   I will be sending a second-degree amendment to the desk that would reiterate our support for that. I hope our colleagues will join us in a request to move that amendment, which was attached to bankruptcy, to the House-passed minimum wage so we can go to conference and pass a minimum wage package with tax relief.

   Mr. NICKLES. This is the same amendment we passed in November. This is an amendment that says we should have 100 percent deductibility for self-employed individuals. Right now they only get 60 percent. This is an amendment that says we should give an above-the-line deduction for individuals so they can deduct health care costs. This is not a big tax cut. This is a tax cut targeted towards small business and people who would have a hard time paying the minimum wage. It also  says we should stretch out the minimum wage, instead of doing it over 13 months as proposed by Senator KENNEDY. The language we passed will do it over the next 24 months or 28 months.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, my colleague was incorrect on his figures. The net cost of our tax cut was $25 billion over the next 5 years. The budget resolution before us says $150 billion over 5 years. It is clearly within the budget. It is affordable. It is targeted. I don't know where he got the $100 billion. Maybe that is over 10 years. Over 5 years, the net tax cut targeted toward small business is $25 billion. I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.

   What the Senator's amendment says is increase minimum wage 20 percent in 13 months with no tax relief. 
   We just passed an amendment that said we should pass minimum wage with tax relief. That is the right position. I urge my colleagues not to vote on this big minimum wage increase with no tax relief for small business.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I want, one, to compliment my colleague from Alaska for his statement on this amendment. 
   I would like to make a couple comments in general about our energy policies. There has been somewhat of an oil shortage, so there has been an increase in gasoline prices. A lot of Americans, a lot of our constituents, have said: Well, what are you going to do about it? 
   Gasoline prices are going up. OPEC is strengthening their hand. The administration has sent Secretary Richardson to go over and beg OPEC countries to please increase their production. 
   Some of us on this side have complained about the administration not having an energy policy. I have tried to correct them. I think the administration has an energy policy. I have looked at and reviewed the Clinton-Gore administration's energy policy for the last 7 years. It is fairly consistent. 
   In 1993, they came up with a Btu tax. They were going to have a tax surcharge on Btu's. In 1993 the Democrats controlled both the House and the Senate, but that did not pass anyway. We defeated it. 
   They did pass a gasoline tax increase. As a matter of fact, Vice President GORE broke the tie. They increased gasoline taxes. You might think that was for roads and highways and infrastructure. No. It was for general revenues. So they could spend more money and it passed by one vote, the Vice President's vote. In addition, the administration has done nothing to increase domestic oil production. So our reliance on imports has grown significantly. It has grown very dramatically. 
   They did sign the Kyoto accord. Though it is truly a treaty, they will not call it a treaty and they have not sent it to the Senate for ratification. One of the reasons is, in the Senate we had a vote of 95-5 that said we would not ratify a treaty that was particularly punitive to this country and did not apply to many countries, ``little'' countries like China, Mexico, and India. It is a very poorly thought out agreement that Vice President GORE is very proud of and that this administration wants us to comply with, but they will not send it to us for ratification. It  is the equivalent of increasing costs on all fuels, particularly oil-related fuels. 
   The administration, likewise, has had the policy of restricting access to public lands as far as drilling. They want to expand the moratorium on offshore drilling. That is the administration's position. 
   Vice President GORE, in a political speech in New Hampshire, said he wanted to ban offshore drilling. I guess that sells well in New Hampshire. But that would mean our reliance on imported oil would grow even more. 
   They have a policy, but their policy has been a disaster. As a result of that policy we are much more dependent on foreign sources. 
   What has happened? I mentioned the administration and the Secretary running around begging OPEC countries to produce more oil. 
   Frankly, one of the biggest increases in oil production of any country worldwide is Iraq. What has the administration done with Iraqi oil? We have had an embargo on Iraqi oil production since the war in 1991 where we lost about 147 American lives, where we spent billions of dollars, where we had 550,000 troops in Iraq. We fought a war to get Iraq out of Kuwait, to stop their aggression, and their efforts to take over not only Kuwait but probably to expand throughout the Persian Gulf region. We stopped that. 
   We also wanted to stop their aggression in building weapons of 
   mass destruction. So we set up a compliance regime that said: We are going to have onsite inspectors to make sure Iraqis were not building nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, or biological weapons. We are going to enforce that. Those inspectors are going to make sure they are not building those weapons so they could not continue to threaten their neighbors. 
   Saddam Hussein threatened to burn Israel with the use of chemical and biological weapons. 
   We had arms control inspectors, and said: We are going to keep the strangle hold on their exports, including oil, unless they allow an arms control regime. We had arms control inspectors for years in Iraq. 
   What has this administration done? Year after year, the administration allowed the Iraqis to produce more with less access for inspectors. 
   Today, Iraq can produce all the oil it wants, thanks to support from the Clinton-Gore administration. And there are no arms control inspectors--none, zero--in Iraq today. None. 
   We have not had an arms control inspector in Iraq for over a year. Keep in mind that we have bombed them. This administration has bombed Iraq time and time again. Yet, we have no arms control inspectors there. 
   The real leverage, aside from bombing, was the fuel export valves. The administration just said: Open up. As a matter of fact, they just supported a resolution that said: We want to assist them in making their production facilities grow even more. So now they are producing 700,000 barrels of oil and we are going to help them produce a lot more, but we still do not have one arms control inspector in Iraq. 
   I think the administration's policy dealing with energy, dealing with Iraq, has been a disaster. 
   What can we do? One of the things the administration is supposed to be doing is opening up ANWR. 
   I saw this beautiful picture shown by my colleague from California of this pristine area of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. I do not doubt that it is absolutely gorgeous. I have been there where they are going to drill, hopefully, eventually, in the ANWR area, and it is not that picture, unless it has changed dramatically--and I do not see how it could in the area I saw. Don't get me wrong, I think Alaska is one of the most beautiful States anywhere in the country. It is one of the most beautiful places anywhere in the world. It is beautiful, gorgeous. But Alaska is a great, big State. 
   ANWR covers a lot of land. ANWR, is approximately 19 million acres, about the size of South Carolina, a little less than about half the size of my State of Oklahoma. That is ANWR, the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. That is a big area: 19 million acres. That is a lot of land. That is a big refuge. I am sure it has some beautiful areas in it. 
   Where they are proposing to drill comprises about 2,000 acres; and that area is not at all like the picture just shown. While most of Alaska is gorgeous, this area is not the most prestine. 
   Drilling can be accommodated there without hurting the environment. There are people who say: Wait a minute. Drilling in Prudoe Bay, that has been disastrous for the environment. Drilling in Endicott Field, which is not too far away from there, has been disastrous for the environment. 
   I disagree. That is not the case. 
   They say: Drilling in that area would be bad for the caribou. That is not factually borne out. The caribou around the Alaska oil pipeline has been a very big plus. The only place we really have not seen a lot of caribou is in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge; they are all over by the Alaska oil pipeline. There are a lot of caribou. 
   I am all for the caribou. I am strongly in favor of wildlife development. We have more visitors in the Oklahoma Wildlife Refuge 
   than any other wildlife refuge in the country. We are proud of it. It is a beautiful area and a treasure in our state. I want to encourage that. I want to encourage it in Alaska. But you can do this in a sound, environmental way, and also reduce our dependence on foreign oil sources. We can do this and increase production domestically so we will not be so dependent, so our Energy Secretary will not have to have to hold a tin cup saying: Please give us more. 
   We can do so much more. We can do so much better. We can do it in an environmentally sensitive manner. We can do it in a way that is compatible with the caribou, compatible with wildlife, compatible with all the beautiful scenery that we have in Alaska, and not do any damage whatsoever to the environment. 
   We can have a more sensible, sane energy policy where we are not just spending billions and billions of dollars overseas. Our dependence on foreign sources has grown so dramatically that we are a lot more vulnerable than anyone realizes. 
   We had shortages in 1973 and 1979. We were importing something like 36 percent in 1973. Today we are importing 56 percent. That number is growing every year. We will be at two-thirds probably in another 10 or 15 years. 
   We had shortages in 1973 when we imported 36 percent. Today we are importing 56 percent. 
   In 1979, we had a shortage, and the shortage was significant. That meant we had brownouts. That meant factories had to close. That meant there were gas lines galore. People were lined up. Their biggest problem was getting through gas lines in their cars so they could get to work, if their factories were opened because there was an energy shortage. 
   We do not want to replay that. We do not want to become that dependent. Yet we are marching on a dependency line that is unbelievable. We can do things to prevent it. 
   One of things we could do is supplement Alaska production, which has been declining dramatically. I am sure every person who has been speaking about how bad it would be to drill in ANWR would also be opposed to Prudhoe Bay. 
   Prudhoe Bay was at one time producing 2 million barrels of oil at its peak. Today, it is declining. Now it is down to about 1.2 million barrels of oil a day and continues to decline. We need to supplement that or else we will have an even greater dependency. As Alaska pipeline Prudhoe Bay production continues to decline, our dependency will only rise. 
   We can open up ANWR to help prevent this. I urge my colleagues to think about the future. It is going to take years to get this on line, to alleviate some of the shortages and curtailments and dependency we will have 5 years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now. If we stay on this present course, we will be importing 60 percent or 70 percent of our oil needs and be very dependent, frankly, in some cases on unreliable, unstable sources such as Iraq, such as Iran, some of the other Middle East countries that may get mad at us for whatever reason. 
   Again, I compliment my colleague from Alaska. I urge our colleagues to vote no on the underlying amendment, the ROTH amendment, tomorrow. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, sadly this week the Senate has lost another member of our family. On Monday, Larry Harrison, a retired Senate staffer, passed away in Washington, DC. Before his retirement in June of 1997, Larry had over 36 years of Federal service. 
   Most of my colleagues will remember Larry's hard work as a Chamber attendant. His dedication to the upkeep of the Chamber and the surrounding rooms will be remembered. On Tuesday evening, former Senator Bob Dole fondly remembered Larry during the Leader's Lecture Series. 
   Like many of the support staff who work for this institution, Larry arrived at work long before the Senate convened and frequently left the Chamber long after adjournment. 
   Many Senators will recall Larry's passion for golf. I certainly do. As a matter of fact, Larry was one of the founders of the ``Cloakroom Open.'' This golf tournament was organized by Larry to enable many of the Senate staff who work around the Senate Chamber an opportunity to play a round of golf together. It was a chance for a little camaraderie without the discussion of party or politics.  
   Many may know that Larry's step son, Mike Henry, also works for the Senate and has worked for the Senate for a long time. I have had the pleasure of knowing Mike. I think highly of Mike and his family. Mike's wife, Cookie, also works for the House of Representatives. This is a family who has dedicated decades of service to the Congress and to the Senate. 
   I join with all of my colleagues in expressing sympathy to Larry's family and our hearts and prayers go out to them at this time. I know all Members will join me in saying, ``Thank you, Larry, for your service, and keep hitting 'em straight.''

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues, Senator ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN because they work so well together. 
   Today, we are going to pass something that will have a positive impact on millions of Americans. I say millions--some people say there are only 800,000 people who are currently paying the Social Security earnings penalty. There are millions of people who want to work, maybe have to work, but basically their taxes are so punitive that they cannot work; it does not make sense to work. Their taxes are so high they have to work more for government than they work for themselves. 
   These are senior citizens, not particularly wealthy people. You can be a senior citizen and have, as an individual, an earned income of $30,000. You are in the 28-percent tax bracket. Because of the earnings penalty on Social Security, that is an additional 33-percent tax bracket. Add those two together and you are at 61 percent. You have to pay Social Security tax. If you are self-employed, you add 15 percent to that. That is 76 percent, and you have not even paid taxes to the State. 
   For most States, that is 6 or 7 percent. 
   You can have a marginal tax rate of 80 percent; you work four times more for the Government than you do for yourself. That is way too high. This 33-percent penalty for seniors between the ages of 65 and 70 who want to have earned income--maybe need to have earned income--is long past overdue for repeal. 
   I am delighted that today we are going to fulfill what the House has done. I compliment Chairman ARCHER in the House. I compliment Chairman ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN. I remember Senator MCCAIN speaking on this issue for years. I remember Senator ASHCROFT making tireless speeches, saying we need to repeal the earnings penalty. 
   Over the years, we have raised the amount people can save before the penalty takes effect, but the penalty still takes effect for any income above $17,000. The real solution is to repeal it. That is what we are going to do today. We are going to open up economic opportunity for millions of Americans who are at age 65 and maybe do not want to retire. They might be a STROM THURMOND; they who may have another 50 years of very energetic hard work ahead of them and they don't want to say they want to retire. We should not force them to retire. 
   The earnings penalty forces many of these people to retire--some of our most productive citizens in America. I think it is wrong. This tax penalty is wrong. We are going to repeal it today. We are repealing it with bipartisan support. It is going to become the law of the land. 
   Again, I compliment our leader for proving we can get some good things done that will have a positive impact on millions--frankly, on all of us, because a lot of us want to work beyond the age of 65. Now we are telling seniors they can do so. 
   Again, my congratulations to the leaders for making this happen. I think this will make Social Security policy better and, frankly, it will make economic policy better for all Americans. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and urge my colleagues to vote yes on this bill.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments regarding the nomination of T. Michael Kerr to be Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor. I held up this nomination until I could secure an agreement regarding the issue of unauthorized break time from the Secretary of Labor, outlined in a letter I will submit for the RECORD. 
   The need for this agreement with the Secretary was precipitated by a case pending before the Wage and Hour Division regarding an employee exceeding the allotted time for a rest/period break, and an employer deducting from the employee's compensation the time taken in excess of the break time. 
   The Fair Labor Standards Act does not require employers to provide its employees with a rest period/breaks. Nevertheless, many employers offer short breaks to their employees. Although the duration of a voluntary break is up to the employer, the breaks generally run between 5 and 20 minutes. 
   The Department of Labor does recognize that employers have the flexibility to determine the number of breaks and the length of breaks that they offer to their employees. The Department of Labor has taken the position that when an employer allows its employees to take a short break and an employee abuses the break time policy by exceeding the time that the employer allotted for the break, the employer must still compensate the employee for the first 20 minutes of the break. 
   Further, the Department of Labor has taken the position that if an employer offers its employees a compensable break of less than 20 minutes in duration, and an employee's break time exceeds the time that the employer allotted for the break, then the employer's only recourse against the employee is disciplinary action (such as a reprimand or termination), or elimination of the rest period. 
   Under the agreement I reached with the Secretary, the Department of Labor will conduct a complete review of its policy regarding unauthorized breaks. That review will be completed by February 1, 2000. Upon completion of the review, the Department of Labor will submit its findings in writing to the Chairman and Ranking Members of the relevant committees in the House and the Senate. The review will include consideration of what outcome is in the best interest of the employee if the employee exceeds the allotted time of a rest period/break: disciplinary action against the employee (such as a reprimand or termination); elimination of the rest period/break option; or deductions of compensation for the time in excess of the allotted break time. 
   Also, the Secretary committed the Department of Labor will assure that the resolution of any cases in which unauthorized break times are at issue, will be consistent with the findings in their review. 
   This is an important review of what is clearly an outdated policy. I look forward to the outcome of their review, and I thank the staff at the Department of Labor for working in good faith with my office, and the Secretary for working to a quick resolution of this issue so this nomination can move forward.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, on June 23, 1999, Senator LIEBERMAN and I introduced S. 1272, the Pain Relief Promotion Act, which addresses two specific concerns. First, it provides federal support for training and research in palliative care. Second, it clarifies federal law on the legitimate use of controlled substances. On October 27, 1999 the House passed its companion measure H.R. 2260 by the resounding bipartisan vote of 271 to 156. It is my hope that the Senate will soon have the opportunity to debate and vote on this important legislation. 
   In anticipation of that debate, and in light of inaccurate characterizations of the second aspect of our bipartisan legislation, I believe it is important for me to ensure that the Record reflects precisely how this bill will--and will not--affect current federal law with regard to Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) oversight of the use of federally controlled substances. 
   To understand the effect the Pain Relief Promotion Act will have on pain control, we must begin with what the law is now. The Controlled Substances Act, CSA, of 1970 charged the DEA with the responsibility of overseeing narcotics and dangerous drugs--including powerful prescription drugs which have a legitimate medical use but can also be misused to harm or kill. In asserting its authority over these drugs, Congress declared in the preamble of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 that ``Federal control of the intrastate incidents of the traffic in controlled substances is essential to the effective control of the interstate incidents of such traffic'' (21 U.S.C. 801 (6)). 
   In 1984, Congress amended the CSA due in part to a specific concern regarding the misuse of prescription drugs in lethal overdoses. The then Democratic-controlled House and a Republican Senate further strengthened the Act, empowering the DEA to revoke a physician's federal prescribing  license if he or she uses it to endanger ``health and safety'' regardless of whether state law has been violated (21 U.S.C. 824, referencing 21 U.S.C. 823). The chairman of the Health subcommittee in the House agreed: ``Drugs legally manufactured for use in medicine are responsible for a substantial majority of drug-related deaths and injuries'' (Rep. WAXMAN, Hearing of July 31, 1984, Hearing Record No. 98-168, p. 365). Congress' view was that while the states are the first line of defense against misuse of prescription drugs, the Federal Government must have its own objective standard as to what constitutes such misuse--and it must have the authority to enforce that standard when a state cannot or will not do so. Congress' 1970 and 1984 decisions have been upheld time and time again by federal courts. 
   It is clear that federal law is intended to prevent use of these drugs for lethal overdoses, and contains no exception for deliberate overdoses approved by a physician. Nowhere in the Controlled Substances Act has death or assisting death ever been considered a ``legitimate medical purpose'' for use of these drugs. In the past, physicians who were involved in the use of these drugs for suicide or other lethal overdoses have lost their federal authority to prescribe controlled substances on the grounds that they had endangered ``health and safety.'' 
   In 1997, Congress passed the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997 without a dissenting vote in the Senate and by an overwhelming margin of 398-16 in the House. President Clinton stated in signing the bill that ``it will allow the Federal Government to speak with a clear voice in opposing these practices.'' He further warned that ``to endorse assisted suicide would set us on a disturbing and perhaps dangerous path.'' I would add only that authorizing a federal agency to endorse the use of controlled substances for assisted suicide would similarly ``set us on a disturbing and perhaps dangerous path.'' 
   In November 1994, the State of Oregon adopted by referendum the so-called ``Death with Dignity Act,'' allowing physicians to prescribe medication for the purpose of assisting patients' suicides. The week of that vote, Professor George Annas of Boston University pointed out the inconsistency between the Oregon referendum and the Controlled Substances Act in an article in the New England Journal of Medicine. He questioned whether such a state law was compatible with existing federal laws governing federally controlled drugs, ``since the drafters of the federal statute certainly did not have this purpose [assisting suicides] in mind.'' 
   However, on June 5, 1998, overturning a previous determination by her own DEA Administrator, the Attorney General issued a letter carving out an exception for Oregon so it can use federally-controlled substances for assisted 
   suicide. She claimed that Congress did not ``intend to override a state determination as to what constitutes legitimate medical practice in the absence of a federal law prohibiting that practice.'' The Pain Relief Promotion Act will respond to the Attorney General's challenge, by clarifying that the intentional misuse of these drugs to cause patients' deaths is not authorized by Congress in any state, nor has it ever been. 
   On October 27, 1997, Oregon's ``Death with Dignity Act'' became effective. In the first year at least 15 patients have committed suicide with doctor's assistance under the new Oregon law. We really do not know the total number, because all reporting of cases is left completely in the hands of the doctors themselves, and the Oregon Health Division admits it has no idea how many unreported cases there are. But regarding those 15 reported cases we know one thing: Every one of those patient's deaths was caused by a federally controlled substance, prescribed with a federal DEA registration number, using federal authority. Today, without any decision to this effect by Congress or the President, the federal government is actively involved in assisting suicides in Oregon. 
   To hear some of the critics of this bill you might think that the Pain Relief Promotion Act creates a new authority on the part of the DEA to revoke doctors' registrations if they use controlled substances to assist suicide. On the contrary that authority has existed for 29 years and it exists now. Attorney General Janet Reno was very clear on this matter in her letter of June 5, 1998: ``Adverse action under the CSA may well be warranted ..... where a physician assists in a suicide in a state that has not authorized the practice under any conditions, or where a physician fails to comply with state procedures in doing so.'' 
   What does this mean for current law and practice? First, the DEA has full authority to revoke a DEA registration for assisting suicide in any of the 49 states where assisting suicide is not authorized by state law. While critics of the Pain Relief Promotion Act have said that empowering the DEA to investigate physicians in such cases will have a ``chilling effect'' on the treatment of pain, the fact is that such authority already exists in 49 states. 
   What about the one State, Oregon, where the Attorney General said the DEA will not take adverse actions against physicians for assisting suicide in compliance with the Oregon law? Even in Oregon many cases of assisting suicide remain illegal under state law. The state law authorizes assisting the suicide of those who are terminally ill, but not others. Under the Attorney General's determination, then, the DEA can continue to review cases of assisting suicide to make sure they do not involve those who are not terminally ill, and it can scrutinize whether a given use of pain medication was really intended to assist suicide. All aspects of the Oregon guidelines for legally valid assisted suicide are also subject to DEA investigation, since the Attorney General has only authorized physicians to use federally controlled drugs for assisted suicides when they fully comply with those state guidelines. 
   Thus, as interpreted by the Attorney General, a registration to prescribe federally controlled substances can be revoked under the current Controlled Substances Act if these substances are used to assist suicide in any state in the Nation, with the exception of certain cases of assisted suicide that Oregon has legalized for the terminally ill. If DEA scrutiny of doctors' prescribing practices were going to ``chill'' the practice of pain control, that would already be occurring under current law. 
   How does the Pain Relief Promotion Act impact this situation? It establishes that, for the first time in federal law, the use of controlled substances for the relief of pain and discomfort is a ``legitimate medical purpose,'' even if the large doses used in treating pain may unintentionally hasten death. Intentionally causing death or assisting in causing death remains forbidden. Thus this bill does not increase the DEA's regulatory authority at all. On the contrary, its only effect in 49 states (and even in Oregon, in cases involving those who are not terminally ill) is to provide new legal protection for physicians who prescribe controlled substances to control pain. 
   In Oregon, this bill eliminates the Attorney General's artificial exception designed to accommodate assisted suicides that are no longer penalized under Oregon law. The DEA can meet its responsibility here simply by looking at the reports required by Oregon law, in which doctors must identify the drugs used to assist suicide. Those records will make it clear whether federally controlled drugs were used; and since the physician is clearly reporting that his or her own intent was to help cause death, there will be no question of murky intentions or ambiguity. Thus this bill will not lead to any increase in the DEA trying to ``second guess'' or infer physicians' intentions, even in Oregon.*****-*****- -Name: -Payroll No. -Folios: J1S/13-J1S/14 -Date: -Subformat: 
   What of any unreported cases in which physicians assist the suicides of terminally ill patients? Those assisted suicides are already a crime under Oregon law, and thus already subject to adverse action by the DEA as well under the Attorney General's interpretation. Only if a physician officially reports the case to the Oregon Health Division is he or she exempted from state criminal penalties. So those cases are already covered by the same DEA authority that currently applies to assisted suicides in the other 49 states. 
   Let me take this situation step by step. 
   First, removing the Oregon exception to the existing nationwide policy cannot increase any ``chilling effect'' on  pain relief outside of Oregon, because the bill does not increase one iota the authority of the DEA to investigate the misuse of controlled substances to assist suicide outside of Oregon. In fact, in those states its only effect is to provide a more explicit ``safe harbor'' for the practice of pain control, which is a significant advance and improvement for doctors and terminally ill patients. This is also true of assisted suicide cases within Oregon that do not comply with the state's reporting requirements or other guidelines. In all these cases, the Pain Relief Promotion Act gives the DEA no new mandate to investigate cases of assisted suicide more directly. Rather, it is expected to follow its longstanding practice of generally deferring to state authorities and allowing them to take the lead in investigating possible wrongdoing. 
   Second, no new questioning of physicians' intentions is warranted to address the cases of assisted suicide that are now permitted under Oregon law. To be free of criminal penalties under state law in Oregon, a doctor who assists a suicide must submit a report to Oregon authorities that includes information on the drugs prescribed to assist the suicide. The Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, can obtain those reports from the Oregon authorities. It already has the authority to subpoena them, if necessary; again, our legislation has no impact on this. 
   Thus, even in Oregon, this bill will not result in any increase in DEA oversight or investigations of doctors based on their prescribing patterns or the dosages they use for particular patients. This is clearly stated in the House Judiciary Committee report on this bill, H. Rep. 106-378 Pt. 1, pp. 12-13. 
   It follows that if this bill is enacted, any doctors in Oregon who prescribe controlled substances for pain relief need not fear any increase in DEA scrutiny of their practices, and therefore should not in any way be deterred from prescribing adequate pain relief. 
   This bill cannot have a ``chilling effect'' on pain control, but will have the opposite effect. For the first time, it will place in the Controlled Substances Act, as the American Society of Anesthesiologists notes, ``recognition that alleviating pain in the usual course of professional practice is a legitimate medical purpose for dispensing a controlled substance that is consistent with public health and safety, even if the use of such a substance may increase the risk of death.'' The American Medical Association says this bill, ``provides a new and important statutory protection for physicians prescribing controlled substances for pain, particularly for patients at the end of life.'' As the American Academy of Pain Management observes, this will protect the ability of ``prescribers to relieve pain without fear of regulatory discipline.'' 
   Those who are concerned about the possibility of a negative impact on pain relief if we pass this bill need to answer this question: do they believe that now the Drug Enforcement Administration is having a chilling effect on pain relief because federally controlled substances cannot be used to assist suicide in 49 states and even, in many cases, in Oregon? 
   If the answer is ``no,'' then there is no basis to be concerned about this bill--for this bill will not increase investigations or oversight into the dosages of drugs used for pain relief, and in fact instructs the DEA to be even more sensitive to physicians' need to prescribe large doses of these drugs for pain control. 
   If the answer is ``yes,'' then there is a great need for this bill--because for the first time it adds specific protections for doctors who prescribe controlled substances for pain control--resulting in a decrease in any ``chilling effect'' that may exist under current law. 
   Let me quote from the American Medical Association:  
   The bill would not expand existing criminal penalties in the CSA for persons whose unauthorized use of a controlled substance leads to someone's death........The bill would not expand the DEA's authority concerning jurisdiction, investigations or enforcement regarding the CSA. In fact, the inclusion of a recognition of the ``double effect'' in the CSA provides physicians in all jurisdictions an additional statutory protection in cases of alleged [physician-assisted suicide]. The bill has the potential, through its educational provisions, of sensitizing law enforcement personnel to the multiple issues of end-of-life care and prescribing.  
   It is noteworthy that although the Justice Department expressed concern about the portion of the bill that would prevent the use of federally controlled substances to assist suicide in Oregon, it agrees that the bill would aid, and not hinder, pain relief. In a letter dated October 19,1999, the Justice Department wrote that the bill ``would eliminate any ambiguity about the legality of using controlled substances to alleviate the pain and suffering of the terminally ill by reducing any perceived threat of administrative and criminal sanctions in this context. The Department accordingly supports those portions of [the bill] addressing palliative care.'' 
   This bill makes it easier, not harder, to use controlled substances to relieve pain. That is why so many major medical organizations, including the National Hospice Organization, the American Academy of Pain Management and the American Society of Anesthesiologists, as well as the AMA, strongly support its enactment. 
   Some may wish to abolish the Controlled Substances Act altogether. They may think that the federal government's longstanding insistence on monitoring the distribution of these powerful drugs is an unwarranted intrusion into medical practice. I disagree with that stand, but at least it can be understood as a consistent position. What is untenable is the claim that this particular bill, which clearly improves the law's sensitivity to medical judgments on pain control, somehow mysteriously worsens that situation. Once we understand what the current law is and what this bill does, that claim simply does not make sense. 
   In short, the Pain Relief Promotion Act will foster pain control. It will improve existing law by adding significant new legal protections for physicians and pharmacists who prescribe and dispense controlled substances for pain control. It will reduce, and in no way increase, any possible ``chilling effect" that could deter adequate pain control. And by clarifying federal law so the federal government will not facilitate the medical institutionalization of assisted suicide in any state, this legislation may help discourage doctors from simply suggesting assisted suicide instead of working to address their patients' real problems of uncontrolled pain. As protectors of public health and safety we should be encouraging doctors to kill the pain, not the patient.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I commend my colleague from New Mexico for the work that he has done in providing a more realistic substitute. But the first vote we are going to have today is voting on a motion to table the Kennedy amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Kennedy amendment for a lot of different reasons, one of which is that it dramatically increases the minimum wage--about 20 percent over the next 13 1/2 months. That is a big hit for a lot of small businesses. I am afraid it will prevent a lot of people, low-income people, who want to get their first jobs--they may not be able to get them. Estimates by some of the economists, CBO, and others, are that it could be 100,000 people; it could be 500,000 people that lose their jobs. It is a big hit. 
   There are a lot of other reasons to oppose the Kennedy amendment. How many of our colleagues know it has a $29 billion tax increase, that it extends Superfund taxes? We do not reauthorize the Superfund Program, but we extend the taxes. Many of us agree we need to extend the taxes when we reauthorize the program, but not before and that is in there anyway. 
   There is a tax increase on business. I received a letter from all the business groups opposing it. It is practically an IRS entitlement program, so they can go after anything they want. 
   It deals with ``Noneconomic attributes,'' whatever that means, it is a $10 billion tax increase. It may sound good and some people say that it is just to close loopholes. But it is to give IRS carte blanche to go after anything and everything they want. We reformed IRS and curbed their appetite somewhat, and regardless of those efforts this would be saying: Hey, IRS, go after anybody and everybody. 
   There is also a provision in the Democrat proposal that hits hospice organizations right between the eyes. 
   I have put letters from outside organizations addressing this very issue on Members' desks so they may see it for themselves. I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD three letters from various hospice organizations.

   Mr. NICKLES. From the Hospice Association of America:  
   ........I am requesting your support to reject a proposed amendment to S. 1625 that would apply civil monetary penalties for false certification of eligibility for hospice care.  
   I have a letter from the Federation of American Health Systems urging opposition to the Kennedy amendment. I have a letter from the National Association for Home Care, also in opposition. It says:  
   We would encourage the Senate to oppose this provision, generally, and in particular, because it is contained in a nongermane legislative effort to increase the minimum wage. 
   The foreseeable result of the proposed amendment would be to further discourage physicians from utilizing hospice services for terminally ill patients.  
   Do we want to do that? I don't think so. Certainly we shouldn't do it in this legislation. Let's have hearings to find out more about this. Let's do it in Medicare reform. Let's do it when we have a chance to know exactly what we are doing because this is strongly opposed by hospice organizations. 
   I encourage my colleagues to oppose it for all the above reasons. I urge them to vote yes to table the Kennedy amendment. We will move to table it at the appropriate time.

   Mr. NICKLES. Note that the Senate Finance Committee approved most of the provisions outlined by Senator STEVENS and later all of the provisions in his proposal were included in the Senate version of the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 that passed the Senate on July 30th. The problems for working people in multiemployer plans associated with section 415 concern me and I understand the Budget Chairman will join me in working to secure the provisions described by Senator STEVENS.

   Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, as I understand the parliamentary situation, we have 2 hours equally divided: One on the Kennedy amendment, and the other 2 hours on an amendment that will be offered by Senator DOMENICI. 
   I wish to speak very briefly in opposition to the Kennedy amendment. Then I will yield back the time, and that will eliminate at least that round. Then there will be 2 hours equally divided on the Domenici amendment. People can speak on either proposal, as they wish. 
   For the information of our colleagues, we will have one hour of debate tomorrow morning and a vote at 10:30 on both proposals. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote no on the so-called Kennedy minimum wage proposal that is now before the Senate. I compliment my colleague from Massachusetts. He has offered this time and time again. I am sure he will be back next year and the following year to increase the minimum wage. If you ask the question: should there be an increase in the minimum wage, I am sure a lot of people would say yes because they want everybody who is making a low wage to make more. 
   I happen to agree with that very strongly. It is very important for people to be able to climb the economic ladder. What people many times don't recognize is that if you have a very significant increase in the minimum wage--such as Senator KENNEDY's proposal of approximately a 20-percent increase, increasing it from $5.15 to $6.15, a $1 over the next 13 1/2 months. That is OK, I suppose, if everybody can just pass it along without any repercussions. But there may be some businesses that can't. If they can't, what are they going to do? They may hire less people. They may let some people go. 
   I know it does not seem as if that would be the case, but frankly it is. It may not happen in every case, but it happens in many cases. There are some employers that may not be able to pay $5.15 an hour or $6 an hour. Senator KENNEDY's proposal says in 13 1/2 months you have to be paid $6.15 an hour or it is against the law for you to have a job. 
   The Federal Government has determined that, in our infinite wisdom, in rural Montana or where ever, we don't care if pumping gas can only pay $5.50 or the corner grocery store can only afford to pay that amount, we don't care. We are deciding up here in Washington DC, that the Federal Government does not want you to have a job. It is against the law for you to have a job. The Federal Government has decided employers must pay at lease $6.15 an hour or they cannot hire anyone. Sorry, 15-year-old, 16-year-old, or 17-year-old trying to get a summer job, if there are no summer jobs available at that amount. It may be fine for the State of Massachusetts. That may be great in New York City. I can't help but think there are some areas of the country where maybe that does not apply and will not work. 
   This idea that raising the minimum wage can only have a positive economic impact is grossly incorrect. The Congressional Budget Office has stated it would mean a job loss of between 100,000 and 500,000 jobs. That is a pretty significant hit. Maybe it is not a hit for everybody because we have millions of people working, but for between 100,000, and 400,000 people who could lose their jobs, that is pretty significant. If they find themselves unemployed because they couldn't get a job as a result of the minimum wage increase we have created a real injustice. Maybe they are looking for summer work, maybe they are looking for part-time work, or maybe they are trying to supplement a job working evenings. Why should we price them out of the market? 
   Let me address a few other things that are in Senator KENNEDY's proposal. There are some tax cuts. Senator ROBB just spoke regarding those. Many of those are similar to ones we have 
   in our package that Senator DOMENICI will be talking about briefly. I compliment them on those tax cuts. What I criticize them for are the tax increases. You didn't know they had a lot of tax increases in the Democrat proposal? Well, they do. The fact is, there are more tax increases than there are tax cuts. 
   What tax increases do they have? They have two or three things. They have a little provision in here that reauthorizes Superfund taxes. We do not reauthorize Superfund because the program is flawed. Does it make sense that they are going to extend Superfund taxes without fixing the program? I am absolutely confident, 100 percent confident this Congress is not going to reauthorize and extend Superfund taxes unless we reauthorize the program. The program is broken. We are raising billions of dollars or have raised billions of dollars and we are wasting it. 
   The lawyers and trial attorneys reap great benefits, but we spend very little money cleaning up the program. Many of us are in favor of fixing the program. Let's make sure 90 percent of the money that is raised for Superfund cleanup actually goes to cleanup, rather than the current situation in which two-thirds of it goes to legal fees. 
   The Kennedy legislation also includes several other tax increases. There is a proposal that goes by the name of the Doggett proposal. According to a lot of different groups--including the Cattlemen's Association, Taxpayers Union, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and National Federation of Independent Businesses--this is a really big, bad tax increase. It is called the Abusive Tax Shelter Shutdown Act of 1998. 
   Most people think of it simply as an IRS enhancement act. Well, they are  quite mistaken. I mean, should we really give the IRS a blank check to go after lots of people for a lot of things because we think maybe we will disallow noneconomic tax attributes, whatever that means. It is essentially a $10 billion tax increase and we are going to turn the IRS loose. 
   We spent a lot of time and passed, in a bipartisan fashion--my compliments to Senators ROTH and MOYNIHAN--last year a very significant IRS reform bill that curbed the appetite of the IRS. This legislation would say, forget about those reforms. It would give the IRS more power to go after what they consider noneconomic attributes. It is truly a bad idea. 
   There are a lot of bad proposals within the Kennedy language. There are tax increases and the tax increases won't work. The tax increases will extend taxes that shouldn't be extended until the programs are reauthorized. 
   It is a heavy hit, particularly on small business, too quick, too much, too early. A 20-percent increase in the next 13 and a half months, in my opinion, is too much. It would have economic ramifications that would cause many people to lose their jobs. How many? Hundreds of thousands. According to CBO, it says job loss would be between 100,000 and 500,000.

   Mr. NICKLES. I say that 100,000 to 500,000 lost jobs is too heavy a penalty. For that one person who might lose his or her job, it is a very heavy penalty. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, there would be from 145,000 to 436,000 lost jobs. These are independent studies, not branches of a Don Nickles study group that says this is a bad idea. The CBO and Federal Reserve state that this will cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. 
   If there is no job loss or negative economic consequence, why stop at $6.15 an hour? Why don't we make it $20 an hour? I want everybody in America to make $20 an hour. I do. If they work 2,000 hours a year, that is an average of 40 hours a week for 50 weeks. If everybody made $20 an hour, hey, that would be great. That would be $40,000. I would love for everybody in America to make $40,000. But guess what. Some jobs might not pay that. 
   Does it make good economic sense to pass a law to say it is against the law for somebody to work for $40,000? I don't think so. Whether it would mean the loss of 100,000 jobs or 500,000 jobs, I don't know. But, I don't want to put even 100,000 people out of work. I don't want to discourage any young person or any person at all from trying to climb the economic ladder. We pulled it up. Sorry. We would rather have you unemployed than have you climbing the economic ladder. 
   I think that is a huge mistake. I think this proposal is too big of a hit, too quickly. I think the tax increase in the Democrat proposal is completely unworkable and it is certainly unfair. 
   The other side might claim that they paid for their tax cuts, and that Senator DOMENICI will have a proposal to benefit small business, and he didn't pay for his because it comes out of the surplus. 
   I disagree, especially when we are looking at having significant surpluses in the next 10 years. Basically what our Democrat colleagues are saying is: We want no tax cut whatsoever. 
   Less than 2 months ago, they voted for a $300 billion tax cut that was not paid for. Now they are saying we have to pay for this; even if it is only $18 billion over 5 years, we have to pay for every dime of it so we have more money to spend. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Kennedy proposal. 
   I understand Senator KENNEDY and his side have used their hour. If there is no objection, I will yield back the remainder of the time in opposition to the Kennedy amendment.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, I think we are getting close to a vote on the Feingold amendment momentarily, or in the next few moments, and a vote on final passage. 
   First, I want to compliment Senator ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN for their leadership in managing this bill. This wasn't the easiest bill in the world to manage. They handled it professionally and with great class. I think we are getting ready to pass a good bill. I  think we are going to pass a bill that proves, one, the Senate in 1999 is not isolationist and protectionist. It proves we can help a lot of our fellow people across the world by expanding trade, whether they be in Africa or whether they be in the Caribbean nations. We want to help them through trade, which we believe is mutually beneficial. 
   So I particularly compliment the two managers of this bill for their outstanding work and bringing to a close a bill that I think will be a real compliment to the first session of this Congress.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am going to speak in a moment on the trade bill, but first I want to repudiate, or at least take issue with, some of the comments that have been made by the President and those of his National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger, when he made comments about the Senate becoming the new isolationists. 
   I looked at his speech he made before the Council on Foreign Relations just a couple of days ago. He blasted the Senate, blasted Republicans, or that was the implication. I will quote:  
   It's tempting to say the isolationist right in Congress has no foreign policy, that it is driven only by partisanship. But that understates it. I believe there is a coherence to its convictions, a vision of America's role in the world. Let me tell you what I think they are in simple terms; First: any treaty others embrace, we won't join. The new isolationists are convinced that treaties--pretty much all treaties--are a threat to our sovereignty and continued superiority.  
   I could go on, but I am very offended by that statement. I am very offended the National Security Adviser of this President would make such a statement about Members of this Senate. He is factually incorrect. He is making statements that send bad signals throughout the world that are unfounded, and he should be ashamed, and he should apologize for this speech he made before the Council on Foreign Relations. 
   He implies this new isolationism is against all treaties, and he is implying maybe Republicans don't like treaties. Let me just take issue with that. 
   In 1988, we passed the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty. It passed by an overwhelming margin. We passed the START treaty, Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, START I in 1992, START II in 1996, by overwhelming majorities. 
   We worked and had a bipartisan arms control group that monitored arms control. I might mention, that started under President Reagan and President Bush. It has been discontinued, to my knowledge, under President Clinton, and maybe that is to his loss. One of the reasons that group was put together was that another arms control treaty, the SALT II treaty, the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty proposed by President Carter, was defeated. 
   I am amazed, when people said the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was the first treaty defeated in the Senate, they don't count SALT II. SALT II was defeated. We didn't have an up-or-down vote, but President Carter had the treaty withdrawn. He could count votes and he didn't have 67 votes. It was not going to be ratified, so he  withdrew the treaty. And he was correct in doing so. That treaty had fatal flaws. 
   So subsequent administrations, President Reagan and President Bush, said let's have a bipartisan arms control group in the Senate that will help monitor, discuss, give advice and consent. So we had good dialog on treaties as they evolved, and this Senate was quite successful in ratifying those treaties. I mentioned the fact we ratified INF, START I, START II, Conventional Forces in Europe--we did that in the 1990s--the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
   I might mention, I did not support the Chemical Weapons Convention, but it still passed by an overwhelming majority. I have my reasons. I don't think it is verifiable. I think somebody can build chemical weapons in a closet and no one will ever know. But my point is, that happened just a year or so ago. 
   This Senate also passed NATO expansion. We passed it overwhelmingly. 
   So, again, for the President's National Security Adviser to say we are isolationist I think is absolutely wrong. To say we oppose all treaties is absolutely wrong. 
   I might go ahead and mention that if the President submits the Kyoto treaty, the Global Climate Change Protocol negotiated in Kyoto, Japan, it will be defeated. This Senate passed a resolution 
   prior to their signing that treaty with 90-some votes saying we will not ratify something that leaves out major players worldwide, players such as China, Mexico and India, who did not sign the Kyoto Protocol, didn't sign the treaty--that we would not sign it. It has several other fatal flaws. The President went ahead and signed it anyway. If the President submits that treaty for ratification, it will go down in defeat. 
   Is it our fault the President went ahead and submitted the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty? Didn't he read the Constitution? The Constitution says it takes two-thirds to ratify a treaty. He never had two-thirds. He didn't even have a majority. Was that the Republican Members' fault when we had Members of the Senate, day after day, saying ``We want a vote on the treaty''? The President said, ``We want a vote on the treaty.'' We had ranking members, the ranking minority Member of the Senate and several others saying, ``We want to vote on the treaty.'' So we did what we often do around here; we entered into a unanimous consent agreement that could have been objected to by any Senator and scheduled a vote. 
   Then people wanted to get out of the vote because, oops, we counted and we don't have 67 votes. There were not even 50 votes. All it would have taken was a unanimous consent to defer the vote and that attempt was not made. Senator LOTT tried to offer the President an escape route, but he wouldn't take it. The President didn't even call Senator LOTT until an hour, maybe 2 hours, before the vote. That is the President's fault. 
   Let's go back to treaties. Is this Senate willing to ratify and consider treaties? 
   What about the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty? That is a treaty we have ratified, but we also know it has not been enforced. We know Russia has been selling nuclear weapons and materials to Iran, and this administration has done almost nil about it. The fact is the last Congress passed legislation to increase penalties for firms that, through Russia, are selling to Iran. The President did not want to sign it. He eventually signed it. 
   He has been lax in the enforcement of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty with respect to Iran. The administration has been looking the other way with China, who has been selling arms, missiles, and equipment to Pakistan. China signed that treaty. Russia signed the treaty. Iraq signed the treaty. And the administration turns its back on Iraq. North Korea signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and they have not complied with it. They have not come close to complying. As a matter of fact, we have uncovered evidence that they are pretty active in their nuclear program. 
   The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty says there will be onsite visits. North Korea said: No, there will be no onsite visits; we are turning off the cameras. The administration said: We are going to reward your noncompliance and build you a couple of nuclear powerplants and we will give you millions of dollars of oil every year if you promise not to do this anymore. 
   What was North Korea's response? Thank you very much; we will take your money, your powerplants and, incidentally, we will lob missiles over South Korea, over Japan, and maybe hit the west coast of the United States, certainly Alaska. 
   The administration has rewarded noncompliance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by North Korea. They have done the same thing with Iraq. My colleagues might remember we had a war. We had a war in Iraq in 1991--actually, in 1990, we had a significant buildup. In 1991, we had a war. 
   At the conclusion of that war, we said: Before we are going to allow Iraq to sell oil, we are going to have international arms control inspectors to make sure they are not building nuclear weapons and that they were not in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty--to make sure they are not building chemical weapons, not building biological weapons; so we are going to have an arms control group monitor Iraq to make sure they are not building weapons of mass destruction. Unless they complied with that, we were not going to let them sell oil. That was in 1991. That was after we won the war with Iraq. 
   Guess what has happened since then. Since this President has been elected, gradually over time, we have allowed Iraq to sell more oil year by year. We have zero inspectors in Iraq today. Zero. So they are able to build their nuclear weapons, chemicals weapons, and biological weapons. We do not have anybody on the ground. We may have satellites flying around, but they cannot pick that up. They can be built in small rooms. 
   This administration's record on proliferation is poor. Their record on enforcing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is pathetic. Again, to have this administration lecturing Members of the Senate and saying we are new isolationists is totally unfounded. 
   They rewarded Iraq for their noncompliance. They did not comply with the regime imposed on them by the United States and, frankly, the entire world--the United Nations. They did not comply with it. 
   What did we do? We rewarded them and said: You can sell all the oil you want. And the administration ratified that by a unanimous vote in the Security Council 3 weeks ago which said to Iraq: You can sell all the oil you want and, incidentally, you do not have to have any arms control inspectors whatsoever in Iraq; none, zero. 
   Great. That is a great policy. 
   Speaking of nonproliferation, the whole idea of 
   nonproliferation is we do not want a lot of nuclear weapons primarily, but we also do not want chemical and biological weapons spreading around the world. We do not want them expanding. 
   Maybe the administration better give us some answers, including the Vice President of the United States, when we have evidence turned in by the intelligence agencies--actually, it was done by a Chinese agent--that shows us they have copied or they have multitudes of information on our nuclear weapons, including our missile designs, our latest warheads, and a whole variety of things. We found out about that. 
   When did the President find out about it? His National Security Adviser found out about it in the fall of 1995. Sandy Berger, who is Assistant National Security Adviser, at least was briefed about it by the Department of Energy in April of 1996. According to Mr. Berger's statement, he did not brief the President until July of 1997. Mr. Berger, why didn't you brief the President? 
   Somehow, I do not believe that. He should resign. If the National Security Adviser finds out that China has access to our latest technology or designs on nuclear weapons in April of 1996 and does not brief the President until July of 1997, he should be replaced. These are weapons that threaten the security of the United States. These are weapons that threaten the security of the world. And he did not find time to brief the President of the United States? I do not believe that. 
   When did the President find out they had stolen these weapons or they have the designs for these weapons? What is our National Security Adviser there  for? To make partisan speeches in New York calling Republicans new isolationists? He does not find time to brief the President, but he has time to sit in on campaign meetings throughout the year and at the same time we have Chinese arms merchants coming to the White House writing big checks? This thing smells. It is despicable. Yet he has time to make partisan speeches that are totally, completely unfounded. 
   I have gone over a few treaties, and I have mentioned several the Senate has ratified when Republicans have been in control and when the Democrats have been in control. We had bipartisan ratification for every treaty I mentioned. 
   I mentioned the Kyoto treaty earlier. It has bipartisan opposition, and if the President submits it, it will not be ratified. 
   I mentioned the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty about which the President is so upset. It was not ratified because it is a treaty in perpetuity. It is a treaty that says 100 years from now or 40 years from now, no matter what China does, no matter what Russia does or what Iraq does or any other country, if we find out they have an aggressive nuclear program, we still cannot test because we will abide by the treaty in spite of the fact that other countries may not. 
   The Senate, by a majority vote, said it is not going to ratify a treaty that has zero test limits. Every President in the past has said if we have a treaty, it should be temporary, a moratorium, and not a permanent ban; it should allow for some small amount of testing. Frankly, we think some countries which have signed it are already cheating, but we cannot detect it because it is not verifiable. 
   Many think this is not a treaty on which we should bind the United States for the next 40 years. Mr. President, you have to submit a better treaty. You have to consult with Congress. You have to get some advice and consent. You cannot rail and make partisan statements that you want a vote and you get a vote, but then you say: Wait, I didn't know. I thought we were guaranteed to win. That is not in the Constitution. Congress fulfilled its constitutional duty. Maybe the President should read the Constitution. It takes two-thirds of the Senate to ratify a treaty. It is not our fault he did not have the votes. He did not even come close to having the votes. 
   What about this new military isolationism about which Mr. Berger is talking, implying the Republicans do not want to get involved in a foreign war? Maybe he is alluding to this Senator. 
   In January of 1991, we voted in the Senate whether to authorize the use of military power in Iraq. 
   And we did. We passed it by a vote of 52 to 47. We had some bipartisan support. Vice President GORE supported that resolution. 
   Most Democrats opposed it, including the majority leader, including some very respected Senators whom I know and think the world of: Senator Nunn, Senator Boren, for example. They were saying let's give sanctions a little more of a chance before we initiate the war. I respected that. I didn't agree with it, but I respected it. I did not question them or call them isolationists. I did not question their patriotism. But yet when some of us had some reservations or opposition to the bombing campaign in Kosovo, we are now called isolationists. I disagree with that. 
   In the Rambouillet accords, the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, basically said: Mr. Milosevic, you need to sign this treaty we have put together or we're going to bomb you. I have made several speeches on the floor that have those transcripts. Those were statements that she made: We're going to bomb if you don't sign. 
   I was opposed to that. I stated at the time I thought it might make matters worse. And, frankly, it did. 
   If you are concerned about the humanitarian loss, things were a lot worse after the bombing was initiated. After we pulled out the observers, the monitors, things really got bad. Thousands of people lost their lives. Is it unpatriotic to question that action? Does it make you an isolationist because you don't think we have used all the diplomatic tools at our disposal before we start trying to bomb somebody into submission? 
   This administration has bombed four countries in the last 13 months. They have bombed in Serbia; they have bombed in Sudan; they bombed in Afghanistan; they bombed in Iraq--most all of which have not been effective. In Serbia, particularly Kosovo, for a long time it made matters a much worse. 
   I don't question people's integrity or their patriotism or whether they are new isolationists. I question that policy. The same thing in Bosnia. I thought we should have given the Bosnians a chance to defend themselves. This administration did not. There was a difference of opinion. I met with Bosnian leaders who came in and said: We don't want your troops to be stationed in Bosnia. We want to have arms so we can defend ourselves. I happen to agree with that policy and also said: If we go this route, we are going to be stuck in Bosnia forever. We are. I visited the camps in Bosnia. We are going to have U.S. soldiers there for a long time. Now we are going to have United States soldiers occupying Kosovo, probably for decades, at a cost of billions of dollars. 
   So my point is, this administration seems quick to bomb, and if you question their rhetoric or if you question the issue, well, maybe you are a new isolationist. I just disagree with that. 
   I don't like name calling and there seems to be a lot of it lately. I am personally offended. Somebody made the implication that, well, somebody was a racist because we didn't confirm a judicial nomination. I am very offended by that comment. I am upset about that comment and the implication from the President and from a couple Members of this body. That does not add to the debate. That is not right. It is inaccurate. 
   In that particular case, the judge was opposed by the National Sheriffs Organization and opposed by the State chief of police. For that reason, I voted no. It did not have anything to do with his race. 
   I just think name calling--whether you are calling somebody a new isolationist or whether you are saying somebody has racial motives--is very offensive. 
   Let me just touch on a couple other issues. Mr. Berger alludes to the fact that we are isolationists. We have a trade bill before the Senate today, the African trade bill. We are trying to pass that. We are trying to include the Caribbean Basin Initiative. We are trying to pass that as well. 
   There are some Members on the Democrat side who are opposing that. They have a right to do it. My guess is, an overwhelming majority of the Senate will vote to pass this. And I do not question the integrity of one of my colleagues who is opposing it. He has the right to do that. They are entitled to their opinion. They are entitled to offer their amendments. They are entitled to have discussion and debate on the issue. 
   But if you look at trade over the last 10 or 15 years, this Congress passed NAFTA by a bipartisan vote. We passed GATT. NAFTA, we passed in 1993; GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in 1994. 
   This Senate is more than willing to pass fast track. The President did not call for fast track to be reauthorized because he was running for reelection in 1996. Some of the leaders of organized labor did not want it, so he didn't call for it to be done in 1996. He waited until after his reelection and then he sent it to us. 
   He was the first President, going all the way back to President Ford, I believe, who didn't have fast-track authority. After he was reelected, he said: Hey, Congress, pass this. The Senate wanted to pass it, but the House couldn't. A lot of House Democrats said: You didn't want to take a tough vote before the election, so we do not need to do it now either. He could hardly get any votes from Democrats in the House to pass fast track. So he is the first President in decades who has not had that authority. It is not the Republicans' fault. That is not new isolationism. 
   Is the President catering to protectionist forces within his own party and within the organized labor agenda? He could not get it through the House; but it was not the House Republicans, it was the House Democrats that presented the problem. And those are just the facts. 
   Another issue at hand is the World Trade Organization. There is going to be a meeting of the WTO in Seattle. Most Republicans support the idea of  reducing trade barriers throughout the world. There are negotiations with the People's Republic of China in the WTO. They were so close, and the President would not say yes. A Chinese delegate came to the United States and made a lot of trade concessions. Frankly, it was a pretty good deal. My compliments to the President's Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, who negotiated a good deal. And then the President would not say yes. 
   Why? Because maybe a few people in organized labor did not want him to say yes. Regardless, he did not say yes. So now he has called, I guess, the Chinese Premier and said: Well, we really want to do WTO. He had them here a few months ago, and he said no. Whose fault is that? Who is the new isolationist? Most of us realize we need to develop and encourage growing markets with China. 
   So I mention a few of those things to just repudiate, in the strongest words I possibly can, Sandy Berger's comments talking about the new isolationist fever that is running through Congress. Maybe there are some people running for President who have that philosophy. They don't represent the Republican Party. As a matter of fact, the primary person espousing that belief left the Republican Party. 
   In the Senate, I serve on the Finance Committee with Senator ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN, and others on that committee, who have jurisdiction over trade issues, who have jurisdiction over tax issues. There is not an isolationist trend coming out of that committee or from the Senate. 
   If the President wants to get treaties ratified, he needs to consult with the Senate. He could have found out from the Senate he had some flaws in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and did not have the votes. He could have found that out before asking for the vote and saved himself some embarrassment. Hopefully, he will come to that realization with the Kyoto Treaty. 
   We had a resolution in the Senate with, I believe, 94 votes that said Kyoto was fatally flawed, don't bring it to the Senate in this form or it will not be ratified. So maybe he is taking that as a hint he doesn't have the necessary 67 votes. 
   I hope the President and his National Security Adviser will move away from this rhetoric of ``new isolationism'' because, frankly, they are fomenting something that is not there. It is very much to the disadvantage of our country, our reputation worldwide, and it does not do them service because it is not true. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I, like countless Americans, am very saddened over the news that JOHN CHAFEE is no longer with us. The news of his death was a shock to me. I was with Senator CHAFEE just last week. I teased Senator CHAFEE about the fact that he was using a wheelchair, and I was accusing him of doing wheelies and racing down the aisles. He spent at least an hour with many of us in the Finance Committee discussing a number of issues, including health care, which was one of the issues in which he was most interested and of which he was a real champion for all Americans. This is a loss for so many, because of his great service to this country.

    Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the efforts of those working to make a difference in the lives of today's youth. The last week in October is ``Mentor a Child Week'' in my home State of Oklahoma. I encourage all of us to participate. 
   Big Brothers, Big Sisters is an organization whose mission is to make a positive difference in the lives of children and youth. Focusing on the challenges single parents face, this organization provides professionally supportive one-to-one relationships with a positive and caring adult volunteer, and assists these children in achieving their greatest potential as they grow to become responsible citizens in the community. 
   Children with mentors are 46 percent less likely to use illegal drugs, 27 percent less likely to use alcohol, and 52 percent less likely to skip school. Youth with mentors have better relationships with their peers and family members. 
   I encourage all citizens, parents, governmental agencies, public and private institutions, businesses and schools to support efforts that will promote the mentoring of children and youth throughout our community.

   Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Senator. There are, indeed, other key questions that must be thoroughly reviewed and discussed by the GAO study. Specifically: 
   1. For non-arms length transactions; the GAO should study the use by the MMS of comparable sales as a measure of value of production at the lease, provided the lessee satisfies prescribed information and sales volume requirements. This study should not be limited to the Rocky Mountain region only, but studied for use in all areas. 
   2. The GAO must study the adoption of alternative ratemaking principles for DOI use in establishing the commercial rate for transportation when oil is sold downstream of the lease. GAO must also examine what adjustments are reasonable for location and quality of production and post-production activities when oil is sold downstream of the lease. 
   This seems to be the best way to arrive at a fair, accurate, and concise calculation of the fair market value of production at the lease. 
   I am confident that in this way producers and the Federal Government would be ensured a fair and workable royalty payment system.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of all colleagues, I believe there are going to be three rollcall votes commencing at 5:30. So hopefully everybody will be present and we can move the votes fairly rapidly. 
   I compliment the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SANTORUM, for the outstanding debate he has conducted on the floor during the last couple of days. In addition, Senator SMITH and others, I think, have presented a very compelling case that this procedure, the so-called partial-birth abortion procedure, should be stopped. There is no medical necessity for it. It is not necessary to save the life of the mother under any circumstances, according to experts such as Dr. Koop, the American Medical Association, and others. It is a gruesome, terrible procedure. It needs to be stopped. 
   We have laws on the books that protect unborn endangered species from Oregon to Florida. We have fines and penalties that if you destroy an animal, or an insect, you can be subjected to fines and penalties of thousands of dollars. You can even go to jail for destroying the unborn of a particular type of insect which happens to be classified as endangered. 
   Yet in this procedure, when we are talking about a child who is partially born, we won't give it any protection whatsoever. We are talking about a child, a human being. I know some people say, ``It's a fetus and not a child; it  is not a human.'' Well, if we waited maybe 30 seconds, then it would be a child, or a human being, totally outside the mother's womb. I just find that incredible that we are not going to offer at least some protection for these unborn children. 
   I want to allude to something else. There was a sense of the Senate passed earlier today, and some people have talked on it and said it reaffirms Roe v. Wade, as the law of the land. That Roe v. Wade is a great thing. There are a couple of points about this I would like to address. From a legislative standpoint, we are the legislative body; we pass the laws of the land. The Supreme Court is not supposed to legislate. I read the Constitution. We all have a copy. It says, in article I, section 1, of the Constitution:  
   All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.  
   All legislative powers. 
   Then if you read through the conclusion of the Constitution, in the 10th amendment it says:  
   All of the rights and powers are reserved to the States and to the people.  
   It does not say in the case of abortion we give the Supreme Court the right to legislate. That is exactly what they did in Roe v. Wade. So now we have a sense of the Senate that says we agree with Roe v. Wade. I wonder how many people have really looked at Roe v. Wade. I thought I might introduce it into the RECORD because it is a very convoluted, poorly-drafted piece of legislation in which the Supreme Court legalized abortion. 
   The Supreme Court doesn't have the constitutional power to legalize anything. They don't have the constitutional power to pass laws. That is what they did. I was going to insert Roe v. Wade into the RECORD, but it is too long, it has too many pages. I object to the Supreme Court legislating at any time, even if I agree with the legislative result. 
   If Congress wants to codify Roe v. Wade, let somebody introduce legislation and let it go through the process. Let's have hearings. Does it make sense to have abortion legal, totally legal, without any restrictions whatsoever in the first trimester, and maybe little restrictions on the second trimester, and further 
   on the third trimester? Is that the way Congress would do it? If we are going to do it this way, at least if the people don't like the laws Congress passes, they would have some recourse. There is no recourse to legislation dictated by the Supreme Court. 
   So I strongly object to the idea of the Supreme Court legislating. I think the sense of the Congress was a serious mistake. I don't know if I am going to be a conferee or not, but I will work hard to make sure the sense of the Senate language is not included in anything that will be reported out on this bill. I think that would be a serious mistake. 
   Again, I compliment the authors of the bill and state for the RECORD that I urge all people, Members of Congress, to vote for the legislation by the Senator from Pennsylvania to protect unborn children who are three-fourths born, or two-thirds born; give them protection--maybe not as much protection as we give unborn animals under the endangered species. Evidently, we are not going to do that, but let's give them some protection. 
   So let's pass this bill. We can go to conference with the House, and we can drop this sense-of-the-Senate resolution and pass the bill, and hopefully this time the President will sign it. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. NICKLES. I thank and compliment the Senator from Missouri for offering this amendment. It is needed. This amendment is needed because the administration is getting ready to promulgate some regulations in the near future that will cost hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars for American industry. 
   When I say American industry, I am talking about small business, as well as, big business. I am talking about an unbelievably complex set of regulations and there is no telling how much it will cost to implement these regulations. 
   These regulations consist of how many motions you should make. That if you do more than a certain amount, then maybe that is not safe; or if you lift something, it cannot be lifted more than this number of times, or it will be too heavy or too stressful. OSHA and the Department of Labor try to make these very regulations and at the same time they say they honestly do not know what they are doing, so in many cases they will wait until laborers complain and then they will try to come up with regulations to alleviate their pain. These methods are not successful. 
   We have in fact already addressed this issue. The Senate houses the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan group, to research complex issues. There is a CRS study that was updated August 31, 1999. I will read from a copy of this report that addresses further ergonomic regulation:  
   Due to the wide variety of circumstances, however, any comprehensive standard would probably have to be complex and costly, while scientific understanding of the problem is not complete. 
   It would be costly, it would be complex, and, frankly, it would not be understandable. It would not be workable. 
   The state of scientific knowledge about ergonomics--and especially the role of non-work and psychological factors in producing observed syndromes--has become a key issue in the debate over how OSHA should proceed. 
   Even if the problem were fully understood, the wide variety of circumstances will bedevil efforts to frame simple cost-effective rules. What are called ``ergonomic'' injuries are actually a range of distinct problems, much as ``cancer'' is not one but a family of diseases.  
   Throughout the summary of this report, the point is that, due to a lot of circumstances, any comprehensive rules would have to be complex and costly while scientific understanding of the problem is not complete. 
   What about a scientific study? Why don't we ask the scientists? If Congress' research arm says this is going to be costly, we do not have the scientific basis to do it, why don't we have scientific basis? Why don't we ask the experts to take a look at it and see if there is something they can come up with that would be workable? 
   Well, we did do that. Last year, Congress passed and almost every Member of this body, or the majority of the Members of both Houses of Congress, passed a bill that funded $900,000 for the National Academy of Sciences to complete a study and review the scientific literature as mandated by Congress and the President on ergonomics. They have not completed that study. They should complete the study in about a year, January 2001; in 13 or 14 months. 
   We are spending almost a million dollars on the study to ask the scientists to do an in-depth review. Yet many people say they want OSHA to go forth and come up with these complex rules in spite of the unfinished study. They are saying that they trust OSHA to come up with rules and regulations without this study, without the basis for making such rules? You talk about repetitive motions--OSHA often tells companies that they may possibly be doing something wrong and a company could ask OSHA whether or not they are in violation of certain standards and OSHA would reply: ``We don't know.'' 
   These standards are almost impossible to define. What is repetitive motion? Standing at a machine on the job for 8 hours a day--that is ergonomic--is that too much? I grew up in a machine shop. I grew up in Nickles Machine Corporation. We lifted and moved a lot of heavy equipment. There is no way in the world 
   some Federal bureaucrat knows what is the proper amount of weight that individuals should be moving around. There is no way to create a uniform standard that applies to each individual. 
   Are they going to come in and supervise and say: You should not be standing there for that period of time? Maybe you should not be working at your computer for this amount of time. Maybe you should not be engaged in moving heavy objects. 
   We are going to have the heavy hand of the Federal Government, Federal bureaucrats running all across the country trying to make those kinds of determinations, saying: If you do not comply with our infinite wisdom, we are going to fine you. We are going to close you down. Amazing. It is amazing that we would do such a thing. 
   The proposed regulations by OSHA are not workable. They are unbelievably complex. Anybody who has looked at them from a standpoint of real-life experience in the workforce agrees that this is not workable. So what have we done if we succeed with this amendment? We have passed restrictions keeping this administration from going forward on this enormously complex, expensive, regulatory scheme. 
   Last year, we said let's have this study, let's let this study go forward; let's look at real scientific facts before we implement a standard that could cost billions of dollars, and no telling how many jobs would be lost as a result. Let's let that happen. I regret that this was not already included in the committee bill. 
   I think most people will acknowledge we have a majority vote on this. We have the votes to do this. We have Democrats and Republicans who will support this amendment. We have a majority; we have a majority vote in the House as well. Now we have this implied senatorial discussion: If you have this amendment, due to its complexity, we will discuss it for a long time; i.e. we will filibuster this amendment. We will not let this bill pass. We don't care if we bring down the largest appropriations bill, that deals with Education, Labor, Health and a multitude of Governmental agencies--we don't care if we bring down the whole thing. 
   Why? Because organized labor wants this rule to go forward. I guess if the leadership of AFL/CIO wants this rule to go forward, we should absolutely let it go forward. That is what a few people are saying, although masked with niceties, in senatorial discussion: If  you insist on a vote on this amendment, we are going to talk for a long time and not let this bill pass. 
   As I said, we passed related legislation in 1998. We authorized the study I previously mentioned, to look deeper into the problems employees and industry face. Let's let the study work. Let's find out what the scientists have to say. Let's listen to the experts. 
   We had a couple of congressional hearings regarding this very issue. The following was concluded from a hearing in 1997:  
   Any attempt to construct an ergonomic standard as a remedy for regional musculoskeletal injuries in the workplace is not just premature, it is likely to be counterproductive in its application and enforcement.  
   It is likely to be counterproductive. Does this give unions a chance to file complaints for harassment purposes? Has anybody thought of that? Of course they have. Does this increase people's leverage? ``If you work with us, maybe, a little bit, we will not be quite as vigorous in our complaints.'' Is this what we really want? 
   Another statement was made by Dr. Stephen Atcheson and others with the American Medical Association:  
   The debate concerning whether certain occupations actually cause repetitive motion disorders is now well over a century old and far from settled.  
   This is complex business. You are talking about movements and actions in the workforce, and there are an unlimited number of movements and actions. Now we are going to have that regulated by the Federal Government? We are going to turn loose the Department of Labor, OSHA, to come up with regulations that have the force and the power to fine and assess and have bureaucrats telling people how to operate their businesses? As if people running those businesses could care less about their employees? 
   The whole premise of this regulation is Government knows best; employers certainly don't care about their employees--which I do not believe. I have been an employer. You show me an employer who doesn't care about his employees, and I will show you somebody who is going out of business in a very short period of time and probably deservedly so. It is this presumption-- the Government knows best; we need Government as the caretaker for business operations--that I think is absurd. And we trust some bureaucrat in OSHA, who probably knows nothing about a particular operation, to come in and say: Here is how you should run your business. We know better than the people that have been managing that plant, working in that plant for years. There is no telling how much it will cost. No telling how many jobs will be lost, the costs that could be imposed, the costs that could result from unfair, unworkable regulations. 
   I compliment my colleague from Missouri, and I urge my colleagues to support the Bond amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. I would like to address a question to my friend from Pennsylvania regarding the Institutional Development Awards (IDeA) Program funding within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget. I am joined by my colleagues Senators LOTT, DASCHLE, and REID in support of the House level of funding for IDeA in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and related agencies Appropriations bill. It is my understanding that the Senate level is $20,000,000 while the House level is $40,000,000.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for his cooperation. Of course, this will be charged to our time. 
   I appreciate the comments by Senator COVERDELL and Senator GREGG. I know Senator GRAMS from Minnesota will be speaking shortly on this amendment. I will make some quick comments, and maybe I will not take 5 minutes. 
   I hope we do not have to have across-the-board cuts to meet our objectives, but our objective is to make absolutely certain that we do not dip in, as some people say, or spend some of the Social Security surplus money. 
   Right now there are surplus taxes coming from Social Security. There are more taxes going in than going out. We want 100 percent of that to be used to pay down the national debt. We do not want to spend it. We do not want to spend it for anything other than paying down the national debt. Period. We are drawing the line. 
   I heard my colleagues from the Appropriations Committee--and I have great respect for the members on that committee; I served on it at one time--say: We do not want to; we do not have to. I agree with that. We even put in the resolution we would have across-the-board cuts only if necessary. I hope it will not be necessary. I do not think it will be necessary. 
   Right now, in totaling up the bills, from the Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget Office, basically if we have discretionary spending above $592 billion or $593 billion, then we will start dipping into the Social Security money. Current projections are if we continue spending, as outlined in all the appropriations bills, we will be above that figure by about $4 billion or $5 billion. We have not concluded major appropriations bills. We have not concluded the Ag bill, but we are very close. We have not concluded the Department of Defense bill, and we have not concluded the Labor-HHS bill which is the biggest bill. Among those three bills, we can find $5 billion, and there would be no reason whatsoever to have to make this cut. 
   In the event we do not, for whatever reason, then let's have some adjustments. If it turns out we are $5 billion over--and those are the figures given by the Budget Committee and Appropriations Committee--we will have across-the-board reduction cuts of about 1 percent. It will apply to Defense, Labor-HHS, and VA-HUD. It will apply to all agencies. That is minuscule, that is affordable, and that is doable. It will keep us from dipping into Social Security trust funds as we have done year after year. 
   A lot of us have been pretty resolute in saying we ought to have a line. We are breaching the line on the caps because we are exceeding the caps by using emergency designations. We are now saying the absolute line is let's not grab Social Security money. That money comes from payroll taxes. It is supposed to be set aside for retirement. It is not to be spent on a variety of programs, whether that is a $2 billion increase in NIH or a $2.3 billion increase in education, or a big increase in defense, or an $8.7 billion emergency Agricultural bill. It should not be spent for those things. If necessary, and hopefully it will not be necessary, we will implement across-the-board reductions to make absolutely certain that we do not dip into the Social Security trust funds. 
   I thank Senator GREGG, Senator COVERDELL, Senator GRAMS from Minnesota, Senator GRAMM from Texas, and others in supporting this sense-of-the-Senate amendment, and hopefully it will not be necessary; Congress will pass its bills and show at least enough discipline to not dip into the Social Security trust fund. 
   Again, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for his accommodation so I can attend another meeting. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I apologize to my colleagues for going to the Finance Committee. I have just a couple of comments. 
   I have heard some of the discussion which said if we enact this amendment, we will have a 5-percent reduction. That is not the case. I have heard my colleagues say the Congressional Budget Office says it. Well, frankly, you get into descriptions of who is doing the scoring. If you use the administration scoring, it is not 5 percent; it is 1 percent. We use some administration scoring, OMB scoring. When we had the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, we used OMB scoring. They were the ones who implemented it. We use OMB scoring in a lot of the bills we have before us. If that is the case, we are $5 billion off. I don't think we have to be $5 billion off. I think we can, within the last few bills, narrow it down. We can eliminate $5 billion of growth in spending. Across the board won't be necessary, it shouldn't be necessary, if we show just a little discipline. 
   I know others on the other side said we can raise taxes. That may be their proposal. But it is not going to pass. 
   Yet I know there is lots of demand for increases in spending. We are trying to say we should have some restraint. The restraint is that we shouldn't be dipping into the Social Security surpluses. If we are going to spend Social Security surpluses, let's have an across-the-board reduction--if necessary. I hope it is not necessary. Let's do that if necessary to restrain the growth of spending, so we can ensure that 100 percent of the Social Security funds are used for debt reduction or for Social Security and not used for more Government spending in a variety of areas, whether it is defense, Labor-HHS, or you name it. 
   I thank my colleagues for their cooperation. 
   I yield the floor. 
   I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, shortly, within the next 10 or 15 minutes, we will be voting on the Lautenberg second-degree amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment. I looked through the amendment. Although it is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, it should be factual. This is not factual. Amendment No. 1851 calls for across-the-board cuts which could result in a broad-based reduction of 10 percent. That is not true. There is no way in the world it can be 10 percent unless Congress goes on a drunken spending spree. Maybe some people want to do that. We are not going to do that. 
   You can get into all kinds of discussions using CBO or using OMB. 
   Further, the amendment says we should do it without using budget scorekeeping gimmicks. 
   The gimmick is, we are using the administration's scorekeeping. That is a gimmick. Maybe it is wrong, but I have heard many people on the other side say OMB is more accurate than CBO. If you used all CBO numbers, it would be, at most, a 5 percent reduction. So 10 percent does not even belong in this debate. Using OMB scorekeeping, you are talking about 1 percent. I actually believe we will not have to. 
   I have talked to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and he says we can make it. We are talking about spending $500 billion. We are only $5 billion off. That is about 1 percent. We ought to be able to do that. 
   The Labor-HHS bill we are debating right now has some big increases in some programs. Maybe we could scale back those increases just a little. NIH grows from $15 billion to $17 billion, but the President only requested an increase of $300 million. Does it have to grow by $2 billion? 
   Education. I have heard some of my colleagues say, oh, those Republicans are cutting education. The bill has a $2.3 billion increase over last year and $500 million more than the President requested. There is a $500 million increase in the bill that is before us dealing with labor. 
   So my point is, I think we can tighten up a little bit and not have across-the-board cuts. I just mentioned Labor-HHS. Maybe we could also do it in defense; maybe we could do it in a couple of other areas. 
   But the way I read the Lautenberg amendment, getting around the false statements that it could cut up to 10 percent, it says: ``closing special-interest tax loopholes''--that is another way of saying let's raise taxes--``and using other appropriate offsets.'' 
   If the Senator has the votes to raise taxes, let him try to raise taxes. This Congress passed a tax cut, not a tax increase. The Senator had a chance to offer tax increases. They did not pass. I am just saying maybe he still wants to raise taxes, but that did not happen. The tax cuts were not signed into law. The President vetoed that. So we are not going to get tax cuts. 
   So I am saying, whatever happens, let's make sure we do not dip into this money of the Social Security surplus. We are saying 100 percent of that should be used to pay down the national debt--100 percent of it. We should not be raiding that money to spend on all these other appropriations bills. That is what I am saying.  
   I look at the substitute offered by my friend and colleague from New Jersey that says: Hey, let's raise taxes; let's use other appropriate offsets. I do not know what they are. If he has ``other appropriate offsets,'' offer them. 
   I want to help work with my colleagues to make sure we don't take money out of the Social Security fund. I am willing to do it. We have bills on the floor now where we can do it. 
   Maybe we should have other offsets for the Labor-HHS bill. Maybe we should have other offsets for other appropriations bills. But if we try to put them all together, let's make sure we do not dip into Social Security money. Let's not do that. We should not do it. 
   I think this amendment by my colleague from New Jersey says: Well, instead of any cuts in spending, let's raise taxes. I think that would be a mistake. I do not think the votes are there to do it. I do not think it will happen in this Congress. 
   So I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Lautenberg amendment.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will make a couple of comments, and then we will vote. 
   For the information of all of our colleagues, we will have a vote momentarily on the Lautenberg amendment, or at least in relationship to the Lautenberg amendment. 
   I have heard: Well, if you follow the amendment that has already passed, we will have to have a 10-percent reduction. 
   I want to say categorically that is false, and people shouldn't try to mislead people. What we are saying is we should not be taking money out of Social Security trust funds to spend it on a bunch of other programs. We should show some discipline. I absolutely don't want across-the-board cuts. I want to make those cuts. I want us to live within the numbers necessary so we don't touch Social Security. That is $14 billion more than the caps. All right. We will go up to that amount, but not more than that amount. We need some limit. 
   This bill has been growing like crazy. The Labor-HHS bill, as Senator SPECTER mentioned, the bill that he reported out of committee, had significant growth; it had more money than the President requested for education. Somebody said: Well, if we adopt the last amendment, which is already adopted, and we followed that, we would have cuts in education. 
   We would have maybe 1 percent. But guess what. The education bill went up by $2.3 billion. You could have a 1-percent reduction in that and still spend more than the President requested. 
   The Labor-HHS bill over the year has been growing like crazy. In 1996, it was $63.4 billion; in 1997, it was $71 billion; in 1998, it was $80.7 billion. The bill we have before us is $84.4 billion. As Senator SPECTER mentioned, we already have amendments adding a couple of billion dollars on top of that. We defeated amendments to try to add a couple billion dollars more. 
   There is a whole slew of amendments to spend billions more as if there is no budget, as if there is no restraint whatsoever. And Senators are saying, wait a minute, you really are spending Social Security surpluses, and we shouldn't be doing that. We said we are not going to do it. We passed a resolution that says if it is necessary, we will have across-the-board cuts. We don't want to touch Social Security. Yet we have amendment after amendment saying let's spend more. Many of us reject that. 
   I yield the remainder of our time. 
   I move to table the Lautenberg amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, two or three comments are in order. 
   Some people are still debating the amendment to which we have already agreed. I withdrew it. It was a sense of the Senate, a sense of the Senate which said we shouldn't be raiding Social Security funds. I don't think we should be raiding Social Security funds for education or for defense or for other issues. We have a lot of money. Defense is going up by $17 billion. Education alone is going up by $2.3 billion, even more than the President requested. As I stated before, if you do have an across-the-board cut, it is only 1 percent. And if you cut 1 percent off that 37.3, you are talking about $370 million off an increase that is $2.3 billion. So you still have an increase of $2 billion in education alone. 
   People are entitled to their own interpretation. They are not entitled to their own facts. Education has grown dramatically. The entire Labor-HHS bill, on which I have already quoted the figures, has grown from--I don't have it right in front of me--about $50 billion a few years ago to about $90 billion today. 
   So when I see charts: ``Republicans slashing education,'' it is just absolutely false. We have more money in this bill than the President requested. And even if you have a 1-percent reduction--and I hope we don't; I have said this time and time again; I hope we don't have an across-the-board reduction--I hope the appropriators will work with everybody to stay within the limit to which we agreed, which actually, so everybody will know, is $592 billion, and if we do that, we won't be touching Social Security. That is what we ought to do. 
   You can fund an increase in education, an increase in NIH, an increase in defense, an increase in HUD, an increase in veterans, and still not raid Social Security. That is what we are trying to do. 
   Just for the information of my colleagues, I withdrew the amendment. I don't believe the Senator's amendment is in order. I don't know how you amend something that is not underlying. I make that point and yield the floor at this time.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, before we return to the consideration of the FAA reauthorization bill, I would like to make a couple of comments. Raymond Fisher, just confirmed to the Ninth Circuit, is the 323rd judge who has been confirmed since President Clinton has been in office. 195 of those judges have been confirmed since Republicans took control of the Senate in 1995. 
   Judge Ronnie White is the first nominee, I believe, to be rejected on the floor since Republicans took control of the Senate. One of our colleagues said that he hoped that we are not returning to a ``color test.'' That is what was said. I am offended by that statement. Many people on our side of the aisle didn't know what race Judge White is. We did know that 77 of Missouri's 114 sheriffs were opposed to his nomination. We did find out that two State prosecutors' offices raised their objections. We did know there was a letter from the National Sheriffs Association opposing his nomination. 
   I believe that we have been very consistent, at least on this side of the aisle. We do not want to confirm a nominee where you have major law enforcement organizations and leading officials saying they are opposed to the nomination, regardless of what race he or she is. I do not believe the Senate has ever confirmed anyone when national law enforcement organizations or officials have stated that the nominee has a poor or weak background in law enforcement. To my knowledge, I have never voted to confirm any such nominee, nor have many other members. 
   I want to make it absolutely clear and understood that members voted no on Judge White's nomination because of the statements made by law enforcement officers, in addition to the respect that we have for the two Senators from the nominee's state who recommended a no vote. 
   We respect their recommendation to us. So I make mention of that. 
   I am bothered that somebody said I hope we are not returning to a ``color test.'' That statement was uncalled for and, I think, not becoming of the Senate. I want to make sure that point is made.

   It is the sense of the Senate that the Congress should ensure that the fiscal year 2000 appropriations measures do not result in an on-budget deficit (excluding the surpluses generated by Social Security trust funds) by adopting an across-the-board reduction in all discretionary appropriations sufficient to eliminate such deficit.......  
   The original amendment I filed said it is the sense of the Senate that conferees would make sure they did not dip into Social Security funds. Now I am saying the Congress should make sure we do not dip into the Social Security funds and, if necessary, that we have across-the-board reductions in spending to make sure we do not touch Social Security funds. 
   I have stated--and I think all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have done so as well--that we do not want to touch Social Security, we absolutely do not want to touch the Social Security trust funds. 
   We are going to have a surplus next year and it is in large part, if not totally, because of the Social Security surplus. Many have drawn the line and said: We are not going to touch that. Maybe because of emergencies we will spend the non-social security surplus. Those funds may well be spent--as a result of the hurricane, agricultural disasters, the events in Kosovo or East Timor, or whatever. There may be some emergencies that that $14 billion is going to be spent on, but absolutely not a dime more. 
   As we total all of these appropriations bills--the numbers are growing, or at least some people are trying to make them grow. I am saying that no matter what we do, at the end of this process, we will have across-the-board cuts if they are necessary. Hopefully, we won't have to. If we do our jobs, we will not need to have across-the-board cuts. 
   Senator STEVENS, the Appropriations chairman, said we are not going to need the cut because he is going to make sure we come in below the amounts necessary. He said that he will make sure outlays do not exceed the level that would intrude upon or have us spend Social Security trust funds. I respect that and I agree with it. But just in case I am saying--let's go on record; let's make sure that, if necessary we will have across-the-board cuts. 
   What are we talking about? I have added up all the bills. Just for the information of colleagues, I have added up all the bills including the Labor-HHS bill we have before us. If you add them all up, we are about $5 billion into the Social Security surplus right now. According to the calculations I am using, the same ones I believe CBO and OMB are using, we are about $5 billion over. That is about $5 billion out of $500 billion on discretionary spending. It equals about 1 percent. 
   I hope we can avoid an across-the-board cut. I do not think it is the best way to govern because we should be making reductions throughout the process. But, it may be necessary if we can not accomplish the FY 2000 appropriations without dipping into Social Security. 
   Incidentally, in the bill we have before us, I see we have about a $2 billion increase in NIH, about $1.7 billion more than the President's request; we have $2.3 billion more in education spending; we have $500 million in administrative expenses in the Department of Labor, and much, much more. There is a lot of squeezing we could do. Even if we went to the President's numbers on a few items, we could save $3.5 billion or $4 billion. 
   So I hope an across-the-board cut will not be necessary. But I think it is important we do whatever is necessary to make sure we do not raid the Social Security trust fund. A lot of us agree with that rhetorically, but we should make sure that each and every one of us mean it. 
   I have heard some of my colleagues saying: Well, we need to make some fixes in various areas such as Medicare, to correct some of the mistakes made in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I will just say that there are many on this side of the aisle who are willing to make some adjustments in Medicare. We understand that some of the assumptions and some of the guesstimates were inaccurate and fell disproportionately on some different areas. So we are willing to make some adjustments. 
   Medicare is an important issue and I am very disappointed that the administration would not work with and support the Bipartisan Commission on Medicare, to make significant, real reforms that would help save Medicare long term. The idea that the administration is going to save Medicare by putting an IOU into the Medicare fund, is baloney. It is false, it is misleading, it is deceptive, and it does not do anything to save Medicare. 
   My colleagues have just talked about introducing a proposal 
   that will greatly increase Medicare spending. We are willing to make some adjustments. I do not use the word ``fix'' because you are not going to fix it with a few Band-Aids. 
   A lot of us are somewhat knowledgeable on the issue, and we are willing to take the bipartisan efforts of the Breaux Commission and put together some positive solutions to help save Medicare for several years. Maybe we can only do a Band-Aid this Congress. 
   Frankly, I think we could and should do more. Certainly this Senator, and others on this side of the aisle are willing to work toward that. It is the administration that has been unwilling to dedicate itself to saving Medicare and as a result they have withdrawn their support of the Medicare proposal that was chaired by Chairman BREAUX and Congressman THOMAS. 
   Regardless, I hope we can lay aside the partisan guns and ask ourselves what we need to do to fix the system? I know Senator KERREY of Nebraska worked on that commission and did some outstanding work. Frankly, I think there are many of us who want to help fix and save Social Security, not just apply a few Band-Aids to alleviate a few of the problems. We are willing to try to work to help fix the entire system. 
   In working on these various appropriations it has become apparent that there is no limit to the appetite of some members of this body to spend money. Democrats yesterday offered about $3 billion of additional spending on the Labor-HHS bill that is already growing by tremendous amounts. Chairman SPECTER has already come out with an amount that was $2.3 billion over last year. Obviously, no matter what is reported out of committee, it is not enough, so we have to have billions more. 
   I think the appropriations process is getting a little faulty when we start appropriating so many years in advance. I do not quite subscribe to some of the games that are being played. And how much money can we move forward? We are seeing this happen time and time again.  
   Incidentally, the administration's budget had $19 billion in forward funding. And now, evidently, the process will come out closer to $19 billion or $20 billion, but that is still not enough. 
   I know the Medicare fixes are going to cost money. My point is, I already said, before we have the add-ons, we are $5 billion into the Social Security trust funds. We are going to have to make those adjustments in the conferences in the next couple weeks. It is going to have to happen. It is going to have to happen by people working together. If, for some reason, these conferences come out and exceed the amount and raid Social Security, we should have across-the-board reductions to stop it, to make sure we do not raid Social Security. 
   Maybe with the momentum for popular programs and we can't say no--if we do not have the collective will to say we are going to vote down and vote no on some of these appropriations bills, then let's set up a mechanism to say the bottom line is, if these amounts are so large that they actually raid Social Security, we are going to have to say no by having across-the-board reductions. 
   I hope that is not necessary. I do not expect it to be necessary. I think when it is all said and done, and the budgeteers finally start scrubbing these numbers--the CBO and Budget Committee--Democrats as well as Republicans will say: Wait a minute, let's limit the appetite of growth in spending and make sure we do not raid Social Security. That is the purpose of this amendment. It is a sense of the Senate. 
   Frankly, I was considering budget language that would implement it. Senator STEVENS has pointed out he will make a budget point of order that it is legislation on appropriations. But at some point we are going to have to get serious and say we are not going to touch Social Security. 
   At this point, I offer this sense of the Senate. I hope 100 Members of the Senate will support it. I am hopeful we will not need it, but we will have it if necessary to make sure--absolutely sure--that we do not touch the Social Security trust funds in our spending programs. Let's make absolutely positive that does not happen for the fiscal years 2000 and 2001 or for the foreseeable future. 
   Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Very briefly, we don't have to debate all the budget assumptions. 
   My colleague pointed out a lot of things he has read in the paper that different people have tried. The earned income tax credit, frankly, needs to be reformed. About 24 percent of that program is waste and fraud. It needs to be reformed, but we are not going to do it. I am probably the biggest proponent of reforming the program, but I have already said it shouldn't be done in this bill and it will not be done in this bill. It is not in the Senate bill. You haven't seen it; you are not going to see it in the conference report. At least that is my intention. 
   The Senator mentioned a few other things. My point is, we don't have to play games. He mentioned tax cuts. We don't have a tax cut in this bill. 
   When it is all said and done, let's not raid Social Security. The Senator said we are going to have to cut education. We have more money in the bill that is pending than the President requested for education. Even if we had an across-the-board cut to make sure we didn't touch Social Security, we would still have more than the President requested. There is $500 million more than the President requested in this bill for education, and if we had an across-the-board cut, it still comes out. There would still be more money than the President requested, and almost $2 billion more than last year. 
   My colleague said: Hey, the horse is out of the  barn. Well, it is not out of the barn. We have a lot of horses in the barn. Big horses are still there, such as the Defense bill, Labor-HHS. Those are two bills that are expensive. Most of the other bills are coming in at last year's level, maybe a little less. There are big increases in Labor-HHS and in the Department of Defense. Those are not out yet. Defense is close to being finished. 
   If Defense and Labor-HHS, Commerce-State-Justice, and HUD, come in too high--we do not know yet because they haven't been reported out, but if they raid Social Security, let's cut everything across the board. That is what this says. I hope they don't. I absolutely believe if I had my say-so, they would not. But I am just one person. 
   I think if the conferees show some restraint, and if we show some restraint on Labor-HHS, on the Department of Defense, and on the remaining bills, we don't have to touch Social Security, not one dime. But if, for some reason, we are not able do it, with the Agriculture bill for instance, the Agriculture bill emergency funding, as designated has blown from $6 billion to $8.7 billion; it grows by $1 billion every few days. I question that. I may vote against it. I think it has grown too much. 
   I have a lot of farmers in my State who are going to be quite upset when I vote against it, but I may well because I think it is getting ridiculous how much we are spending. Even if we do, that will be classified as an emergency; but I don't care if it is called emergency or regular outlays. If it starts dipping into Social Security, this resolution says let's cut all spending enough to make sure we don't. Are we going to draw the line and stop at a certain level or not? 
   Let me make one other comment because we have heard a lot of discussion on Medicare. President Clinton's budget proposal proposed to freeze hospital payments. How many of us have had hospitals coming up here and saying: You have cut too much? The President's proposal was to cut it more. Nobody has talked about that. My colleague says President Clinton's budget was balanced. It was not. The President's budget, according to CBO, still raids Social Security by $7 billion in 2000. I am saying, no, let's not let Congress do it, or the President; let's not do it. But if we have to, let's have an across-the-board cut and cut everybody a little bit. 
   Right now, the projections are that maybe it would take 1 percent if we don't show a little restraint. We can show a little restraint. We can save a measly $5 billion out of $500 billion of appropriations that have not been passed. We can do that, and we should. Absolutely. I am going to be disgusted if we don't do it. We used to have Gramm-Rudman-Hollings that provided for an automatic sequester if we didn't meet certain targets. I prefer that we not touch Social Security, but if we do, let's cut across the board so it is a small percentage. 
   I urge my colleagues to seriously consider that and, hopefully, pass this resolution when we vote next week. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, my colleague has made several 
   references about Republicans cutting education. I have called him on it in the past, and I am calling him on it again. The budget we have before us increases education by $2.3 billion. If you took what I said, cut 1 percent, that increases education from $35 billion to $37 billion. And that is a $2.3 billion increase. So I keep hearing him say Republicans are cutting education, and it has grown every single year. 
   I think he needs to stay with the facts. If you adopted this draconian proposal, you would reduce the growth of education from maybe $2.3 billion to $2 billion, which is still a big growth. So I want to make clear there is too much rhetoric that is too inaccurate which says Republicans are cutting education, when education is growing by over $2 billion in this bill.

   Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Senator. 
   Mr. President, the Gorton amendment is a pro-education amendment, if you believe people in the local school districts know what they need. Maybe they need more teachers. Maybe they need more computers. Maybe they need to enhance the benefits for teachers that are there so they can keep them there. 
   Maybe they need it for recruitment. Let's give them the flexibility. 
   I, along with several other Senators, met with some Governors and asked them what they wanted, and they said they wanted flexibility and they wanted Congress to help them meet the unfunded obligations of IDEA. I said: What about this proposal that some people have made that says let's have 100,000 new teachers paid for by the Federal Government? That was not their request. 
   They said: No, just give us flexibility; there are hundreds of Federal programs, some of which work, some of which do not work, a lot have mandates; give us the flexibility to work on those programs; give us some of the money without the strings attached; you do not need to tell us we have to hire so many teachers. 
   Frankly, they do not have to hire teachers and have them paid for by the Federal Government. Some States have already taken significant action to reduce class size. I compliment them for it. Some are way ahead of others. Should we punish those States that have moved ahead earlier than other States? I don't think so. 
   How in the world do we in the Federal Government have that kind of knowledge that allows us to dictate, to mandate that we need 30,000 teachers, or 100,000 teachers? In my State, it comes to 348 teachers. We have 605 school districts, so each school district gets half a teacher. Nationwide, there are 14,000 school districts, so I guess we get 2 teachers for each school district. Some people are saying that is the solution for better education, for the Federal Government to hire two teachers for each school district? That is ridiculous. 
   We have a lot of programs. The Senator from Pennsylvania has already mentioned there is a significant increase for education. Let's allow some flexibility, as proposed by the Gorton amendment, by people who run the schools who know--the local school boards and the States--what they need most. Let them make that decision. Maybe it is four more teachers. Great, I am all for it. Maybe it is for retention of teachers. That is fantastic. Maybe it is for computers. Let's have them make the decisions and not dictate that Washington, DC, knows best. 
   I reiterate, a vote for the Gorton amendment is pro-education, and a vote against the Murray amendment, in my opinion, is pro-education if you happen to believe people on the local school boards and the PTAs within the States have an interest in improving the quality of education and might know better than some bureaucrat in the Department of Education. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. I would to address a question to my friend from New Mexico, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. This continuing resolution essentially funds government programs and operations at fiscal year 1999 levels under the authority and conditions provided in the applicable appropriations Act for fiscal year 1999. Since Congress has not yet completed its work on the fiscal year 2000 Interior and Related Agencies appropriations bill, I would conclude that Department of Interior agencies, programs and activities will be funded under this resolution at fiscal year 1999 levels under the policies and restrictions in effect during fiscal year 1999.

   The President pro tempore introduced Pastor Estep as being from South Carolina. However, we still consider him a native of Oklahoma. Pastor Estep was one of the leading pastors in my State. He led one of the largest churches in the State, Council Roads Baptist Church. Before that, he was at the First Baptist Church in Pawhuska, OK, which is pretty close to my home town of Ponca City. He is really one of the most respected leaders we have had in our state, and we still consider him an Oklahoman. We are delighted to have him as guest Chaplain and very much appreciate his opening our day with a beautiful prayer this morning. 
   I thank Pastor Estep for joining us.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I compliment my colleague from Texas, Senator HUTCHISON, for outstanding work on this issue, and also several other people who have spoken on the issue, including Senator DOMENICI and Senator GRAMM from Texas. 
   I have been a little disappointed in the tenor of the debate by people on the other side of this issue. In the Senate, we certainly have the right to have disagreements on issues, but in some cases sometimes debate is not a credit to the Senate. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But certainly some of the insinuations that have been made on the floor today--that people are doing this because they owe big oil or they received contributions--is very offensive to this Senator. I think Senators need to be very cognizant of the rules of the Senate not to impugn the integrity or the intentions of Senators. 
   In 1996, this Congress passed legislation called the Royalty Fairness and Simplification Act by an overwhelming margin with bipartisan support in the Senate. I sponsored the bill and it was supported by Democrats and signed by President Clinton. The purpose of that legislation was to simplify the royalty process. 
   The MMS rule proposal flies in the face of that action. The President signed the bill in 1996. The proposal now put out by the MMS is the opposite, it is not a simplification. 
   If you look at this chart, you can see that this rule is not workable. To insinuate that people who oppose this rule are beholding to big oil, or they are against schoolkids is wrong. 
   The MMS proposal on royalties simply will not work and to state on the floor that it is going to waste millions of dollars, and we are depriving kids is not factual. 
   If this rule goes into effect, it will be an invitation for litigation. Instead of the States getting more money, or cities getting more money, they will get more litigation. The attorneys handling the cases might make more money. 
   Then they imply that maybe they have evidence from whistleblowers showing intent to deceive. We know there are whistleblowers. In the recent case where one ``whistleblower'' testified, I hate to tell you that before a jury trial in Long Beach it was decided against the plaintiffs, against the city of Long Beach against the supposed whistleblower. That was a 14-year case. There have been three decisions, all of which big oil won. I doubt that the jury was trying to decide the case in favor of big oil. It so happens the jury decided that the claimants in this case were wrong.

   Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is exactly right. I appreciate the clarification. That is the point I am making. When you hear the opponents of this amendment basing almost everything on this disgruntled employee, it just doesn't make sense. I didn't sit in on the case. I wasn't a juror. I was not involved in this case of 14 years. But I know the Exxon company won. Big oil won. The jurors decided that this disgruntled employee wasn't telling the truth, or didn't have a case. 
   When you look at the MMS proposed royalty scheme, you can say mistakes have been made. I will promise you that if we pass this MMS proposal as it now stands before us, you will have more litigation, more mistakes. It is an invitation for litigation. Sure, there will be some settlements and some wins and some losses. 
   But this is not a workable situation. 
   I will mention that the present law is not as good as it should be and we certainly shouldn't make it worse. You shouldn't be changing the rules of the game and changing contracts. Every law of the land says royalty is based on  the value of oil at the lease. Now you have the MMS saying: Let's include ``duty to market.'' What does that mean? We have had 50 years or more of experience--ever since we have been producing oil. We have the experience of collecting royalties based on the value of the oil at the lease. We don't know what ``duty to market'' means. 
   This is something new from the Clinton administration that I will assure you, if it becomes law will create more problems. If it does go into effect, two things will be wrong: One, MMS is not supposed to make law. We are the legislators. We are supposed to be the ones who make the law and not some unelected bureaucrat at MMS. It shouldn't become law, period. If this rule becomes final and is implemented, it wouldn't raise more money. It would create more litigation. 
   What I want on royalties is for them to be fair and simple and for the companies to pay exactly what they owe--no more, no less. The royalty rate is 12 1/2 percent. If we want to raise it to 13 or 14 percent, that is a decision this Congress can make. 
   But to say we are going to keep the same percentage, yet we are going to have a new obligation called ``duty to market,'' which includes marketing the oil away from the lease and other new obligations--which are kind of hard to define--but, we will try to work that out. There is some ambiguity. It is an invitation to litigation. All that will happen is that the lawyers will make more money. 
   Speaking of lawyers, I want to raise one other thing. It is very troublesome to me to think that you have two Federal employees--one now a former Federal employee--actually getting paid $350,000 for their involvement in this issue. They were somewhat involved in implementing this rule. 
   Think of this. Here you have individuals involved in writing the rule. These same people help groups that sue these companies, or sue on behalf of the Government, and get paid a bunch of money--Federal employees. Are we going to allow IRS agents to get a percentage of the take if they go after some big company? If they get a big settlement, are two or three employees supposed to get a percentage of that? That sounds like corruption to me. We have had two people that received $350,000 and we have an administration that wouldn't even say it was wrong. 
   This is the most corrupt administration in U.S. history. Yesterday we had the FBI testify that this administration completely thwarted their efforts to investigate campaign finance abuses. We had an FBI agent who served for 25 years who said never in his history did he have an investigation in which he was not thwarted, time and time again, by the Justice Department during this administration. 
   In addition to that we have an administration that grants clemency to 16 terrorists, while the FBI and others said: Don't do it. These are terrorists. They are a threat to the United States. 
   Did the administration listen to the FBI? No. Did they even consult with the FBI? The FBI said no. 
   That was a mistake. This administration's corruption, including two employees who were involved in this rulemaking and ended up getting paid $350,000, is deplorable. It is despicable. It shouldn't be applauded. It shouldn't be rewarded. 
   But most importantly, article I of the Constitution says that Congress shall pass the laws and says Congress shall raise the taxes. It doesn't say unelected bureaucrats at MMS can rewrite the rules, raise royalty rates, or raise taxes. They do not have that right. That belongs to elected officials. Then if we do a bad job, people can kick us out. They can vote us down. They can say: We don't like the laws you passed. What recourse do they have against unelected bureaucrats? None. 
   There is a reason our forefathers gave us this system of government. They gave us a good system of government, and we should never allow some bureaucracy the opportunity to set rules and regulations that gives them the force and the power to raise taxes. 
   Should we have royalties that are fair? Yes. Should we have royalties that are accurate and a royalty system that people can understand? You bet. Should people pay exactly what they owe? Certainly. 
   Members might wonder where I am getting my information. I am chairman of the subcommittee, and we held a hearing regarding this issue. We had a lot of experts in the field saying this is not workable. It is not the money. It is not the money in any way, shape, or form.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an outstanding Oklahoman, John Lopez, whose achievements have just earned him a major award--his firm, Lopez Foods, has been selected by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the 1999 National Minority Manufacturer Firm of the Year. 
   John spent several years honing his business skills as an independent owner-operator of four thriving McDonald's restaurants. Seven years ago, he sold his restaurants and purchased controlling interest in the company that now bears his name. John is Chairman and CEO of Lopez Foods, an Oklahoma City meat producer that is among the select few beef and pork suppliers for McDonald's 25,000 restaurants. 
   John took a struggling company and turned it into a vital force in Oklahoma's economy. He has had tempting offers to relocate to other states but has remained steadfastly loyal to Oklahoma and his workers. Leveraging his understanding of McDonald's standards and management philosophy, he has continually expanded and modernized his operation, bringing it to the forefront in food safety, worker conditions, and diversity. Today, a $160 million business with over 300 employees, Lopez Foods is ranked third among all U.S. Hispanic-owned manufacturing companies. 
   A long time champion of minority employment opportunities, he has strengthened his diversity program, such that minorities now make up nearly 55 percent of his workforce. John was selected by the National Hispanic Employees' Association as its 1997 Entrepreneur of the Year. 
   John also actively supports charitable endeavors that give back to the community, notably the Ronald McDonald House Charities. The United Way and the Jim Thorpe Rehabilitation Foundation benefit from his support as well. 
   Mr. President, the Commerce Department's award is a fitting tribute to a dynamic Oklahoman who continues to make a difference for our state and our nation. Congratulations to John Lopez, community leader, compassionate citizen, and founder and head of the National Minority Manufacturer Firm of the Year.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I compliment my friend and colleague from Ohio for the statement he made. Frankly, the announcement he made that this tragedy called partial-birth abortion is happening today and it is happening very frequently--I appreciate him calling attention to it. I hope our colleagues listened and I hope our colleagues this year will pass a ban on that very gruesome procedure which is the murder of a child as it is being born. 
   I thank my friend and colleague. I hope and expect Congress will pass it this year. Maybe with the votes necessary to overturn the President's veto. 
   I thank him for his statement.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would like to correct the record, because I know I heard a number of my colleagues say the Republican budget is slashing education, it's at the lowest end, it's the last appropriation bill we are taking up. Let me correct the record. Let me give you some facts. 
   One, the budget the Republicans passed earlier this year had an increase for education, not a decrease. The Appropriations Committee has yet to mark up the Labor-HHS bill. They are going to mark it up next week. I understand from Senator SPECTER and others they plan on appropriating $90 billion. The amount of money we have in the current fiscal year is $83.8 billion. So that is an increase of about $6.2 billion for FY2000. That is an increase of about 9 percent. That is well over inflation. I think it is too much. I think we should be freezing spending. We should not be increasing spending. But I just want to correct the record. It bothers me to think some people are trying to manipulate the facts, to build up their case. 
   The Democrats are well aware that the Appropriations Committee is going to be marking up a bill that is going to have at least as much money this year as we spent last year in education. I hope we change the priorities. I hope we follow the guidance of my colleague from Washington, the Presiding Officer, and give the States some flexibility. I haven't heard anybody say ``Let's cut the total amount of funds going to education,'' but I have heard, ``Let's give the States, Governors and school boards more flexibility so they can do what they need to do in improving quality education. Let's hold them accountable to improve the quality of education. Let's not just come up with more Federal programs.'' 
   I heard both of my colleagues say, ``Boy, we need more Federal teachers or more school buildings.'' Is that really the business of the Federal Government? Are we supposed to make that decision that this school district or this school needs more teachers, or this school should be repaired, or this school should be replaced? Is that a Federal decision? I don't think so. It just so happens that within the last hour I met with the Governor of Oklahoma, the Governor of Nevada and the Governor of Utah. They say they have already reduced class size and some of them have already made significant investments in schools. But, they need more help. They want flexibility. They want to be able to use the money for individual students with disabilities. We should give them that flexibility. But our colleagues seem to think, ``Oh, no, we have to have 100,000 Federal teachers. The Governor of Nevada said that in the city of Las Vegas alone they hire 18,000 new teachers every year. Why in the world should we be dictating? In last year's budget agreement we needed 30,000 teachers. Now we need to go to 100,000 teachers? Is that the Federal governments responsibility? I don't think so. 
   I don't think the Federal Government should be dictating that this State or this school district needs to hire more teachers or build more buildings or put in more computers. Let's give them the 
   money we spend--and altogether the Federal Government spends over $100 billion on education--let's give the States the flexibility to spend that money in ways that will really improve the quality of education. Maybe that will go to increasing the number of teachers or to buildings and construction. Maybe it will be in computers and in training. Maybe it will be in retention or it will be in bonuses for the best teachers. Why should we be making that decision? We don't know those schools. We don't know those districts. We don't know those superintendents. We are not serving on those PTAs. This really should not be a Federal responsibility. Let's give that responsibility to the local school boards and to the States and not have more dictates and more Federal programs. 
   There are already over 760 Federal education programs to date. Our colleagues on the Democrat side would like to add even more programs, as if that is going to improve the quality of education. I don't think so. 
   Just a couple more facts: Labor-HHS funding, which is the appropriations bill we are talking about, has been rising and growing dramatically. Yet I  hear, ``Oh, they are slashing this bill by 17 percent.'' Wait a minute, let's get the bill on the floor before we start saying we are slashing the bill. What we passed and appropriated and spent in 1997 was $71 billion. In 1996, it was $64.4 billion. It went to $71 billion in 1997, that's over a 10 percent increase. From 1997 to 1998 it went from $71 billion to $80.7 billion, again well over a 10 percent increase. Last year it went from $80.7 to $83.9 billion, plus there were some advanced appropriations of about $6 billion. 
   So, again there was a big increase from last year and we are talking about increasing it even further for next year, for the year 2000. So this rhetoric by the Democrats that is designed to scare people and to get people activated on the education bill, is not substantiated by the facts. 
   I want to address a couple of other things we can do for education and for the American taxpayer. But the President has to help us do it by signing the tax bill that is now before him. We have $11 billion of tax relief targeted towards education in the tax bill. If the President wants to improve education he can sign the tax bill and I hope he will. We allow for student loans, greater deductions and we provide extended assistance for education. Right now, people can save $500 on educational savings accounts. We increase that to $2,000. 
   It is vitally important that the President sign the tax bill. In addition, we have a lot of relief for taxpayers in the bill. I will just mention a couple of them. 
   I have heard a lot of people, Democrats and Republicans, say the marriage penalty is unfair. It's unfair for the present day Tax Code to penalize a couple because they happen to be married. In other words, when they get married their combined tax load should not be greater then when they were single and paying separately. And it is. The marriage penalty averages out about $1,400. For the privilege of being married you have to pay an extra $1,400. A lot of us think that is grossly unfair. We want to change it. 
   The President can change it. We, in Congress, have changed it. We sent the bill to the President's desk. If he signs it we will be eliminating the marriage penalty, for all practical purposes, for almost all married couples. 
   We also want to give relief to individuals who, in many cases, are at the lowest end of the economic ladder in the tax bill. I have heard some people say, ``Oh, that tax cut package, that's a tax cut for the wealthiest people.'' That's hogwash. We cut taxes for taxpayers, people who are in the lowest end of the income-tax schedule. They get a 7 percent reduction because we reduced the rate from 15 percent to 14 percent. It doesn't sound like much, but that is a 7 percent reduction for somebody on the lowest end of 
   the economic ladder. That is a significant tax reduction. 
   Wait a minute, what are you doing for the wealthier people? We are reducing the rate from 39.6 to 38.6, and we do not do that until the outyears. That doesn't happen until several years later. That would amount to a little less than 3 percent. So we give a much greater percentage reduction in tax cuts to the people on the lower end of the scale. We actually make the tax schedule a little more progressive. 
   We provide a tax cut for taxpayers, and honestly it is not very much of one. Somebody says that's too much, you have cut taxes too much. Think about this for a second. When President Clinton was sworn into office in January of 1993, the maximum tax bracket for any American, personal income tax, was 31 percent. The Democrat controlled Congress, with a tie vote broken by Vice President Gore acting as President of the Senate--increased the maximum tax bracket from 31 percent to 39.6. So, at the end of 10 years we reduce that 39.6 to 38.6, wow, we have reduced it about one tenth as much as he increased it. 
   And that is too much? We are being too fair to the rich? Wait a minute, they increased the rate from 31 percent to 39.6 percent; and we reduce it to 38.6 percent. It is still a whole lot higher than it was when President Clinton was elected. That is too much? The President claims that if you cut taxes that much, you won't be able to pay for all these programs. 
   We take two-thirds of the surplus and use it to pay down debt, to pay down our national debt by over $2 trillion. We take two-thirds of it and we pay down the national debt with the Social Security surplus. You cannot spend one dime of it for anything else. 
   In the President's original budget he said he wanted to spend billions for other things. We said, no we are not going to do that. We want to use 100 percent of the Social Security surplus to pay down the debt, period--no ifs and or buts about it. The President wanted to try to raid the fund and we said no. 
   Then we said, out of the surplus we want two thirds of it to pay down debt, one-fourth of it can go back to taxpayers. We do not want the taxpayers to have to send all of their hard earned money to Washington, DC. We certainly do not want to have to return it, we want them to keep it in the first place. It is theirs. It is not ours. It is not the Government's to spend. If they are sending in too much in taxes, let them keep it, why should they have to filter it through Washington, DC, and hope they get something back in the form of a so-called targeted tax cut? 
   President Clinton--his definition of ``targeted'' means: It applies to somebody--not you, not me, not anybody I know--so targeted that, in effect it is Government deciding who wins and who loses. It is Government making economic decisions. I think that is a mistake. 
   I would hope the President would sign the tax bill that we have on his desk that makes these changes and includes many more. I also believe we should be repealing this so-called death tax. I do not think it is right to have a death tax of 55 percent on somebody's estate that they worked their entire life on, and the Government comes in and says: Because you passed away, and you are trying to give this to your kids or grandkids, the Federal Government is entitled to take 55 percent of it. That is the present law. 
   If you have a taxable estate of $3 million, the Government gets 55 percent. So people who have those estates, they spend their lives trying to figure out ways to minimize this tax or get around this tax. 
   You do not have to be very wealthy to be paying a lot. You can have a taxable estate of $1 million, and the Government gets 39 percent. So that is 39 percent for a taxable estate of $1 million. Uncle Sam says: Hey, give me about half of it. This tax bill repeals that. 
   Mr. President, I urge you to sign this tax bill. I know you have said that you are going to veto it. I know you would rather spend the money. You think you can spend the money better than the taxpayers. I remember the statement you made in New York, in February I believe, that said: Well, wait a minute, I guess we could give it back to the taxpayers, and let them keep it, but what if they don't spend it right? 
   Obviously, there are lots of ways that this President wants to spend the money. There is no limit. And there is no doubt Congress will find lots of ways to spend the money as well. 
   A lot of us believe it is the people's money. They should be the ones making the decision. If they want to spend it on education, or if they want to spend it on housing, or if they want to spend it on a vacation, or if they want to spend it on helping their family in different ways, let people make that decision instead of Washington, DC. We think it would help the economy more and certainly be more pro-family. Let the families make those decisions, not politicians. 
   So, Mr. President, again, I urge you to sign this bill. I do not have any doubt you are going to veto the bill and the real losers are going to be the taxpayers. 
   I also remember we passed a tax cut in 1995. The President vetoed it. We came back in 1997 and passed another tax cut, and he eventually signed it. He did not want to sign it, but he did. 
   As a matter of fact, in that tax bill, in 1997, we reduced the capital gains from 28 percent to 20 percent. Secretary Rubin was against it and the President was against it although he eventually signed it. He did not want to increase the estate tax exemption. We had a small exemption rate from $650,000 to a $1 million. He was not in favor of it, but he eventually signed it. Those very things have helped the economy. They have helped grow the economy at a faster rate than people  anticipated. And now we are in a position to make further gains. 
   In the bill we have on your desk, Mr. President, we cut capital gains from 20 percent to 18 percent, and index it for inflation in the future. That will help the economy. That will make the economy grow faster. That will increase jobs. That will probably raise more money for the Federal Government. 
   So, Mr. President, we once again, urge you to sign this tax bill. It will be a good thing for the economy. It will be a good thing for American taxpayers. It will be a good thing for American families. 
   Let's get rid of the marriage penalty. Let's get rid of the death tax. Let's cut taxes across the board for taxpayers. We do that in the tax bill and still save over two-thirds of the budget for debt reduction. 
   So, Mr. President, let's allow taxpayers to have one-fourth of the surplus. Let's let them keep it. I urge you to rise to the challenge and sign the bill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan, Senator ABRAHAM, as well as Senator DEWINE from Ohio, for their statements. They are exactly right. I do not need to repeat their statements, but I think it is vitally important that they prevail in beating this amendment. 
   I hope my colleagues will pay attention. This is not an esoteric amendment. As the Senator from Ohio said, there are lives at stake. Do we really think we can have a big increase in the corporate average fuel economy standards mandated on sport utility vehicles without having economic consequences? 
   There are going to be consequences. Vehicles may cost more. It is quite likely they will have to reduce the weight of the vehicles. The vehicles will not be as safe. 
   We are superimposing Government wisdom on manufacturers and on consumers. The sales of these vehicles are going quite well because consumers want them. Nobody is forcing them to buy them. Yet if we come up with a Government-mandated higher fuel economy standard, presumably with the idea that this is going to be more fuel efficient, it may make the vehicles more expensive. It may make the vehicles more unsafe. It may cost lives. It  has significant economic consequences on families. 
   So I urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment that is pending. I again compliment my friends and colleagues, including Senator LEVIN, as well as Senator ABRAHAM and Senator DEWINE, for their excellent statements. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, I would like to have a vote on the Hutchison amendment. I think the Senator from Texas has a good amendment. The Senator from New Mexico, Mr. DOMENICI, has worked on this amendment. It is unfortunate that it is needed. 
   I am chairman of the Energy Regulation Subcommittee, and we had a hearing on this issue. The issue was whether or not MMS could change policy on royalties, or does that take an act of Congress. Does MMS have the power to increase taxes or the power to increase royalties? They have the power to collect royalties; that has been the law. Do they have the power to change it? 
   I tell my colleague from California, if she is not going to give us a vote on the amendment, then I am going to move to table the amendment momentarily. I am going to make a couple more comments. If she wishes to have a couple of minutes on this, I will agree to that. I listened to the debate last night for a while. I wasn't able to get in here to join the debate. I will make a couple of comments momentarily. If the Senator from California wishes to speak before I move to table, I will agree to that.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Texas for her statement of yesterday and today, and also for the chart. I hope my colleagues will look at the chart because that is what MMS is proposing and it is not workable. People who work in this field all the time have come before our committee, a committee of Congress, and said this proposal is not workable. They told that to myself, they told that to the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. BINGAMAN, as well as Senator DOMENICI, also from New Mexico. They said it is not workable. 
   I have two or three problems. I am going to touch on them briefly. 
   One, I have a problem with the Senator from California saying she doesn't like the amendment so she is going to filibuster the amendment. I earlier said: Let's vote on the amendment an hour from now, or 5 hours from now. 
   No, no, we are not going to have a vote on the amendment; she's going to filibuster the amendment. 
   If we are going to filibuster every amendment coming along on an appropriations bill, we are never going to get it done. If we do this, we are never going to be able to get finished. 
   People can talk all they want about a do-nothing Congress, but if we have members of one party or the other, or individual Members, who say: I don't like that provision in the transportation bill so I am going to filibuster the transportation bill--we have already seen that happen today--or I don't like this provision so we are going to filibuster it so we are not going to get an Interior bill unless I get my way, or get a supermajority--to say we need to have 60 votes to pass any amendment, I think that is a mistake. So we should get away from that. 
   Let me touch on the subject of this amendment. We passed in 1996 a bill, the Federal Royalty Fairness and Simplification Act, of which I was one of the principal sponsors, in a bipartisan way to simplify royalty collection. We did that. It passed overwhelmingly. The President signed it. It was a good bill. 
   The chart Senator HUTCHISON shows, the proposed MMS regs, is just the opposite of royalty simplification and fairness. If we follow the MMS proposal, what we have is an invitation for litigation. You have litigation nightmares already going on. The Senator from Texas already mentioned the testimony of the ARCO employee. His testimony was not persuasive. The issue of royalty under payments went before a jury of twelve in California in a case that had been ongoing for 14 years, and guess what? The jury decided in favor of the oil companies. They decided that the oil company was right. This company litigated the issue of underpayments for 14 years. 
   A lot of companies decided it was not worth the expense. It was not worth the bad press. It was not worth these editorials that really do not know what they are talking about, that know nothing about oil valuation and the complexity of it. So maybe they do settle. That does not mean they are guilty, that they are stealing. That is like somebody who says, wait a minute, the IRS audited your taxes and you owe some more money. Does that mean you are stealing? 
   There are some things wrong with the current royalty valuation program. We had two government employees who were involved in these developing the new MMS regulations and all of a sudden they got paid $350,000 each by an outside group who supports the proposed regulations. That is pretty corrupt. That is like having an IRS agent say: I audited your return and as a result we found out you owed more money. I want half of it. That is what happened in this case.

   Mr. NICKLES. That investigation is pending. Supposedly, the Justice Department is reviewing that case. 
   I urge all of our colleagues, to think about that. There are two federal employees involved in developing these MMS regulations who were paid $350,000 by a group with a financial interest in the final rule. I find that to be corrupt. I find that to be unethical. I find that to be outlandish. It needs to be stopped. 
   So I compliment, again, my colleague from Texas for this amendment. We need to make sure that Congress raises taxes if Congress is going to. If there is going to be a tax increase, if there is going to be a royalty increase, it should happen by an act of Congress. It should not happen by an act of unelected bureaucrats changing the rules without appropriate legislative authority and opening up a litigation nightmare. 
   Mr. President, I move to table.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I wish to compliment my colleague, the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, for his leadership in bringing the bill to the floor. In addition, I compliment Senator LOTT and Senator DOMENICI because they helped make this happen. 
   The Senate, earlier this year, passed a budget resolution that says let's use most of the surplus that is projected to pay down the national debt. As a matter of fact, let's use over two-thirds of it to pay down the national debt. I have heard complaints from colleagues on the Democrat side saying we don't do enough. Frankly, we pay down the national debt more than the Democrats have proposed and more than the President has proposed. Maybe that is not enough for them, but it is more than they have proposed. 
   I compliment Senator DOMENICI and Senator LOTT, as well as Senator ROTH, for laying the groundwork to say let's  take at least one-fourth of the surplus projected and let the people keep it. Some people say give it back to them. Well, I don't think they should ever have to send it to Washington, DC, in the first place; it is their money. 
   That is the issue. Are we going to allow the taxpayers to keep one-fourth of the surplus, or are we going to insist on that money going to Washington, DC, and Washington spending it? Obviously, there is no limit on the number of demands we have on spending other people's money. We can spend it all just like that. It is quite easy, in fact it is the easiest thing to do. Now, we finally have an opportunity, as a result of the significant surplus, to allow people to keep more of it. 
   We do that in this bill. We have come up with a bill that I believe is fair, balanced, and I think is a good tax bill, a tax bill for taxpayers. I will go into some of the benefits. First, I want to repudiate some of the comments that were made against it. One Senator said it was too much. It is one-fourth of the surplus. 
   I don't think that is too much. We have given tax cuts in the past when we didn't even have a surplus. I happen to have supported those. We passed a tax cut in 1997--a strong majority of Congress passed it. We didn't have a surplus then. I think it was the right thing to do. We gave a tax cut because, in some cases, rates were too high. We said if we have a tax cut, it will stimulate the economy and raise more money. Guess what. That is what happened. 
   We cut the capital gains tax both in 1995 and in 1997. The President vetoed it in 1995. He signed it in 1997. When I say ``we,'' I am talking about Republicans because we didn't have any support in 1995 from our Democrat colleagues--maybe with one or two exceptions. We passed it in 1997. We cut capital gains from 28 to 20 percent. It helped the economy and raised a lot of money. It beat the expectations by the CBO and the Treasury Department. Why? We reduced the tax on transactions by about 230 percent and ended up having more financial transactions. As a result, you have more income and more taxes. It helped the economy. Many of us said that would happen, that it would have a very positive impact. 
   Let me touch on one other thing. A couple of colleagues said you can't have this tax cut because it benefits high-income people. Heaven forbid, somebody making $500,000 is going to get a greater benefit than somebody making $10,000. Let me just step back a little bit. Is this tax cut too high, too generous for high-income people? I don't think so. 
   Let me talk about rates. I believe marginal rates impact on whether or not somebody is going to do extra work. I have been in 
   the private sector. I used to have a janitorial service, and marginal rates kept me from doing more work. I had a situation where I was making enough money to combine income and Social Security taxes. I was working about 40 percent of the time for the Government, and I said that is enough. I am not going to work more if the Government is going to take almost half of everything I make. It denied the advancement and expansion of my business--a small business. 
   I might mention, that small business is where most additional new employees are starting. Somebody says, wait a minute, this tax cut is unfair, it benefits the high income bracket. Look at what we do for high income. We reduce every single income bracket by 1 percentage point. The low end is 15 percent and we reduced it to 14 percent. The high income is 39.6 percent, and we reduced it to 38.6 percent, and so on. There is a 28 percent bracket; we move that to 27. 
   Somebody says, that benefits the high income. Wait a minute. We reduce it in every single bracket by 1 percentage point. It so happens that for the 15-percent bracket, to move down 1 point, that is a 7-percent reduction. If you move a 39.6 percent down to 38.6, that is a 2.6-percent reduction--less than half of a percentage reduction of the 15-percent taxpayer, or the lower income taxpayer. So I don't think this is tilted in any way. If anything, if one really looks at this, it makes the system more progressive. 
   So the argument that this benefits upper income doesn't fly, and it doesn't fly with history. Look at what the tax cut rates were when President Clinton was sworn into office. The maximum rate in 1992 was 31 percent. After the Clinton tax increase--or maybe I should say the Democrat tax increase because it only passed by Democrats, with the Vice President breaking the tie vote twice in this Chamber--it increased the maximum rate from 31 to 39.6 percent. Actually, it went higher than that because they also took the cap off the Medicare tax and said you have to pay Medicare tax on all income, all salary, and all wages. So you have payroll taxes and Federal income taxes and Social Security taxes, and no limit, no base, no cap on Medicare taxes. 
   Medicare tax is 1.45 percent of payroll, plus your employer's contribution; that is 2.9 percent. So a person in the maximum bracket pays actually 39.6, plus 2.9 percent Medicare. That is a total of 42.5 percent. When Bill Clinton was sworn in, the maximum rate was 31 percent. One year later, it was 42.5 percent on all income, all wages, on everybody in the country. 
   That is a massive tax increase. That is a 37-percent increase. 
   What are we doing in this bill? We are reducing that by one point. We reduce it from 39.6 to 38.6; 38.6 is a whole lot more than 31. 
   So, the tax cut that we are proposing is just a small fraction of the tax increase President Clinton and the Democrats passed in 1993--a small fraction. Yet some of my colleagues are saying we can't do that. It might deny us the ability to spend more money. We have a whole laundry list of people parading to Washington, DC, saying: Give me some more money because we want to spend it. We want more of your money because we can spend it better than you can. 
   Finally, I want to address the comments of one of our colleagues who says we favor a tax cut, but we don't believe now is the time to do it. Wait a minute. When are you going to do it, if not now? 
   We have estimates of a $3 trillion surplus over the next 10 years. And we are not going to do it now? Will we only give you a tax cut if it is $4 trillion, or $5 trillion? At what point would our colleagues say it is time to let people keep more of their own money? We are taking too much from them. If my colleagues are not going to agree to a tax cut that is only one-fourth of the surplus, they will never agree to one. 
   It absolutely amazes me how our Democrat colleagues all marched in step in 1993 and said: We are going to support this tax increase because Bill Clinton wants it. 
   You might remember that Bill Clinton shortly after that said, Oops, surprise, I agree with the business community. We increased taxes too much. He actually admitted to that. A lot of Democrats were mad, but he admitted to it anyway and then he went ahead and vetoed our tax cut in 1995. 
   Then in 1997, he eventually agreed to a tax cut and everybody seemed to favor it. I guess whatever Bill Clinton says the Democrats march in line to. 
   I don't know. But we cut taxes in 1997. We reduced capital gains from 28 to 20 percent--very positive things. They might think that was a bad thing to do. No one offered an amendment saying let's bring capital gains back up to 28 percent saying that it was terrible. A lot of people debated against it in 1997. But it was the right thing to do. 
   We cut taxes for families in 1997. We passed a $500 tax credit for each child in 1997. Bill Clinton campaigned for it in 1992. He didn't deliver in 1993. As a matter of fact, in 1993 he increased taxes. That tax cut didn't happen until 1997. Republicans passed it. The President vetoed it. We passed it in 1997 and he eventually signed it. 
   A family of four with an income of less than $80,000 has $2,000 per year that they can keep. A family with four kids gets to keep $2,000 more per year because Republicans in Congress said we are going to pass it. We promised to and we did. 
   We established the ROTH IRA. 
   We did some good things in 1997. Guess what? We didn't have the projected surplus in 1997 that we have in 1999. Now we have trillions of dollars of anticipated surplus. Let's give one-fourth of it back to the American people. Let's let them keep it. They shouldn't have to send that much to  Washington, DC. Their taxes are too high. 
   I will go through a couple of examples that we correct in this bill to show why their taxes are too high and what we do about it. There are too many people who send too much to Washington DC. Let me address a couple of those examples. 
   I mentioned a self-employed person. A self-employed person, an individual, makes $25,000. They are taxed at the marginal bracket of 15 percent on everything they make up to $25,000. Above that they are taxed at 28 percent. If somebody has a painting 
   service in rural Delaware, and paints houses and works for himself, that individual has a taxable income of $25,000, and probably is not considered wealthy by most people's standards. Any additional contract that person makes, any additional income that person makes, is taxed at 28 percent. He also has to pay Social Security and Medicare tax. That is 15.3 percent on top of the 28 percent. Add those two together, and it is 43.3 percent. He has to pay State income tax. In my State that is 6 or 7 percent. For any additional dollar that individual makes painting houses, fifteen cents of it goes to the government. 
   That is too high. That is far too much. 
   For a married couple right now that makes $43,000, it is the same thing. For any additional dollar they make, half of it goes to the government, if they are self-employed. 
   That is too high. So we cut that. 
   We provide marriage penalty relief and several other positive things. Let me go through some more of the changes. 
   I mentioned that we cut all brackets by one percent. That benefits the lower more than the upper brackets. The lower brackets get a seven-percent reduction and the upper brackets get a 2.8 percent reduction. That is not stacked towards the higher income people. It is a tax cut for all taxpayers, and it benefits, percentage-wise, the lowest income taxpayers first. The lowest income taxpayer gets the break first. 
   Again, for somebody who says this is weighted towards the wealthy, it is absolutely totally and completely false. 
   We widen the 15 percent bracket. We make it 14 percent. Then we widen it. We ship $3,000 more of income into the 14-percent bracket instead of the 28-percent bracket. 
   That is a very positive change for an individual with an income up to $25,750. That means they get to save $390. That is fairly significant. I think that is very significant. 
   For a couple you are talking about double that amount. So they get to save a significant amount as well. 
   Marriage penalty relief: What did we do? Some people do not understand what we did. We said we would double the bracket by increasing the standard deduction--basically doubling the standard deduction for an individual. If you look at the income tax forms, and say you are filing as individuals, or joint. If you file as married, you don't get twice the individual deduction. So, frankly, it would be better off if a married couple filed as individuals. They are penalized for filing jointly. 
   Does it make any sense for our Tax Code to penalize people for being married to the tune of $1,400 per family? That is wrong. This bill eliminates that for most couples. 
   What do we do? We said, Let's double the standard deduction. It should be twice as much for those who are married as it is for individuals. 
   We do that with this legislation because the biggest hit is on married couples, and the marriage penalty is that individually they are taxed at 15 percent. For joint income tax they are taxed at 28 percent--almost twice as high. We move those rates to 14 and to 27 percent. We are saying for all of the income that is taxed up to 14 percent they should have twice that bracket amount for a couple. That is not the way the tax code is right now. 
   Let me explain it. 
   Individuals today are taxed at 15 percent up to $25,000. You say, OK. That is for an individual, and it would make sense for a couple then to be taxed at 15 percent up to $50,000. But that is not the present law. The present law says above $43,000 they are taxed at 28 percent. So they have $7,000 that they are taxed at a higher rate, twice the rate as what they should be. We eliminate that. We double the 15 percent bracket for married couples. 
   So if it is $25,000 at 15 percent for an individual, it would be $50,000 for a couple. 
   What does that mean in savings to a couple that makes $50,000? 
   It means $980 a year that they will be able to keep. We are not going to penalize couples because they happen to be married and because they happen to file joint returns. 
   I want to compliment the chairman, because he has worked very hard in supporting this. 
   We have $100 billion in tax relief for married couples by eliminating the marriage penalty in this legislation--that is one eighth of this bill. 
   When we debated this legislation on the floor of the Senate last week, no one said take out the marriage penalty. 
   The marriage penalty tax elimination is one of the most important aspects of this bill and we are going to make it happen. 
   The upper rate reductions that I mentioned move one percent down. 
   That may not happen, because we have a trigger mechanism that says if we don't meet the deficit reduction targets the tax cut doesn't happen. 
   That is not the case for marriage penalty relief. 
   I encourage my colleagues. If you believe in getting rid of the marriage penalty, you had better vote for this bill. It is one of the most significant reforms that we have in this legislation. 
   What else did we do? Why should somebody be in favor of this? 
   We eliminate the death tax. 
   We changed the current unified credit into an exemption. 
   What does that mean? Right now everybody knows that we have a unified credit that says if you have a taxable estate above $650,000, you don't have to pay a death tax. If you pass away, your survivors and kids won't have to pay any death tax. 
   We changed that unified credit into an exemption. 
   What does that mean? Once you have to pay the tax, you start paying at 39 percent. 
   By making an exemption, you start out at a lower rate. So any taxable estate will be taxed at an 18 percent rate. 
   The beginning rate of a taxable estate will be 18 percent instead of 39 percent. We will be helping out estates that are just over the threshold, estates that are $1 million or $1.5 million. That is a very positive change. 
   Eventually, in 9 years, by the year 2009, we eliminate the death tax. At that point, estates should be taxed when the property is sold--not in the event of death but when the property is sold. If your kids inherit a business or ranch, they don't have to pay inheritance tax until they sell it; if they sell it, then they are taxed capital gains. And they have to pay tax on the base, going back to the original base. That is how it should be. If they sell, they should pay capital gains; if they don't sell, they shouldn't be hit. 
   I learned the hard way. This inheritance tax makes people sell businesses all the time. It makes people sell farms, ranches, homes--just name it--to cover estate taxes. That is wrong. If they should choose to sell it, then let them pay the tax on the gain. That is what we do here and that is a very significant provision in this bill. 
   What else do we do in this bill? We reduce capital gains taxes. We have proven time and time again, going back to the time of John F. Kennedy, reduce taxes and we generate more money to Government, particularly with marginal rates and capital gains rates. We reduced the capital gains rate in 1997 from 28 to 20 percent, and it raised a lot of money for the Federal Government. In this bill, immediately going back to January 1 of this year, we reduce the capital gains rate from 20 percent to 18 percent. 
   Beginning January 1 of next year we index capital gains. What does that mean? It means we will quit taxing inflation. If someone has a home and that home is escalating in price through inflation, they won't have to pay taxes on that inflated gain because the home really hasn't increased in value, it is just staying up. That is a very positive provision and I compliment the authors of the bill for their hard work. 
   We increase IRA deductions from $2,000 to $5,000. We haven't increased it  since we passed IRAs many years ago. That is another significant provision, so people are saving and are not so dependent on an employer or the Federal Government. 
   We allow self-employed persons to deduct 100 percent of their health care costs. Right now they can deduct 45 percent. This measure affects nearly 16 million taxpayers. It is a very positive provision. We allow 100-percent deductibility of health insurance for workers without generous employers. If you do not work for a generous employer, you can deduct your health care costs. 
   We increase child care tax credits. 
   We have AMT reforms so people don't get stuck paying an alternative minimum tax just because they are taking tax credits that Congress has already passed. 
   We allow small businesses to be able to expense up to $30,000 a year. We increase that from $19,000. This is a provision that will benefit thousands and thousands of businesses, small businesses, all across the country. 
   I say to my colleagues, this bill is a good tax bill, it is a fair tax relief bill. It allows small business, individuals, and married couples an opportunity to keep more of their own money instead of sending it to Washington, DC. 
   I urge my colleagues on behalf of the taxpayers all across America to vote ``yes'' on this bill later this evening.

   Mr. NICKLES. I want to take a minute to congratulate and thank my friend and colleague from Arizona for his leadership in the entire tax reduction effort, but particularly in estate taxes. The Senator from Arizona has been principal sponsor of a bill to reduce and eliminate the estate taxes. We have incorporated most all of that provision in this bill. 
   I want to compliment him because I am confident eventually--maybe this bill will be vetoed; I hope not; I hope the President reconsiders--we will pass a bill to eliminate the death tax. The Senator from Arizona deserves great accolades and credit for being a principal player in making that happen.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the ``Small Business Franchise Property Recovery Act of 1999.'' This bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to classify certain franchise operation property as 15-year depreciable property. 
   As my colleagues may recall, the recovery period for real estate property and building improvements was generally extended to 39 years in 1984 primarily for revenue reasons. Since that time, growing concerns have been voiced that having such an extended recovery period is neither justifiable nor based on sound tax policy. In many cases, 39 years is far longer than the normal use life of the property. Congress has directed the Treasury Department by early next year to provide us with a study and recommendations for overhauling the tax code's depreciation provisions. I look forward to receiving the Treasury's report, but in the interim, I do not believe we should defer addressing obvious depreciation inequities. Therefore, I am offering this bill now to shorten the depreciation period for real property and buildings for all franchisees from 39 years to 15 years. 
   Mr. President, franchisees-such as those who operate quick-service food restaurants generally enter into a franchise agreement with the franchisor that terminates after a set period of time (e.g., 15 or 20 years). There typically is no guaranteed right to renew the agreement. Franchisees often must undertake major renovations and improvements to the property at least once during the franchisee period. 
   Under current law, the real estate and buildings owned by franchisees generally must be written off over 39 years. This extended depreciation period bears no relation to economic reality and is roughly double the normal use life of the franchise property. 
   The ``Small Business Property Recovery Act of 1999'' would reduce the 39  year recovery period for such franchisee property to 15 years. This shorter period, which tracks the convenience store precedent, would essentially reflect the property's use life. This would be fairer to the small and closely held businesses that operate quick-service restaurants and other franchises. It also would enable them to free-up more capital to expand their businesses and create more jobs. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to cosponsor this bill. I would also note that Representative RAMSTAD recently has introduced a similar bill, H.R. 2451, in the House. I look forward to working with him and others to help secure the passage of this legislation.

Mr. President, we should not be passing a law on a tax cut bill to say it is against the law anywhere in the country to work for $6.10 an hour, that the Federal Government, in its infinite wisdom, decided if you don't have a job that pays at least $6.15 an hour you should be unemployed. That would be a serious mistake.

   The Senator is proposing a $6,000 tax credit if somebody is trained as a high-tech employee. We are going to have the Federal Government saying in this one area we want to pay $6,000 for this person to be trained how to run computers. 
   I want people to learn how to run computers. Millions of people are doing it today. They don't need the Federal Government to give them $6,000 to do it. What about steelworkers? What about auto workers? What about oil workers? What about factory workers? We don't do it for them. We shouldn't do it for this industry. 
   Also the Senator pays for it by taking away the tax benefits we have that allow people to enhance their retirement income. I think that is a serious mistake. 
   I make a point of order against the amendment under section 305 of the Budget Act on the grounds that it is not germane, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have been working for several years to clarify a provision of the tax code which treats certain truck drivers as ``statutory employees,'' meaning they are independent contractors except for payroll tax purposes. 
   Prior to 1991, these individuals could pay their own payroll taxes if they had a substantial investment in a distribution route. However, a 1991 IRS ruling said that an investment in a distribution route no longer qualified as an investment in ``facilities.'' This reversal by the IRS has created much uncertainty, particularly in the bakery industry. 
   I have prepared an amendment to clarify that an investment in facilities can include a substantial investment in a distribution route, area, or territory. Thus, an independent-contractor truck driver who has a substantial investment in a distribution route or territory will not be treated as a statutory employee for FICA and FUTA tax purposes. 
   Unfortunately, I am prevented from offering my amendment to this tax reconciliation bill because it affects the Social Security program. Under Section 310(g) of the Budget Act, the adoption of my amendment would cause the entire bill to be subject to a 60-vote point of order. 
   Therefore, I will not offer my amendment to this bill. However, I ask my colleague from Delaware, Senator ROTH, if he would work with me to consider this amendment on the next non-reconciliation tax measure considered by the Senate Finance Committee.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I would like to thank my colleague, Senator ROTH, for his management of this bill and for bringing this bill to the floor of the Senate. I am going to talk preliminarily about the bill. 
   First, let me say to our colleagues who are offering the $500 billion substitute that I compliment them for the fact that they are trying to work to reduce taxes. I think that is important. There are several provisions they have in their bill that I compliment them for. 
   Most of all, I want to talk about the bill that is before us, the bill as reported out of the Finance Committee by a vote of 13-7. That was a bipartisan vote. I think that is important. 
   Again, I think that happened in large part because of the Senator from Delaware and because of the content of the bill. I think that maybe we spent too much time talking about numbers. Maybe that is partly my fault. I like talking about numbers. We have a $3 trillion surplus. We are going to give a tax cut of $782 billion. That is about 25 cents on the dollar. 
   We are going to take two-thirds of the surplus and use that for debt retirement. That is good. 
   Some people say: Wait a minute. You are not reducing the debt enough. We reduced the debt more than Clinton's proposal. Maybe that is good. I think that is probably good. 
   Concerning the tax cut and total of the estimated surplus: Some people may say: Maybe the estimates aren't right. Maybe they are too optimistic. And even though we are only taking one-fourth of the surplus and allowing people to keep it, they don't want to give it back to the taxpayers. They'd rather spend it. 
   Well, that is not what a tax cut is. A tax cut let's people keep more of their money. They do not have to get it back from Washington, DC. Is it their money, or is it Washington's money? It is their money. Is it not a gift from us. We are taking it from them right now. In some cases we are taking too much. In some cases the taxes we are taking from people are unfair. 
   I am going to talk about that because the bill we have before us alleviates some of those problems. It doesn't solve all the problems, but it alleviates some of the problems. Is it the best bill imaginable and perfect? No. But it does go a giant step toward eliminating inequities and injustices in the tax bill. I say ``injustices.'' There are some cases in the 1999 Tax Code where the taxes are unfair. 
   It is absolutely unfair for a married couple to have to pay more taxes than if they were living together and unmarried. It is unfair to have a tax penalty for being married--absolutely unfair. That is in the Tax Code today. 
   The bill of the Senator from Delaware eliminates that. We want to get rid of it. 
   Unfortunately, that doesn't happen under the Democrats' proposal. Let me talk about that for a second. 
   Somebody says: Well, you eliminate the marriage penalty. What does the House do? The House basically doubles the exemption for single people and for couples. That is one way of taking care of the exemption. But it doesn't eliminate the fact that a lot of people have combined incomes that push them into higher income brackets. 
   For example, an individual with a taxable income of $25,000 is taxed at 15 percent. Anything above that, they are taxed at 28 percent. That is kind of simple. 
   Let's say you have two teachers who are married, and they have a taxable income of $25,000. If they file as individuals, they are both taxed at 15 percent. If they are married, their combined income pushes them into a 28-percent tax bracket. They are penalized. 
   It just so happens, as it works out, that in this case they are penalized $1,400. 
   Where did I get that? 
   They have a combined income of $50,000. A 28-percent tax bracket actually kicks in at $42,000. They have $8,000 that is taxed at a 14-percent rate. It is higher than what somebody is paying at the 14-percent rate. Senator ROTH's bill moves the bottom rate from 15 to 14. 
   The difference between 28 and 14 is 14 percent. Fourteen percent times the number of thousands, if it is $10,000, that is $1,400. 
   This hypothetical couple pays an additional $1,400 more per year for being married. 
   We shouldn't penalize them for that. 
   In the bill each couple has the option of being taxed individually. If one member of the couple is taxed at 28 percent, fine. It doesn't mean the next spouse has to be taxed at that rate as well. Maybe the income of that spouse, male or female, might be significantly lower. It would be taxed at a lower rate. Why tax them at the highest rate? We shouldn't do that. We eliminate that in this bill. That is not insignificant. 
   The example I gave was a $1,400 differential. CBO says the average marriage penalty is $1,400. We should be able to eliminate that, and we do eliminate it in this bill. Who benefits? Nineteen million married returns would have that inequity eliminated. That is in this bill. 
   Let me talk about the 14-percent bracket expansion. I wasn't particularly fond of this idea. I thought, why move the 15-percent rate to 14 percent? What does that mean? Somebody asked me the other day on a radio show: What does that mean to me as a taxpayer? It means we have a benefit for all taxpayers. Any taxpayer will benefit. How much do you benefit? Individuals, up to $250; and a couple, $430. 
   Therefore, a couple who makes up to, I think, $48,000 receives a $430 benefit. Somebody said the tax benefit in the bill is only 50 cents a day. Their numbers are not adding up. The benefit of that is $430 a couple. 
   I will touch on the bracket expansion. I want to compliment our colleagues on the pending amendment. They expand the 15-percent bracket up. We have that in this bill, too, under the pending bill authored by Chairman ROTH. We expand the 15-percent bracket. That means a lot of people who are paying 28 percent will pay 15 percent. We increase that by $5,000 per couple or $2,500 for an individual. That means a couple will save $700. If they have a combined income of $42,000, we save them $700 by reducing the rate from 15 to 14. For a couple earning $40,000 or more will save $1,130 under the bill. That is almost $100 a month. 
   I use the test sometimes of my son and his wife. He sells cars, and she is a schoolteacher. They have one child. How will this benefit them? From those two provisions alone, they will save almost $100 a month in taxes, and they are a middle-income, tax-paying family. I think that is a good provision. When combined with marriage penalty relief, the average married couple will realize significant savings through this bill.  
   For instance, those items together come to $1,100 just in the rate reduction and the expansion of the 15-percent rate. Then there is $1,400 savings in eliminating the marriage penalty. Now we are talking about $2,500 per year for a married couple making $40,000, $50,000, or $60,000 a year. That is not insignificant. That is $200 a month. 
   We are helping a lot of people. The number of people who would benefit from expanding the 15-percent rate upwards, so they don't have to pay 28 percent, is a reduction of 13 or 14 percent --13 percent by the substitute offered and 14 percent by Chairman ROTH's proposal. Chairman ROTH's proposal says to individuals in that category, we are going to cut their rate in half for that additional $5,000. That is a significant savings. Add that all together, and we are talking about $2,500 for a couple who make $40, $50, or $60,000. That is not insignificant. 
   Mr. President, 98 million people will benefit from the reduction in the 15 to 14 percent income bracket, 80 million who have incomes less than $75,000. In other words, it is a tax cut for taxpayers, not necessarily targeted the way as some others might like, but it is a tax cut that is weighted on the lower end of the tax schedule. 
   Moving the 14-percent bracket up, 36 million middle-class people will benefit from that provision; 19 million married returns will benefit from elimination of the marriage penalties. 
   Then there is something else that hardly anybody is talking about. We have a provision that eliminates the penalty called alternative minimum tax that disallows a lot of the tax credits we have already passed. In 1997 we passed a tax credit, $500 per child. It was $400 last year, $500 this year. That is law. I know a lot of the people arguing against the Republican tax bill didn't like it when we passed that in 1997. I had an appearance last night with Gene Sperling, and he said the President supported the $500 tax credit for a child. 
   Maybe a little history would be in order. The President campaigned for it in 1992, and he forgot about it in 1993 when he raised taxes on all Americans. Not only did he forget about it, but he did a tax increase rather than a tax cut. It wasn't until 1995 that the $500 tax credit passed again. That was when Republicans took control. We passed the bill, and the President vetoed it. We passed it again in 1997, and he signed it. Now they are trying to take credit for it. They didn't want a tax cut in 1995, they didn't want a tax cut in 1997, but we gave it to him and he signed it. Now that is law. 
   Because of AMT, a lot of people are not able to take full advantage of that tax credit or child care tax credit--13 million families, and I tell my colleagues that number is growing every year. Senator ROTH's amendment has significant relief. My colleagues will be interested to know that is $96 billion. Over one-tenth, about 12 percent, of the entire tax bill is targeted toward AMT relief on American families. I have not heard anybody talk about it. If anybody thinks that provision is wrong, offer an amendment to strike it out. 
   If anybody thinks the marriage penalty provision, which is $112 billion--again, probably about 15 percent of this entire package--is too generous, if Members don't think we should have marriage penalty relief, offer an amendment and take it out. If Members don't think we should cut the rate from 15 percent to 14 percent--which is $298 billion, which is the biggest provision in this entire bill, which is three-eighths of the entire bill--if Members don't think it should be in there, take it out. I would oppose any such amendments, because these provisions are at the heart of this legislation and are what make this bill a tax cut for taxpayers on the lowest end of the ladder. 
   A lot of people say the Republican package is a tax cut for the rich. It is not. Those people have not read the bill. This bill reduces taxes for all taxpayers, including people at the lowest end of the economic ladder. 
   The provisions I discussed are $506 billion out of $792 billion. That is over five-eighths of the bill I have already described. I haven't heard anybody single out any of those sections and say: that is a bad provision, we shouldn't have that provision. 
   Let me discuss a couple of other areas in this bill and why we should pass the bill. Let me talk about estate taxes. A lot of people are not aware of how the amendment of the Senator from Delaware works. It replaces the unified credit with an exemption. Most people say: What in the world are you talking about? Unified credit, under the existing system, says we will credit you so much in taxes, and you don't have to pay; but above that, you start paying taxes at whatever rate it is. It means if you have a taxable estate, once you start paying taxes, you start paying taxes at a 39-percent rate. If you have a taxable estate of $1 million, 39 percent goes to the Government. 
   What we do by replacing the unified credit with an exemption is, once you run out of the exemption, you start paying taxes at the lowest rate, which is 18 percent. That is a big difference. That is a big difference for estates that are barely taxable. So, if you are over the exemption amount--the exemption amount today is $650,000--and you don't have to have a lot of property or a lot of wealth to have an estate of $650,000, if you get above that, your tax would be 18 percent instead of 39 percent. That is a big difference, and I compliment the chairman for doing it. 
   Frankly, I would like to eliminate the estate taxes and have the taxable event not be death but when the property is sold. Senator KYL and others have been advancing that. I think that is an excellent idea. You should not be taxing somebody because somebody dies. You should tax them when that property is sold. If the people who receive the property, the beneficiaries, the family, if they want to keep the business and keep the business operating and running, great. If they want to sell the business, tax it as a capital gain and tax it at the old valuation, at whatever escalation has been in the market value. That is the capital gain. That is what the taxable event should be, when the property is sold--not because somebody dies. 
   Again, the chairman's provision, exchanging the unified credit for an exemption, is a giant step towards, basically, bringing about some relief in estate taxes which I think is critically important. If you believe, as do I, in family-owned businesses, if you believe the Government is not entitled to take over half of people's property just because they pass away then you should support this bill. Somebody said earlier this provision in the bill only benefits the wealthy. I disagree strongly with that statement. 
   My father, unfortunately, passed away when I was pretty young and we had a family-owned business, Nickles Machine Corporation, in Ponca City, OK. We had a significant dispute with the IRS for 7 years about the valuation of this company. The IRS said: We think it is worth a whole lot more and we want you to pay a lot of taxes. My mother did not pass away; my brothers and sisters did not pass away--just my father. And he was second generation in this business. Yet the Government said: We want a chunk of it. 
   The estate tax rate today says any estate over $3 million, they want 55 percent. Why in the world would the Federal Government be entitled to take over half of what somebody worked his or her entire life for because somebody passed away? 
   One of the changes we made in 1981, it has been seldom noticed, but one of the great changes we made, we eliminated the inheritance tax between spouses so surviving spouses do not have to pay a dime of inheritance tax. That is a positive change. I was here and had a little something to do with it, and I am very pleased we made that change. 
   But it isn't enough. Now, even though we have made that change, when the surviving spouse passes away and you have a taxable estate of $3 million--maybe it is a manufacturing company, maybe it is a farm or ranch, maybe it is a restaurant, and it happens to be worth $3 million--the Federal Government comes in and says: We want half. I absolutely think that is wrong. That is one of the many reasons why I think we need a tax cut today. That is one of the reasons why I think we need a greater tax cut than the alternative proposed by our colleagues that would provide $500 million. I note the estate tax relief they have in their provision----

<TEXT>
   Mr. NICKLES. Looking at the provision offered by our colleagues, in the substitute they have $19 billion of estate tax relief and the estate tax relief offered by the underlying proposal 
   is $63 billion. So it does a lot more in estate tax relief in the chairman's bill than what is offered in the substitute. 
   I happen to believe in estate tax reform very strongly, and not because it benefits the wealthy. I happen to believe it is a matter of fundamental fairness and freedom. People should be able to work their entire life and be able to pass their property on to their kids without Uncle Sam coming in and saying that we want half or even over half. The chairman's amendment helps make that change. 
   Also in the underlying bill, we increase retirement savings. Everybody in this room knows we do not save near enough. What we do under the underlying bill is we increase IRAs over a 3-year period from $2,000 to $5,000. We do that in both the IRAs that are tax exempt going in and the ROTH IRAs, into which you may put after-tax dollars. That means we are allowing people to put in more money to save for their own retirement. 
   The $2,000 limit goes back for years and has not been indexed for inflation. Frankly, we in Congress should encourage savings. We want people to be less dependent on Government, more dependent on themselves, to be able to save for their retirement. Increasing this amount from $2,000 to $5,000 is a giant step in the right direction. Again, I compliment the chairman. This provision is in his bill. It is not in most of the other bills. I do not believe it is in the substitute as well. 
   Finally, I want to touch on one other thing, and that is the self-employed health care deductibility. The chairman's bill says, for self-employed persons, we are going to allow 100-percent deductibility. We had this debate actually when we were debating the Patients' Bill of Rights. It was included in the measure we passed on the floor of the Senate. I argued then if we want to increase health care access, we should at least make the Tax Code equitable, and it is not equitable. Major corporations today get to deduct 100 percent of their health care costs; self-employed deduct 45 percent. What is right about that? What is right about a code that says: Self-employed person, you deduct 45 percent but GM or any corporation in America, you deduct 100 percent? I am offended by that section in the Tax Code and I support this bill for making that much needed change. I used to be self-employed. I used to run a corporation. A corporation deducts 100 percent, but if you are self employed tough luck, you only get to deduct 45 percent. 
   Then the chairman's package also has a major expansion for people who do not get anything from their employer. If they pay over half their health care cost, they get to have an above-the-line deduction for their health care expense. Again, why in the world, if we are going to use the Tax Code to encourage health care, why do we not let it apply to everybody in America? We do not do that today. If you do not work for a generous employer who subsidizes your health care, you are out of luck. If you are not self-employed, you are out of luck. You have to pay for your health care with after-tax dollars. You do not get any deduction. 
   The chairman's bill changes that inequity and says, yes, you eventually get a 100-percent deduction. It phases that in, but eventually that person gets a 100-percent deduction for their health care cost as well, and they do not have to itemize to get it. All taxpayers would get it. Again, this is a giant step in the right direction in bringing tax equity in health care costs. 
   When we allow people to buy homes and we say you can deduct your interest, we do not say you have to work for a generous employer to be able to deduct the interest. Everybody gets it. We are free to use the Tax Code to encourage health care. It should apply to everybody, and again, the chairman's package makes a giant step in that direction. 
   The chairman's package does many other things. It allows an extension of time for people to be able to deduct their student 
   loans; it allows a continued deduction for companies that have educational plans and benefits; it has a plan to help in education; it has a plan to help in health care; it has a plan to help increase savings and retirement and 401(k)s; it has a plan to allow people to keep more of their own money; it eliminates the marriage penalty. 
   I tell my colleagues that those are things we need which will help American families. That is not just a tax cut for the wealthy. That is not something my colleagues can demagog. They may want to, but if they want to demagog, where do they want to cut? Do they want to eliminate the permanent R&D tax credit? Do they want to eliminate the self-employed deductibility? Do they want to eliminate the marriage penalty? Do they want to eliminate the reduction in rate from 15 to 14? Do they want to eliminate the expansion of the 15-percent tax bracket? I don't think so. 
   I think the chairman has put together a good package and that package, yes, costs $792 billion. I say costs. It is going to allow people to keep $792 billion of their own money. They are going to be sending in over $3 trillion more than the Federal Government needs in the next 10 years. We are saying we are going to let them keep some of that themselves. The chairman has crafted this in a way that is going to help a lot of middle-income working Americans who are interested in health care, who are interested in education, who want to not be penalized because they happen to be married. 
   So I compliment him for his package. I urge my colleagues, with all great respect for the amendment that is pending, I urge them to vote no on that amendment because we can do more, and we should do more. The American taxpayers deserve more, deserve better. I hope our colleagues vote no on the pending amendment and vote yes on final passage, hopefully tonight. 
   I will mention, as far as procedurally, I hope we can finish this bill tonight. It is possible. It will not be easy, and our colleagues will have to work together to make that happen, but I hope it will be possible for us to have final passage on the underlying amendment later tonight. 
   I yield the floor. I thank my colleague from Delaware.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague and friend, Senator CRAIG, in making a few comments about a friend of ours--both of ours--Ken Foss, who passed away this past Saturday. 
   His passing is a real loss to the Senate and a real loss to this country. He was a very dedicated member of the Senate family, a person with whom I had the pleasure of working for several years. When I was chairman of the Policy Committee, I got to know Ken Foss. He started his career when he worked for Senator Coats, starting in 1990 or 1991. He did good work for Senator Coats, and was an asset to our former colleague's staff. 
   In 1992, I stole him from Senator Coats' office because he had great talent, and great promise; and he quickly became an integral part of our team at the Policy Committee. 
   I was fortunate enough to be chairman of the Policy Committee from 1991 to 1996, and blessed to know this energetic person who had a real love affair with this country and a real love affair with history. Ken was energetic. He worked with a lot of zeal, a lot of passion, and a lot of real belief. 
   I remember him working in the Policy Committee as a person who always did his homework. On any issue, he did his research, and he knew his subject. I remember also his dedicated work in the cave, down in the basement of the Capitol, doing television work, keeping Members--all Members--apprised of what was going on on the floor. He was one of the individuals on whom you could count to give an update of what was happening on the floor, what was happening politically, what was happening substantively, what was happening procedurally, keeping colleagues and staff fully informed and ready to act when the time came.  
   I remember one time traveling to Richmond, VA, to speak at a 
   GOP gathering--actually a State convention. It was an effort to try to bring the party together after a somewhat divisive campaign. Ken was my guide to all the party officials, from those with high rank to those whom we never hear much about, but make our party work. His understanding and devotion to the Virginia State Republican party was strong, and unwavering, and Virginia benefited from his dedication and hard work. 
   But his political knowledge was equaled, and exceeded, by his vast storehouse of knowledge about Virginia history. He knew more on this subject than any person I have ever met. From the beginning of the Commonwealth as a colony of England, to the present day, you had no better guide than Ken. When you are talking about Civil War battlefields, which I happen to be interested in, my small knowledge paled in comparison to Ken Foss's. And all this information, Ken shared freely, enthusiastically, from school children to the elderly, inspiring many whom he met. 
   As all of our colleagues know, we are renovating the Rotunda. I had the pleasure earlier this year of making my second or third trip to see the Rotunda in my Senate career. Of course, Ken Foss wanted to participate in that, and he climbed all the way to the top with us. All of us on that tour certainly enjoyed his presence that morning, because, again, his ability to be able to illuminate history, going back to Washington, going back to the founding of our country, and explaining various facts about our Capitol, was certainly informative and reminded us all of what a resource the Capitol is to tell our country's story to her citizens. 
   To Ken Foss's family, to his father and mother, to his brother, to his countless friends, to his colleagues in the Senate, certainly he will be missed by all of us. We deeply appreciate his dedication to the Senate. We wish to extend our condolences and sincere sympathies to his family and to his friends. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. NICKLES. I want to be clear. The Governors do not want us micromanaging their health care. The Governors, frankly, do not want us driving up health care costs. The Governors do not want to have a bill that is not really for patients rights, but rather for trial lawyers' rights. It would be great for lawsuits, but it would be terrible for health care. It basically would have people dropping health care all across the country because, not only do you sue HMOs, but you sue employers as well. Maybe many people have missed that part of the debate. 
   The Kennedy bill says, let's sue employers. If your health care is not good enough, sue your employers. The employers say: We do not have to provide health care; we are going to drop it. Employees, I hope you take care of it on your own. If you want to increase the number of uninsured, pass the Kennedy bill. This amendment would strike the provision. I think it would be very positive for health care in America.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we are coming to closure on this bill. I think the procedure is that now the Democrats, if we continue our alternation, have a second-degree amendment which will be offered to the underlying amendment, and we will consider that. We will vote on it. Then it is our expectation that we will have the passage of the substitute amendment, to be offered by Senator LOTT on behalf of us, that will be wrapping up some of the changes we made to S. 326 in the consideration of this bill. 
   We will offer that immediately following disposition of the Democrat amendment, and that will be the final  vote of the evening. At least that is our expectation. For Members' information, we will be voting on the next amendment no later than 6:50, hopefully before 6:50. Then it is our intention to vote on final passage no later than an hour or 2 hours after that. That would be closer to 9. 
   It is our hope that we can shave off some time and have final passage much closer to 8 than 9. Members can plan accordingly. Please plan on two more votes, one on the Democrat amendment, which will be offered momentarily, and then basically the final passage or the Republican wraparound amendment--we might call it that--or a substitute. It would incorporate all the changes we have made on the floor to S. 326. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the clarification made by our colleague from Tennessee. My colleague from Tennessee said we have this appeal process which applies to all plans, State-regulated plans as well as federally regulated plans, and that is very important. For people to say this would not have an appeal process, it would not apply to them, they are absolutely wrong. Any employer plan in the country would, from the internal and external appeal under the bill which hopefully we will be passing shortly. 
   For the information of our colleagues, we are going to be voting in the next minute or two on the pending amendment, and then we will take final action on the substitute that will be offered by Senator LOTT and myself and others. We expect to be voting on that, just for the information of our colleagues, by 8:15, hopefully no later than 8:30. We are going to be wrapping this up. 
   I have one final comment. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the pending amendment. The pending amendment deals with continuity of care, all of which we support, but it tells the States: We don't care what you are doing. It is another one of these examples of we know better, we can define continuity of care better from Washington, DC, than the States. That is a serious mistake. 
   In addition to overruling State laws, it also takes away an existing right under ERISA. It eliminates injunctive relief which would apply to everybody in the plan. It eliminates class action and injunctive relief on page 8 in the amendment. I do not know why they put it in. It is wrong. It is in the amendment. A person can go to court and say: I am entitled to the benefit under the plan, and the judge can agree, but the court can only agree for that one individual. It cannot agree for all the participants in that plan. That is a violation of current law which takes away rights in existing law. It is a serious mistake and should not be allowed. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the underlying amendment. 
   I yield back the remainder of our time. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.

We had countless meetings and a lot of people, a lot of staff, put in a lot of effort. This was an effort that we felt very strongly about because we wanted to improve the quality of health care without increasing costs and increasing the number of uninsured, and I think we have done it.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues and, frankly, the entire Senate for a very good debate. 
   I believe we came up with a very good bill. I think we passed a bill that will improve health care quality. We passed a bill for anybody in America who has an employer-sponsored plan to have an appeal, an appeal that will be decided by doctors, despite some of the advertisements we have seen, appeals that are decided by experts, by doctors. That is binding and that is real. So I hope that maybe some of the rhetoric will tone down a little bit and we will look at what is in it. 
   We also didn't do damage. We didn't say we are going to turn over health care plans to the Health Care Financing Administration. We are not going to duplicate State regulation. We will not confuse the States and say, no matter what you have done, Washington knows better. We didn't make those mistakes. 
   We didn't astronomically increase health care costs. We didn't pass a bill that would increase the number of uninsured by a couple million. 
   Final comment on the President. I hope the President decides not to play politics and say: We are going to veto that bill; it doesn't do what I want it to do. 
   I hope he will work with us to pass a positive bill that will benefit and improve health care quality for all Americans. If he wants to play politics, that is his choice. If he wants to, then we don't have to have a bill. It is up to him. If he wants to help us pass a good bill, I think we can do so, that would improve health care quality for all Americans. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time, and I ask for the yeas and nays on the bill.

I have already stated that I very much respect and appreciate the tenor of the debate that we had throughout this week with proponents and opponents of the legislation we just passed, including Senator KENNEDY, Senator REID, Senator DASCHLE, and others. I think we had an excellent debate. 
   I also want to thank my colleagues who really did work hard, and especially I thank Senator JEFFORDS for his leadership, and Senator COLLINS, Senator FRIST, and all the members of the task force. They did a fantastic job. 
   In addition to the Senators I just mentioned, I want to thank other members of the task force, including Senator HAGEL from Nebraska, the Presiding Officer of the Senate, Senator SANTORUM, and other Senators who worked so hard. 
   Also, Senator ENZI joined us and did a fantastic job on the floor, as well as in the Health Committee. 
   A lot of people put in a lot of time and effort, and a lot of staff members worked very hard on both the majority side and the minority side. I want to recognize a few. 
   First, from my staff, I thank Stacey Hughes and Megan Hauck. Eric Ueland, Hazen Marshall, and Mark Kirk did a fantastic job. 
   In addition, I want to recognize some staff members from other staffs who probably spent more time in the last year and a half working on this issue than any other issue. I can assure you that in the last month, and in particular the last 2 weeks, this has been a full-time job, including Saturday and Sunday, and late nights almost every night: With Senator COLLINS, Priscilla Hanley; Senator DEWINE, Helen Rhee; Senator ENZI, Chris Spear, Ray Geary, and Jen Woodbury; Senator FRIST, Anne Phelps and Sue Ramthun did a fantastic job on a number of provisions; Senator GRAMM, Mike Solon; Senator GREGG, Alan Gilbert; Senator HAGEL, Steve Irizarry; Senator HUTCHINSON, Kate Hull; Senator JEFFORDS, Paul Harrington, who did a fantastic job both in the Health Committee and also on the floor, and Kim Monk, Tom Valuck, and Carole Vannier did a fantastic job; Senator LOTT, Sharon Soderstrom and Keith Hennessy; Senator CRAIG, Michael Cannon; Senator ROTH, Kathy Means, Dede Spitznagel, and Bill Sweetnam; Senator SANTORUM, Peter Stein; Senator SESSIONS, Rick Deeborn, and Libby Rolfe. 
   This is an understatement because these staff members worked very hard. 
   In additional, I wish to recognize Senator GRAMM, who worked on this task force, and was the primary promoter of the medical savings account, which is a very important thing for bringing tax equity and relief. 
   I have already mentioned Senator ROTH helped us, as well as his staff. Senator GREGG, who led the fight, frankly, against having a propensity for lawsuits, did a fantastic job; Senator HUTCHINSON, and Senator SESSIONS. 
   This was not an easy effort. It was a challenge. I think it was a good effort, and I think we produced a good bill because we had a lot of Senators who were willing to spend a lot of time trying to improve the quality of health care in America. 
   I hope the President will not look at the rhetoric that was sometimes on the floor, but will look to the substance of the legislation and work with us to see that it will become the law of the land. 
   My thanks to Senator JEFFORDS and others who worked so hard to make this happen. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we are going to be voting on this amendment probably in another 10 minutes. I urge my colleagues to vote no for all the reasons that have been so amply discussed by my colleague, Senator HAGEL, just a moment ago, and Senator COLLINS earlier, Senator GRAMM, Senator ENZI, and others. 
   They are exactly right. We should not have ``one size fits all'' or ``Government knows best.'' 
   There are a couple other reasons why they should vote against the KENNEDY amendment. It is a big tax increase. I look at page 14, section (H) and there is a tax increase, a tax increase that boils down to about $3.5 billion over the next 10 years. Section (I) on page 14 is a tax increase that is $1.2 billion over 10 years. Section (J), page 16, another tax increase of $288 million over 10 years. If you add all that together, this amendment we will be voting on increases taxes by $5 billion. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.  
   I thank my friend and colleague from Vermont. I compliment him for his outstanding leadership.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, just a couple comments on the underlying amendment. I am always kind of amazed with the philosophy of saying, well, millions of people are not protected, as if the States have not been doing a good job. It is as if saying to the States: We don't care what you have done, it is not good enough. Senator KENNEDY has decided you haven't done good enough. HCFA should be running your health care plans. States need not apply. States, don't bother. We know better. The Federal Government knows better. HCFA, the Health Care Financing Administration, basically should be running your health care plans. 
   We don't care what you have done, States. We don't care if 42 States have already passed a health care bill of rights or 50 States already have consumer grievance procedures or 47 States already have a ban on gag clauses. We are going to pass things that supersede what you have done. We know what is best. 
   The Health Care Financing Administration has done a crummy job, frankly, in administering rules dealing with home health care. We have home health care problems all across the country. A lot of it is because of HCFA. Or HCFA is getting information out to Medicare--which we passed in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. They are supposed to give seniors information. They have not done it. Yet we are going to transfer the entire regulatory authority of all the health insurance plans of America over to this governmental agency? To a bunch of bureaucrats thinking they can do a better job than all the States? I do not think so. 
   If people are somewhat familiar with the labyrinth of regulations dealing with insurance plans, if we pass the Kennedy bill, as now proposed, the amendment that is before us, this is the kind of regulatory scheme we are going to have. 
   You talk about duplication, you talk about confusion, you talk about almost an impossibility if the State has a plan--wait a minute, do we comply with Federal regulations dealing with the bill of rights or do we comply with the State, or do we comply with the State ban on gag clauses or ours? Somebody says, well, if there is confusion, we will have HCFA decide. HCFA will decide, the Government will decide, the Federal Government will decide. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment. In addition, I would like to let my colleagues know there is $5 billion worth of new taxes in this amendment that is before us. If you want to increase taxes by another $5 billion, vote in favor of the Kennedy amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, one, I understand some of my colleagues made the statement, what about a blue slip? If we pass a tax cut, won't the House of Representatives automatically blue-slip it? For those people who are not aware of what that means--and probably a lot of people watching do not have the faintest idea what that means and what that has to do with health care--the idea of a blue slip is that the Constitution of the United States says: All revenue measures must originate in the House. If the Senate originates a tax cut or revenue measure, the House can refuse to take it. They can blue-slip it and not have it go anywhere. We do not plan on having that on this particular bill. We have seen it before. 
   I might mention, in the unanimous-consent agreement that was agreed to, that outlined the procedures for the bill. We agreed:  
   That following passage of the bill, should the bill upon passage contain any revenue blue slip matter, the bill remain at the Desk; that when the Senate receives the House companion bill, the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of the Senate-passed bill be inserted in lieu thereof, and the bill, as amended, be passed; and that the Senate insist on its amendment and request a conference with the House, all without any intervening action or debate.  
   What that means is, obviously, we knew in the Senate bill it was our intention to deal with tax issues because we want to increase access; we want to improve access; we want to increase the number of people who are insured. Unfortunately, our colleagues' bill, the Democrat bill, the Kennedy bill, will increase the number of people who are uninsured. It is estimated by people to increase the number of uninsured by 1.8 million, maybe 2 million people who would lose their insurance. We don't want to do that. 
   I stated on the floor of the Senate, maybe 2 years ago, that whatever we did we should do no harm, we should not increase health care costs, and we should not increase the number of uninsured. We should be doing just the opposite. We should be increasing the number of insured. 
   In the amendment the Senator from Maine has offered, we have given a tax credit for people with long-term health care, a provision I believe and I hope and expect will improve the access to long-term health care, which is a problem for millions of Americans. That will improve it dramatically. It will be a very positive change. 
   I compliment my friend and colleague from Maine for basically saying: We want this in our bill. Long-term health care is a very significant problem. There are a lot of people going into nursing homes and they are going bankrupt or their families are going bankrupt trying to take care of loved ones in nursing homes. 
   Shouldn't we do something to address that? In the Tax Code we have incentives to help with health care, rather significant incentives. Large corporations get to deduct 100 percent. Unfortunately, the self-employed only get to deduct 45 percent. We have already addressed that. That was one of the amendments 
   we agreed to yesterday, allowing 100-percent deductibility for the self-employed. That is a positive change. 
   This change, as offered by our colleague from Maine, and others, is a very positive change saying, let's give a tax deduction for people in purchasing long-term health care coverage so they will not be so dependent on their kids or their grandkids, in some cases, or other family members, so they can start working on preparing for their later years and making that available for them now. That will improve their quality of health care now, or they will be ready for it now. Most people do not do that. Most companies do not do it. Most plans do not do it. We want to encourage it. We want to jump start it. We want to make it a common option, a common fringe benefit that, frankly, right now is not there. Most people do not have it, do not think about it until it is too late, until a loved one goes into a nursing home or maybe a loved one has a real problem with Alzheimer's or something, and the expenses are very large. 
   So the provision my friend and colleague, Senator COLLINS, has offered allows individuals with no employer subsidy to deduct 100 percent of the cost of long-term care insurance and allows long-term care benefits to be offered through a cafeteria plan. 
   The estimated cost--I think somebody asked that--is $5.4 billion over 5 years and would benefit an estimated 3.8 million taxpayers. I make that clear. 
   One of my colleagues said: How is it paid for? How are you going to pay for it? What is your intention on how to pay for it? 
   We actually do intend on having some offsets. We have not introduced those yet. We will at the appropriate time. 
   I have been somewhat critical and maybe have had a little fun with my colleague, Senator KENNEDY, because he had some tax increase in some of the provisions including Superfund and others. I do not think Superfund belongs in this bill. We do plan on having some offsets at the appropriate time. We do not have to, under this UC, have them in the bill at this point or else my colleague could make a point of order on it. That is not allowed in the unanimous consent agreement that was already reached by both sides, and so I just mention that. 
   But at the appropriate time we expect to have an offset. Even if we did not have an offset, the bill would not pass the Senate; it would be held at the desk until we received the appropriate vehicle from the House of Representatives. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, one of the big concerns many of us have with the underlying legislation of the so-called Kennedy bill is its cost. How much will it cost employers? How much will it cost employees? What will it cost employees in lost wages? If employers have to pay increased costs for health insurance, are they not paying their employees as much as they would pay them? 
   Health care costs a lot. Many of us would say health care already costs too much. It is unaffordable for millions of Americans. They would like to have it. We have 43 million uninsured Americans today. Most of those Americans, I imagine, would like to be insured but they cannot afford it. So health care already costs too much. Unfortunately, the bill proposed by Senator Kennedy and many of the Democrats would make it worse. They would make the insurance a lot more expensive and therefore less affordable. As a result, millions of Americans would probably lose their health care insurance. We think that would be a mistake. 
   I said yesterday we should make sure we do no harm. We should not increase the number of uninsured. I am afraid the Kennedy bill, with its estimated increase of cost of 6.1 percent over and above the inflation already expected, would increase the number of uninsured by what is estimated to be about 1.8 million persons. That is too many. That is far too many. So the amendment I will be sending to the desk, as soon as I get a copy of it, will say we should not increase the cost of health insurance by more than 1 percent. If we do, the provisions of the bill are null and void. 
   Let's not do any damage. Let's make sure at the outset we say very plainly we are not going to increase the cost of health care by more than 1 percent. Let's not increase the number of uninsured by over 100,000. If we do that, we have done harm, we have done damage, we have done more damage than good. 
   Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of myself, Senator GRAMM, and Senator COLLINS, and I ask for its immediate consideration.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, let me back up a little bit and bring our colleagues, and maybe the public, up to speed as far as where we are because, from a parliamentary procedure standpoint, this is getting maybe a little bit confusing. 
   The Republicans offered as the underlying vehicle the so-called Kennedy bill, S. 6, the Patients' Bill of Rights. We did it because we wanted to expose that it has a lot of expensive provisions that, frankly, need to be deleted. 
   The Democrats offered a substitute yesterday, the Republicans' Patients' Bill of Rights Plus that was reported out of the HELP Committee. They offered that as a substitute. 
   Then Senator DASCHLE, on behalf of Senator KENNEDY, offered a perfecting amendment to the substitute--``the substitute'' being the Republican bill--that said that should apply in scope to all plans. The Republican plan basically applies to self-insured plans. It does not duplicate State insurance, unlike the Democrats' bill that says we do not care what the States have done; we are going to insist you do everything we have dictated. They expanded the scope. That was a first-degree perfecting amendment. 
   The Republicans offered a second-degree amendment yesterday to the underlying first-degree amendment of the Democrats on scope that says two things: One, we think the primary function of regulating insurance should be maintained by the States. That was in the findings of the bill. And then in the legislative language: We should expand access and coverage to health care plans. 
   When the Democrats were so kind as to offer the Republican bill as a substitute, they forgot to offer our tax provisions. We included one of the tax provisions which we included in our Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, and that is 100 percent deductibility for the self-employed. We will be voting on that, and that will be the first vote this afternoon. We will probably be voting on that at the conclusion of Senator SMITH's statement or shortly thereafter. I expect that votes will occur on that sometime after 3 o'clock, maybe closer to 3:30. 
   The Democrats then were entitled to a second-degree amendment, and Senator GRAHAM of Florida offered a second-degree amendment dealing with emergency rooms. Senator HUTCHINSON and Senator FRIST debated against that and stated they would come up  with an alternative dealing with emergency rooms. That will be 
   voted on at some later point in the debate. 
   This afternoon we will have a debate on the Republican amendment dealing with 100-percent deductibility of self-employed persons, and we will have a vote on the Graham amendment dealing with the emergency room provision, and then the next amendment we will actually vote on, depending on whether or not either of these second-degree amendments is adopted, will be to the amendment tree or the side to which I just sent an amendment. 
   I sent an amendment to the first-degree amendment on the so-called Kennedy bill. This amendment says, whatever we do, let's not increase health care costs by more than 1 percent or increase the number of uninsured by over 100,000. It is very simple and very plain: Congress, don't do it; whatever you do, whatever mandates you are considering--and we recognize and applaud everybody for having good intentions--let's do no harm; let's not increase health care costs by more than 1 percent; let's not increase the number of uninsured by over 100,000. 
   If the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that it would increase costs by that amount or increase the number of uninsured by that amount, then the underlying bill will not take effect. 
   Those are the basic provisions of the bill. I hope and expect all of our colleagues will support this amendment. I urge its adoption. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to respond just a little bit to our colleague from North Dakota who said: Well, the Democrat bill would only increase costs by $1 a month. CBO says --I just read the CBO report. CBO does not say it. Or if my colleague would show me where it says that, I would be happy to maybe consume that page on the floor of the Senate. I don't know, but I read rather quickly. Maybe I missed it. I read fairly fast. 
   But the section I am looking at in CBO says--this is talking about the Patients' Bill of Rights, S. 6:  
   Most of the provisions would reach their full effect within the first 3 years after enactment. CBO estimates the premiums for employer-sponsored health care plans would rise by an average of 6.1 percent in the absence of any compensating changes on the part of employers.  
   That is 6.1 percent. The annual premium for health insurance for a family, according to Peat Marwick, in 1998, in an employer survey, was $5,800. And 6.1 percent of that is $355 per year. 
   If you divide that by 12, it is almost $30 a month--not $1 a month; $30 a month. That is not even close. 
   So I make mention of this. Again, I think people are entitled to their own opinion; they are not entitled to their own facts. 
   If CBO says this Kennedy bill only increases costs by $1 a month, I would like to see where it is. I just read the report--April 23, 1999. It says: 6.1 percent. 
   That is a fairly big difference. When I am saying the cost is almost $30 a month--$29.50 a month--versus $1 a month, we have a little difference. I am using CBO. Maybe my colleague from North Dakota reads it a little differently. 
   I think that is a rather significant difference: $30 a month will price a lot of people out of health insurance. This additional 6-percent increase, on top of the 9-percent increase which is already projected, is going to put a lot of people in the uninsured category. We don't want to do that. We should do no harm. We shouldn't put millions of people in the uninsured category. 
   I refer, again, to the CBO report, because I heard my colleague from Massachusetts assert that this will only cost a family one Big Mac a month. I don't know if he is using CBO, but we are using CBO. CBO says S. 6, the Patients' Bill of Rights, the Kennedy bill, will increase health care premiums by 6.1 percent, resulting in an $8 billion reduction in Social Security payroll taxes over the next 10 years. This is in the report. If Social Security taxes are going down by $8 billion, that means total payroll goes down over that same period of time by $64 billion, total payroll reduction. 
   Employers are going to say: Wait a minute, if you are driving up my health care costs, I can't pay you as much. I am going to pay you less or we will offset this reduction. 
   That is CBO. That is not the Republican organization. That is not DON NICKLES penciling it in. This is CBO, a nonpartisan group, saying there is $64 billion in lost wages if we pass the Kennedy bill. That is a whole lot of Big Macs. That is 32 billion Big Macs, if they cost $2 apiece. That isn't one Big Mac. As Senator GRAMM said, you can buy the McDonald's franchises for that. I expect you could. 
   For people who say the cost impact of the Kennedy bill is trivial and it would do no damage, if they believe that, have them vote for this amendment. I hope they will vote for this amendment. 
   We should do no harm. We should not increase the cost of health care by more than 1 percent. Shame on us if we do. We should do no harm. We should not increase the number of uninsured. We should not be passing bills that make matters worse. Let's work on quality. Let's improve access. Let's make sure more people have health  care. Let's not do just the opposite. Let's not uninsure a couple million people by increasing the cost of health care so dramatically, as the Kennedy bill would do. That is the purpose of our amendment. 
   I compliment my colleague from Texas, who has been working on this amendment as the principal cosponsor with me, and also my colleague from Maine who spoke so eloquently on it earlier. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to make a couple more comments. I think some people have been loose with facts on saying the Kennedy bill would only cost $1 a month. One Member said it would only cost one Big Mac a month. That is absolutely, totally false. 
   I have been looking at the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate of the Kennedy bill, S. 6, the Patients' Bill of Rights of 1999. I will read a couple of provisions. If this report is wrong, I wish to be corrected. Members are making statements that it will only cost $2 a month, or one hamburger a month--unless they are buying that hamburger in Cape Cod or Hyannis Port. Maybe that is $30 a month. It is not a Big Mac in Oklahoma.  
   Page 3 of the CBO report says most of the provisions would reach the full effect within the first 3 years after enactment. CBO estimates the premiums for employer-sponsored health care plans would rise by an average of 6.1 percent in the absence of any compensating changes on the part of employers. 
   What would the compensating changes be? CBO says, on page 4, employers could drop health insurance entirely if we pass the Kennedy bill. Employers could drop health insurance entirely, which I am afraid many would do. They could reduce the generosity of the benefit package, according to CBO, increase the cost sharing by beneficiaries, or increase the employee's share of the premium. 
   This is CBO. This is not just DON NICKLES. This is not some right-wing conspiracy. They are saying if health care costs are increased this much, some employers will drop plans. Some employers will say employees have to pay a lot more. Some employers will come up with cheaper plans. CBO said some will reduce the generosity of the benefit package, come up with cheaper plans, not cover so much. 
   I thought the purpose of the bill was to improve health care quality, not come up with cheaper plans, not come up with fewer plans, not come up with greater uninsured. That is what CBO is saying increased costs would be. 
   How much would it cost? Again, I am a stickler for having facts. What is the estimated budgetary impact of the Kennedy bill? CBO says it would reduce Social Security payroll taxes by about $8 billion over the next 10 years, reducing Social Security payroll taxes by $8 billion. That means total payroll goes down by $64 billion. That is a big reduction. That is a lot of money coming out. That is a lot of money that people won't receive in wages, according to the CBO, because Congress passed a bill. Congress said: We know better; we should micromanage health care from Washington, DC. The net result is lost wages of $64 billion. That is not one Big Mac per month. 
   What is the cost per month? Family premium for health insurance, according to Peat Marwick: $5,826 in 1998; 6.1 percent of that is $355 per year. 
   That is right at $30 per month an employer would pay. What does CBO say the employer would do if they were saddled with those kinds of increases? They would drop plans, drop health insurance entirely, reduce the generosity of the benefit package, increase cost sharing by beneficiaries, or increase the employees' share of the premium. 
   We should use facts. The cost of the Kennedy bill is not one Big Mac; it is about $30 a month for a family plan. According to CBO, I am afraid a couple of million people, at least 1.8 million people, would lose the insurance they already have. We should not do that. That would be a serious mistake.

   Mr. NICKLES. Even higher than that. I think the estimate I have, that was done by the National Survey of the Employee-Sponsored Health Care Plans, Mercer, which is probably one of the biggest actuaries in health care, estimates a 9-percent increase for next year in health care costs. So if you put 6.1 percent on top of that, that is a 15-percent increase in health care costs for next year.

   Mr. NICKLES. I would like to make a few comments. I will not address the amendment that was just sent to the desk, but I would like to respond to my colleague. 
   First, I started to call Senator FRIST. Sometimes I call him because we need help on the floor to debate things, such as medical necessity or other medical procedures. This time I thought I would call him because I thought we might need him because I was afraid somebody might have a heart attack getting so excited in the debate. 
   But let me just touch on a couple of comments that my good friend and colleague, Senator KENNEDY, made. He said: Enough about this cost stuff. He said: That was done by some study that was bought and paid for by the insurance companies. 
   Correct me if I am wrong, but I stand corrected if the Congressional Budget Office is bought and paid for by the insurance companies. If so, I would like to know it. I am not aware of that. 
   My colleague alluded to the fact that Republicans are bought and paid for. He was close to getting a rule invoked. I do not think he meant to say that. I will let that go. 
   I am not going to make allusions that trial lawyers have bought one side or that the unions have bought one side, although he did mention that the unions support his bill. It just happens to be that the unions are exempt from his bill. That is interesting. They are exempt for the duration of their contracts. 
   So his bill basically tells every private employer: You have to rewrite your contract next year, except for unions. Oh, 
   if you have unions, you don't have to redo it until the end of your contract. If the contract is for 4 years, you don't have to touch it for 4 years. But anybody else, you rewrite it next year. 
   Maybe that is the reason the unions have signed on. Maybe there are other reasons or other special interest groups that have gotten into his bill. 
   But back to the cost. My colleague says: Well, it is only 1 percent per year. CBO says the cost would be 6 percent when it is fully implemented in 3 years--not 5 years. So Senator KENNEDY is able to say: Well, we think it is about 5 percent over 5 years; therefore, it is a 1-percent per year cost increase. And employees only pay 20 percent, which is how he gets his one Big Mac per month. It just does not work. It does not equate. The bill, when fully implemented, is 6.1 percent. That is in 3 years, and the cost is $355 per year. 
   If that happens, you are going to have a lot of people, according to CBO--not some study financed by the insurance companies--who are going to lose their coverage, a lot of people who are going to get less quality coverage, people who are going to have to pay a greater percentage of the coverage, people who are going to have to pay a greater percentage of the premiums if we pass the Kennedy bill. That is the bad news. The good news is we are not going to pass it. 
   But I think we have to stay with the facts. The facts are that the Kennedy bill increases costs dramatically and increases the number of uninsured dramatically. That would be a serious mistake. That is something we are not going to allow to happen. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we were in the process of debating the Robb amendment dealing with mandatory length of stays for mastectomies. That is a second-degree amendment to an amendment I offered on behalf of myself, Senator GRAMM, and Senator COLLINS that had a limitation on the cost. The cost of the underlying bill cannot exceed 1 percent, nor could it increase the costs or increase the number of uninsured by over 100,000 or the bill would not be in effect. 
   Senator ROBB's amendment strikes the amendment that limits the 1-percent cost. It is our intention to finish the debate on the Robb amendment. We will vote on the Robb amendment, and it will be our intention for the Republican side to offer a second-degree amendment. We will debate that amendment and vote on it and work our way through the amendments that have been stacked today. 
   I ask the Parliamentarian how much time remains on the Robb amendment?

   Mr. NICKLES. The Senator from Massachusetts says it is the same amendment offered in committee, but that is not factual. The Senator can correct me if I am wrong, but this amendment deals with Superfund. This amendment deals with transferring money from general revenue into Social Security. That was not offered in committee. There are few tax provisions in here. I asked somebody: What is this extension of taxes on page 17? My staff tells me it is a tax increase of $6.7 billion on Superfund. I don't know what that has to do with breast cancer, but it is a tax increase on Superfund. 
   I know we need to reauthorize Superfund. I didn't know we were going to do it on this bill. I stated in the past we are not going to pass the Superfund extension until we reauthorize it. We should do the two together. Why are we doing it on this bill? 
   So there are tax increases in here that nobody has looked at. They did not do that in the Labor Committee or the health committee, I do not think. I asked the Chairman of the committee. I don't think they passed tax increases on Superfund. That does not belong in the HELP Committee. 
   Certainly transferring money from the general revenue fund, as this bill does, into the Social Security trust fund, was not done in the HELP Committee, I do not think. It should not have been done. My guess is the Finance Committee might have some objections. Senator ROTH is going to be on the floor saying: Wait a minute, what is going on? 
   So there is a lot of mischief in these amendments. Some of us have not had enough time. One of the crazy things about this agreement is we are going to have amendments coming at us quickly. We have to have a little time to study them. Sometimes we find some things stuck in the amendments which some of us might have some objections with. 
   I want to make a couple of comments on the amendment. In addition to the big tax increases hidden in the bill, this amendment also strikes the underlying amendment that many of us have proposed on this side that says, whatever we should do we should do no harm. If we are going to increase premiums by over 1 percent; let us not do a bill. Maybe people forgot about that, but that is an amendment we offered earlier. This amendment, the Robb amendment, says, let's strike that provision. We do not care how much the Kennedy bill costs. 
   Some of us do care how much it costs. We do not want to put millions of people into the ranks of the uninsured. We do not want to do harm. Unfortunately, the amendment proposed by Senator ROBB and others would do that. It would strike that provision. It would eliminate that provision. 
   On the issue of breast cancer and mastectomy and lumpectomy and so on, Senator FRIST has addressed it a little bit. Senator SNOWE and others will be offering an amendment that is related and, I will tell you, far superior to the amendment we have on the floor. 
   I do not know if we will get to it tonight. Certainly, we will get to it tomorrow. It is a much better amendment. It is an amendment that has been thought out. It is an amendment that does not have Superfund taxes in it. It is an amendment that includes, as this bill does, transfers from the general revenue fund into the Social Security trust. 
   I urge my colleagues at the appropriate time to vote ``no'' on the Robb amendment, and then let's adopt the underlying amendment which says we should not increase health care costs by more than 1 percent; let's not do damage to the system; let's not put people into the ranks of uninsured by playing games, maybe trying to score points with one group or another group. Let's not do that. Let's not make those kinds of mistakes. 
   If people have serious concerns dealing with breast cancer and how that should be treated, again, Senator SNOWE, Senator ABRAHAM, and Senator FRIST have an amendment they have worked on for some time that I believe is much better drafted. It does not have Superfund taxes in it. It does not have a transfer of general revenue funds into the Social Security trust fund. It does not make these kinds of mistakes that we have, unfortunately, with this pending amendment.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute on the bill. 
   The Senator from Pennsylvania is right. The whole essence of the second-degree amendment is to kill the underlying amendment because the Senator from Massachusetts does not want to say we will not increase costs by more than 1 percent, because, frankly, he wants to, and expects to, increase costs by 5 or 6 percent. The net result of that will be to uninsure a couple million people, half of which could be women, half of which will not get those exams, half of which will not get those screenings, half of which will not get the care they need. That is the purpose of the amendment. 
   In the process, he also increases Superfund taxes and also comes up with general transfers of money from the general revenue fund to the Social Security fund. That is a mistake. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote no and keep in mind that in dealing with breast cancer, Senator SNOWE, Senator FRIST, and Senator ABRAHAM will offer a much better proposal later in this debate. I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we have now disposed of the Democrats' second-degree amendment to the first-degree amendment proposed by the Republicans, which first-degree amendment would limit the cost of the Kennedy health care bill to 1 percent. Now I have sent a second-degree amendment up under the unanimous consent agreement. Each side could offer a second-degree. 
   The amendment I sent to the desk on behalf of Senators FRIST, JEFFORDS, and others, is a very important amendment, so I hope all of our colleagues will listen to it. The amendment would strike the medical necessity definition that was in the Kennedy bill and replace it with the grievance/appeals process we have in our bill. In other words, it is a very significant amendment, one that we had significant discussion on last week. Some of our colleagues said they really wanted to vote on it last week. We will get to vote on it, depending on the majority leader's intention. If the time runs on this amendment, all time would be used, and we would probably be ready for a vote at about 6:40. Of course, it would be the majority leader's call whether or not to have a vote. 
   The amendment deals with medical necessity. It replaces the definition in the Kennedy bill with the grievance and appeals process that we have in the Republican package, which I think is a far superior package as far as improving the quality of care. I compliment Senator JEFFORDS, Senator FRIST, and others for putting this together. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I was trying to make sure our colleagues understand the procedure in the Senate. When you have colloquies, you go through the Chair. I have noticed some colloquies on this side have bypassed the Chair. Some colloquies on that side have bypassed the Chair. That is not the rule of the Senate. It is important we have discussions according to the rules of the Senate. That is the way we should do it. That way, we do not freeze out other colleagues who want to participate in colloquies. I was not trying to get under my colleagues' skin. It is important we follow the rules of the Senate. 
   I want to point out that a couple of the statements made by our colleagues are actually very inaccurate. Actually who pays for the plans and entities are very similar in both bills. Under the Democrat bill, S. 6, on page 66: A plan or insurer shall be conducted under contract between the plan or insurer in one or more qualified external appeals entities. 
   That is page 66. 
   Under the Republican bill, it is the same thing, the plan selects the entity. They do not select the person who does the review, they select the entity. The entity is licensed by the State, or it is a State agency established for that purpose, or it is an entity with a contract with the Federal Government and they have the reviewers. 
   My point is, both the Democrat plan and the Republican plan select the entities. They are the same. For them to say, oh, the Republican plan selects the reviewer is false. The Democrat plan, as well as the Republican plan pay for the entities, they select 
   the entities, and the entities themselves are independent, and the entities select the individual reviewer. 
   There is a little--I do not want to use the word ``hypocrisy''; it is not a word I often use on the floor. But to be railing against the Republican plan, not stating the facts, and then say, oh, by the way; oh, the Democrat plan, the plan selects the entities as well, I just find it to be very inconsistent. 
   I urge my colleagues to see that in the Republican plan, the proposal we have before us, we say the plans select the entity, and the entity is a qualified entity if it is an independent external reviewer and credentialed by the State or a State agency established for the purpose of conducting the external review, or it is an entity under contract with the Federal Government, or it is an entity accredited as an independent external review entity by an accrediting body recognized by the Secretary of HHS. 
   I just mention that. It is important we be consistent and that people understand on both sides, the Democrat proposal selects an entity very similar to that of the Republican proposal. 
   I yield the floor.

He happens to be factually wrong. I would like to have the RECORD be clear. We ought to be stating facts and we ought to be stating the truth. What he said was not correct. They do not like our bill, either. They have not supported our bill. 
   My colleague from Massachusetts earlier said they wrote our bill. He is absolutely wrong. I just want to make sure people have the facts. 
   Mr. President, I will yield back the remainder of our time. 
   First, I ask unanimous consent that at the expiration of debate time on the pending amendment, votes occur on the following pending amendments: amendment No. 1238, medical necessity, that is the pending amendment; the next amendment would be amendment No. 1236, which is the cost cap, limiting it to 1 percent; the next amendment would be amendment No. 1235 which deals with emergency rooms, by Senator GRAHAM; the next amendment would be amendment No. 1234, deductibility for the self-employed; and the next amendment would be amendment No. 1233, dealing with the scope. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that following the first vote, there be 4 minutes equally divided for closing remarks prior to the beginning of each vote.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, just to correct my colleague from Rhode Island, he said the cost of the Kennedy bill is about $2 a month. That is not correct. That is not in CBO's report. CBO says most of the provisions would take full effect within the first 3 years, not 5 years; not 1 percent, but a total of 6.1 percent. That is S. 6. That is what we are debating. That is what we are amending. 
   We are saying that costs shouldn't increase by more than 1 percent. 
   The Congressional Budget Office says the total costs would be $8 billion in lost Social Security taxes and total lost wages would be $64 billion. That is not a McDonald's hamburger. That is $64 billion in lost wages, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That is not a Republican insurance study. That was the Congressional Budget Office that said people would lose $64 billion in lost wages. 
   They also said as a result of the Kennedy amendment that people would drop insurance entirely; would reduce the generosity of health benefit packages; they would increase cost sharing by beneficiaries. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.

   Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I will speak in general about the bill and maybe correct some statements that I believe are factually incorrect. I think it is important to deal with facts. 
   I have heard a lot of opinions. I heard that the Republican bill that many of us worked together on was a shell. I am kind of offended by that, I mention to my colleague. 
   First, let me say, when we are considering health care, we should make sure we don't do any damage. We should do no harm. Maybe we should repeat the physicians' Hippocratic oath: Do no harm. 
   When I look at the proposal of Senator KENNEDY, the Democrats' bill, I see it doing a lot of harm. If that bill was enacted, a lot of people would become uninsured. That is harm. As a matter of fact, it is estimated as many as 1.8 million, almost 2 million, people would become uninsured if we passed his bill. We already have 43 million uninsured Americans. Let's not add to it. Let's not make it worse. Unfortunately, I think that is what would happen. 
   We shouldn't be dramatically increasing health care costs. That is not going to help solve the problem. Cost is a big problem. We had a little press conference today. We had several self-employed people who said: I can't afford health insurance. One said they didn't have it. One said they barely had it and, if the cost went way up, they would lose it. They would have to cancel it for themselves and their employees. We don't want to do that. That is doing harm. That is doing damage. That is doing damage, frankly, to the best health care system in the world. I am not saying the health care system we have in the country today is perfect. Does it make mistakes? You bet. Can we make it better? Sure we can. Let's do that. 
   But I don't think we make it better by coming up with a whole laundry list of Federal mandates stacked on top, duplicating State mandates, saying: The Federal Government knows best. Yes, this is going to cost you a lot of money. Oh, yes, Mr. Employer, you can be sued. The employer saying: Thank you very much, but I don't have to provide this benefit in the first place and, if you are going to sue me for it, I will just drop it. I hope my employees take care of their health care needs on their own. I will give them a little money. I hope they do it. 
   You and I know, in many cases they won't do it. We shouldn't do harm; we shouldn't do damage to the system. 
   I heard my colleagues, from Massachusetts and from Nevada, say: Well, our bill doesn't cost much. It costs about the cost of a cheeseburger, maybe a cheeseburger and fries. 
   Let's look at the reality. The Congressional Budget Office says the Kennedy bill would increase health care costs by 6.1 percent. I understand they may amend it to make it 4.8 percent. What people haven't caught onto is, that is in addition to health care inflation that is already in the system. The cost of health care is going up. It is estimated to go up 9 percent, by a national survey of plans by William Mercer. So health care costs are going up 8 or 9 percent. You add another 5 or 6 percent on top of it, that means if we pass the Kennedy bill, health care costs will be up by 15 percent. What if it is 14 percent? I think that is too high. I think if health care costs go up that percentage, you are going to have a lot more people uninsured. 
   Then what about: Well, it only costs as much as a Big Mac. I have the greatest respect for Senator KENNEDY, but I do not know how good his math is. Let me use some people who are pretty good at math, the Congressional Budget Office. They are not Democrats. They are not Republicans. They're not people who say: Let's come up with some bad information on the Kennedy bill. 
   They said, Senate bill 6, the Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights, will increase health care premiums by 6.1 percent, resulting in an $8 billion reduction in Social Security payroll taxes over the next 10 years, 
   an $8 billion reduction in Social Security payroll taxes. The total reduction in payroll over that period of time is $64 billion over the next 10 years. Now, $64 billion in lost wages is a lot more than a Big Mac. As a matter of fact, I think it equates to $355 more per family per year. That is not a Big Mac. That is about $30 a month. That is not $3 a month, or $2 a month, as Senator KENNEDY alluded to. That is about $30 a month. That is a big hit. That means that is $30 less that an employer will have to compensate his employees. Where does that money come from? That is real money. According to CBO, $64 billion over the next 10 years is the cost of the Kennedy bill. Where does that come from? From lost wages of employees. A whole lot of employees say: Thank you very much, Senator KENNEDY, but I want the money. Thank you, but I want to keep my health insurance. Don't price it out. 
   So I think it is funny, in a way, that I hear it will only cost $2 a month. That is not accurate. CBO says it would cost $355 per year per family. So I mention that, and I think it is important that we use facts. I think everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but they are not entitled to their own facts. The fact is that the Kennedy bill would cost families hundreds of dollars per year and would increase the number of uninsured in the millions. 
   Right now, there are 43 million uninsured Americans. That equals the population of 9 States--the population of the States that I have in yellow on the chart. If we pass the Kennedy bill, we can add 3 more States, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. The entire population of those States would be uninsured. We should not be doing that. Democrats and Republicans, from the outset, should not do any harm and we should not increase the number of uninsured. 
   Another thing we should not do is increase the complexity of plans. My friend and colleague, Senator DASCHLE sent that to the desk for Senator KENNEDY. He said we need to expand the scope, that the Republican plan only covers 48 million Americans, and we cover 161 million Americans, and those other 100 million Americans have no protections whatsoever. 
   Well, this chart, compliments of Senator GREGG from New Hampshire, shows you the complexity of the Kennedy plan. Now, this is very graphic, and I am sure anybody looking at it closely would say that looks like a mess. And it is, because what it does it, it says: States, we don't care what you have done. We know better. The Federal Government knows best. 
   Again, I have great affection and admiration for my colleague, Senator KENNEDY. He has always thought the Federal Government knows best when it comes to health care. He has always supported national health care and thought the Federal Government should write the plan and insist on the benefits. We know best, so States get out of the way. The Federal Government will tell you how to run your health care business. We don't care if you have had experience over the last 50 years in administering insurance, health care, having insurance commissioners, and having quality inspectors. We don't care if you have that. We know better. The Federal Government, HCFA, Health Care Finance Administration, knows better and should be making these decisions. 
   Under the Kennedy bill, we are going to overlay on top of all the State regulations a Federal-Government-knows-best plan. We are going to dictate that you have all these things. This little chart kind of shows the complexity of it. Health care is fairly complex anyway with State administrations. But this says we are going to overlay, on top of what the States do, complex Federal mandates. States, you must do as the Federal Government decided. 
   What if there is competition? What if the State has an emergency room provision for their State-regulated plans? We are going to say: We are sorry, but we know better, so you have to comply  with ours. The State says: We think ours is better. But we are going to have to have a Government bureaucrat who knows 
   best. Senator KENNEDY knows best, HCFA know best, the Government knows best. 
   That is the problem with the Kennedy bill. Unfortunately, in many cases, the Government doesn't know best. There are lots and lots of State mandates, and I pulled out a few on this chart. Forty-two States have a Bill of Rights. My colleague from Nevada said the Texas Governor vetoed a Bill of Rights. I see on the list that Texas has a Bill of Rights. I happen to see that Texas has a total of 42 mandates. Probably many of them--the Senator from Texas says it may be too many. It is probably increasing the cost of health care, but the State of Texas is doing it. 
   Maybe we are the source of all wisdom. I don't know what the State of Texas has, but is it really in our prerogative and our right to say: Texas, you don't know what you are doing; we know what is best. So whatever you have in your mandates, we are going to mandate something more, something more expensive. We are going to dictate to you. I think that is a mistake. 
   There is a basic difference in philosophy between Senator KENNEDY and Dr. FRIST, who will be here shortly to discuss this. I might mention, I think the plan we proposed, as far as scope is concerned--we said, let's regulate the unregulated and protect the unprotected. There were a lot of plans that aren't covered by State insurance, and we said those plans should have some basic protections, so we put them in. Those plans weren't covered by the State mandates. That is the reason we put them in there. My Democrat colleagues said they are unprotected, out of luck, as if the States have no role whatsoever. The States don't know what they are doing. HCFA knows better. HCFA is not a cure-all for health care. 
   Here is an example. On a bill that we passed last year, I have a couple comments. This was in a bill we passed:  
   HCFA, as a regulatory authority to enforce consumer protections, stands by the Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act of 1996. In States that failed to enact these provisions, according to the General Accounting Office, HCFA admits that it has ``pursued a Band-Aid or minimalist approach'' to enforcing these consumer protections. The General Accounting Office also found that HCFA lacks ``appropriate experience'' in regulating private health insurance.  
   So GAO said HCFA is not doing a very good job. The Kennedy bill says turn it all over to HCFA. We don't think the States are good enough. We are going to turn it over to HCFA and let them do it better. GAO also said that HCFA is doing a crummy job. They should not be trying to regulate insurance throughout the country. They have a big job. What about the health insurance portability bill, the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill? People have been bragging on it. It is interesting to find out that the State of Massachusetts has not yet complied. Five States have not complied. I doubt that that means the State of Massachusetts doesn't care about insurance portability. My guess is that it is probably just as portable in Massachusetts as it is in other States. But they have not met congressional criteria. Therefore, HCFA is supposed to administer their plans. Guess what? They are not doing it. They have not done it. I don't want them to do it; I will be frank. Even though that is a law we have already passed, I don't think Federal regulation of health care in Massachusetts is going to make it any better. As a matter of fact, it might make it worse. I think that might be a mistake. 
   Look at the number of health care mandates on this chart. My State of Oklahoma has 26. The State of Texas has 42. Florida has 44. States have an average, I think, of 30-some or 40. Again, is it really necessary for us to come in and say: States, thank you very much, we are sure you are well-intended, but we know better. We have decided this, and we have had hearings. Our emergency room provision has to be better than yours. Our access to specialists has to be better than yours. We don't know what yours is, but we know ours is better. A colleague showed pictures and said: Look at this child; he was denied the health care. The plan said it was not medically necessary; therefore, the child didn't get the health care. So we are going to change all the laws of all the States because somebody finds some horror stories. 
   I have said in the past that there have been mistakes. There always will be. There will be some mistakes. We have to decide what is the best way to solve the problem. Is the solution to the problem coming up with more Government mandates--a Federal Government takeover of health care, which is really, in effect, what the Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights is. Is that the solution? Or will it make it worse? Look at other countries that have really tried socialized medicine, government-controlled medicine, government dictates from A to Z. Is their health care better or worse than in the United States? 
   It is worse. It is much worse. All you need for evidence of that is people in their states continue to come to the United States for quality health care, including their leaders, and including their top officials. They want to have health care in the United States because we have the best quality health care system in the world. 
   We need to make sure that we do no harm to that system. We absolutely need to make sure that if we can make improvements on the system, let's do so, but let's not make it worse. 
   Let's not pass this government-knows-best, one-size-fits-all, Washington, DC, HCFA, you are going to run it, and that we have confidence in the government bureaucrats that we are going to hire, and solve all the problems.

   Mr. NICKLES. That is correct. I appreciate my colleague making that distinction. 
   I have a list of all of the mandates that the State of Texas has. I have a list that says 42 States have a State bill of rights. 
   I might say that those States might have a more far-reaching bill of rights than the proposal that Senator KENNEDY offers. They may; I don't know. But I happen to think they are probably a lot closer to the people in that State. I happen to think if there are complaints, they are more likely to be resolved favorably by the State regulators than they would be by bureaucrats in HCFA that have no idea of how to regulate health care plans. 
   That quote that I just read from GAO said that HCFA pursued a Band-Aid or minimus approach to enforcing consumer protections, and that HCFA lacks appropriate experience in regulating private health insurance. 
   The GAO has already studied HCFA's results, and they have failed. Yet Senator KENNEDY's bill says to States: We want HCFA to regulate their insurance.  
   I just disagree with that. I disagree with that very strongly. 
   When I see the pictures of the health care catastrophes where somebody was denied care, or somebody didn't get care, I am very 
   sympathetic to the families. But I don't think they are going to get more protection by turning it over to the Federal Government. I think, frankly, they get less.

   Mr. NICKLES. I will answer the Senator's question. No, I don't. I don't think HCFA knows the State of Oklahoma. I think HCFA is an organization that has a lot of responsibilities, and most of which are not doing a very good job--most of which haven't done a very good job, frankly, regulating Medicare. They have caused a lot of problems, as the Senator from Maine can attest to, whether you are talking about home health care, or whether you are talking about information to seniors. I know for a fact they haven't given information to seniors which was mandated by law under the Medicare changes in 1997. 
   I am looking at HCFA. I am sure there are some very good quality people who are very concerned about health care in general. But I don't want to turn over all insurance regulation to them, because GAO says they don't have appropriate experience. Frankly, I don't think they can do it as well. I know they shouldn't be doing it. I think that is a responsibility that can and should be left to the States. The States may make mistakes. Individuals may make mistakes. I want to make sure that I point this out before we see--I am sure--dozens more charts of somebody who was denied care.

   Mr. NICKLES. Let me finish this point. I haven't made this point just yet. It is important. 
   We will have countless charts showing somebody who needs a cleft pallet replaced, or somebody who has lost an arm by mistake, or somebody was not treated. Obviously, any lay person would say, Why didn't that person get health care? 
   If you pass our plan, we were going to see them and make sure they get health care. 
   The distinction that I want to make is that the bill that we have before us on the Republican proposal is that every health care plan in America has an internal appeal done by a doctor. The internal appeal is done by a doctor. It is done by a physician. If for some reason that physician still determines that it wasn't medical necessary, that physician can appeal it to an outside, independent expert to make the determination of whether or not it was medically necessary, or whether or not the treatment should go forward. 
   Hopefully that would solve the pictures, or the horror stores that we have seen. 
   It wouldn't be decided by politicians. It would be decided by an independent expert in that field who has no financial incentive whatsoever and no connection to the health insurance industry--as I heard one of my colleagues say, Oh. Yes. They are bought and paid for. That is not correct. 
   What we are offering instead of a lot of litigation and the probability that people will be dropping plans like crazy is the chance for people who need health care to get. If they are denied health care coverage, they get an appeal. If their life is threatened, or if it is dangerous, they can get it immediately, and they can get it done by an independent review board. So they get the health care they need--not get a lot of litigation, and not in the process uninsured millions of Americans.

   I might qualify part of the Senator's statement. I am not sure that States are doing an excellent job in every area. I think they will do a much better job than they would be if it is turned it over to the Federal Government. I think they would be much closer to fixing the problem, and they could fix the problem of the absence of quality. I think they can fix that much, much better than we can by dictating it from Washington, DC.

   Mr. NICKLES. To answer my colleague from Maine, the Senator is exactly right--although I say we protect the unprotected. Even in the State-regulated plans, we make sure all those plans have an appeals process. 
   ERISA, which is a national law that does deal with fiduciary standards, deals with reporting standards. We make sure there is also an appeals process that covers 124 million people. Maybe our colleagues on the other side forget that. That is a basic process which we think is much better than saying, let's go to court; you were denied coverage, let's go to court and sue. It may be 3 or 4 years and the plaintiff may eventually get something--or the trial lawyer may get most of the money. We say, instead of going that way, let's go through an appeals process. We formulate an excellent internal and external appeals process for 124 million Americans, broad based, for any employer-based plan. 
   That is a fundamental asset in our plan that will improve quality health care throughout the country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, let me outline where we are procedurally. We notified Members under the unanimous consent request that we would lay down S. 6, the so-called Kennedy bill, to mark up. The Democrats offered a substitute to that, the Republican bill that passed out of the Labor Committee, S. 326. 
   The Democrats then offered a first-degree perfecting amendment to the substitute, to the Republican bill. Their amendment dealt with scope. Their amendment says: We want the Federal Government to have far-ranging scope to overrule all State plans. All State plans must do such and such under their first-degree amendment. 
   I am offering a second-degree amendment on behalf of my colleagues. The amendment would do two things. One, it is the sense of the Senate that the States are the primary providers of health care, for good reasons. States have hundreds of mandates. We don't think the Federal Government should come in and say: We know best; Senator KENNEDY knows what is best; HCFA knows what is best; the Health Care Financing Administration should regulate all health care plans. 
   We think that would be a mistake. We don't think that, many times, the Federal Government knows best. That doesn't mean all State plans are administered perfectly. It doesn't mean that they are not without problems. We just don't think HCFA--the Health Care Financing Administration--overruling States, dictating to the States, or this Congress, or Senator KENNEDY, should be saying: States, here is what we know should be in your plan. 
   We state that in the sense of the Senate. 
   We also state some other things that come not just from Republicans but from the GAO. The Health Care Financing Administration has, in paragraph 16, stated:  
   On April 13, 1999, the GAO office testified the Health Care Financing Administration failed to use its authority to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries were informed of their appeals rights under managed care plans.  
   HCFA failed, according to the GAO. Yet Senator KENNEDY's bill says: We want to give HCFA more power. 
   Section 17 says the GAO testified in a July 1998 hearing in the Ways and Means Committee, House of Representatives, that the Health Care Financing Administration missed 25 percent of the implementation deadlines for consumer and quality improvements to the Medicare Program under the Balanced Budget Amendment of 1997. 
   Senator COLLINS alluded to that earlier. 
   Section 18 states the Health Care Financing Administration should not be given new, broad authority as they have not adequately met their current responsibilities. 
   I could go on. 
   Section 1 of this amendment states the States should maintain primary regulatory authority over health care. 
   Section 2 states that self-employed individuals should be able to deduct 100 percent of their health care premiums. 
   It is ironic that when we talk about health care we have such inadequate, inequitable treatment under the present Tax Code. Corporations deduct 100 percent of their health care costs; self-employed individuals deduct 45 percent. I personally am offended by that provision. I used to be self-employed, and I used to run a corporation. I wanted health care for my family in both circumstances. When I was self-employed, you could deduct almost nothing. Any person self-employed today can deduct 45 percent. Under the present Tax Code, in another 8 years they finally get to deduct 100 percent. That is a mistake. It needs to be remedied. We remedy it in this amendment. We provide 100 percent deductibility, beginning December 31, 1998--it would be effective immediately--100 percent deductibility for the self-employed. 
   I want my colleagues to understand that under this provision we are correcting the fact that the self-employed can only deduct 45 percent of their health care costs. We are expanding access. We are making it possible for more people to buy health insurance. I hope we will have strong bipartisan support for this provision. 
   This amendment is a second-degree amendment to the underlying amendment offered by Senator KENNEDY and Senator DASCHLE that tries to expand the scope that says the Federal Government knows best. We say no, the States should be the primary regulator over health insurance, and self-employed individuals should be entitled to deduct 100 percent of their health care premium. 
   I yield to my colleague from Arkansas such time as he desires.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I was a little disappointed when I heard my colleague say the Republican amendment is a diversion. The Republican amendment is an effort to increase access to quality health care for the self-employed. We have 43 million Americans who are uninsured today. We want to help them get insurance. 
   A large number of the people who are uninsured are self-employed. They are in small businesses. Small businesspeople who are just starting their businesses sometimes have a hard time getting quality fringe benefit packages. Almost all of the larger corporations have health insurance and pension benefits. But most job growth is in small businesses, and a lot of small businesses have not had time yet to develop and expand a fringe benefit program, including access to quality health care. 
   When they find out they can deduct 100 percent of their wages but they cannot deduct but 45 percent of their health insurance cost, what do you think most self-employed people are going to do? They might tell their employees: I will just give you the money and you buy the insurance yourself; I cannot deduct it so why spend it? I want to spend my money in my business operations. Everything I spend should be deductible. 
   It is not. We are trying to remedy that. 
   I am glad my colleague from Illinois says we have bipartisan support. I know we passed a provision a year or two ago that phased it in gradually, but that is too long. We want to make it effective now. We want to make it where the self-employed get to deduct 100 percent of their health care costs just like corporations. Why not do it now? That is not a diversion. 
   When we promote our bill, we say Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. What is the plus? We want to increase access. That is in stark contrast to the Kennedy bill which will decrease access. Their bill dramatically increases health care costs, and when you increase health care costs, you are going to be driving a lot of people into the ranks of the uninsured. We do not want to do that. That is not a diversion. It just happens to be a fact. 
   We want to make health insurance more affordable. The people who cannot afford it, in many cases, are self-employed, and they get the short end of the stick in the Tax Code. They are not treated fairly in the Tax Code. We are trying to remedy that. That is what we have in our amendment. 
   Also, we have in our amendment a finding of the Senate that, frankly, HCFA does not do a very good job in many cases. Despite what our colleagues say--we want all these people to have assurances and we want them to have all these guarantees. They are basically saying: We want the Health Care Financing Administration of the Federal Government to regulate insurance--we are saying no, that really  should not be the prerogative of the Federal Government to duplicate, override, overrule State regulation of insurance plans. 
   There is a difference. I am amazed that people keep making the comment: The Republican plan leaves all these people unprotected, as if the States are not doing anything. Every State has a regulatory regimen set up to regulate health insurance under their plans, and our colleagues evidently on Senator KENNEDY's side seem to think whatever the States are doing is not good enough; we know better, in spite of the fact, if you look at HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act that Congress passed in 1996, there are five States that are not complying. HCFA is supposed to be regulating those plans, and they are not. They are not complying with the law that we passed 3 years ago. The State of Massachusetts is one of the States that is not complying. Maybe I have too much faith in the States, but I cannot help but think the State of Massachusetts is still interested in making sure employees have portability and continuity of coverage, so I am not really faulting the State. 
   I just find it ironic that some people seem to think: Whatever the States are doing, it's not good enough. We know better. And HCFA, this grand almighty bureaucracy of the Federal Government, can do better than the States. I disagree with that. 
   So the second-degree amendment that we have states two things: One, findings that the primary regulatory authority of insurance should be done and handled by the States, not the Federal Government; and, two, we should help the self-insured be able to have equitable tax treatment comparable to corporations; they should be able to deduct 100 percent of their health care costs. 
   I just hope that our colleagues, if they agree in the primacy of States, if they believe in State regulation, if they believe in the 10th amendment to the Constitution that says all other rights and powers are reserved to the States and to the people, respectively, will adopt this amendment. I hope we will when we vote on this. For the information of our colleagues, I expect the vote will occur sometime tomorrow, most likely after the policy lunches. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NICKLES. On legislative procedure, I have advised my colleagues on both sides to go through the Chair. I think it is somewhat demeaning to the Senate to not have exchanges through the Chair. There is a reason for the rule. 
   I will make a couple of comments concerning this issue. I compliment my friend and colleague from Ohio for raising the issue. This is not about how someone spends their own money, I say to my colleague from New York. Anybody can spend their own money. A Federal employee can spend their own money and pay for an abortion. 
   It says ``no funds appropriated under this act.'' In other words, no taxpayer money shall be used to pay for abortion. That has been the law of the land. We have passed that many times. This administration wants to overturn it. They have not been successful. 
   I heard one of my colleagues, I believe my colleague from Washington, say it is only a minority, a radical minority. I am not sure if the word ``radical'' was used, but a small minority that wants to impose its will. 
   That is not the case. There was a poll taken some time ago that asked, ``Should the Government subsidize health care plans to pay for abortion?'' and 72 percent said no. 
   I have heard people say: You are trying to outlaw abortion. 
   That is not the case. 
   The purpose of the amendment is, we do not want to subsidize abortion and we don't want it to be a fringe benefit. 
   I heard a colleague saying this is a ``benefit.'' It shouldn't be a benefit. Abortion should not be a fringe benefit that is provided for and subsidized, three-fourths of which is paid for by the Federal Government. 
   Remember what we are talking about. Abortion happens to take the life of an unborn child. 
   I heard a colleague say we need a full range of reproductive services, we need reproductive health. What about health of the unborn child? Are we going to have the taxpayers pay to destroy the life of an unborn child? The majority in Congress and overwhelming majority of the American people have said no. 
   That is what our colleague's amendment does. It does not take away a woman's right to choose. It does not outlaw abortion. It just says we should not subsidize it. We should not be using taxpayers' money to provide a fringe benefit in the Federal employees' health care plans to help subsidize the destruction of innocent, unborn children. 
   So I compliment my colleague for the amendment. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment when we vote. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, let me clarify something with the majority leader. The majority leader made a request, or we discussed one on Thursday evening, I think, at 6:30. The major difference between this request and the one on Thursday is, No. 1, the limit on debate on the bill is limited to 3 hours and there was not a time limit?

<DOCNO>106-nickles-ok-2-19990629</DOCNO>

   Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate that. For further clarification, I understand why the minority leader asked for that, but I will state--I stated it on the floor--it was never anyone's intention on this side, to my knowledge, to filibuster the bill. I do think 3 hours is a very limited time. I do think it is possible, though, you can discuss the bill during amendment time, so I am not going to object. 
   Then the other major change was a reduction from 120 minutes to 100 minutes. That, of course, is to facilitate a greater number of amendments and that is understandable as well. So I have no objection.

<DOCNO>106-nickles-ok-1-19990629</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I join my colleague from West Virginia, Senator ROCKEFELLER, to introduce legislation to reform the alternative minimum tax, or AMT. 
   Congress created the AMT in 1986 to prevent businesses from using tax loopholes, such as the investment tax credit or safe harbor leasing, to pay little or no tax. The use of these tax preferences sometimes resulted in companies reporting healthy ``book'' income to their shareholders but little taxable income to the government. 
   Therefore, to create a perception of fairness, Congress created the AMT. The AMT requires taxpayers to calculate their taxes once under regular tax rules, and again under AMT rules which deny accelerated depreciation, net operating losses, foreign tax credits, and other deductions and credits. The taxpayer then pays the higher amount, and the difference between their AMT tax and their regular tax is ``credited' to offset future regular tax liability if it eventually falls below their AMT tax liability. 
   Unfortunately, the AMT has had a negative, unanticipated impact on many U.S. businesses. As it is currently structured, the AMT is a complicated, parallel tax code which places a particularly heavy burden on capital intensive companies. Corporations must now plan for and comply with two tax codes instead of one. Further, the AMT's elimination of important cost-recovery tax incentives increases the cost of investment and makes U.S. businesses uncompetitive with foreign companies. 
   Mr. President, I am proud to say that several AMT reforms I began pushing in 1995 were eventually enacted in 1997. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 exempted small corporations from the AMT, and conformed the depreciation cost-recovery periods for AMT and the regular corporate tax. The depreciation provisions in particular will relieve much of the AMT's negative impact on capital-intensive businesses. 
   However, even with these changes, some businesses continue to be chronic AMT taxpayers, a situation that was not contemplated when the AMT was created. These companies continue to pay AMT year after year, accumulating millions in unused AMT credits. These credits are a tax on future, unearned revenues which may never materialize, and because of the time-value of money their value to the taxpayer decreases every year. 
   The legislation Senator ROCKEFELLER and I are introducing today helps AMT taxpayers recover their AMT credits in a more reasonable time frame than under current law. Our bill would allow businesses with AMT credits which are three years old or older to offset up to 50 percent of their current-year tentative minimum tax. This provision will help chronic AMT taxpayers dig their way out of the AMT and allow them to recoup at least a portion of these ``accelerated tax payments'' in a reasonable time-frame. 
   Mr. President, our legislation does not repeal the AMT, and it will not allow taxpayers to ``zero out'' their tax liability. This bill specifically addresses the problems faced by companies that are buried in AMT credits they might otherwise never be able to utilize. I encourage the Senate Finance Committee to consider our bill when drafting this year's tax reconciliation legislation.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am really kind of surprised that our colleagues have not agreed to the unanimous consent proposal that was made last night. I am almost shocked because when you think about it--let me put it in a little different perspective. We have about 8 weeks that we are going to be in session before the end of September, before the end of the fiscal year. We have a lot of work to do in that period of time. 
   The majority leader basically made a proposal that said you can have almost all of a week. He said we will have a week off on the July 4th break, but then when we come back, you can have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. That is 4 days not 3. It is 4 days. Under that proposal, amendments were limited to 2 hours each. 
   That is a major concession. A Senator has a right to have unlimited debate on any amendment. Some of these amendments are very significant, as I think everybody would agree. Some of the proposals would change every single health care plan in America. Some would be quite expensive. Some would increase everybody's health care costs across the country. So we should not do that lightly. Probably we should not do it in 2 hours. If one amendment can increase every health care premium in the country by 1 percent--and there are a couple proposals to do that--we should discuss that because a lot of people are concerned about the growing cost of health care. 
   Under our proposal we said every amendment would have a 2-hour time limit. Granted, every amendment could have two second-degree amendments. I would be happy to modify that to one second-degree amendment if you think that advances your cause. I would be happy to do that. It doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure it out. I probably should not say that; Senator FRIST is here. I would not assume a second-degree amendment is exactly the same or that close to the first-degree amendment. 
   So, really, if you have 2-hour time limits, if you have one amendment and a second-degree, that is two amendments every 4 hours. We don't have to have a second-degree on every amendment. So you can have a lot of amendments in 4 days, a lot of them, probably to accomplish the desires that you have expressed to us, which is that you wanted to have 16 amendments or 20, or something similar to that. Some of those amendments on the list, hopefully, would be agreed upon. I haven't looked at the list. I haven't seen the list. But I am sure we can come to an agreement. I am also sure you don't have to spend 2 hours on every single amendment. 
   So my point to my colleagues who have had amendments, and to the Senator from California, I mention this: You have the best deal you are ever going to get. It takes unanimous consent. A lot of Senators over here don't want to give unanimous consent to 2 hours on some of these amendments. That was in the proposal. I can't believe you didn't accept it, and then you said you want Friday, too. That is regrettable. 
   Other people have said, wait a minute, now you are talking about making a point of order that you should not legislate on an appropriations bill. The Senator from South Dakota says we have done it before--a couple weeks ago. We have a real problem. We changed the rules by an action on the floor, and a lot of us voted that way and said, wait a minute, that has not helped us manage the Senate. We have had a rule in the Senate--a rule called rule XVI--which many times is abused and ignored; we legislate a lot on appropriations bills. But it makes it very difficult to accomplish things. Maybe that rule should be reinstated. Both Democrats and Republicans know we should reinstate it. Let's leave the authorizing and legislating up to the  authorizing committees that have the experience and expertise to do so.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague. My point is that rule XVI is not a Democrat rule or a Republican rule. It is a rule that has been abused in the past, and it ought to be reinstated. It is a rule that would help us do our Nation's business and finish our appropriations bills on time. We should leave the legislating up to the appropriate authorizing committees. If the authorizing committees aren't passing legislation we want, maybe we ought to give them a jump start. It goes through the appropriate legislative process. 
   I compliment Senator CRAPO from Idaho, who suggested that we should do this. He is right. Many of us suggested that we do this long before we came into this dilemma. I told my friend and colleague from California this amendment doesn't belong on the agriculture appropriations bill. Granted, if you want to try to pass the so-called Patients' Bill of Rights, piece by piece, or body part by body part, on an agriculture appropriations bill, you are wasting everybody's time. There is no way in the world an agriculture appropriations bill is going to come back with a Patients' Bill of Rights. Maybe you are making political statements, but you are not legislating effectively. It is not going to become law. 
   The majority leader proposed that we will give you basically a week, 4 legislative days, with time limits on amendments, which nobody has seen on either side. That is a tremendous gift. My colleague from Delaware is probably saying: I can't believe they didn't agreed to that. Many people on the other side are saying: I can't believe you haven't agreed. 
   I am not sure that offer is still going to be out here. I am troubled by that offer, I tell my colleague from South Dakota. I will tell you, there is no way in the world you are going to get another UC after today. I will be shocked if you get one that will be this generous in time, giving 4 legislative days to this particular issue. 
   I think I heard my colleague from South Dakota say: Wait a minute, we are being squeezed out and we haven't had the opportunity to bring up these amendments. 
   I think the majority leader, in making this request yesterday, was being very sincere in saying, hey, this is a way we can do this--not piece by piece, not on legislative appropriations bills, but basically we would give you 4 days beginning on July 12. I think that was a very generous offer. I wanted our colleagues to know that. If it is refused, then obviously the Patients' Bill of Rights is not going anywhere this session.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I hate to see my colleague and friend from Massachusetts get so exercised--and he happens to be incorrect. 
   He has to know the rules of the Senate very well. The proposal the majority leader was propounding is very fair. The Senator from California wants a vote on her amendment. I will be very frank. The way she can get a vote on her amendment is to move forward and accept the offer already made. She could offer her amendment, for example, as a second-degree amendment. The Senator can get a vote on her amendment. 
   The way to do this is not on an appropriations bill. The Senator from Idaho is correct. We shouldn't be doing this on an appropriations bill. Everyone in the Senate knows it. This is not the way to legislate. 
   We ought to be able to manage the Nation's business in an appropriate manner, not coming up with the Patients' Bill of Rights saying: We will do this piece by piece; we have 40 pieces and we will do it on various bills, bills that are going to go to conferees. 
   Conferees know absolutely nothing about this issue. They have never had a hearing on this issue, never dealt with this issue. Asking them to legislate on it is wrong. It is not going to happen. It will not pass; it will not become law. We are wasting our time. 
   It is not anybody's intention on this side to filibuster, to deny the opportunity to offer amendments. The Senator can have the opportunity. Yes, it is quite likely there will be amendments offered in the second-degree, but a lot of amendments wouldn't be offered in the second-degree. Likewise, second-degree amendments are available to Members on both sides. That should be very apparent. 
   The point is I am a little frustrated by people saying we are not being treated fairly. The Senator has been offered a most generous proposal where Senators could offer lots and lots of amendments and get votes on those amendments. It doesn't take a legislative genius to make that happen. 
   I encourage our colleagues to see if we can't work together and make this happen instead of offering this piece by  piece on an agriculture appropriations bill, even though we know it will not become law. 
   I think there is a right way to legislate. This is not the right way to legislate. I hope we will work together to come up with something acceptable. I think there has been put off a more than generous proposal from on our side. We have been amending it for the last 2 days, trying to accommodate legitimate concerns. Somebody said originally it was 3 hours on each amendment. Some people say we shouldn't have any debate limit on amendments. I happen to think that is probably closer to correct when considering the magnitude and the scope of some of these amendments. 
   I urge our colleagues to step back and lower the rhetoric, not get so exercised, and see if we can't come up with an appropriate legislative way to solve this problem, see if we can't come up with a legitimate, positive, legislative approach that will help solve some of the problems that have been acknowledged, without dramatic increases in consumer costs and increases in the number of people who are uninsured. That is what I prefer. The hotter the rhetoric gets, the less likely that is to happen. 
   We need to work together in order to make positive legislation happen. The Democrats alone will not pass legislation; the Republicans alone will not pass legislation. Nothing will become law if it is strictly partisan. 
   I urge my colleagues to step back a little bit and look at some of these unanimous consent requests and see if we can find an appropriate vehicle and manner to legislate on this important issue. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague from California. She mentioned timing. I do not think the time is now. I do not think it should be on the appropriations bill. We have been pretty straightforward in saying we will give you a few days after the Fourth of July break. Basically, that means next week we will be working on other appropriations bills, and that means the following week we will be working on the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I will tell my colleague--I can easily tell her, and anybody else--the Senator can orchestrate a way to get a vote on her amendment. It can be done. Her amendment can be a second-degree amendment, I tell my colleague. I have already stated we can limit the agreement to one second-degree amendment instead of two. There are many of us willing to do that. The way not to do it, in my opinion, is piecemeal on 20 different legislative items--some on this appropriations bill, some on that appropriations bill--knowing those appropriators are going to conference and will say: What in the world are we going to do with medical necessity? We don't know what that is. 
   I appreciate the fact she mentioned a brain surgeon who said a patient should stay in a day longer and some managed care idiot, or bureaucrat, said no. I do not happen to think the legislative solution proposed in the Senator's legislation is the right fix. I happen to think the better idea is to give an internal appeal that can be done immediately. It can be appealed. If it is  not overturned--the example the Senator cited I think would be overturned immediately, and, if not done immediately, it could be done by an external appeal done by outside peer review experts. They do not have to go to court, they do not have to sue, and they have immediate change. That 
   is the better process. 
   My point is, as far as process is concerned now, we should not be debating this on an appropriations bill. Offering a few days beginning on July 12 is more than generous. I will try to be flexible in further negotiations, but the give is just about given when, if the Senator looks, we have just about 8 weeks to legislate before the end of the fiscal year. 
   I think the majority leader has been very, very generous. I will work with my colleague to see if we cannot come to a constructive conclusion. I appreciate her willingness to do so. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. I tell my friend, and colleagues, there is a lot of work to be done. I think it is in the interest of all Senators to work together. I do not think that necessarily it is really constructive to say we are going to shut down the Senate for a week, as has actually happened the last couple days, unless we get our will. I would like us to work maybe a little more off the floor and a little more behind the scenes and say: What can we do? 
   That will take cooperation. It will take saying, We are willing to take up this bill and finish it by tomorrow. Then you do not have to get into a whole lot of extended discussion and maybe a lack of trust. Because I heard some people say, well, wait a minute. Under this agreement that we proposed, somebody could filibuster the bill, and you could only have one or two amendments. 
   That was not our intention. I can tell my colleagues that was not my intention. Do we want to have 25 really tough votes? No. But votes go both ways. 
   But my point being, there is no one I know of who was saying we are going to have somebody come in and filibuster this bill. Nobody was talking about doing that. Maybe we need to have a little more faith and a little more collegiality and willingness to work together. 
   This is an item of interest to a lot of people. There are a lot of people on this side who would like us to pass a positive bill. 
   I have also stated my very sincere conviction that we should not pass a bill that is going to increase health care costs a total of about 13 or 14 percent, after you add in inflation. I really mean that. I am very sincere about that. 
   So we may have some differences, but, I have not totally given up on the idea of us working something out. 
   I will suggest the absence of a quorum. Maybe something 
   else can be done to accomplish that. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Electric Consumer Choice Act. For the last three years hearings and workshops have been held in both the House and Senate examining the issue of restructuring the electric industry. Many bills have been introduced on this issue by both Congressmen and Senators, some comprehensive and some dealing with more discreet issues such as repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company (PUHCA) or repeal of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA). The bill that I am introducing today cuts to the heart of the issue: do we or don't we support allowing consumers to choose their electric supplier? Do we or don't we support a national competitive market in electricity? I believe the answer to these questions is a resounding ``yes''! I believe competition is good, that free markets work and that every American will benefit from a competitive electric industry. 
   The Electric Consumer Choice Act is intended to begin the process of achieving a national, competitive electricity market. It achieves this in a simple, straight-forward method. Primarily, it eliminates electric monopolies by prohibiting the granting of exclusive rights to sell to electric utilities. It prohibits undue discrimination against consumers purchasing electricity in interstate commerce. It provides for access to local distribution facilities and it allows a state to impose reciprocity requirements on out-of-state utilities. The bill before you today also includes a straight repeal of PUHCA and the prospective repeal of the mandatory purchase provisions of PURPA. The bill also makes it clear that nothing in this act expands the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) or limits the authority of a state to continue to regulate retail sales and distribution of electric energy in a manner consistent with the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. 
   The premise of this bill is that all attributes of today's electric energy market--generation, transmission, distribution and both wholesale and retail sales--are either in or affect interstate commerce. Therefore, any State regulation of these attributes that unduly discriminates against the interstate market for electric power violates the Commerce Clause unless such State action is protected by an act of Congress. 
   The Supreme Court has interpreted Part II of the Federal Power Act (FPA) as protecting State regulation of generation, local distribution, intrastate transmission and retail sales that unduly discriminates against the interstate market for electric power. The Court has reasoned that Congress, in the FPA, determined that the federal government needed only to regulate wholesale sales and interstate transmission in order to adequately protect interstate commerce in electric energy. Thus, all other aspects of the electric energy market were reserved to the States and protected from challenges under the Commerce Clause. The Electric Consumer Choice Act amends the FPA to eliminate the protection provided for State regulation that establishes, maintains, or enforces an exclusive right to sell electric energy or that unduly discriminates against any consumer who seeks to purchase electric energy in interstate commerce. 
   This bill provides consumers and electric energy suppliers with the means to achieve retail choice in all States by January 1, 2002. It does not impose a federal statutory mandate on the States. It does not preempt the States' traditional jurisdiction to regulate the aspects of the electric power market in the reserved realm--generation, local distribution, intrastate transmission, or retail sales--it merely limits the scope of what the States can do in that realm. It does not expand or extend FERC jurisdiction into the aspects of traditional State authority. 
   As I stated earlier, this bill is intended to provide every consumer a  choice when it comes to electricity suppliers. It is intended to be the beginning, not the end of the process. There are many other issues that need to be addressed at the federal level to facilitate a national market for electricity. Some of these issues include taxation differences between various electric providers, clarification of jurisdiction over transmission, ensuring reliability, providing for inclusion of the Power Marketing Administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority in a national market, and other issues that can only be addressed at the Federal level. These issues need to be addressed and should be addressed. But while these issues are being debated we should ensure that progress towards customer choice proceeds. 
   I am proud to say that my state of Oklahoma has been in the forefront of opening up it's electricity markets to competition. Nineteen other states have also moved to open their markets. It is my hope that the Electric Consumer Choice Act will facilitate this process nationally. To that end, I am introducing this bill today.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have a couple comments. Again, we are trying to come up with an arrangement. I think all my colleagues are aware of the fact that we have been negotiating on this most of the day. Hopefully, we will come up with an arrangement that is mutually satisfactory to all participants in the debate. 
   I will respond to a couple of the comments, because maybe they haven't been responded to adequately. There has been a lot of discussion about the Republican package doesn't do this or the Democrat package does so many wonderful things. The Democrat package before the Senate increases health care costs dramatically. 
   I stated, maybe 2 years ago: When the Senate considers legislation, we should make sure we do no harm. By doing no harm, I stated two or three propositions. One, we should not increase health care costs; that makes health care unaffordable for a lot of Americans. Unfortunately, the package proposed by my colleagues on the Democrat side--the Kennedy bill--increases health care costs 4.8 percent, according to the CBO, over and above the inflation that is already estimated for this next year, estimated to be about 8 percent. 
   If you add 5 percent on top of 8 percent, that is a 13-percent increase in health care costs. The result is, probably a million and a half Americans will lose their health care if we pass the Democrat package. 
   I have heard a lot of my colleagues say: We need to pass the Kennedy bill; it is going to do all these wonderful things, because we are going to protect, we have a prudent layperson. It is just a great idea. We have emergency care. It is a wonderful idea. We are going to guarantee everybody all this assortment of benefits. We are going to mandate all kinds of little coverages that all sound very good. 
   But they do have a cost. If we make insurance unaffordable and move a million and a half people from the insured category to the uninsured category, I think we are making a mistake; I think we are making a serious mistake. 
   There are some costs involved, and there is a little difference in philosophy. Some of our colleagues said the Republican package doesn't cover this or doesn't do this, doesn't do that. What we don't try to do is rewrite health care insurance, which is basically a State-controlled initiative. We don't have the philosophy that Washington, DC, knows best. There is a difference in philosophy. 
   The Kennedy bill says: States, we don't care what you are doing. We know what is best. We have a package, an emergency care package, that you have to have ER services under the following scenarios. We don't care what you are doing, States. 
   I just looked at a note. Forty States have emergency care mandates. The Kennedy bill says: We don't care what you are doing, States. Here is what we say, because we know what is best. 
   I wonder if the State of Massachusetts has it. The State of Washington has it. I heard my colleague from Washington, Senator MURRAY, talk about emergency care. The State of Washington has emergency care mandates in their health care packages for State-regulated health care plans. I heard the Senator from Washington talk about ``prudent layperson.'' The State of Washington has a prudent layperson mandate. Maybe that is not adequate. Maybe somebody in the State legislature in the State of Washington said: We need to strengthen this; we need 
   improvement. 
   There is a difference of philosophy. We, on our side, are saying we shouldn't try to rewrite health care plans all across America. We don't believe in national health insurance, that the Government in Washington, DC, is the source of all wisdom, has all knowledge, can do all things exactly right, and we should supersede the governments of every State. 
   We don't have that philosophy. There is a difference of philosophy. The Kennedy bill says: States, you have emergency room provisions. We do not think they are adequate. We know what is best. 
   Then the health care plans say: Wait a minute, we have been regulated since our inception by the States, as far as insurance regulation. Now we have the Federal regulation. Whom should we follow? They are different. 
   Who is right? Do we just take the more stringent proposal, or are we now going to have HCFA regulate not only Medicare and Medicaid, but are we now going to have HCFA regulating private insurance? I do not think we should. 
   I will tell my colleagues, HCFA has done a crummy job in regulating Medicare. HCFA has not complied with the mandates we gave them in 1997 for giving information to Medicare recipients on Medicare options. They haven't done that yet. They haven't notified most seniors of options that are available to them that this Congress passed and this President signed. They haven't notified people of their options. They have done a crummy job of complying with the regulations that they have now. They haven't even complied with--some of the States--the so-called Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation that passed a few years ago. There are some States, including the State of Massachusetts, which don't even comply with the Kennedy-Kassebaum kid care formulations. HCFA is supposed to take that over. They haven't done it. 
   My point is, people who have the philosophy, wait a minute, we need to  have this long list of mandates, we are going to say it, and we are going to regulate it and dictate it from Washington, DC, I just happen to disagree with. 
   It may be a very laudable effort. Some of the horror stories that were mentioned--this person didn't get care, and it is terrible--are tough stories. But we have to ask ourselves, is the right solution a Federal mandate? Is the Federal mandate listing here of what every health care plan in America has to comply with, dictated by Washington, DC, dictated by my friend and colleague from Massachusetts, is that the right solution? I don't think so. 
   Is there a cost associated with that? Yes, there is. I mention that to my colleagues and to others who are interested in the debate. 
   We will have this debate. I think there will be an agreement reached that we will take this up on July 11, and we will have open availability for individuals to offer amendments with second-degree amendments, and hopefully a conclusion to this process. 
   I did want to respond to say that this idea of somebody finding a horror story or finding an example of a problem and coming up with the solution, or the fix being ``Washington, DC, knows best,'' I don't necessarily agree with. 
   I do think we can make some improvements. I do hope, ultimately, we will have bipartisan support for what I believe is a very good package. I am not saying it is perfect. It may be amended. It may be improved. I hope we will come up with a bipartisan package. 
   We do have internal/external appeals which are very important and, I think, could make a positive contribution towards solving some of the problems many of the individuals have addressed earlier today. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, end-of-life issues are some of the most complicated our society wrestles with today, as medical technology dramatically advances and life expectancies continue to increase. Many of us have relatives, or know someone, who has grappled with grave and terminal illnesses. Doctors, caregivers, and family members work together in such situations, not just in an effort to save a loved one's life, but to give them the comfort and palliative care they deserve. However, love and concern can often come up against a confusing and complicated set of Federal and state laws which govern and influence care and treatment decisions in such situations. 
   Today I, along with Senators LIEBERMAN, LOTT, ABRAHAM, ALLARD, BROWNBACK, COVERDELL, ENZI, HAGEL, HELMS, INHOFE, and CRAIG, introduce the Pain Relief Promotion Act of 1999. This comprehensive legislation will restore the uniform national standard of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to all 50 states. The Pain Relief Promotion Act will: 
   Affirm and support aggressive pain management as a ``legitimate medical purpose'' for the use of federally-controlled substances--even in cases where such use may unintentionally hasten death as a side-effect (``principle of double effect''). 
   Encourage practitioners to dispense and distribute federally-controlled substances as medically appropriate to relieve pain and other distressing symptoms, by clarifying that such conduct is consistent with the Controlled Substances Act. 
   Provide that a state law authorizing or permitting assisted suicide or euthanasia does not change the federal government's responsibility to prevent misuse of federally-controlled, potentially dangerous, drugs. The Federal government's responsibility to prevent such misuse in states which have not legalized assisted suicide is already conceded by the Attorney General and would not change. 
   Provide education and training to law enforcement officials and health professionals on medically accepted means for alleviating pain and other distressing symptoms for patients with advanced chronic disease or terminal illness, including the legitimate use of federally-controlled substances. 
   Establish a ``Program for Palliative Care Research and Quality'' within the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) to develop and advance scientific understanding of palliative care, and collect, disseminate and make available information on pain management, especially for the terminally ill health professionals and the general public. 
   Authorize $5 million for a grant program within the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to  make grants and contracts for the development and implementation of programs to provide education and training in palliative care. It states that physicians entrusted by the federal government with the authority to prescribe and dispense federally-controlled substances may not abuse that authority by using them for assisted suicide; however, it strongly affirms that it is a ``legitimate medical purpose'' to use these federally-controlled substances to treat patient's pain and end-of-life symptoms, even in light of the unfortunate and unintended side effect of possibly hastening a patient's death. 
   Recognize that this policy promoting pain control does not authorize the use of federally-controlled substances for intentional assistance in suicide or euthanasia. 
   Restore the uniform national standard that federally-controlled substances can not be used for the purpose of assisted suicide by applying the current law in 49 states to all 50 states. This bill does not create any new regulatory authority for the DEA. 
   This is a straight-forward, very positive bill that would merely apply what is current law in 49 states to all 50 states, without increasing the federal regulatory authority of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The bill has been endorsed by organizations including the National Hospice Organization, American Society of Anesthesiologists, American Academy of Pain Management, and former Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop. And, today I was informed that the House of Delegates of the American Medical Association voted to support the bill. 
   A variety of provisions in this legislation is in direct response to the June 5, 1998, letter by the Attorney General, allowing Oregon to use federally-controlled substances for assisted suicide, a decision that was in direct opposition to an earlier policy determination by her own Drug Enforcement Administration. 
   It is significant to remember that in 1984 Congress passed amendments to strengthen the Controlled Substances Act, due to specific concerns regarding the use of prescription drugs in lethal overdoses. Congress's view was that while the states are the first line of defense against misuse of prescription drugs, the federal government must enforce its own objective standard as to what constitutes such misuse--and it must have the authority to enforce that standard when a state cannot or will not do so. 
   Again, Congress clearly spoke on the issue of assisted suicide when it passed the Assisted Suicide Federal Funding Restriction Act of 1997 by a nearly unanimous vote. Signing the bill President Clinton said it ``will allow the Federal Government to speak with a clear voice in opposing these practices,'' and warned that ``to endorse assisted suicide would set us on a disturbing and perhaps dangerous path.'' 
   It is time for Congress to speak again. 
   Federal law is clearly intended to prevent use of these drugs for lethal overdoses, and contains no exception for deliberate overdoses approved by a physician. The DEA currently pursues cases where a physician's negligent use of controlled substances has led to the death of a patient, it was inappropriate for the Attorney General to allow for the intentional use of controlled substances to cause the death of a patient. The Pain Relief Promotion Act will clarify federal law, to affirm use of controlled substances to control pain and reject their deliberate use to kill patients. 
   This legislation is overdue. Already physicians have used these federally controlled substances to cause the death of their patients. There is no role for the Federal government in providing assisted suicide. 
   I urge my colleagues to support and enact this urgently needed bipartisan legislation.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote no on the so-called steel quota bill. I think it would be a mistake. I think the bill would do more harm than good; I mean more harm than good to our entire economy, and I believe also to the steel industry and to the steelworkers. I think it would be a serious mistake. 
   One would have to figure what happens if we enacted these arbitrary quota restraints. Senator MOYNIHAN just mentioned it would be a violation of our trading laws. If we do that, that will hurt the steel industry indirectly, because we export a lot of steel products. We export a lot of tractors, we export a lot of heavy equipment, and we export a lot of cars, all of which use steel. 
   If we establish arbitrary quotas on what we are going to import, many other countries are going to retaliate, and they have the right to do so under the WTO. We are going to be violating the trade laws that we have agreed to, and there is going to be a response. 
   Senator GRASSLEY just mentioned that the biggest response is going to be against agriculture. It is kind of the easiest thing to hit. Agriculture is very competitive in the export market. 
   Farmers all across the country are going to be faced with a loss of exports, and they are going to say: Wait a minute. Congress just imposed a restriction on steel imports, and, therefore, they are going to put restrictions on the amount of wheat, or the amount of grain they will import. It would be a serious mistake.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will read a couple of lines from his article. He says:  
   No one has more to lose from quotas than America's farmers who grow more and export more than any farmers in the world.  
   He also says:  
   The quota bill is not in our Nation's economic interest, and it is not even in the interest of our steel industry and its workers.  
   He is exactly right. This bill would be a serious mistake. 
   The Commerce Department has already taken action against Russia, against Brazil, and against Japan. They can impose tariffs up to 28 percent on Japan for dumping, up to 86 percent on Brazil for dumping, and up to 200 percent on Russia for dumping. Already there are remedies. 
   Incidentally, I might mention that the problem is not near as grave as some people have indicated. Steel imports have gone down 72 percent from last November, which was an all-time high. 
   Again, I don't think the facts warrant passage of this bill. I clearly think if people look at the long-term ramifications of passing it, agriculture will lose, the American economy will lose, and I really think, frankly, the steel industry will lose as well.

   Mr. NICKLES. I yield myself a couple of minutes, and then I will yield to my colleague from Maine. 
   Our colleague from Massachusetts said there was a unanimous consent request last year; we were talking about doing this last June and July. That is correct. We offered several unanimous consent requests, from June 18, July 15, and July 25, to bring this bill up to allow both sides to have a chance to vote on their proposals. We offered a number of amendments before the August break. Those were not agreed upon. 
   Everyone has had a chance to offer their bill and to have it voted on. We  would have a package, we would have a bill, before the Senate that possibly could pass. That was not agreed upon last year. I don't know if it will be agreed upon this year. I told the Democratic sponsors we are willing to come to some time agreement, some limit on amendments, but we are not just going to have the bill on the floor for an unlimited number of amendments with unlimited debate. 
   Somebody asked, Why haven't we done this? 
   The Kennedy bill increased health care costs a lot. It is estimated that health care costs will increase 4.8 percent in addition to whatever health care increases are already scheduled. Increases are scheduled to be 7 to 9 percent. Take the average of that, 8 percent, and add 4.8 percent. That is a 13-percent increase in health care costs. That will increase the number of uninsured by at least 1.5 million. 
   I am going to work energetically to see we don't pass any bill that increases people's health care costs by 13 percent in 1 year. Certainly, I will work energetically to see we don't pass a health care bill that increases the number of uninsured by 1.5 million. That would be a serious mistake. 
   Whatever the Senate does, it should do no harm. If we increase health care costs in double digits and increase the number of uninsured by over a million, we have done a lot of harm. Some Members will not do that. 
   We should make some needed reforms. One of my colleagues worked energetically to put together a good package that makes needed reforms. 
   I yield 7 minutes to our colleague from Maine, Senator COLLINS.

   Mr. NICKLES. I will reserve 12 seconds. 
   In a moment there will be a motion to table the Republican substitute. I hope our colleagues will vote against that motion to table and then, hopefully, after that is not tabled, I will move to table the Kennedy amendment. 
   Mr. President, I will do so for a couple of reasons. One, it doesn't belong on the agriculture bill. I told my colleagues we are willing to come up with a reasonable time agreement and a limited number of amendments to debate this issue. It doesn't belong on the agriculture appropriations bill. 
   There are other reasons to table the underlying Kennedy amendment. If you want to increase health care costs, that is what this bill does. It will increase health care costs 5 percent, in addition to the 6, 7, 8, 9 percent of health care inflation. You are going to have a 13 or 14-percent increase in health care costs, which is going to increase the number of uninsured probably by 1.5 million, maybe more. We should not be passing legislation to put 1.5 million people into the uninsured category. That would be a serious mistake.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. I compliment the sponsors of it, Senator BYRD and Senator DOMENICI. They are very persistent. I expect they will be successful today, but I hope that this bill doesn't pass either today in the Senate or in the conference. 
   I urge our colleagues to vote against it. The reason is because I think it is a mistake. It is not that I don't want to help the steel industry or that I don't want to help the oil and gas industry. I want to help both. 
   I do not think the Federal Government guaranteeing loans is the right thing to do. We have tried it. We have been there. It did not work. We did it in 1978 and 1979. The Federal Government had a loan guarantee program for the steel industry--$290 million worth of steel loans were made, guaranteed by the Federal Government. The Federal Government loaned $222 million on which the steel industry defaulted. That is a 77 percent default rate. Basically, the people who ran the program at the time or later said, well, really, it was replacing the marketplace with politicians making those decisions, saying that we don't think that the marketplace should be making capital decisions; we are going to have those decisions being made by Government. 
   I think that was a serious mistake. We have urged other countries not to go into this industrial policy; let the marketplace work. And now we are trying to come back and do it. We have done it before. It did not work before. 
   I want to help the oil and gas industry. It is really hurting in my State. But I do not think that having the Federal Government guaranteeing loans is the right solution. As a matter of fact, I do not think it will help anybody. I do not think it will even help the steel industry. It might help them reshuffle some debt, but I do not think it makes sense. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote no on this bill today. 
   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the bill.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my friend and colleague from Texas. I hope his speech is one that all Members of the Senate have listened to. I happen to agree with him, I think this bill is a mistake. 
   I spoke on this bill. We only had 5 minutes before we voted on this. The first debate we had on this was actually 10 minutes for the proponents, 10 minutes for the opponents. That was the only debate we have had on the floor of the Senate. That was on a motion of cloture. For people who don't know what that is, it is a motion to proceed to debate the bill. 
   I told the proponents of the bill, Senator BYRD and Senator DOMENICI, I will object to the bill; I will debate against it; I will offer amendments against it. However, I will not filibuster it. If they get cloture, they get cloture. 
   They got cloture. I lost. I happen to think I was right on the issue. 
   I will follow through. I said I would amend it. I told Senator BYRD I would not offer a bunch of dilatory amendments. I will not go into extraneous matters. I will try to make a bad bill better. I don't think this is a good bill. I don't think it should pass. I don't think it should become law. I will work to see that it doesn't. This is one step in the process. 
   Let me say why I think this is a bad bill. I have great respect for Senator BYRD and Senator DOMENICI. They are very effective legislators. They have convinced a lot of people we should move forward. My compliments to them. I don't happen to think they are right on this bill. 
   Looking back at loan guarantees, the last time we did this we actually ended up having net loan guarantees of $290 million and defaulted on $222 million. That is a default rate of 77 percent. That means taxpayers had to write a check for $222 million out of a total loan guarantee of $290 million. That is a terrible, terrible failure. 
   I will mention a couple of things. That is a failure by my words, but it is a failure according to Members of previous administrations. 
   I will just give you a couple of comments:  
   Less than a decade later, all 5 loans [talking about steel loans] are in default.  
   And the Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration, in an internal memorandum notes:  
   By any measurement, EDA's steel loan program would have to be considered a failure. The program is an excellent example of the folly inherent in industrial policy programs.  
   They are exactly right. Other countries do not do this. They believe in the private sector. We believe in it. We believe in developing private capitalism. Let bankers take risks, have investments, have the right to succeed and the right to fail. 
   Now we are on the floor of the Senate and we say, wait a minute, not in steel or not in oil and gas; those are two vital industries. I agree these are vital industries, but I do not think this bill will help them one iota. It did not help in 1978 and 1979. It cost taxpayers millions of dollars; it was a boondoggle, it was a failure. Why should we repeat it? We know better. 
   I am sympathetic when people say we have lost jobs and these are really tough times. I will tell you, it is a lot tougher in the oil patch than it is in the steel industry, and I think that is the reason Senator DOMENICI offered his amendment. The oil patch lost 50,000 jobs; the steel industry lost 10,000. But I do not think this is the right solution to help the oil patch. If I did, I would support it. I have been pretty supportive of the oil patch in my tenure in the Senate, but Government loan guarantees is not the solution. 
   I have talked to our producers. I have talked to the people. They do not want it, they do not need it, and it will not help to have a Government loan guarantee. It will not help. That is not the solution. 
   Not everybody in the oil patch and not everybody in the steel industry is losing money. There are 16 big steel companies, 12 of which are profitable. A lot of them do not even want it. A lot of them do not need it. What will they do, if one company gets a loan guarantee and gets a subsidized low-interest loan, say, at 6 percent and they are paying 9 percent? They will say: Wait a minute, we are in a competitive field. How in the world can we allow this company, a competitor, to go out and borrow money with the Government guaranteeing it? They get a lot better interest rate. We are competing with them. When they are doing it, we had better do it. 
   So we are, in effect, going to give U.S. Steel or Bethlehem Steel a loan guarantee? Those are companies that are probably doing fine, and they probably do not want this. I doubt they do. I hope they do not. Are they going to let their competitors go in and get a competitive advantage? So maybe there will be a race to grab some of  this money. We should not be exposing taxpayers to that kind of risk. 
   We should not be circumventing the marketplace. We know the Secretary of Labor, Alexis Herman, is a great lady. I have great respect for her. But I don't think she knows better than bankers in the United States whether a loan should be made or not; or, for that matter, the Secretary of Commerce or the Secretary of the Treasury. This bill says they know better, frankly, than all the bankers, all the capitalists in this country. The Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of the Treasury would be making the loans for a billion and a half dollars. They are going to guarantee, the Federal Government, we will back that loan up. If it fails, we will write a check. That is what this bill does. 
   You cannot say the bill is without cost. It has been estimated the bill could cost taxpayers $270 million. That is not an insignificant amount of money. That is a guess. That is an absolute guess. If we have default rates like we had 20 years ago, it will be over a billion dollars Uncle Sam will be writing a check 
   for. I do not have a great deal of confidence the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of Commerce can make the right decisions. 
   This bill has a provision that allows the Government to guarantee basically 100 percent of the loan. That doesn't make any sense. When you get into a loan guarantee, most of our Federal programs guarantee 70 percent, 75 percent, 80 percent, in some cases 90 percent. Almost all small business loans are guaranteed at 90 percent or less. This bill says there can be 100 percent. What sense does that make? 
   I mentioned that we are going to offer some amendments to make some changes. I am hopeful the sponsors of this legislation will support us in an effort to adopt those changes. Let me just go over some of the amendments I think will make a bad bill less bad. It still will not make it, in my opinion, worthy of passage, but as I told the sponsors, I am not going to filibuster the bill indefinitely. I am going to offer some germane amendments. 
   One will be to change the composition of the board. Instead of having the Labor Secretary and the Commerce Secretary and Treasury Secretary make these decisions, the Treasury Secretary would be a member of the board, and he would serve as chairman--in addition the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission would serve. They would replace the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Commerce. 
   It does a couple of things. It gets politics out of it for a lot of purposes. The SEC and the Fed are not as politically in tune as a Cabinet-level Secretary. I think it offers a little more balanced business perspective. I think it would complement the board and make it a better board. So that would be one amendment. Hopefully, it will be passed. 
   Another amendment would be to establish an 80-percent maximum loan guarantee. Instead of having a 100-percent loan guarantee, the maximum would be 80 percent. So the Federal Government, if this board says okay to a steel company or an oil company, we are going to lend up to $100 million, the maximum exposure of the Federal Government on that $100 million loan will be $80 million. That means a private financial institution which is lending the other $20 million has something at risk, and if it fails, they will lose a little bit of money too. It will make people a little more prudent when they start applying this idea of using Government money or Government guarantees. So, hopefully, that will pass. 
   We have another amendment that would strike the minimum loan levels. Some people say: Why did you have the board set up? We did not pass this bill. It passed the Senate one time but not with a direct vote. It never went through any authorizing committee. It did not go through the Banking Committee in the House or the Senate. No one has looked at it. Basically, this has been crafted and it really has not been scrutinized. I think we are pulling out some of the deficiencies of the bill. 
   One of the deficiencies in the underlying bill says we will have minimum loan levels. In steel, the lowest, smallest loan they could make would be $25 million. Small steel companies, don't apply. This is for big steel. In other words, the loan levels in this package--as drafted, would have to be between $25 million and a maximum of $250 million. That is what the Federal Government guarantees. It would not guarantee a $10 million loan or a $5 million loan. We want to strike the minimum levels for both steel and oil and gas. 
   It says, for iron ore, the minimum level was $6 million; oil and gas, the minimum level loan guarantee would be $250,000. I probably have more small producers in my State than any State, with the possible exception of Texas, and why in the world would we have a Federal loan guarantee program? But, oh, if you can't borrow at least a quarter of a million dollars, don't apply. Does that make any sense? 
   We have thousands of producers in our State. Frankly, most of 
   our wells produce about 2 barrels a day, 2.5 barrels a day. If we are going to help people, are we really going to say, you have to be pretty big before we are going to help you? I don't think that makes sense. So we are going to have an amendment to strike the minimum loan levels. I think that would be important. 
   One other amendment I hope and expect we will be successful in passing, would be to strike the emergency spending designations in the bill or make a point of order that emergency spending does not lie. I hope, if anybody in this body is going to make statements such as ``we want to protect Social Security, and we don't want to spend those Social Security revenues,'' they better support this amendment. Because I want to make sure everybody understands, when we are talking about striking the emergency section, what it means. If you have the emergency section in there, it means the budget doesn't apply. It means we are going to add that amount of money to the caps. It means you are going to be taking that money out of the surplus and, in this case, 100 percent of that money is the Social Security surplus. So you are raiding the Social Security surplus, raiding the Social Security funds in order to be giving loan guarantees to steel and oil and gas. 
   I do not know if that sells in Minnesota, but it doesn't sell in Oklahoma. It is ludicrous to say we are going to have an emergency designation on this. An emergency basically means the budget does not apply. Maybe some people do not want to have a budget. 
   We just passed a big bill for Kosovo. We declared it an emergency. It was a net of $13 billion. We said it was an emergency; the budget cap doesn't apply. Some people say that was wartime, it is understandable, and so on, even though we increased the numbers rather significantly. That is one thing. Are we going to do it 2 weeks later and say that now we have an emergency steel loan program; we are going to have to declare that an emergency? Are we going to have to do that every 2 weeks? How many times are we going to declare an emergency? If we are going to do it every 2 weeks, let's just stop the charade and don't even have a budget. 
   Just forget having a budget. It is not necessary. We can just appropriate whatever money we want to spend and see how much it is at the end of the year. That, in effect, is what we are doing when we repeatedly declare something an emergency. 
   We are going to make a point of order on the emergency provision, and I hope we will be successful. I am going to venture to say on all four amendments, we will be successful. I expect we will be. 
   I appreciate the fact that Senator DOMENICI has communicated to us already he is willing to see if we can work something out on these amendments. It is vitally important we do so. 
   We do not really believe in this concept of industrial policy where the Federal Government is going to supersede the private sector and make financial decisions. Some countries try that. Communist countries try it. Socialistic countries try it. Frankly, it does not work very well. Look at third world growth rate and see how many jobs they create. They do not work well. 
   Why would we start doing it? We tried it 20 years ago, and it was a dismal failure, a total, complete failure. Basically what they are saying is we want to replace the marketplace with political wisdom. It is a serious mistake. Again, my State has had  percentagewise as big a job loss as any, and I still think it would be a serious mistake. 
   Finally, obviously, big steel has a lot of clout. We are considering this bill, and there is another bill which just went through the Finance Committee dealing with section 301. Then there is a bill that the House has already passed dealing with steel quotas. I believe the majority leader said we are going to be voting on that next week. There will be a cloture vote on whether we should take it up. I urge my colleagues to vote no on cloture and defeat the steel quota bill. 
   Today I asked Mr. Summers, who is the nominee for Secretary of the Treasury, what his position is on the bill. In the past, we heard the President was against it. He said his advisers will be recommending the President veto it. That is the right position. They should veto it. 
   One has to ask a couple of questions: Do you believe in GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which has made it possible for us to have a greater economic activity worldwide? If you believe in it, the steel quota bill is totally, completely inconsistent with GATT. Totally. Our trading partners would retaliate. 
   If you think if we pass this steel quotas bill, that it is going to protect steel jobs, it will not, because there will be retaliation. The retaliation in many cases will be: We are not going to buy some of your other products. 
   You may think we are saving a few steel jobs, but the net result is we are going to lose a lot more jobs throughout the economy--not a few, a lot more--and maybe even start a real trade war. That is a serious mistake. We should not do that. 
   I urge my colleagues, if you believe in free trade, if you believe in GATT, if you believe in negotiations--that does not mean we cannot take retaliatory action if somebody is dumping. The administration has already imposed antidumping tariffs on Brazil and Japan. There are proper avenues to do that. A steel quota is not one, and loan guarantees is not one. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the amendments that Senator GRAMM and myself, and I believe Senator MCCAIN, will be offering shortly this afternoon. Maybe we can have them agreed to. If not, I hope we will have votes and they will be adopted. I urge my colleagues to vote no on final passage on this bill.

   Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the Senator's comment. I was not aware of the article. I am aware of the fact the steel industry as a whole is not doing all that bad. I mentioned, I believe, in my comments that 12 out of 16 of the larger companies are all profitable. Not all companies, but several companies are profitable. 
   The Senator mentioned seven new plants. I was not aware of that. That is an excellent point. I do not think they are clamoring for Washington, DC, to give them a loan guarantee. I have not had them knocking on my door saying give us a loan guarantee. If they do, I certainly would not want to be an investor. If somebody in the steel industry is knocking on the door saying, we need the Government to give us a loan guarantee, that is a bad sign, poor management, and they are in serious trouble.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and, in particular, Senator BYRD, Senator DOMENICI, and Senator STEVENS, for working with Senator GRAMM, myself, and others to try to make this a better bill. Senator DOMENICI mentioned one, we strike the emergency provision. That basically means there is $270 million estimated cost by CBO of this bill, and it was declared emergency. We are striking that. That means we won't be raising the caps. I think that is important; I don't think we should be calling everything an emergency, as I stated, and busting the budget. I appreciate the cooperation in striking that section. 
   We did a couple of other things. The bill originally said that the loan guarantees would be made up to 100 percent. We limited that now to a maximum loan guarantee of 85 percent. The lending organization, or bank, is going to have to put up 15 percent, with some risk. It may be 25 or 30 percent, but they will have to put up at least 15 percent. I think that is a good amendment. 
   We changed the composition of the board. Originally, the lending board was comprised of the Labor Secretary, the Treasury Secretary, and the Commerce Secretary. 
   We changed that. We said, well, we will keep the Secretary of Commerce on, but we will change it and add the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the head of the SEC--I think, again, trying to take politics out of it, trying to put people on the board that are more interested in economics and making good financial decisions, and not have it be so political. 
   We also have another amendment that would strike out the lower loan limits. The bill originally said in steel the loan range would be from $25 million to $250 million. We dropped the $25 million lower limit. In other words, now a steel company can get a $5 million loan, or a $10 million loan, or a $1 million loan; it won't have to be at least $25 million. 
   We did the same thing for ore, which had a $6 million minimum loan level. Now that can be smaller. For oil and gas, I believe, there was a $250,000 minimum. We struck that minimum as well. 
   I think the combination of amendments we have had make this a better bill. I appreciate the fact that leaders who are promoting this bill have agreed to these amendments. I think it improves it. I am still going to vote no on final passage. I really do not think the Federal Government should be in the loan guarantee business for steel, or for oil and gas, and for the iron ore companies. But I do appreciate their consideration of these amendments. 
   I urge my colleagues to support them. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. NICKLES. To respond to the question of my friend and colleague--I think it is an excellent question--we didn't fix that problem. The Senator is exactly right. This bill still leaves it open where you can have a bad loan, or basically you are going to have that refinanced with the Government guaranteed loan; i.e., a steel company would have a $100 million loan. Maybe they are paying a high interest rate--maybe 12 percent. Maybe that loan is in jeopardy. Maybe they are having a hard time making payments on it. 
   We haven't fixed that yet. That is an amendment some of us have been talking about. It wasn't in this package we just agreed to.

   Mr. NICKLES. I think, again, my colleague from Illinois is pointing out a shortcoming that is in the bill. It has not been fixed by the amendments that were offered. Quite possibly, maybe the Senator from Illinois will have an amendment, and maybe the principals that are engaged in this might support it. 
   I will be happy to work with the Senator to see if we can't correct that problem. But we haven't stopped anybody from refinancing a bad loan, or maybe a self-interest loan, as the Senator discussed. I personally think those mistakes should be corrected. We have taken four good steps to make it better. But we need some additional amendments to solve that problem.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my friend from West Virginia, because he is tenacious. He is a very good legislator. I am afraid he is going to win on this vote on the motion to proceed. I hope he does not, because I think we are making a serious mistake if we vote for this, but I compliment him for his persistence in pushing this proposal. I am opposed to it. This proposal is a $1.5 billion loan guarantee, $1 billion for steel, $500 million for oil and gas. Senator DOMENICI added the oil and gas provision, because the oil and gas industry is probably going through a greater economic crisis than even the steel industry. 
   The Senator from West Virginia said steel has lost 10,000 jobs. The oil and gas industry probably lost 40,000 jobs, and I will tell you, a good percentage of those are in my State. So I am sympathetic with the objectives they are trying to accomplish. I just disagree with the idea of having the Federal Government come in and make Federal loan guarantees. 
   We tried it before. The Carter administration did this in 1978. In 1978, they came up with a loan guarantee proposal for steel. They ended up making 290 million dollars' worth of loans, net contingent liability. 
   The steel industry defaulted on $222 million. That is a 77-percent default rate. I will read a couple of comments that were made in the CRS report, dated March 17, 1994.  
   Although only five loan guarantees were obligated to steel companies.....77 percent of the dollar value of these guarantees were defaulted. Although the sample size is very small, hindsight suggests that as a group, steel loans represented a very high level of risk, which may account for the lack of interest in the private markets to take these debt obligations without a guarantee.  
   I also will read for the RECORD from a Washington Post article dated February 28, 1988, just a couple of comments talking about the loan guarantees.  
   Less than a decade later, all five loans are in default, and the Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration, in an internal memorandum, notes that ``by any measurement, EDA's steel loan program would have to be considered a failure. The program is an excellent example of the folly  inherent in industrial policy programs,'' the memo added. The companies that received the guaranteed loans are either in bankruptcy, out of business or no longer own the facility in which the money was invested.  
   This is a news report that analyzed the loan guarantee program that was initiated in the Carter administration back in 1978-1979.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NICKLES. We have tried it. It didn't work before. I am afraid it won't work again, because it is basically saying we don't believe the marketplace can make loans; we want the Federal Government to do it. We want to set up a board of politicians that will make loan guarantees, and not only guarantee 70 or 80 percent of the loan but the bill that is before us says they can guarantee 100 percent of the loan. 
   I find that to be very irresponsible. We are saying the Secretaries of Labor and Commerce and Treasury have better wisdom on whether or not to be making loans than bankers throughout the country. I think that is a serious mistake. 
   I also have objections because of the way this bill is drafted. It says this is an emergency. We just voted on lockbox. We are going to vote on lockbox again later this week. We do not want to spend any of the surplus of Social Security money on anything but Social Security. 
   This bill takes a bunch of that money, up to $270 million estimated by CBO, and says: Let's spend that on loan guarantees. Let's spend Social Security money. Let's move the caps. Let's adjust the caps. 
   We are violating the so-called lockbox which we say we do not want to spend. As a matter of fact, President  Clinton said it in the State of the Union Address 2 years ago: We won't spend one dime of this Social Security money on anything else. This bill would say, let's spend $270 million of it. I think that is a mistake. 
   I urge my colleagues, we shouldn't be declaring an emergency this week. We just did it 2 weeks ago. We did it 2 weeks ago as Kosovo money, $13 billion net for Kosovo. We declared that an emergency. We are declaring this an emergency; that is a $270 million cost. That shouldn't be counted. Even though it may have offsets on budget authority, it is not offset in outlays. It does move the caps up. It does violate the budget. I think it would be a serious mistake. 
   What about dumping? The Commerce Department has already taken action against Japan and against Brazil to stop illegal dumping. That is the proper avenue to be moving if there is illegal dumping. It is not to have the Federal Government come in and say: Let's make loan guarantees. Let's have the Federal Government underwrite it. Politicians know best. We don't think the marketplace can work. We think bureaucrats in three Departments should be making these loans. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote no on the cloture vote.

We also made a unanimous consent request last year a couple of times to have a limited number of amendments. That was not agreed upon. 
   I will inform my colleagues, I did discuss this last Wednesday with Senator DASCHLE and Senator KENNEDY. They expressed a desire to bring it forward. I said I think we have to have some kind of time constraints and limit on amendments. I did request that. They said they would be forthcoming in giving me that list. We have yet to receive it. Our staff requested it from them as late as Friday. We have yet to receive that list. Once we receive that list, we will try to see if we cannot negotiate some reasonable time agreement to get this thing resolved.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am happy to join Senator BOB SMITH as a cosponsor of the Davis-Bacon Repeal Act of 1999. 
   I believe Davis-Bacon repeal is long overdue. This 68-year-old legislation requires contractors to pay workers on federally-subsidized projects what the Labor Department determines is the local prevailing wage. What Davis-Bacon actually does is cost the Federal Government billions of dollars, divert funds out of vitally important projects, and limit opportunities for employment. 
   In my own State of Oklahoma, it has been proven that many ``prevailing wages'' have been calculated using fictitious projects, ghost workers, and companies established to pay artificially high wages. Oklahoma officials have reported that many of the wage survey forms submitted to the U.S. Department of Labor to calculate Federal wage rates in Oklahoma were wrong or fraudulent. 
   Records showed that an underground storage tank was built using 20 plumbers and pipefitters paid $21.05 an hour but no such tank was ever built. In another case, several asphalt machine operators were reported to have been employed at $15 an hour to build a parking lot but the lot was made of concrete, there were no asphalt operators, and the actual Davis-Bacon wage should have been $8 an hour. Ultimately, the Oklahoma Secretary of Labor established that at least two of the inflated Oklahoma reports were filled out by union officials. 
   The Davis-Bacon Act also diverts urgently needed Federal funds. After the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City, Mayor Ron Norick of Oklahoma City estimated that the city could have saved $15 million in construction costs had the President waived the Davis-Bacon Act. 
   This money could have been used to provided additional assistance to those impacted by the bombing and to further rebuild the area around the Murrah site. The Federal role in disaster situations should be to empower communities and foster flexibility so that rebuilding efforts can proceed in the best manner possible. 
   The Congress should repeal a law that discourages, rather than encourages, the employment of lower skilled or non-skilled workers. 
   Davis-Bacon began as a way to keep small and minority businesses out of the government pie, and today it still does, reaching even further. Repeal of the act will take wage setting out of the hands of bureaucrats and return the determination of labor costs on construction projects to the efficiencies of the competitive marketplace. This would result in a more sound fiscal policy through payment of actual market-based local wage rates; more entry-level jobs in construction industry for youth, minorities, and women; and more small businesses bidding on Federal contracts. 
   The Davis-Bacon Repeal Act will provide increased job opportunities for those who might not ordinarily have the chance to enter the workforce, the opportunity to learn a trade, and the opportunity to climb the economic ladder. 
   I applaud Senator SMITH for his efforts and appreciate the chance to cosponsor this bill.

<DOCNO>106-nickles-ok-2-19990527</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I have introduced legislation to clarify the proper depreciation of natural gas gathering lines. While depreciation is an arcane and technical area of the tax laws, continued uncertainty regarding the proper depreciation of these assets is having real and adverse impacts on members of the natural gas industry. 
   The purpose of this bill is quite simple--to clarify that natural gas gathering lines are assets that are properly depreciated over seven years. The legislation would codify the seven-year treatment of these assets as well as providing a sufficient definition for the term ``natural gas gathering line'' to distinguish these lines from transmission pipelines for depreciation purposes. 
   I believe that these assets should currently be depreciated over seven years under existing law, and that this is the long standing practice of members of the industry. However, it has come to my attention that the Internal Revenue Service has been asserting both on audits and in litigation that seven-year depreciation is available only for gathering assets owned by producers. The IRS has asserted that all other gathering equipment is to be depreciated as transmission pipelines over a fifteen-year period. This confounding position ignores not only the plain language of the asset class guidelines governing depreciation, but would result in disparate treatment of the same assets based upon ownership for no discernible policy reason. Moreover, this position ignores the fundamental distinction between gathering and transmission of natural gas long enshrined in energy regulation and recognized by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as well as other state and federal regulatory bodies. 
   Nonetheless, the IRS' position on this issue has resulted in the past in a division of authority among the lower courts. Although the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit recently held that the seven-year cost recovery period was properly applied to natural gas gathering systems under existing law, this legislation is needed to provide certainty and uniformity regarding the proper depreciation of these assets throughout the country. With extensive gathering systems totaling many thousands of miles, we cannot afford to allow the proper depreciation of these substantial investments to remain subjects of dispute. I urge my fellow Senators to join me in securing the adoption of this important legislation.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that will transfer ownership of land owned by the Department of Energy (DOE) and known as the National Institute of Petroleum Energy Research (NIPER) to the City of Bartlesville for business and educational purposes. 
   The NIPER facility was originally established in 1918 as the Petroleum Experiment Station by the U.S. Bureau of Mines. Its purpose was to provide research targeted to oil and gas field problems. In 1936, as World War II approached, additions to the Work Project Administration building were erected. Its research was expanded to help the war effort. During the 1973-1974 energy crisis, the center was renamed the Bartlesville Energy Research Center. When the Center privatized in 1983, it was renamed the National Institute for Petroleum and Energy Research (NIPER). NIPER closed its operations on December 22, 1998. 
   According to the Surplus Property Act of 1949, excess federal property is screened for use by the following: Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, and local and state organizations including non-profit organizations. At the conclusion of the screening process, a negotiated sale is conducted. If the property is still undeclared it goes to auction. 
   Unfortunately this process can take many years, thus preventing the city of Bartlesville from realizing any near-term economic boost from NIPER's redevelopment. Consequently, this legislation is needed to ensure that the NIPER facilities are redeveloped as quickly as possible in order to provide a prompt economic boost to the community. This legislation also will ensure that the NIPER facilities do not deteriorate while the property is being  processed through the lengthy steps of the Surplus Property Act and therefore make re-use impossible. 
   The City of Bartlesville intends to provide an educational facility and a place for business and industry that would facilitate job creation through technology and investment. The NIPER facility will also provide housing for administrative services for community development organization such as United Way, Women and Children in Crisis, and various homeless programs. This project enjoys the strong support of the Mayor of Bartlesville and other locally elected officials.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment Senator SMITH for his remarks. I join him in urging our colleagues to vote ``yes'' in favor of the tabling motion, to vote ``no'' on the Murray amendment. 
   Abortion is not a fringe benefit. People talk about a benefit that other people have. Abortion is the taking of a human life, so it should not be just a fringe benefit that is provided for at Government expense or provided for in Government hospitals. These are military hospitals. They do not have abortionists working in those hospitals. They have not been allowed through 1992. It was a change in the Executive order by the Clinton administration in 1993, saying we are going to have those. In 1993 and 1994, because of an Executive order--not because of a change in Congress--the Clinton administration said we want to provide abortions at military hospitals. 
   Guess what. They could not find abortionists. They could not find doctors to perform abortions at military hospitals, because they had been prohibited for at least 10 years, if not 12 years before, when that was not the case. The Hyde amendment said we are not going to use Federal funds to provide abortions. We did not have abortions performed at military hospitals. The Clinton administration tried to change that. They did not have anybody to do it. They tried to recruit them. 
   We changed the law in 1995. The Murray amendment would change it back by saying to military hospitals: You must provide abortions--a fringe benefit. Granted, maybe the person receiving the abortion now would have to pay a little bit, but the military is going to have to find somebody to perform them. They are going to have to make sure they have somebody who is trained to do it, and trained to do it right. So they are going to have to hire people to perform abortions, people right now they do not have--they have not been able to find them. Frankly, in 1993 and 1994 we changed the law. Congress changed the law in 1995, and I think they were right in doing so. 
   I think it would be a mistake for Congress to overrule that now and say we think that should be a standard benefit that is provided in Government military hospitals all across the world, so it could be basically a fringe benefit, it could be standard operating procedure--yes, anybody can get an abortion in a military hospital. It would be a method of birth control. I think that would be a serious mistake. 
   We have to realize, it is not a fringe benefit; it is the taking of an innocent human being's life. So I urge my colleagues to support Senator SMITH in the tabling motion with respect to the Murray amendment.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for this amendment. I think this is a very important amendment. I wish we would debate it at much greater length, because I am afraid, from some of the things I have read, from comments made by the President of the United States, that he is expanding NATO's role, commitment, obligation, frankly, far beyond the treaty we have signed, which has been so successful, the 50th anniversary of which we commemorated this year.  
   I look at the President's statement he made on May 27, 1997. He did this in concert with French President Chirac and Russian President Yeltsin in France. He stated:  
   In turn, we are building a new NATO. It will remain the strongest alliance in history, with smaller, more flexible forces, prepared to provide for our defense, but also trained for peacekeeping.  
   He goes on, and I will just read the last sentence:  
   It will be an alliance directed no longer against a hostile bloc of nations, but instead designed to advance the security of every democracy in Europe--NATO's old members, new members, and non-members alike.  
   A couple of days later he made a speech at the United States Military Academy, a commencement speech at West Point, May 31, 1997:  
   To build and secure a new Europe, peaceful, democratic and undivided at last, there must be a new NATO, with new missions, new members and new partners. We have been building that kind of NATO for the last three years with new partners in the Partnership for Peace and NATO's first out-of-area mission in Bosnia. In Paris last week, we took another giant stride forward when Russia entered a new partnership with NATO, choosing cooperation over confrontation, as both sides affirmed that the world is different now. European security is no longer a zero-sum contest between Russia and NATO; but a cherished, common goal.  
   Clearly, President Clinton is trying to redefine NATO's mission far beyond a defensive alliance, as our colleague from Kansas pointed out. The purpose in the charter of NATO under article 5 was a defensive alliance. Now he is expanding it to include nonmembers. He is including out-of-area conflicts. He includes ethnic conflicts or trying to resolve ethnic conflicts. I think, clearly, if he is going to do so, he needs to rewrite the NATO charter and submit that as a treaty to the Senate for its ratification. 
   So I compliment my colleague for this amendment. I think it is one of the most important amendments we will consider on this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Roberts amendment, and I thank him for his leadership.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which will right a wrong that has been in the tax code for too long. This legislation will clarify the U.S. tax treatment of foreign pipeline transportation income. This legislation is needed because current tax law causes active foreign pipeline transportation income to be unintentionally trapped within the anti-abuse tax rules of Subpart F. These anti-abuse rules were originally established to prevent companies from avoiding payment of U.S. tax on easily movable and passive income. Pipeline transportation income, however, is neither passive nor easily movable. Pipes are located where the natural resources and energy needs are--they cannot be placed just anywhere. Further, one a pipe is in the ground, it is tough to move. 
   Referring to the legislative history, we find that Congress did not intend these anti-abuse rules to target foreign pipeline transportation income. Rather, these rules were intended to reach the significant revenues derived by highly profitable oil related activities that were sourced to a low-tax country as opposed to the country in which the oil or gas was extracted or ultimately consumed. Furthermore, it is important to note that when these anti-abuse rules were being considered and then put into place, pipeline companies were not engaged in international development activities, rather they were focused solely on domestic infrastructure development. 
   Today, pipeline companies are continuing to actively pursue all development opportunities domestically, yet they are somewhat limited. The real growth for U.S. pipeline companies, however, is in the international arena. These new opportunities have arisen from fairly recent efforts by foreign countries to privatize their energy sectors. 
   Enabling U.S. pipeline companies to engage in energy infrastructure projects abroad will result in tremendous benefits back home. For example, more U.S. employees will be needed to craft and close deals, to build the plants and pipelines, and to operate the facilities. New investment overseas also will bring new demands for U.S. equipment. Yet before any of these benefits can be realized, U.S. companies must be able to defeat their foreign competitors and win projects. Unfortunately, current U.S. tax laws significantly hinder the ability of U.S. companies to win such projects. 
   We must act now if we are to ensure that U.S. companies remain competitive players in the international marketplace. There are incremental, low cost, reforms that we can and must make. My legislation--to clarify that U.S. tax treatment of foreign pipeline transportation income--is one such low-cost reform. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to bring current U.S. tax law in line with good tax policy. It is up to us to do all we can to keep America competitive in the global economy.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I do not support the adoption of the conference report on H.R. 1141, the fiscal year 1999 emergency appropriations act. 
   My decision to oppose this bill was not an easy one, Mr. President. This legislation contains funding for our U.S. military forces in Kosovo, Iraq, Bosnia, and elsewhere around the world. Regardless of my deep concerns about NATO's Kosovo operations, I realize that our military, already stretched to the limit by numerous foreign deployments, needs the resources provided by this legislation. Further, this bill contains funding to help farmers in Oklahoma who are finding it hard to get credit, and it will make sure disaster assistance for Oklahoma tornadoes does not deplete FEMA's funding reserves. 
   Unfortunately, it is also fiscally irresponsible. 
   H.R. 1141 provides $15 billion in new spending authority, $13 billion of which is provided for fiscal year 1999 and $2 billion of which is provided for fiscal year 2000. 
   The outlays flowing from this budget authority will reduce our budget surplus by $14.6 billion over the next five years. In fiscal year 1999 and 2000, when the entire budget surplus is attributable to the Social Security trust fund, this bill spends $11 billion of the surplus. 
   Additionally, $14.7 billion of the bill's total spending is designated as emergency spending, so that it is outside of the spending caps. $10.9 billion of the emergency spending is attributable to defense. 
   Unfortunately, the efforts of my colleague Senator GRAMM to remove the nondefense emergency designations failed earlier today. I supported him in that effort, and I am disappointed that more of my colleagues did not join us. 
   This legislation makes a mockery of our budget process. I believe Congress cannot continue to squander the economy's good fortune on a bigger, more invasive government. I believe the fiscal restraints we all agreed to in 1997 should be enforced, and I believe the budget we passed just a few weeks ago must be complied with. 
   A soaring economy and the 1997 budget agreement combined last year to produce the first budget surplus since 1969. What was Congress' reaction? 
   We abandoned all fiscal restraint and passed a monstrous Omnibus spending bill which included a record $22 billion in emergency spending. 
   With CBO predicting an even bigger budget surplus this year, $111 billion, we are rushing to enact a $15 billion emergency spending bill. 
   Since spending caps were instituted in the 1990 budget deal, Congress has appropriated $132 billion in emergency spending; $70 billion since the end of the Gulf War. The average annual emergency appropriation from 1993 to 1997 was $8 billion. 
   I believe that Senators must decide if they truly intend to abide by the budgets we pass, or simply ignore them. 
   As I have already mentioned, this bill includes $1.13 billion in new spending for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, partially offset by a $230 million transfer from the Community Development Block Grant program. This $1.13 billion is in addition to the $1.2 billion Congress has already appropriated to FEMA for fiscal year 1999. 
   While I support the work FEMA is doing to help my state recover from massive tornado damage, I believe the funding in this supplemental is far more than the agency needs. In fact, after touring Oklahoma tornado damage two weeks ago, the President asked for an additional $372 million for FEMA. I have been assured by FEMA that they do not require resources beyond this request to accommodate the Oklahoma disasters. 
   Unfortunately, the conferees on the supplemental decided to pile on $758 million more than the President requested. This extra funding has nothing to do with FEMA's current needs.  It has everything to do with the appropriations committee's desire to ``pre-fund'' the agency in an attempt to avoid the fiscal year 2000 spending caps. 
   Mr. President, I commend the majority leader for his efforts to keep the cost of this bill down and remove some of its objectionable provisions. However, I deeply regret that I cannot support this emergency supplemental spending bill. I believe we are losing our grip on fiscal sanity, and I fear that worse is coming later this year. I plan to work aggressively throughout this year to make sure we comply with the budget we enacted last month.

   Let me ask the question a different way. If I can have the Senator's attention, I only have 7 minutes and I have to go kind of quick. 
   Can he tell how much the cost is per cop per subsidy per year? It is graduated--100 percent the first year, and some other reduced percentage over the next 2 years. Can the Senator give us those percentages?

<DOCNO>106-nickles-ok-13-19990520</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NICKLES. Let me reclaim my time. On page 10 of the amendment, it says ``hiring cops.'' It says the bill is amended by striking $75,000 and inserting $125,000. 
   The cost of this program--the subsidy of this program right now of the current program, the one we have had for the last 5 years--has been a Federal subsidy per cop of $75,000. That is a pretty generous subsidy. I believe the first year subsidy is $50,000. In Oklahoma that may pay the entire salary of a cop. Maybe it doesn't in some places. But it does in my State. Then the subsidy is reduced the next couple of years so that by the fourth year, the total cost of the program needs to be borne by the city. 
   This subsidy is much greater. The Senator's amendment says the subsidy increases from $75,000 to $125,000. For  $125,000, you can pay, frankly, probably the entire 3-year salary in many areas--certainly in rural areas. And some people said we purported to help them particularly. 
   I just question the wisdom of doing it. 
   I have just two more comments. We are having the Federal Government provide for police in cities, and that is not a Federal responsibility. I think it is a mistake. 
   I also think it is kind of gratuitous to say this program is responsible for the decline in crime rates. I think that might be a lot more attributable to a change in political leadership in the states and in the Congress. I know the mayor in New York City has had a different philosophy on crime which is greatly responsible for the reduction in crime. Now he may take advantage of this program. In a lot of cities they are going to say: Hey, if you will help pay for our police force, thank you very much. 
   But why should we be doing it? Is that a Federal responsibility? 
   The whole purpose of the program initially, if I understand it, was that we were going to put 100,000 cops on the street, but then phase it out. This was not going to be an addiction for cities. We would phase it out where the Federal Government may pay 100 percent the first year, but by the fourth year the subsidy is reduced to zero. Put another way, where the Federal Government was paying most of the subsidy to get this thing started to hire new cops, but by the fourth year the cost would be totally borne by the city. Now we are saying let's extend it. Let's just keep this thing going. Let's have more Federal cops. 
   Then we passed an amendment yesterday, for the information of my colleagues, over my objection. But it passed by unanimous consent, unfortunately. It said that we have a COPS Program, and some of these cops are going into schools, and we will waive the requirement of local matching funds. In other words, the cops will be paid for 100 percent by the Federal Government. That is now part of this bill. We will waive the local contribution. So it won't be just a partial Federal subsidy, it will be a total Federal subsidy. 
   Is that the Federal Government's responsibility? I don't think so. 
   If we want to subsidize cities, subsidize cities. We are saying: Well, let's have the Federal Government do it. We have a problem. Let's just write a check. We don't think the city should be able to decide their own needs. 
   Maybe they need computers and cars, and not cops. Maybe they need a different training program. But we are saying, no: you are going to have the cops. 
   There is a study that was done by the inspector general, the IG. Maybe the Senator from Utah will allude to it. The IG's research said--in just one example--52 out of 67 grantees are receiving more grants; 78 percent either could not demonstrate that they redeployed officers, or could not demonstrate they had a system in place to track the redeployment of officers into community policing. At that point, the COPS office counted 35,852 officers under more programs toward the President's goal of adding 100,000: we hadn't made it to 100,000. It says 60 of 147 grantees--41 percent--showed indicators of using Federal funds to supplement local funding instead of using grant funds to supplement local funding. 
   In other words, hey, Federal Government, thank you very much. You are helping meet our budgets, and we appreciate the contribution. Meanwhile, it just so happens that we have a Federal Government that doesn't have a surplus, if you do not include the Social Security surplus. 
   I don't think we should be subsidizing cities. I don't think we should get cities addicted to this program that will never end, especially when you are talking about increasing the cost from $75,000 per police officer to $125,000. I don't think we can afford that. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment my colleagues from Tennessee and from Missouri for an outstanding amendment, one that I hope will be overwhelmingly supported by all of our colleagues. It is important we not discriminate, in a way we would say if this child happens to be under the IDEA program, individuals with disabilities, that the laws or the rules and regulations say we will not discipline you if you happen to carry a gun or bomb to school. 
   Clearly, we want any student who is carrying a gun or a firearm or bomb to school to be disciplined--any student. We want safe schools. This amendment would provide for that. It is a commonsense amendment. It is an amendment that should be passed overwhelmingly. 
   I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to the amendment.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, yesterday, Senator INHOFE and myself, Congressmen J.C. WATTS, FRANK LUCAS and STEVE LARGENT, as well as the Governor of Oklahoma, and James Lee Witt, Director of FEMA, toured the Oklahoma tornado disaster. 
   I have been in the Senate, I guess, 19 years now, and I have looked at the damage of several tornadoes in the State for the last many years. But I have never seen this type of devastation nor this level and this extent before. This may be the most devastating tornado that we have had in total damages in our State history. It has certainly produced one of the largest tornadoes, probably the largest number of tornadoes. I read one press account that said there were 45 tornadoes in the State of Oklahoma on Monday. One particular tornado was much larger than the others. Many reports said it was a quarter of a mile wide, or maybe half a mile wide, and at some points it was maybe a mile wide and stayed on the ground for a long period of time--some people said maybe as much as 2 hours. 
   What we did see was a tremendous amount of damage--a devastating amount of damage that destroyed, it was estimated, 1,500 or 2,000 homes. We will find out. Unfortunately, it has taken 40-some lives. I say unfortunately. I think Oklahoma is very fortunate. I think the fatality toll could have been in the hundreds if not thousands, because we looked at homes that were just totally demolished as if a bomb had gone inside each one of those homes and absolutely exploded the homes. There was nothing but just some elements of rubble. To think that people survived in many of these homes is truly a blessing, truly a miracle that I think we will find recounted day after day. 
   Needless to say, we are moved by the tragedy, and also by the compassion that is being expressed by so many people from across the country. 
   We were there to say that we wanted to help, that our government would help, that we will do everything that we can. Our government steps in in times of tragedy and national disasters to help lend assistance. And we will do that. 
   I will also say that won't be enough. It will take a lot of support from individuals, from churches, from communities, from families and friends to try to replace these homes and these families, and to make them whole again. And they will. They will survive. They are very solid. 
   One of the things I will never forget was seeing this area that is totally demolished and one house which hardly had anything left standing, and there was an American flag flying very high with people very proud. 
   Mr. President, it makes me proud to be an Oklahoman. It makes me proud to be an American, and proud to represent the great people of Oklahoma.  
   With that, Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator INHOFE. 
   Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend and colleague, Senator MCCAIN, for recognizing me, and I also compliment him for his leadership, although I oppose the resolution that is before us. I also wish to compliment Senator WARNER for his comments. And I agree with his comments. I think we have had some good debate. I think it is an important debate. 
   I have heard many things on both sides of the issues. I happen to concur with a lot of the statements that some of the proponents have made on this resolution. I just disagree with its conclusion. I think it is going to be interpreted, this resolution, as a blank check for the President to do whatever is necessary to win in Kosovo, whatever that means. 
   ``If you win, you are going to own Kosovo.'' Are you going to occupy Kosovo? Maybe Kosovo is second prize;  first prize will be Serbia. And then we get to run Serbia. I do not think we want to do that. I think it would be a mistake. 
   I stated on the floor, prior to the bombing resolution, that I thought it was a mistake. And I think it really kind of resulted as a failure in diplomatic effort. 
   As a matter of fact, I think the diplomatic mission in this area has been a disaster. Unfortunately, it has resulted in a humanitarian disaster. 
   Mr. President, could we have order?

   Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Chair. 
   I want to go through a little bit of the chronology to show, at least in my opinion, how we got into the bombing campaign, because what this resolution is kind of implying is, well, the bombing campaign is not working. And we call it a campaign because the polls don't like the word ``war.'' 
   It is interesting, I was with some of our colleagues, and we went to the Kosovo region into the Balkans. We talked to our military planners. They use the word ``war.'' But the politicians do not use the word ``war.'' It doesn't poll very well. People don't like war. So this is called an air campaign. This is a mission. 
   I disagree with that terminology. How did we get into the air campaign? How did we get into this air war? 
   I want to go through several statements, because, as I mentioned in my opening comment, I think this has been a diplomatic disaster that has led to a humanitarian disaster. It is not working, and some people are saying, let's double the ante again. Let's throw in troops now and then maybe we can win. 
   I do not think that would be the result. I want to win, but I question, what is winning? Are we going to have a NATO presence, a U.S. presence in Kosovo forever? Are we going to go all the way into Serbia and occupy Belgrade and take Milosevic out and have him tried as a war criminal? He is a criminal. He is a thug. I have met with him. He doesn't tell the truth. He is responsible for a lot of serious atrocities, and he should be punished. But something tells me this body is not going to say, let's mount up 250,000 or 300,000 troops so we can invade Serbia and occupy Serbia and go door to door at the expense of that. So I just mention that. 
   Let me go through a little chronology of how we got into the bombing campaign as classified by the State Department. Just to put this in context, we started bombing on March 24. The Senate voted on March 23. 
   This is from the New York Times on February 19:  
   As the deadline neared for a settlement in the Kosovo peace talks, the military and diplomatic pressure mounted today on President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to choose between tolerating NATO-led peacekeepers in Kosovo or suffering NATO air strikes for refusing them. 
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said she had again spelled out the choice in a telephone call to the Yugoslav leader and that she would return Saturday to the talks, which she visited last week.  
   That was on February 19th. February 20th:  
   President Clinton warned President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia today not to ``stonewall'' a peace settlement in Kosovo and threatened to bomb Serbia if Mr. Milosevic missed the Saturday deadline for an end to the peace talks.  
   So we are threatening bombing. ``Mr. Clinton said the two NATO allies''--in this case, he is talking about President Chirac of France--stood ``united in our determination to use force if Serbia fails to meet its previous commitment to withdraw forces from Kosovo and if it fails to accept the peace agreement.'' 
   I will talk about the peace agreement in a moment. 
   He also says, this is President Clinton, ``I don't think there is an option other than NATO airstrikes.'' This was in the New York Times, February 20th. 
   Also February 20th, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says, at a press conference:  
   Let me stress that we expect nothing less than a complete interim agreement, including Belgrade's acceptance of a NATO-led force and a civilian mission building on OSCE's Kosovo Verification Mission. Until the parties have accepted all provisions of the agreement, preparations for NATO military action will continue and if that agreement is not confirmed by Tuesday, Secretary General Solana will draw the appropriate conclusions. 
   I.e., the bombing will begin. It is also interesting that on February 21 she says, according to the New York Times, ``If this fails because both sides say `no,' there will be no bombing of Serbia.'' Mrs. Albright said that on February 21, as Rambouillet talks were winding down. 
   It is also interesting to note that 2 days after Rambouillet ended, the European Union envoy to the talks, Mr. Petritsch, said, ``the Yugoslav President decided he was not going to accept NATO troops--and mustered his own forces and propaganda to prepare for this military showdown.'' 
   It is also interesting to note in this same article, it says, In a meeting with Italy's new Prime Minister in the Oval Office with the President on March 5, Mr. Clinton said Mr. Milosevic had ``accepted almost everything,'' according to Italian officials, except for the international peacekeeping force. I added that comment. That wasn't in the quote, but that is what he had not accepted. 
   This individual was skeptical. He asked the President, what was the plan if there was no deal and NATO airstrikes failed to subdue the Serbian leader. The result, he said, would be 300,000 to 400,000 refugees passing into Albania and crossing the Adriatic into Italy. 
   ``What will happen then,'' Mr. D'Alema wanted to know, according to the Italian officials. Mr. Clinton looked at Mr. Berger for guidance; that is, Sandy Berger. ``NATO will keep bombing,'' Mr. Berger replied. After Rambouillet fell apart, a follow-up conference was called in Paris 3 weeks later. While the world waited, Mr. Milosevic continued to build up his forces in and around Kosovo.  
   A defining moment came on March 18 at the International Conference Center on the Avenue Kleber in Paris. To polite applause, four ethnic Albanian delegates signed the peace plan that would give their people broad autonomy for a three-year interim period. The Serbs did not sign. That paved the way to airstrikes. 
   Ms. Albright said that setting up a deal signed only by one side was a crucial step forward. ``Signing Rambouillet was crucial in getting Europeans two things,'' she said. ``Getting them to agree to the use of force and getting the Albanians on the side of this kind of a settlement.''  
   February 23, this is, again, Secretary Albright talking about Rambouillet.  
   Rambouillet talks to a close. The Kosovo Albanians have requested two weeks for consideration. Belgrade must be ready to move by then as well, or prepare to face the consequences. This period of reflection should not be taken by either side as an excuse for military activities on the ground. We're particularly concerned by recent movements of Serb forces and harassment of members of the Kosovo Verification Mission. The mission's security must be assured, and there should be no doubt that NATO's January 30th decision permitting Secretary Solana to authorize airstrikes remains in force. We also call on the Kosovo Liberation Army to refrain from provocations.  
   So there is a 2- or 3-week period for the Kosovo representative to consider this negotiation. 
   March 15, this is in the New York Times:  
   A massacre in the Kosovo village of Racak of more than 40 ethnic Albanians by Serbian forces in January spurred the current efforts of Ms. Albright to persuade NATO to authorize air strikes against the Serbs if they reject a settlement.  
   So there was a massacre, according to this press report, of 40 
   people who were killed in January. That led to this effort to use military force in a bombing campaign. 
   March 18, again, this is Secretary Albright, State Department:  
   So the situation is as clear as it could be. The Albanians have said yes to the accords and the Serbs are saying no. At the same time, Belgrade's security forces are stepping up their unjustified and aggressive actions in Kosovo and if Belgrade doesn't reverse course, the Serbs alone will be responsible for the consequences.  
   The war drums are rattling. This is March 19, a few days before the bombing commences. This is also in the New York Times.  
   With the Kosovo talks at a dead end, and the Yugoslav leader more recalcitrant than ever, the Clinton Administration was publicly pushing the threat of airstrikes today, but officials said they have no option but diplomacy, at least for another week. 
   Instead of responding to the threats, Mr. Milosevic has moved in the opposite direction, building up his troops in Kosovo to such an extent there are now deep concerns over whether the 1,400 international monitors in Kosovo can leave safely before his troops trap them by sealing their exit route.   
   Also in the same article it says, ``American military is warning that airstrikes may not be easy.'' 
   March 22, a couple of days before the bombing campaign begins.  
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that Holbrooke would warn Milosevic that the NATO allies are preparing comprehensive missile and bombing strikes that could devastate much of his military infrastructure. ``He will make clear that Milosevic faces a stark choice: to halt aggression against the Kosovar Albanians and accept an interim agreement with a NATO-led implementation force, or bear the full responsibility for NATO military action.'' 
   This is just a couple days before, the night before bombing began, on March 23, on Larry King's program. Mr. King asked Secretary Albright:  
   Is there a timeframe here, Madam Secretary? Like you are going to keep this up for 3, 4 days, let us know by Saturday? Is there a plan?  
   Secretary Albright:  
   Well, again I am not going to reveal the operation time line, this is a very well-thought-out military mission. I think it would be a mistake. You wouldn't want me to give the details here so that President Milosevic could hear everything that is going on. But it is going to be a sustained attack, and it is not going to go on for an overly long time.  
   Then she continues and says: ``No, I mean what we have said. Ambassador Holbrooke said to him''--talking about Milosevic--``he had an opportunity to accept accords signed by the Kosovar Albanians in Paris and have a peace agreement. He had an opportunity also to stop the fighting. Ambassador Holbrooke told him that if he did not do that, there would be very serious consequences. He has not accepted those two threshold objectives and, therefore, he knows there are now serious consequences.''  
   The next day the bombing began. I might mention that Secretary Albright said, ``We are very well prepared. This is a well-thought-out campaign.'' I just take issue with that. 
   I am not going to say I told you so, but on the debate we had on March 23, the day before the bombing campaign commenced, I made a speech. On the floor of the Senate, I urged colleagues to vote no because I said I was afraid it would be a mistake. I said--and history has proven--that bombing alone doesn't work. The President has said we are only going to bomb and not use ground troops. Then, I also said that I was afraid it might make things worse. Instead of stopping atrocities, it may turn a guerrilla war into an all-out war. I am afraid that is what has happened. I think we had a diplomatic failure and, as a result, now we have a humanitarian disaster, a catastrophe. 
   I was in Kosovo a week or so ago with some colleagues and I saw some of these refugee camps. There are 600,000-plus people who are now outside of Kosovo, driven away from their homes--in my opinion, because of a diplomatic disaster. We turned a guerrilla war into a real war. We started the bombing campaign, and I stated this on the floor of the Senate before the bombing started. I said:  
   Mr. Milosevic, instead of his response being to move back into greater Serbia away from Kosovo, moving his forces out, he may be more assertive and aggressive, and he may want to strike out against the U.S. airplanes that are flying. He might find that unsuccessful. He might have no success against our pilots and our planes, but if he is not successful against our planes, what can he be successful against? Maybe the KLA, or maybe he would be more aggressive in striking out where he can have results on the ground. So by initiating the bombing instead of bringing stability, we may bring instability. We may be igniting a tinderbox that has been very, very explosive for a long time.  
   I am afraid that is what happened. The bombing campaign has made things worse. I am afraid if we go in and say let's use all necessary force, send in 300,000 troops, we may make things worse. I don't want to compound a past mistake that was a mistake, in my opinion, diplomatically as well as a mistake now through the air campaign, and certainly has turned into a humanitarian disaster. I don't want to further compound that. 
   Again, when I read the resolution it says to accomplish NATO objectives--we are going to use all necessary force and other means to accomplish United States and North Atlantic treaty objectives with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
   I have the Rambouillet agreement. I wonder how many colleagues have read this thing. I urge you to do it. It is 44 pages. 
   I am looking at some of the comments or statements made in this Rambouillet accord. They said, ``We negotiated and Mr. Milosevic would not sign this accord.'' I will read one paragraph. I brought this to the President's attention last week, and Secretary Albright said: Mr. Milosevic would not even talk to us about an international peacekeeping force. In one paragraph, we were insisting that if he didn't comply, we were going to bomb him. On page 41, paragraph 8 of the appendix B, it says this, talking about the NATO force--and some people say let's give NATO all necessary force. This is one of the things about which we said we are going to bomb you if you don't sign:  
   NATO personnel shall enjoy, together with their vehicles, vessels, aircraft, and equipment, free and unrestricted passage and unimpeded access throughout the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including associated airspace and territorial waters. This shall include, but not be limited to, the right of bivouac maneuver, billet, and utilization of any areas or facilities as required for support, training, and operations.  
   Basically, it says NATO gets to occupy not only Kosovo but Serbia as well. Isn't that interesting? I brought that to the President's attention. I don't know if he knew that was in there. I kind of doubt it. Secretary Albright almost acted taken aback. ``What are you doing reading the Rambouillet agreement?'' This is what we were saying he has to sign, or else ``we are going to bomb you.'' I think that is diplomacy failure. It has led to a bombing campaign. We threatened that we were going to bomb and now our credibility is at stake. I have heard that time and time again. 
   I want NATO to be credible, but for crying out loud, when you are so arrogant to say here is our wisdom, here is this accord, we determined this is in your best interest and you must sign it or else we are going to bomb you--I stated in my speech on the bombing resolution that I don't think you can bomb a country into submission or into signing an agreement. I doubted then that Mr. Milosevic, after the bombs were going to fall, was going to raise the white flag and say: Now I see the wisdom. That didn't happen in Bosnia. It got his attention in Bosnia. In fact, the Croatian army was ethnically cleansing their own, and he was losing the war. He decided to be more interested in a peace agreement. 
   I think Rambouillet was a diplomatic disaster and a failure and to say, OK, well, we tried to bomb them into agreeing to this, but I don't think that is going to work; maybe now we should use ground forces so they can sign onto NATO objectives. I think it is a mistake. What should we do? I don't want to just complain, but I think this is a disaster. If you had seen the refugee camps, you would know it is a disaster. There were several hundred thousand people. Senator MCCAIN pointed out that it is not just the several hundred thousand people who are outside of Kosovo and Albania and Macedonia, but the hundreds of thousands who are displaced inside of Kosovo. What should we do? I have heard several people in the administration say that he must withdraw forces and accept this international peacekeeping force, and if he stops all the aggression, then we will stop the bombing. 
   Mr. President, I think we need to have two or three things happen simultaneously. He needs to get his aggressive forces out. We need to have an international peacekeeping force to protect the returning refugees allowed back in. And simultaneously with that, we need to stop the bombing. We need to do all of them simultaneously. 
   The big difference I can see going on now is the negotiation of who should compose the international peacekeeping force. I heard Secretary Cohen say, and I have read time and time again, that it must be NATO-led or a NATO corps. They are talking about U.S. participation. I think our objective should not be so much just what is the composition of the peacekeepers; it should be to keep the Kosovars safe and sound and return them back to their homes. Those people are living in terrible conditions, living in tents. They have absolutely nothing to do. They are waiting hours to pick up food. They have to wait for a long time to use the restroom facilities--latrines would be a more accurate description. It is not a pretty sight. 
   In the first place, I want to compliment many of the international relief agencies that are doing a miraculous job. They have a very difficult, if not impossible, job. 
   Mr. President, I think we need a very aggressive diplomatic effort. I don't think this is a situation where one says, ``Well, let's just double up our military forces; well, if the bombing sorties''--and we are running so many thousands of these bombing sorties--``that is not working; let's throw in another three or four hundred planes, double up the bombing; let's get ready to have ground troop invasion into Kosovo, into Serbia.'' I don't think that is the solution. I think we need a diplomatic solution. 
   I believe I heard Strobe Talbott, Under Secretary of State, yesterday say we are not negotiating. I almost fell off my chair when he said that. Obviously, Jesse Jackson did some negotiation. I want this administration to be negotiating. They need to be negotiating aggressively to save lives, to minimize the human disaster, the humanitarian disaster, the diplomatic disaster. Let's do everything we can to allow the Kosovars to return safely as soon as possible--hopefully as soon as possible under the guise of an international peacekeeping force. And it can be with NATO participation. It can be U.N. led. It can be the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. But let's make it happen, and make it happen soon. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this resolution tomorrow. 
   Again, my compliments to the sponsor of the resolution. I think this debate is important. He was requesting the debate, and I think we have had an excellent debate as well. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal Royalty Certainty Act. The domestic oil and gas industry is an essential element of the United States economy. The Administration needs to acknowledge the critical importance of this industry  and stop hindering it with regulatory obstacles. Right now, our domestic oil and gas procedures are reeling from low oil prices. In Oklahoma alone, 50,000 jobs are dependent on the oil industry. Last year, we had over 350 producing oil rigs in the country, now we have slightly over 100. The industry is in a state of depression, not a decline, and these conditions pose a threat to our national security and our economy. 
   The Administration's policies have failed domestic producers. What is needed is a comprehensive plan to maintain the viability of the domestic oil and gas industry. Part of that plan should be to eliminate or greatly reduce the administrative costs of the current royalty program with simple, clear and certain guidelines. We need to eliminate rules that are burdensome and excessively costly. The Nation cannot afford to allow the devastation of our domestic oil and gas industry to continue. 
   We should be taking action to encourage growth in the industry. Instead, the Administration has advocated policies that undermine it. We must raise our country's awareness and reverse this course of action by providing relief from big government and burdensome regulations. We must provide this critical segment of our economy fairness and efficiency in their contracts with the federal government. 
   Several years ago, I began taking a closer look at oil and gas produced from federal leases and the Department of the Interior's administration of those lease contracts. I was pleased when Congress passed the Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act which I introduced and which became law in August of 1996. What that Act accomplished was to streamline the accounting processes for federal royalties. While that Act made significant steps forward in simplifying the payment of federal royalties, the heart of the issue is still before us--what royalty does a lessee owe to the government under its lease contract for oil and gas produced from a federal lease? When a person or company contracts with the federal government, it should know exactly what is owed under the contract. 
   While this should be a simple question with a simple and unambiguous answer, that is unfortunately not the case today. There appears to be multiple answers, changing answers and a morass of regulatory interpretations that change over time. Such regulatory obstacles prevent industry from knowing what they owe and being able to make business decisions with that knowledge. It also prevents the collection of royalties easily and efficiently. Having a clear understanding of the correct amount due is the central and critical element of any successful royalty management program. Without it, the program cannot operate fairly, efficiently or cost effectively. 
   In January 1997, MMS issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for a new oil valuation rule. The proposed rule was met with a firestorm of protests and thousands of pages of comments have ensued. Despite serious problems that have been raised with the proposal, its workability and its fairness, the Department has repeatedly stated that it will publish its rule as final. As a result, this Congress has imposed two moratoriums on the proposed rule and is in the process of imposing another. Congress and Industry have repeatedly attempted to initiate negotiations with DOI/MMS to no avail. The current moratorium continues until June 1, 1999. Secretary Babbitt has stated that the MMS would publish a final rule on June 1, 1999 and in Congressional briefings the MMS has stated that ``MMS does not believe that further dialogue on the rule would be productive.'' DOI Communications Director Michael Gaulding stated to Inside Energy that ``we're sticking to the position we've taken. It gives us an issue to demogogue for another year.'' Rather than perpetuate the moratoria I believe Congressional action is needed. I am therefore today introducing the ``Federal Royalty Certainty Act.'' This Act addresses and resolves issues related to royalties both when they are paid in value and in amount. 
   This bill amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the Minerals Lands Leasing Act and provides that when payment of royalties is made in value, the royalty due is based on oil or gas production at the lease in marketable condition. When royalty is paid in kind, the royalty due is based on the royalty share of production at the lease. If the payment (in value or kind) is calculated from a point away from the lease, the payment is adjusted for quality and location differentials, and the lessee is allowed reimbursements at a reasonable commercial rate for transportation, marketing, and processing services beyond the lease through the point of sale, other disposition, or delivery 
   My bill will codify the fundamental, longstanding principle that royalty is due on the value of production at the lease. The Department of the Interior recognizes this principle and very recently has said ``royalty payments [should be] based on no more than the value of production at the lease'' (News Release, MMS 2/5/98), there should be agreement on this codification. This legislation provides proper adjustments when sales are made downstream of the lease to arrive at values that equal the value of production at the lease. In addition, this legislation includes a consistent basis for valuation of royalty both onshore and offshore. Importantly, this legislation also resolves many of the core issues related to the proposed rule on oil valuation in a manner that is fair and equitable to the people of the United States and the producers who have entered into contracts with the federal government. These provisions will reduce the costs of a complicated system that spawns disputes, while preserving the taxpayer's right to a fair return for its resources. As I have said on many occasions, we need to reduce unnecessary, burdensome and excessively costly regulations. We need a little common sense. 
   In summary, all interested parties need to work together to arrive at a workable, permanent solution--a system whereby the government can collect what is due in a manner that is simple, certain, consistent with lease agreements and fair to all parties involved. The Royalty Fairness bill was a significant first step to simplify and eliminate regulatory obstacles in the Department's accounting procedures. I believe that the Federal Royalty Certainty Act is an important next step.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, since taking control of Congress in the 1994 elections, the Republican majority has delivered on their promise to balance the federal budget. The Congressional Budget Office says that this year the unified federal budget will have a surplus of $111 billion. Over the next 5 years, these surpluses will total nearly $912 billion. Of the total surplus, $768 billion is attributable to Social Security, and $144 billion in attributable to the rest of the government. 
   The Republican majority has also delivered the tax relief we promised. In 1997, we passed the largest tax cut in 16 years, which is bringing significant relief to taxpayers this year, including a $400 per child tax credit (rising to $500 next year), a 20% capital gains rate, expanded IRAs, and tax credits and savings incentives for education. We also enacted a landmark IRS reform bill, eliminated President's Clinton's 18-month holding period on capital gains, and passed an expansion of Education Savings Accounts. 
   The fiscal year 2000 budget we are now considering will build upon these successes. Our budget is based on three principles: 
   1. Devote the entire Social Security surplus ($768 billion over 5 years) to debt reduction, thus saving it for Social Security reform, 
   2. Maintain the fiscal discipline of the 1997 Bipartisan Balanced Budget Agreement by sticking to the discretionary spending caps, and 
   3. Return the ``rest of government'' surplus ($144 billion over 5 years) to working Americans in tax cuts. 
   Mr. President, our budget is radically different from the one proposed last month by President Clinton. 
   In his 1998 State of the Union address, the President said, ``Tonight I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus, that is every penny of any surplus, until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century.'' 
   However, according to CBO, the President's budget spends $58 billion of the Social Security surplus this year, and $253 billion over the next five years. Even if you ``credit'' the President's proposal to purchase equities for the Social Security trust fund, he still spends $40 billion of the Social Security surplus this year, and $158 billion over the next five years. 
   President Clinton's proposal to save Social Security by ``devoting'' 62 percent of the budget surplus to it is a scam. The President would deposit $446 billion in IOU's into the Social Security trust fund, on top of the $768 billion that would be deposited there anyway. White House officials admit the President's plan does not extend by one day the year (2013) when Social Security benefits will begin to exceed payroll taxes. 
   Additionally, the President's budget includes a Medicare scam based on the same faulty logic as the Social Security scam. The President would transfer $123 billion of the surplus to the Medicare trust fund over the next five years. Again, the practical effect of this transfer is nothing more than more IOU's in the trust fund. And the Medicare prescription drug benefit, a huge applause line in the State of the Union, is nowhere to be found in the budget. 
   Other new programs touted in the President's State of the Union address, such as the promise for Universal Savings Accounts, are also nowhere to be found in his budget. The Secretary of the Treasury has said that the USA accounts are a tax cut, but it is becoming clear that the program will involve a progressive, refundable income tax credit totaling $96 billion over 5 years, $272 billion over 10 years. This massive welfare expansion will nearly double what we will already spend on the EIC program, $139 billion over 5 years, and $293 billion over 10 years. Secretary Rubin has also hinted that USA accounts will likely be limited to persons without employer-provided pension programs, and that anyone making over $100,000 will not be able to participate. 
   Further, despite claims of ``enormous debt reduction'', CBO says the debt held by the public will be $432 billion higher under the Clinton plan after five years than under current law. Gross public debt will be $973 billion higher. 
   The President's budget also breaks the discretionary spending caps by $33 billion in fiscal year 2000, and $434 billion over five years. 
   Finally, despite an estimated $20 trillion in tax revenues over the next 10 years, the President's budget contains no tax cut. In fact, the President's budget includes a gross tax increase of $165 billion over ten years, and a net tax increase of $89 billion.  
   I would like to include for the RECORD a couple of tables and a chart which compares the Republican budget with President Clinton's budget. 
   Mr. President, I congratulate the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, and his staff for their fine work in developing this budget. I think it sets us on the right path to reduce the debt, cut taxes, and reform Social Security and Medicare.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, in 1995, the Department of Defense agreed to evaluate a British missile, the Starstreak, for use as a helicopter borne air-to-air missile as an inducement to the British Ministry of Defence to choose the U.S. Army Apache Longbow helicopter as its own attack helicopter over a competing European candidate. The British did indeed agree to buy the Apache. 
   Increasingly, military helicopters are being outfitted with air-to-air missiles that increase their lethality, a development that began with the Russian HIND helicopter. According to the Army Air to Air Mission Need Statement, the proliferation of technology available on the open market will make it likely that U.S. forces will encounter threat helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, lethal unmanned aerial vehicles and cruise missiles. The Army believes the probability is increasing that Army helicopters will encounter an airborne threat and recognizes that Army helicopters need an improved air-to-air capability to counter that threat. 
   This is why the Congress has been directing the Army to fulfill its commitment to the British Ministry of Defence and its own air-to-air needs by conducting an operational test and evaluation of the Starstreak through a live fire side-by-side shoot-off of the Starsteak and the Army's preferred alternative, the air-to-air Stinger. 
   Mr. President, at this time I would like to engage the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee in a colloquy along with my colleague from Oklahoma and the distinguished senior Senator from Vermont.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, the majority leader will soon be coming over to make a unanimous consent request concerning the vote on a resolution dealing with Kosovo. I have been involved in the negotiations of the resolution. I might read it for my colleagues, for the information of my colleagues, and then I am going to state my opposition to it. But for the information of all of our colleagues, it is our hope and our expectation we would have a vote on this resolution in the not too distant future, possibly as early as 6 or 6:30 or 7 o'clock. So I wanted my colleagues to be aware of that. 
   Mr. President, this resolution authorizes the President of the United States to conduct military air operations and missile strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia, and Montenegro. 
   The resolution reads,  
   Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America and Congress assembled, That the President of the United States is authorized to conduct military air operations and missile strikes in cooperation with our NATO allies against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro.  
   It is very simple. It is very short. There are not a long list of ``whereases,'' not a lot of confusion. It says we authorize the President of the United States to conduct airstrikes against Serbia. 
   I oppose this resolution. I will take a couple of minutes to explain my opposition. I understand and I have great respect for many of our colleagues who are supportive. I have joined with colleagues who went to the White House on Friday and also earlier today to talk to the President and hear his side of the issue. He tried to make a very strong case for airstrikes and for military intervention. He didn't convince me. I respect his opinion. I just happen to disagree with him. 
   Time and time again I ask, If we are going to war, why are we going to war? Make no mistake, if we conduct airstrikes against Serbia, we are going to war. I don't think we should do that lightly. 
   I tell my colleagues, the resolution that we are voting on, in my opinion, is a very important resolution. It is probably one of the most important votes we will conduct, certainly this session of Congress. Maybe Members will look back over their Senate career and it may be one of the most important votes Members will cast in their Senate career. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote no on this resolution. That 
   means I think that we are making a mistake by conducting a bombing campaign in Serbia. A bombing campaign will also lead to ground campaigns. A lot of people have the false assumption that if we have airstrikes, that is it. Many times there has been a tendency by this administration--and maybe previous administrations as well--that we can do things by air and that will do it. 
   We had an air campaign, we had military strikes in the air against Iraq in December--I believe December 18, 19, and 20. It was a significant military operation. Why? Because we wanted to get the arms control inspectors back into Iraq. We bombed them like crazy. Guess what. We don't have any arms control inspectors in Iraq today, so air didn't do it. Saddam Hussein is now able to build weapons of mass destruction. The air campaign didn't change his policies one iota. 
   What about in Serbia? The whole purpose of this--I will read from yesterday's New York Times, an interview with Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State,  
   Two days after President Clinton warned that the Serbs had gone beyond ``the threshold'' of violence in their southern province, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said she was sending Mr. Holbrooke to present Mr. Milosevic with a ``stark choice.'' 
   That choice, she said, was for him to agree to the settlement signed in Paris last week by the ethnic Albanians ..... or face NATO air strikes.  
   In other words, if the Serbs don't sign on to the agreement that was negotiated in France, they are going to face airstrikes. In other words, we are going to be attacking a foreign country because they refused to allow an international force to be stationed in their country. That is what the Paris agreement is. 
   Some of our colleagues say they will vote for airstrikes but they won't vote for ground forces. The Secretary of State says we are going to bomb them until they agree to sign up to a peace agreement, a peace agreement that calls for stationing 28,000 international troops into Kosovo. 
   I just disagree. I don't think you can bomb a country into submitting to a peace agreement. That is more than coercion, and I don't think you get real peace by coercing somebody. Maybe cajoling people, maybe a little leverage here and there, but to say we will bomb your country until you sign a peace agreement is probably very shortsighted and not real peace, and to station the 28,000 troops into hostile territory I think would be a very serious mistake. 
   I have heard the President's arguments. I haven't made the argument this is not in our national interest, but I will say there is--I started to say a civil war is going on in Kosovo, but it is not even to the point of a civil war. There is certainly an armed conflict. There is guerrilla warfare going on. There has been sniping going on. There have been people killed on both sides. I think that is unfortunate, but it has been happening. But this is not the only civil conflict that is going on around the world. Yet in this conflict, we will take sides. Maybe if you declare it is a civil war going on, a total civil war going on in Kosovo--why should we be taking sides? Should we be the air force for the KLA, the Kosovo Liberation Army? Should we be trying to help them fulfill their goals? 
   Their goal is not autonomy; their goal is independence. They were somewhat reluctant to sign on to the France so-called 
   peace agreement because they didn't want autonomy; they wanted independence. They will never be satisfied until they have independence. The French peace accords say we will insert this peacekeeping force of 28,000 troops for 3 years, we will have autonomy at that time, and then we are somewhat silent on what happens at the end of 3 years. If anyone has talked to the KLA, they know that the KLA wants independence. Should we be intervening to the extent of taking that side? 
   Some of my colleagues say if Serbia is really massing and having military actions against the KLA, instead of us just bombing, why don't we just give them some support? Why don't we give them some munitions and help them defend themselves? It is similar to the argument many of us made in Bosnia: Instead of sending troops, we wanted to take the arms embargo off and allow them to defend themselves. Senator Dole stood on the floor many times and said let's allow them to defend themselves. 
   Some people made that same argument today, dealing with the Kosovars. The problem is, the peace agreement  that has been negotiated says we will disarm the KLA. I think the chances of that happening are slim, if nonexistent. They will hide the arms. We will not be successful in disarming, nor do I really think that we should. We will be very much involved in a civil war. We are taking the side of the Kosovars. Many of the Kosovars are great people and I love them and some are very peace loving, but there are some people on the other side, on the KLA side, who have assassinated and murdered as well. 
   I have serious, serious reservations about getting involved in a civil war. I have very strong reservations about the ability to be able to bomb somebody to the peace table and making them agree to a peace agreement that they were not a signatory to. 
   I am reminded by some of our friends and colleagues that this is a continuation of President Bush's policy. As a matter of fact, in December of 1992 President Bush--and he was a lame duck President at the time--issued a very stern warning to Mr. Milosevic: If he made a military move in Kosovo, there would be significant and serious consequences. Mr. Milosevic rightfully respected President Bush, and he didn't make that move. I supported President Bush in making that statement. I think he was right in doing so. 
   However, there is a big difference between that statement and saying we will move militarily if he moves aggressively against the Kosovars. There is a big difference between that and saying we will bomb you until you agree to a peace agreement, and part of that peace agreement is stationing 28,000 troops in Kosovo. There is a big difference. I hope our colleagues will understand that difference. That is one of the reasons I am vigorously opposed to this resolution. I don't think you can bomb a sovereign nation into submission of a peace agreement. 
   Let me mention a couple of other reservations that I have. Somebody said, What about the credibility of NATO? NATO, for 50 years, has helped sustain peace and stability throughout Europe. It has been a great alliance. That is true. NATO has been a great alliance. It has been a defensive alliance. NATO has never taken military action against a non-NATO member when other NATO countries weren't threatened. Now we are breaking new ground and we are moving into areas which I believe greatly expand NATO's mission far beyond the defensive alliance that it was created under. 
   Another reservation I have: The Constitution says that Congress shall declare war; it doesn't say the President can initiate war. The President started at least consulting Congress on Friday. He also consulted with Congress today, Tuesday. We understand that war is imminent. I don't consider that consultation. I remember about 4 weeks ago when Secretary of State Albright and Secretary of Defense Cohen briefed a few of us on the Paris negotiations, or the negotiations in France. They basically said: We are trying to get both sides to sign; we think maybe the Kosovars will sign, but the Serbs and Mr. Milosevic are not inclined to. But if we can get the Kosovars to sign, we will bomb the Serbs until they do sign. 
   I left there thinking, you have to be kidding. That is their policy? I want peace. I want peace as much as President Clinton. I want peace as much as Secretary Albright, throughout Yugoslavia, but I don't think by initiating bombing we will bring about peace. I am afraid, instead of increasing stability, it might increase violence. 
   There might be adverse reactions that this administration hasn't thought about. Instead of bringing about stability, it may well be that the Serbian forces are going to move more aggressively. In the last 24 hours, it looks like that may be the case. So instead of convincing Mr. Milosevic to take the Serbs out of Kosovo, they may be moving in more aggressively. It looks as if that is happening now. Instead of dissuading him from oppression on the Kosovars, he may be more oppressive, more aggressive, and he may run more people away from their homes and burn more villages. Instead of bringing stability, it may be bringing instability, and it may be forcing, as a result of this bombing, Mr. Milosevic--instead of his response being to move back into greater Serbia and away from Kosovo, he may be more assertive and aggressive and he may want to strike out against the United States. If airplanes are flying, he might find that is unsuccessful. I hope he has no success against our pilots and our planes, but if he is not successful against our planes, what can he be successful against? Maybe the KLA, or maybe he would be more aggressive in striking out where he can have results on the ground. 
   So by initiating the bombing, instead of bringing stability, we may be bringing instability. We may be igniting a tinderbox that has been very, very explosive for a long time. I hope that doesn't happen, but I can easily see how it could happen. I have heard my colleague, Senator INHOFE, allude to the fact that former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger alluded to that. 
   I will read this one sentence: `` The threatening escalation sketched by the President to Macedonia, Greece and Turkey are, in the long run, more likely to result from the emergence of a 
   Kosovo State.'' Well, the President, in this so-called peace accord, is supporting autonomy for Kosovo. I have already stated that the Kosovo Liberation Army doesn't want autonomy, they want independence. If they are an independent state, many people see that usually aligned with Albania and may be including the Albanians in Macedonia. So you have a greater Albania which would be very destabilizing, certainly, toward the Greeks and maybe other European allies. So the peace accord says we don't want independence for Kosovo, we just want autonomy. 
   Former Secretary of State Kissinger says maybe that makes it more dangerous and maybe violence would be escalated in that process. Instead of being a stabilizing factor, it may be an escalating factor. That is not just me saying that. That is Henry Kissinger and other people I respect a great deal saying that, also. 
   I am glad we are going to be voting on this resolution. We are going to have this vote--at least that is our expectation. I know the leader is going to propound a request before too long. It is important that we vote on this. It would be easy for this Senator, or any other Senator, to say we are never going to vote on this; we can stop this, and frankly, if you stop it long enough, maybe the President will be bombing and then you can say, hey, it doesn't make any difference, he already started bombing. I think that would be a mistake. We ought to have an up-or-down vote. Is this the right thing to do or not? 
   So I urge my colleagues to support the leader in his efforts to come to an agreement on a vote on this resolution. I, for one --I say ``for one'' because even though I am assistant majority leader, I have not asked one colleague to vote one way or another on this resolution. Some issues are too important to play partisan politics on. I am not playing partisan politics. I refuse to do so. These are tough votes. 
   I remember the vote we had on the Persian Gulf war in 1991, authorizing the use of force. We already had 550,000 troops stationed in the Persian Gulf ready to fulfill our obligations as outlined by President Bush to remove Saddam Hussein and the Iraqis from Kuwait. We had a good debate on the floor. It wasn't easy. It was a close debate and a close vote--52-47. I thought it was a good vote the way it turned out. 
   I am going to vote against this resolution because I think it is a mistake. Maybe I am wrong, and if bombing commences, I hope and pray that every single pilot will be returned safely, and that there will be peace and harmony and stability throughout Kosovo. But I am concerned that we are making a mistake. I don't believe you can bomb a country into submission and force them into a peace agreement that they determine is against their interest. I don't think you can bomb a country and say we are going to bomb you until you agree to have stationed 28,000 troops in your homeland. And this is Serbian homeland, and if you go back centuries, fighting has been going on in this country for centuries. 
   One other comment. Somebody said, ``What about the atrocities?'' I am concerned about the atrocities, but we have to look at what is in our national interest. There were 96 people killed in Borneo last weekend. In Turkey, something like 37,000 Kurds have lost their lives. They want independence. The  Kurds in Iraq want independence; they want their own homeland. What about in Sudan where there have been over a 
   million lives lost? What about Burundi, where 200,000 lives have been lost. Or Rwanda, where 700,000 lives have been lost? 
   We have to be very careful. We had a Civil War in this country 130-some years ago, and 600,000 Americans lost their lives. I am glad we didn't have foreign powers intervene in our Civil War. I think that would have been a mistake. I am afraid that we are making a mistake by intervening in the war now going on in Kosovo. I hope this resolution that we are getting ready to vote on is not agreed to. I urge colleagues to vote no on the resolution. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment Senator STEVENS for the statement he just made. I think he is exactly right. 
   I want to follow those comments and read from the paper what the purpose of this proposed bombing strike is. This is the front page of the New York Times quoting Secretary Albright. She says:  
   Mr. Milosevic has a stark choice. That choice was for him to agree to the settlement signed in Paris last week by the ethnic Albanians who make up most of Kosovo's population or face NATO air strikes.  
   In other words, Mr. Milosevic has to agree to the peace settlement, and he never has agreed to it, but if he doesn't agree to it, he is going to be bombed. 
   Bombing is an act of war. So our Secretary of State and our President on Friday have said they support this agreement. The Serbs agree to this settlement that NATO has negotiated and that the Kosovars have now signed, or else they are going to be bombed. 
   I made the comment Sunday, I said that is a crummy way to start a war. I look at that as us starting the war. Are the Serbians right now at war against Kosovo? No, Kosovo is actually part of Serbia. It has been for hundreds of years. Is there a lot of fighting, a lot of tension? Yes. The Kosovo Liberation Army, for a little over a year, has been attacking Serbian forces for the purpose of independence for Kosovo. As a matter of fact, there was a celebration in one of the towns that was attacked in the last 2 days, a celebration recognizing the fact that about a year ago in February was the first martyr for the KLA, the Kosovo Liberation Army. 
   The goal of the Kosovo Liberation Army isn't autonomy. The goal of the Kosovo Liberation Army is independence. They have been fighting for independence. They have been attacking Serbian police in the process, and they have been killing some. Then Serbia usually responds with a lot more force. They have a lot more force. They have a bigger army. They have tanks, and they have killed a lot of people. I am not saying any of this is right. I am just saying this shouldn't be a purpose for the United States to go to war, to initiate bombing, because Serbia has not yet signed on to a peace accord that we think is the right thing to do.  
   I, for one, have serious reservations about it. What is the peace agreement that we have decided they have to accept? It is autonomy for Kosovo, and the second part of it is 
   stationing 28,000 foreign troops in Kosovo. 
   Again, Kosovo is part of Serbia. We are telling them, you must agree to this or you are going to be bombed. I think that is using NATO's air force as a bargaining tool to try to bomb them into submission to a peace accord that they do not want to sign. Most sovereign nations wouldn't want to sign onto a deal that would put 28,000 foreign troops on its soil. 
   I think the administration is wrong in this area. Don't get me wrong. I think Milosevic is a tyrant. I think he is guilty of a lot of bad things. That still doesn't mean that I think we should go to war with Serbia. If we start a massive bombing campaign, we are going to war. 
   I think Senator STEVENS is right. The Constitution says Congress shall declare war. Our forefathers showed great wisdom. They did not want to get involved in a lot of wars. They knew that the elected representatives--the Congress, House Members and Senate Members--would be very reluctant to do so because we would be sending our constituents that we represent into war, so we wouldn't do it lightly. Granted, we also say in the Constitution the President is Commander in Chief, and he has the authority, and we give him that authority, to respond if U.S. lives, U.S. interests are at stake, but that is not the case. And something has to happen before Congress has a chance to convene and pass a declaration of war. We have all kind of assumed that. 
   Frankly, this President has tried to expand that power and I think even abused that power in saying he has the right to agree to an international force that is going to conduct a war. 
   NATO has never done that. Senator STEVENS is exactly right. NATO is a defensive alliance, and it has been successful. It was formed to make sure that if Soviet aggression against our European allies would happen, that we would all work together to repel that aggression. The very fact that we had significant forces in training and integrated training, demonstrates it has been a successful alliance. Never has NATO gone in to say we are going to go into another country that is not threatening neighboring countries, not threatening part of the alliance, and conduct military affairs to quell a civil war. 
   If we conduct bombing, if NATO conducts bombing into Serbia, we are going to be on the side of the KLA, the Kosovo Liberation Army. I said before, their goal is not autonomy; their goal is independence. 
   I will tell my colleagues, there are some of our allies who have very serious problems about that happening. The Greeks primarily have serious reservations about the wisdom of that. I just wonder how well thought out this has been, or if we conduct the bombing, what happens? 
   I have heard President Clinton say we want to restore stability in the Balkans. It may be just the opposite result. We may start bombing and the Serbs may really escalate their attacks. I will read a comment from an article in today's New York Times:  
   The Yugoslav foreign minister told CNN, ``We are not looking for confrontation,'' but his country considers any NATO force dispatched to Kosovo to be an aggression against sovereign territory, Yugoslavia.  
   Other reports were that if the NATO forces would strike into Serbia, they would use that as an excuse to be more aggressive against the KLA. They might try to strike against the United States, but they hopefully won't have very much success against our airplanes. U.S. planes are going to be too high 
   and too fast, too sophisticated to attack. They will see the United States is now taking sides with the Kosovars and so instead of attacking the United States, where they can't really be successful, they will be attacking the Kosovars. Instead of stopping violence and bringing stability and peace to the region, we might be escalating the war. We might be starting the war. 
   I mentioned that to President Clinton. I do not want to see us start the war, but if we start bombing we may turn a guerrilla effort, that is going on right now between the KLA and Serbs, into a full-fledged war between the Serbs and Kosovo and see the loss of life greatly escalate, yet still not be successful. Just because we bomb does not mean that Serbia is going to say, OK, fine, you can bring the 28,000 troops in and station them in Kosovo. They may not agree with that. They may escalate their warfare. You may have a greater loss of life. 
   Then we are going to have another decision. Are we going to go after that 40,000 Serbian military force that is in Kosovo? Are we going to be attacking those tanks? Are we going to be attacking the platoons? Are we going to be going after those people? You can do only so much, as we all know, with airpower. How deeply engaged in this civil war are we going to become? Again, if our purpose was to bring about peace and stability, can that really happen, if we ignite that type of warfare throughout Kosovo and into Serbia? 
   I am afraid we may be starting something we can't get out of; I am afraid we might be there for years and years and years. 
   I have heard some of my colleagues say, wait a minute, President Bush was for this. I haven't heard President Bush say that he was for this. In December of 1992, President Bush issued a warning to Mr. Milosevic: Don't you dare go in and start genocide against the Kosovars or there will be a price to be paid. 
   Frankly, I supported that. It worked. It worked for one reason--because I think Mr. Milosevic respected President Bush, which is more than what I can say at the present time on U.S. leadership, or even NATO leadership. That is regrettable. But also I didn't hear President Bush, in December of 1992, saying he wanted to have a multinational peacekeeping force stationed in Kosovo, occupying Kosovo. He didn't say that. 
   He just let him know that if he started a very significant genocide in Kosovo, there would be a price to be paid. I do not mind if this President lets Mr. Milosevic know that. If he started slaughtering a large number of people, yes, there would be a military action against him. It does not mean we are going to be occupying Kosovo with 28,000 troops. I think that signal can be sent. 
   That is not what I am reading in the paper. Today I read in the paper that Mr. Milosevic must agree to the settlement signed in Paris last week by ethnic Albanians that make up most of Kosovo's population or face NATO airstrikes. In other words, we are going to be striking if they do not agree to a peace agreement, and that calls for autonomy for Kosovo and calls for stationing 28,000 troops in their country. 
   I believe that is unrealistic. I do not think that is the right negotiation. I do not think you can bomb another country into submitting to a peace plan. If they did, we would be putting 28,000 troops, in my opinion, into very hostile territory. They would be vulnerable to sniper fire, and that is not a very good situation either. 
   I have very, very strong reservations about deploying U.S. ground forces into Kosovo. I have told that to the President. I think that is a serious mistake. I hope we will not do it. That is part of the peace plan. 
   A lot of people are not aware of it. They seem to think we are trying to bring Milosevic to the peace table. I want him to come to the peace table. I want him to sign a peace agreement. I want him to have peace in Kosovo. But what this administration is saying is, unless he agrees to the plan that has already been agreed to by NATO and the Kosovars, including the deployment of 28,000 troops, we are going to begin bombing him. 
   Are we going to keep on bombing him until he agrees to the stationing of 28,000 troops in Kosovo? I do not think that is realistic. Then if we station 28,000 troops there, one, they are vulnerable to attack because it is a hostile area and, two, they will have to be there for a long, long time. 
   This area does have a history of fighting that goes back for many, many centuries. The Ottoman Empire, the Hapsburg Empire, 1389, the war in Kosovo--they have been fighting for centuries. There is real ethnic violence there. There are real problems, and I understand that. 
   I do not think you can station U.S. peacekeeping forces everywhere in the world where there is violence. There are reports that 80-some-odd people  were killed in the last few days in Borneo; 50-some were killed in Russia by 1 bomb. I heard my colleague from Delaware say in 1 village, 40-some people were assassinated, murdered, or they were killed. I do not know that we have seen the autopsy reports. We do not know whether they were carrying guns or not. They were shot point blank. We heard that. I do not know that to be the case. 
   There are lots of atrocities when you start fighting, and we know that. I know we had a civil war in this country 130 years ago, and we had hundreds of thousands of Americans who were killed. I am glad we did not have other countries intervening in our Civil War. I just think that would have been a mistake. I know both sides were trying to get the French and the British involved, but I am glad they did not get involved. 
   I seriously question the wisdom of us getting involved in this war, or if we are going to get involved in this one, why we are not getting involved on behalf of some of the Kurds in 
   Turkey, where the loss of life has been some 37,000 in the last several years. Or what about in Sudan, where there have been over a million people massacred in the last 10 years? What about in Burundi, where 200,000 people have been murdered? I could go on and on. 
   We have to be very, very cautious when we start deploying U.S. forces around the world. In some cases, we have done it with very noble intentions, but it has not worked. It did not work in the early eighties in Lebanon. It did not work in Somalia. We had to bring our troops back and, unfortunately, we brought back a lot of our troops in body bags. 
   Again, I urge my colleagues to think seriously about what we are doing. For crying out loud, let's not be threatening bombing because the Serbs have not signed on to a peace accord that we somewhat arrogantly say, ``This is what you have to do, and if you don't agree, you're going to be bombed.'' I do not think you can bomb a country into submission to sign a peace agreement, especially one that also says they have to agree to foreign troops stationed on their soil for an indefinite period of time. That is a mistake. 
   I compliment my friend from Alaska for his statement. Also, Mr. President, I reiterate that Congress needs to assert its constitutional prerogative, and that is that Congress has the right under article I, section 8, of the Constitution to declare war. Our forefathers did not want to make it easy for us to be involved in foreign entanglements, and they wanted Congress, i.e., the support of the American people, to be involved before we would ever do so. I think they were exactly right. 
   If President Clinton wants to initiate this effort, he should be asking Congress for a declaration of war. I think we, as leaders in Congress, should cooperate to bring that resolution to the floor and have a debate, a discussion, and have a vote. 
   Right now we have been talking about an amendment: No funds will be used for this combat or airstrikes or stationing troops until or unless Congress authorizes it. That may be the most expedient way of getting this up for a vote. 
   I personally would like to see a straight resolution, just like we had in the Persian Gulf war, which we voted on in January of 1991, which authorized the use of force in the Persian Gulf. We had a very significant debate. Most of my colleagues who were here at the time said that probably was the most important vote they ever cast. 
   I would like for us to have that. That resolution, I say to my colleagues, passed by a vote of 52 to 47, but it was significant, it was intense. We knew what we were talking about. We had significant debate on it. It was a healthy debate, and Congress supported the resolution. Airstrikes, I tell my friends and colleagues, started shortly after that resolution. 
   I do not think we are ready for that in this case in Kosovo today. The administration needs to make their case. They then should request a resolution of authorization--we should prepare one or they should prepare one--and we would vote on it. I hope we will do that before hostilities are initiated by NATO; i.e., the United States. 
   Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Alaska for his indulgence, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I introduce S. 606 for Senator MACK, Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator HATCH, and myself. This bill is intended to resolve litigation between the federal government and Kerr-McGee Corporation and Kerr-McGee Chemical, LLC (successor to Kerr-McGee Chemical Corporation) and Global Exploration and Development Corporation. This legislation embodies an agreement that has been reviewed and accepted by the Hearing Officer and a three judge reviewing panel. The Department of Justice has no objection to this legislation. In addition, this legislation would also make it a criminal act to distribute certain information relating to explosives, destructive devices, and weapons of mass destruction. This bill was reported by the Committee on the Judiciary in this form during the 105th Congress. 
   As background to this relief for Kerr-McGee and Global Exploration, in 1964, they first filed applications for phosphate prospecting permits in Osceola National Forest. Under Sec. 211(a) of the Mineral Lands Leasing Act, the Secretary can only grant prospecting permit applications following a determination that the public interest will be served by doing so. The U.S. Forest Service must also consent to the issuance of the prospecting permits. The permits were granted, and the plaintiffs subsequently discovered phosphate deposits. 
   The plaintiffs then filed applications with the Department of Interior for leases to mine the deposits in January of 1969. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to leases is governed by the Mineral Lands Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. sec. 181 et. seq.) which requires the Secretary of Interior to issue leases to a permittee that has discovered a ``valuable deposit'' of mineral. The U.S. Geological Survey, the Bureau of Mines and the Office of Minerals Policy Department all confirmed that valuable deposits had in fact been discovered (valued at $100 to $300 million in 1970's dollars). 
   Kerr-McGee filed suit in 1973 and Global filed suit in 1978 seeking the immediate issuance of the leases. In 1981, the U.S. Forest Service began setting out the requirements for reclamation. The Department of Interior concluded the reclamation technology did not exist based on an Environmental Assessment (``EA'') prepared by Interior and issued in January of 1983. Based on that conclusion, the plaintiffs' applications for leases to mine the deposits were rejected. 
   Agency personnel had told plaintiffs that they would be able to comment on the EA findings 
   before their final issuance. By law, the government was required to permit the applicants to participate in the EA process by submitting comments and expert analysis on the feasibility of reclamation. Plaintiffs were never given a chance to participate in the EA process, to show feasibility of reclamation, or to comment on the draft EA. 
   In 1984, the Florida Wilderness Act (Pub. L. 98-430, 98 Stat. 1665) was enacted which prevented the issuance of phosphate mining leases in Osceola, effectively foreclosing a legal remedy since plaintiffs could no longer ask for reversal of the prior decision or for relief for damages incurred. The House Committee Report accompanying the Act stated that ``in the event the courts ultimately determined that applicants have established lease rights, [the Act] provides that leases will not be issued. The applicants would instead be compensated as required in accordance with constitutional principles.'' H. Rpt. 98-102 Part I, 97th Cong., 1st Sess., at 7. 
   The plaintiffs pursued their case in federal district court and the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The Court of Appeals vacated the district court's judgment and remanded the case with instructions to dismiss the suit as moot in light of Florida Wilderness Act. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims then questioned whether or not it had jurisdiction to hear the case, leaving plaintiffs without a forum to be heard. 
   Under 28 U.S.C. 2509, a congressional reference empowers a judge of the Court of Federal Claims to sit as a Hearing Officer, hold a hearing and determine the facts of the case. The Hearing Officer's findings and conclusions are then reviewed by a three-judge panel. The panel then adopts or modifies the findings and conclusions and submits its report to the Chief Judge who then transmits the recommendations to the house of Congress which referred the case. 
   On Jan. 10, 1991, H. Res. 29 and H.R. 477 were introduced during the 102nd Congress to refer the case to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in order to compensate plaintiffs for any damages incurred on account of the failure of the Secretary of the Interior to grant and permit mining operations pursuant to phosphate leases in the Osceola National Forest. On July 10, 1991, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Law and Government Relations held hearings on H.R. 477 and H. Res. 29. On October 3, 1991, the Subcommittee reported the resolution, with a technical amendment, to full Committee. On July 21, 1992, the House of Representatives passed H. Res. 29, referring H.R. 477 to Court of Claims. The formal Congressional reference confirmed jurisdiction for the plaintiffs' suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. 
   In the Court of Federal Claims, the Government moved for summary judgement. The Court ruled that plaintiffs did not have a legal claim but did have an equitable claim since the government failed to comply with the legal requirement of the EA. The court ruled that the Secretary of Interior had made an error in denying phosphate mining leases on the basis of an EA without allowing plaintiffs the opportunity to comment. The court concluded that the error was not harmless. 
   Remaining was the question of fact whether reclamation was feasible, according to Forest Service standards as of January of 1983. A 6 week evidentiary hearing was held on that issue from October 13 to December 14, 1995. Plaintiffs presented leading experts in reclamation who showed they could have successfully reclaimed the land, that the analysis in the EA was scientifically incorrect, and that EA members who concluded successful reclamation had their conclusions omitted. 
   Before the court issued its opinion, the parties agreed to a joint stipulation of settlement and submitted this stipulation to the Court: Global is to received $9.5 million; Kerr-McGee is to receive $10 million, which it will return to the government as partial payment for a Superfund cleanup site in Louisiana; and Kerr-McGee Chemical LLC is to receive $0. Global, Kerr-McGee and the Department of Justice accepted the report of the Hearing Officer, dated November 18, 1996, and the Review Panel endorsed the decision. 
   On November 18, 1996, the court published its recommendations to Congress that the disputes be settled for the amounts set forth in the joint stipulation of settlement. The court's recommendation was based on a finding that the settlement was fair, just, equitable and supported by the evidence. As noted in the Hearing Officer's report, ``if the case were to proceed to final disposition and plaintiffs to prevail, then the Government would face a potential liability substantially in excess of the proposed settlement amounts. Conversely, however, a victory for the Government would not assure it of protection against all future liability.''  
   This legislation would implement this settlement, and we urge its prompt consideration and approval by the Senate. 
   For the information of all Senators, I have included the House Committee Report from the 105th Congress which provides a very clear background and the need for this provision. 
   In addition, the bill includes language related to the prohibition of distribution of information related to destructive devices, explosives, and weapons of mass destruction in furtherance of a violent crime. This language was added to this legislation during markup of H.R. 1211 during the 105th Congress in the Senate Judiciary Committee by Senator FEINSTEIN  and is a reasonable resolution of an issue pushed by Senator FEINSTEIN for several years. 
   I urge quick consideration and passage of this overdue and important legislation.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I wish to compliment my colleague and friend, Senator JEFFORDS, for his leadership on this bill. I am confident that tomorrow we will pass this bill. 
   Also, I wish to compliment Senator FRIST and others on the Labor Committee who have worked very, very hard to put together a good package, a responsible package, to allow the States to have more flexibility in dealing with Federal education programs so they can deliver a better product, and that is basically improving the education of our kids. That is a very noble goal. 
   By doing so, they are saying we want to set up a program, which we have already done in a pilot program in a few States, and make it available to all States. All State Governors, Democrats and Republicans, say we want to have that flexibility, give us the ability to ask the Federal Government for a waiver from a lot of the rules and regulations in managing these programs so we can do a better job. 
   Frankly, they are telling us they can do a better job, without Uncle Sam's rules and regulations, in trying to manage their schools. They did not need so much Federal help. It is really what the States were telling us. 
   Democrats as well as Republicans were saying that. I think they are exactly right in doing so. I compliment the sponsors of this legislation, and I am going to be pleased tomorrow when we pass it. 
   Unfortunately, there are a few amendments that are circulating around that I think would be very detrimental to this bill. As a matter of fact, I believe if they are adopted, we shouldn't pass this bill. 
   The main amendment I am going to address is the one that maybe has received more attention than others--the so-called 100,000 teachers that Senator KENNEDY, Senator MURRAY and others have been so laudatory about, saying, ``This is exactly what we need to improve the quality of education.'' 
   A couple of comments: One, I think if schools need more teachers, the schools should be able to make that decision. That decision should not be made in Washington, DC. When I say ``the schools,'' I am talking about the school board administrators, the parents, the teachers, the local officials, the school board officials, the Governor. They should be making that decision. I do not think that is Senator KENNEDY's decision to make. I do not think that is the U.S. Senate's decision to make. Nor do I think it should be made by President Clinton. That is not our responsibility. That is a State responsibility. That is a local responsibility. 
   Frankly, the local government knows best what they can do to improve education, not Washington, DC. It may be a school in the Northeast needs more insulation because of the cold or maybe they need more computers, maybe they need a new building, maybe they need building repair, maybe they need more teachers. I don't know. I wouldn't think that we have the guts or the gall to say we know best, the government knows best, but when I look at Senator KENNEDY's amendment, that is exactly what it says. 
   Here we have a national program. We are going to have 100,000 teachers. It is going to be paid for by the Federal Government. Keep in mind, almost all teachers, K through 12, are paid for by State and local governments, yet now we have an amendment on the floor of the Senate that says, We want 100,000 teachers at a cost of over $11 billion, to be paid for by the Federal Government--100 percent paid for by the Federal Government. In some of the districts, the teachers will be paid for 65 percent by the Federal Government and 35 percent by the State government. 
   It is interesting. I have asked, What is the impact? Somebody said that we did part of this last year. We passed a bill last year that cost $1.2 billion, and we increased the number of teachers 30,000. Boy, that has really done a wonderful job. I looked at my State. As part of the bill that we passed last year, part of this 30,000 teachers, Oklahoma is going to get 348. Big deal. For the life of me, I do not think that is a Federal responsibility. Oklahoma is going to get $13 million to help pay for 348 teachers. Big deal. Is that really what the Federal Government is supposed to do? Is that our responsibility? I don't think so. At least Republican amendments are saying, ``Instead of teachers, let's at least allow the States to have the option. If we are going to have Federal money, let's have the money go to give the schools the option for teachers or for meeting our responsibility with kids that have special needs, giving States the flexibility to use the money either for schools or students with special needs,'' which we already have a Federal law stating the obligation for the States to do it, an unfunded mandate. So at least we give the States some flexibility. That is not in Senator KENNEDY and Senator MURRAY's amendment. 
   I am looking at this amendment. There are lots of things in here that deal with regulations and how the money is going to be used, basically telling the States here is how to do it; we know best. The Federal Government knows best. Senate Democrats know best. President Clinton knows best. 
   For the life of me, I just think that is a serious mistake--the Federal Government passing a bill last year that says Oklahoma gets 348 more teachers paid for for 1 year. I might mention, if we 
   don't pay for it next year, what happens to that Federal teacher? I hate to say it, but we have 1,800 schools in the State of Oklahoma. We are going to get 348 teachers. That is about one-fifth or one-sixth of a teacher for each school, not each class, each school. Does that really make sense? I don't think it makes any sense. Which school is going to get a teacher? Which school is not going to get a teacher? 
   I know my colleagues on the Democrat side have an amendment that says we are going to have a Federal school building program, and the President proposed billions of dollars, I guess $11  billion, for more teachers and several billion dollars for more school buildings. Which school buildings are going to be replaced? Which school building is going to be repaired? We are going to be making those decisions in Washington, DC? Is that the proper use for incremental dollars? Do they get more bang in educational value out of buildings or in teachers? We are saying we don't know. We are saying why don't we free up some of the resources that we are now spending from the Federal Government to the States and let the States make the decision? Let the local school boards make the decision. Let the teachers make the decision. Let the parents make the decision. 
   Instead, my colleagues that are offering the amendment are saying, no, no, we will decide; the Federal Government is going to decide we need 100,000 teachers. I disagree. 
   It is interesting. Somebody said, well, we really need lower class size. For a little bit of history, most States have already been reducing the average sizes of their classes. That trend is expected to continue. My guess is that President Clinton feels, since he has promoted this, class size has really declined. In 1955, the average public school class size in the United States was 27 students. In 1975, it dropped to 21. Today it is down to 17.3. If you are talking about only elementary schools, the numbers are slightly higher, but they still show a decline, from 30.2 in 1955 to 18.5 today, 18.5. ``Well, it ought to go to 18.'' Well, it looks to me like demographically we are going to 18 anyway. That will happen whether the Federal Governments gets involved in hiring 100,000 teachers or not. We have spent $1.2 billion last year to hire 30,000 teachers. That money is only good for 1 year. Then under this bill, it says, well, let's spend more than that. Let's just spend billions every year. 
   It has amounts allocated: $1.4 billion for the year 2000; $1.5 billion for 2001; $1.7 billion for 2002, and on; I see $2.8 billion for the year 2005. This says here is a recipe where we can have the Federal Government spending more money, and it stops at the year 2005. We are going to pay for these Federal teachers only up to the year 2005 and then stop? Sorry, States, now it is your responsibility. 
   I just think that is a serious mistake. In my State of Oklahoma, I don't know exactly the number of teachers that we have, but 348 teachers, when we have 1,800 schools and lots and lots of teachers in each school. I just fail to find the wisdom in doing it. 
   There is a difference in philosophy between the Democrats and Republicans on this issue. We have basically said the States and local school districts should make a better decision. Senator KENNEDY and some of my colleagues on the Democrat side seem to think that they have the answer. They are going to dictate 100,000 teachers. They are going to dictate billions of dollars of the Federal Government building school buildings. I think that is a mistake. 
   I had my staff--this is almost 2 years old, a year; it was done May 15, 1997, so it is a little obsolete--I asked them, How many Federal programs are involved in education right now? I know there are a lot, but I don't know them all. I haven't served on the Labor and Education Committee for a long time--I was on it for several years--but I know there are a lot. As a matter of fact, there are a lot more than I imagined. 
   I will put this in the RECORD and maybe somebody can update it 
   for me. According to this, in May of 1997, there were 788 Federal education programs, 788 Federal education programs that were spending at that point $968 billion. That is a lot of money. That is about one-seventeenth of all the Federal spending that we are spending today. Someone can't say we do not have any emphasis in education. What we have is a lot of Federal programs, probably 700-some, too many Federal programs, and we are spending billions of dollars, almost $100 billion, probably if this is updated it is over $100 billion, because I know we had significant increases in the last couple of years in education. Just in the Department of Education alone, there were 307 education programs, totaling $59 billion. Again, this is 1997. 
   So it shows you there is a lot of Federal input. I personally think we need to consolidate most of those programs, get rid of them, and give the money and the power back to the States and to the local school boards. What I think is, we do not need to have another program. ``Here are 100,000 teachers. Let's make this, instead of 788 programs, 789.'' I think President Clinton has proposed 8 or 9 new education programs alone. 
   We do not need more education programs. What we need to do is free the States and local school boards to where they can do a better job with the resources they now have without all the strings and redtape and bureaucracy they now have to comply with. 
   So I hope that will be what we will do. I hope that tomorrow when we are voting on this series of amendments, when we have amendments that are trying to micromanage how States spend money, run their schools, that we will table those amendments, that we will defeat those amendments, and we will pass the Ed-Flex bill which will give more flexibility to States and local school boards in actually administering Federal programs. They can do a better job in educating our kids, to improve the quality of education for the children of America. 
   So I encourage my colleagues to vote against these amendments that try to micromanage education from Washington, DC, and pass the Ed-Flex bill to give the flexibility to the States and to the local school boards to do a better job for our kids. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to speak on a couple of issues that concern me greatly in the arena of foreign policy. 
   First, a couple of comments concerning the administration's recent policies in Kosovo. I am very, very concerned that the administration, in the negotiations in France, is making a mistake. I hope that is not the case. I wish that is not the case. Maybe I don't have all the information the administration has. But I have been to Kosovo. I have been in Pristina. I have met with Mr. Milosevic. I do happen to think he is a tyrant. I think he has conducted a lot of atrocities in Bosnia and Kosovo against people--right now the Albanians in Kosovo. I think he is a bad guy. I think the international community needs to stand up to him. 
   But I am very, very concerned about the administration's policy, or objective, where they are talking about committing 4,000 U.S. troops out of a contingency of 28,000, where they are sending our military in without a militarily achievable objective and without an exit strategy. I am really concerned because I think we are going to be there for a long, long time. It seems like we are duplicating what happened in Bosnia, which the administration calls an outstanding success. But it looks to me like we are stuck in Bosnia. We are spending billions and billions of dollars there. Nobody seems to know exactly how much money we have spent in Bosnia. I heard some people say we have already spent $12 billion in Bosnia. Some people say the real figure is closer to $20 billion or $22 billion. But we are spending billions of dollars. 
   I remember in 1995 the President, when he committed the troops, said they would only be there for a year. As a matter of fact, the year would expire right around election time in 1996. He thought he was going to get them out before election time. But he didn't. Then he said he would extend them another year. And now they are on 3 years plus, and they are still in Bosnia, and we know they will be in Bosnia for a long, long time. 
   I visited our troops there. They are very dedicated and very committed. They are also very, very expensive peacekeepers. I have urged the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, that if we are going to get involved in Kosovo let s not repeat what we have done in Bosnia. It is not the same amount of cost and consternation for European troops, who live in Poland or live in Germany or live in Italy, to spend a little time in Bosnia or Kosovo as it is for somebody in the United States. They are able to go home at various points. We are not able to do that. We are awfully expensive. 
   So I just make the point that I am very concerned about the administration's strategy. I am concerned about this idea that if we just get the Kosovars to agree, then we can bomb Mr. Milosevic and he will now be a compliant partner for peace. That has not proven to be the case. I don't think it will be the case. I think we will be stuck there for a long time. 
   That is the main point I wish to bring as far as my objective. I don't see an exit strategy. I am afraid that we will be there for tens of years instead of 1 year or a very short period of time. 
   Mr. President, I make those comments on Kosovo.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the primary reason I came to the floor this afternoon is to speak about the administration's failed policy on Iraq. I say it is a failed policy. I wish that weren't the case, but it is. It is a failed policy. 
   The administration, this administration, President Clinton, inherited a situation where President Bush and the Secretary of State had won the war with Iraq. We achieved our military objective, which was to get Iraq out of Kuwait. We stated that was our objective. We accomplished that objective. We came home. We implemented sanctions against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait in the summer of 1990. We had a total embargo on Iraqi products, including oil. Oil was the No. 1 product, or commodity, that Iraq exported. It provided 95 percent, I believe, of its foreign currencies. 
   We put that embargo on because they invaded a neighbor. And, frankly, they probably intended to invade other neighbors--maybe Saudi Arabia--and really became the dominating power in the Persian Gulf. We didn't think that was right. We sent 550,000 troops. We stopped them. We kicked them out of Kuwait, and we imposed sanctions to make sure that we would get rid of their weapons of mass destruction, because we knew they were building chemical and biological weapons and possibly nuclear weapons. 
   And so we set up an international regime called UNSCOM to inspect to make sure they wouldn't be doing this again, that they wouldn't be building these weapons of mass destruction to cause more problems for their neighbors and surrounding countries in the foreseeable future. The entire world community supported us, applauded us in that effort. I think we had 30 countries that were involved in the coalition aligned against Iraq in 1990, 1991, 1992. That is what President Clinton inherited. 
   Well, what has happened since? Let me walk you through what has happened since. 
   Saddam Hussein and the Iraqis and the Iraqi Government have really baffled the Clinton administration and, in my opinion, they have beaten the Clinton administration if you look at their objectives. 
   I will show you. The war was in 1991. They were producing over 2 million barrels of oil per day in 1990. After the embargo, they averaged--in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, about 4- or 500,000-barrels per day. We really curtailed their production. Basically, we had the implied reward that said, if you will allow arms control inspectors--if we know that you are not building weapons of mass destruction, we will allow you to produce more oil, there won't be an embargo, but we have to know that you are not building weapons to export throughout the world. 
   What did this administration do? Well, we had a conflict. Actually it happened in 1994 and 1995; Iraq amassed about 80,000 troops near the Kuwaiti border. We started activating troops. We said, well, we wouldn't let this stand; we will respond militarily, if necessary, and then the problem went away. How did they go away? In April of 1995, the United Nations approved Resolution 986, and this resolution allowed Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil every 6 months, $4 billion of oil per year. 
   Well, you might notice, all right, this happened in April of 1995. Their oil infrastructure took awhile to be rebuilt, but, as a result of the U.N. resolution, a couple of years later they doubled their oil production. And this was supposedly to get their cooperation. We didn't have to go to war at the time. We were able to, supposedly, have arms control inspectors, and so they had a little cooperation. 
   In March of 1996, Iraq blocked inspections. In June of 1996, we passed U.N. Resolution 1060 that deplores the refusal of Iraqi authorities to allow access to sites designated by UNSCOM. In August, Iraq launched a campaign against the Kurds. The United States launched a few cruise missiles. The crisis continues. Our arms control inspectors are continually denied access. 
   In June of 1997, Iraq demands that UNSCOM finish their business. In June, the United Nations passed a resolution that demands--demands--Iraq comply fully with UNSCOM. In October of 1997, Iraq bars American inspectors totally. In October, the United Nations passed Resolution 1134 which condemned Iraq's refusal to allow UNSCOM access to certain sites. Boy, the United Nations is standing tough. 
   In November of 1997, we passed another resolution, Resolution 1137. We, again, condemned Iraq because they wouldn't allow these arms control inspectors to have access. We are getting close to finding their weapons of mass destruction. 
   Now, this is only a year ago. A year ago in January this administration was sending 35,000 troops to the Persian Gulf. We are getting ready to go to war again. We are going to have a significant strike. We had significant debate in this body: Is this the right thing to do? Will this bring about compliance? The administration is getting close to going to war. And then what happened? The standoff continues. The inspectors are not allowed access to any of these  sites. And then you might remember, the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, well, he flies to Baghdad and they come to an agreement. Peace is at hand. Arms control inspectors will be allowed back in. 
   Well, guess what. There was a little deal made that not too many people were aware of. I venture to say there weren't two 
   colleagues in the Senate who were aware the administration already cut a deal with Iraq and on U.N. Resolution 1153, they allowed Iraq to sell $5.2 billion worth of oil every 6 months; in other words, allowed Iraq to more than double its oil sales. 
   This is in February of last year. One year ago, February of 1998, the administration signed a deal. We are getting ready to go to war with Iraq because they wouldn't let us have our arms control inspectors in, and all of a sudden we delegate the authority to the Secretary General. He runs to Baghdad. They signed a deal. Everybody is shaking hands. War is avoided. Everybody can be at ease--no real problems now. We have an agreement. We have Kofi Annan's signature. We have the Iraqis saying they are going to comply; they are going to let in arms control people. And, yes, there was a little deal that they could double oil sales, the Iraqis could double their oil exports to as much as $5.2 billion of oil every 6 months. That was February, a year ago, 12 months from this time. 
   What happened last August? Let's see. Last August, the Iraqis stopped inspectors again. Now, they have done this repeatedly. 
   What happened in September and October? They announced they would no longer cooperate. We withdrew the inspectors because they weren't doing anything. They were sitting in hotel rooms. They weren't allowed to have any inspections. And so we started saying this is not satisfactory. 
   President Clinton, again, he is talking tough--we are going to go to war. We are going to bomb them. We have the international community on our side now because they kicked the arms control inspectors out. We have the international community on our side. We are ready to go. 
   Well, the administration wasn't ready to go to war so we will give peace a little more of a chance. And we gave peace a little more of a chance, but they still didn't cooperate. We negotiated more. And so in September the United Nations passed another resolution demanding Iraq cooperate. That was in September. 
   In November, we passed another resolution, U.N. Resolution 1205. We demanded that Iraq cooperate. And then in December we had 3 days of bombing, December 17, 18, and 19. Iraq didn't cooperate. We had 3 days of bombing. Some people called them the impeachment bombings. They happened to be on the day of impeachment. Maybe that is coincidence; maybe it isn't. I don't know. 
   So we had 3 days of bombing. Boy, that taught them a lesson because they weren't complying, and we are going to make sure they are going to comply. So we bombed them for 3 days. And then what happened? And I don't know if anybody can read this or not, but then on December 23 ``U.S. Offers To Raise Crude Sales Cap.'' Just days after the bombing, Clinton administration officials are negotiating to lift the oil sales cap. 
   My point is that we have rewarded Iraq three times in the past for noncompliance with arms control inspectors by raising the oil sales cap. In April of 1995, we allowed them to go from a total embargo to where they could sell $2 billion of oil every 6 months. 
   That was in April of 1995. Why? Because they weren't allowing the inspectors. Then in February of 1998--again, we are ready to go to war, Kofi Annan, negotiates this deal that will allow them to double it again. So, yes, we had a promise that the inspectors would be allowed to have access. Maybe they had access for a few months. The inspectors start getting close to finding something and Saddam Hussein kicks them out again. We threatened to go to war again. This time we actually did bomb them for 3 days and then, guess what. Days later, we can't wait; we run back and say, hey, we are going to reward you for your noncompliance. That has been the administration's policy dealing with Iraq. Let's reward their noncompliance with arms control inspectors. Let's reward them; we will let them sell more oil. And that is exactly what has happened. 
   This was the administration's statement days after the bombing. But it is interesting. And this was made by Tom Pickering. 
   Incidentally, I might mention, Mr. President, we are trying to get the administration to testify at a hearing, and they have been very reluctant to do so. But I think we have a commitment from Secretary of Energy Richardson, and I hope we will have Secretary Albright, or at least Under Secretary Pickering to testify, to explain this position. 
   His statement is interesting. It says:  
   Outlining U.S. policy in the wake of last week's airstrikes against Iraq, Undersecretary of State Thomas R. Pickering said the United States would be prepared to review the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after the 1991 Persian Gulf War if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein gives guaranteed cooperation to U.N. weapons inspectors. If not, the sanctions will remain in place in perpetuity and the United States will use force as needed to block weapons development.  
   In other words, if Iraq doesn't give cooperation, we are going to guarantee that those sanctions will remain in place forever. That was our administration's policy on December 23, just days after the bombing. 
   Well, guess what. I am critical of this administration. Their policy here, 3 weeks later, on January 14--again in the Washington Post, it says, ``Gore Signals Flexibility on Iraq Sanctions; France Proposes Ending Oil Embargo, Changing Weapons Inspections.'' 
   But guess what. Vice President GORE proposed eliminating weapons sanctions. That is our own Vice President who said that. Three weeks after we said we would never lift sanctions unless we had total cooperation, we had the Vice President of the United States talking about--I will just quote part of the article:  
   A ceiling on how much oil Iraq can sell to provide humanitarian aid to its people should be lifted and the approval process streamlined, Vice President Gore said tonight.......  
   ``The ceiling should be lifted.'' He didn't say in exchange for cooperation. He didn't say in exchange for having arms control inspectors in. He just said we should lift it. That is very inconsistent, totally overriding what the Under Secretary said 3 weeks before, but totally consistent with what this administration has done. 
   What this administration has done--Saddam Hussein has tested them. He has pushed them up to the edge of going to war, defied arms control, defied the international community and the arms control community--by kicking the inspectors out. We would talk tough, and then at the last second we would say, ``Well, wait a minute, just give us a little inspection, let us have some inspections, let us do it, and you can sell more oil.'' 
   So what has happened? The Iraqis have done just that. Their oil sales have gone way up. Guess what. They have no inspections--none--zero. They are selling as much oil today as they were prior to the war. That is 95 percent of their currency that they earn for all sorts of things. 
   The administration will say this is only used for food or humanitarian reasons. Hogwash. Money is fungible. If they are ready to take care of humanitarian needs with this money, that means with the other money they have, they can use that to buy arms and weapons and anything else they desire--maybe more castles that they happen to have. 
   So the administration's policy has been a total disaster. Here is just the oil production charts. It shows for years, 1996 and so on, they were only producing 550,000 barrels a day. Then the administration policy where they allow more and more changes--and you notice now we are up to over 2 1/2 million barrels per day, exactly 2 million barrels a day more than it was in 1996. That has also had the consequence of glutting an already flooded market and is driving a lot of producers totally out of business--totally out of business. 
   We have a depression going on right now in the oil industry. You have 111 oil rigs running today. Last year we had 372. You go from 370 rigs to 111 in 12 months, and part of the reason happens to be this administration's policy dealing with Iraq. 
   So I have some concern on what is happening with the domestic oil industry. But my biggest concern is that the administration has had a habit of rewarding Iraqi noncompliance with  more oil sales. Now the administration's policy, as stated by the Vice President of the United States, is we should not have a cap on oil sales. 
   Incidentally, we do not need--or, they don't say this, but we do not have arms control inspectors in; so there is no connection. We are not saying, ``Hey, you can sell all the oil you want to; all you have to do is make sure we have access, have arms control inspection; then we'll take all the embargo off.'' That should be our policy. But until they do that, we should keep the embargo on. Let's put a little squeeze on. 
   I said, ``What are we doing today?'' We are flying daily flights over the no-fly zones. They are shooting at our pilots. Thank goodness they haven't been successful yet. But how successful is our policy? We have already proven to Saddam Hussein, if he denies us, we will reward him. That is what we have done. This is what this administration has done throughout their policy. 
   Our administration policy has been pretty poor in dealing with Iraq. We have continued to reward their noncompliance, going all the way back to April 1995, and I think it has made the world a lot more dangerous as a result. Saddam Hussein is able to produce all the oil he wants. He is able to generate the moneys he needs, able to build the weapons of mass destruction without anybody checking him whatsoever--not the United States, not the United Nations. As a result, the world is a much more dangerous place. 
   The administration should be held accountable for their failed policies in Iraq. I also think it is important that we speak up now so we don't have failed policies in Kosovo.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I know my colleague, the Senator from Florida, has an amendment. I want to make a few comments on the bill if that accommodates his schedule. I won't be very long. 
   Mr. President, I wish to compliment my friend and colleague, Senator WARNER, for his stewardship of this bill, for his chairmanship of the Armed Services Committee, and for his dedication to improving our national defense. He has a proven record in national defense, both as a Secretary of the Navy and his service in the Senate. I understand the support that this bill has by colleagues, and certainly I feel supportive of our military and national defense as well. I have always believed that for the Federal Government our No. 1 priority should be the protection of our people, protection of our country, and the protection of our freedom. This bill will help do this in some ways. So I support those efforts. 
   I support a lot of what is in this bill, but I don't support everything in this bill. I think it would be less than forthcoming if I didn't express my displeasure with at least two provisions in this bill. Maybe by expressing that displeasure we can remedy that before this bill becomes law. I say that in all sincerity. I want a lot of this bill to become law. 
   Frankly, when my staff asked me earlier, ``Do you want to sponsor S.4, one of our first bills? It improves national defense, increases pay.'' Well, I have 35,000 to 40,000 troops in my State, and I definitely want to increase their pay. So I support that provision of the bill. When I started reading the summaries of it--and I have a copy of a summary and cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, dated February 12, 1999. 
   I ask unanimous consent that this CBO summary be printed at the conclusion of my statement.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I became concerned about the cost not just of the pay increases, which are handled by appropriation committees every year--in other words, this bill can authorize pay increases of whatever percent, but the appropriators have to come up with the money to do it. They will do that within the budget cycle, and we are going to pass a budget this year. So I am optimistic that will be funded. It will be within the budget and it will be responsible. So, again, I don't have a problem with that portion of the bill, the pay raise. That portion of the bill, I might mention, is $26 billion over the next 10 years. It is about half of this bill. The total cost of this bill is about $55 billion over the next 10 years. So I don't have a problem with the pay raise provision. 
   I do have a problem with two of the entitlement increases in this bill. I think, with all due respect, they are mistakes. I think increasing the military retirement percentage from 40 to 50 percent is a mistake. Some colleagues say don't raise that. I was in the Congress when we reduced it from 50 to 40. We did that with an overwhelming vote of 92-1. In 1986, we reduced the military retirement schedule from 50 to 40 percent as part of an overall package for entitlement reform in the military. It was overwhelming, 92-1. 
   Now we are getting ready to do the opposite, increasing it probably from 40 percent to 50 percent. That means that an individual can join at age 18 or 20, serve 20 years, receive retirement pay beginning at age 40 for life, and receive cost-of-living adjustments. That is very expensive. Also, when they are 41 years old, they can seek other employment; I expect that they would do that in most cases. So they would have other employment in addition to the military retirement. It is a very expensive provision. In 1986, changes were made with a lot of work; I think it was work that was well thought out. 
   I might note that there is a letter from the Concord Coalition, signed by our former colleagues, Senator Rudman and Senator Nunn, which urges us not to do this, saying they worked hard and they were with many of us in the Senate at that time. I will read part of it:  
   We understand that it has been tentatively decided to include in the year-end omnibus spending bill a provision substantially repealing the 1986 military pension reforms. We urge you in the strongest possible terms to reject this unwise, expensive, and untimely provision.  
   They also said:  
   Several commissions reported that the old pension system was so generous to personnel in their early 40s with 20 years of service that the pensions worked as incentives to highly skilled personnel to leave the military. One of the objectives of this bill is to get people to stay in the military.  
   They also say:  
   Rolling back the 1986 reforms means returning to a system that encourages military personnel to retire prematurely from the service in their early 40s at half pay, augmented by full COLAs.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I think the pension change--which, I might mention, is an entitlement change--is not paid for in this bill and it costs $14 billion over the next 10 years. So it is not an insignificant provision. There are also provisions in here dealing with a thrift savings plan. I am in favor of that. I don't have a problem with that. We should encourage that for military personnel. Most provisions in here I agree with and some I disagree with. I think changing the retirement percentage is a mistake. 
   There is another provision in the bill that Senator CLELAND, I think, was talking about. I compliment him. He was able to get this in the bill in the markup. I don't believe they had cost estimates and actually knew how much it would cost during the markup, but it was a provision dealing with the GI bill, providing benefits, educational benefits for GIs. He expanded the benefit to say it could be transferred to spouses and children. What does this mean? The bill itself increases the GI benefit from $528 a month to $600 a month, a nice, generous increase. That means a GI that is in the regular service with a commitment for 3 years can sign up and receive educational benefits totaling $600 per month--a pretty nice benefit. That is $7,200 per year. 
   This bill is used by a significant number of GIs. This bill eliminates the coshare. They have to pay, right now, $100 a month, or for the first year $1,200. This bill eliminates that. I am not arguing about that as much as I am about the transferability provision in this bill that allows the GI benefits to be transferred to spouses, and also to the kids. 
   I am all in favor of increasing support for our military, but I question the wisdom of this provision, which is enormously expensive. Enormously. The cost of this provision over the next 10 years--just the transfer of the GI entitlement--is $9.8 billion. Also, I might mention that in the CBO study, the last part of the page, they talk about the transfer of entitlement, and they said:  
   CBO estimates that the provision would raise costs by about $110 billion in 2000 and by $2.2 billion over the first 5 years, and $9.8 billion over the 2000 to 2009 period. In the long run, costs will rise to about $3 billion per year.  
   This is just in the transfer of an entitlement. So this is the creation of a new entitlement, transferring this entitlement to spouses and the kids. This $600, which I believe is indexed for inflation, can get very expensive. So we are talking about a $7,200 benefit being transferred to spouses and kids, and 10 years from now how much will that be? Well, the Congressional Budget Office says it is going to cost about $3 billion a year. I know that cost wasn't known--or at least I don't think it was --when this bill was marked up. We know what the cost is now. I think we have to look at it long and hard. 
   Is this the right thing to do? Some people have said this doesn't come out of the defense budget, this is not part of the defense bill, this is really part of Veterans Affairs budget. It comes out of the taxpayer bill. I want to take care of veterans, too, but I don't think we have an obligation to veterans' children, to be providing for their education to the tune of $7,200. I think we have to be very cautious when we go about expanding entitlements. Maybe I am alone in this, but these entitlement increases aren't paid for. So there is a real conflict. 
   Most of us say we believe in a balanced budget. We run back to our States and say we have balanced the budget and we have done a great job. Yet, increasing entitlements to the tune of increasing the percentage from 40 to 50 percent for military retirement, and then also making the GI bill benefits apply not only for GIs, but also for GIs' spouses and for children. 
   I think that is enormously expensive--very expensive. The cost of this bill over the first 5 years is $17.9 billion. The cost over 10 years is $54.9 billion--almost $55 billion over 10 years. About half of that is pay raise. I don't have a problem with the pay raise provision, with one exception. The pay raise provision that is put in says not only a 4.8 pay raise, which is the most generous that we have done in a long time, and it is probably overdue, but it also says for the foreseeable future we are going to add another half point over whatever the cost-of-living index will be for the military over everybody else. I am not sure we should be making that decision for 10 years from now, or for 8 years from now. The next Congress can decide that. Maybe we should say, ``Well, for the next 4 years we will give a half point incremental increase on top of the CPI.'' I don't think we should say for every military person you will get half a percent more than everybody else. And then we are going to have pressure coming from the civil service, and from all governmental employees saying we want just as much, although we have had some studies done that say they are not making as much as those in the private sector. 
   I think that provision can be very expensive, or certainly should be sunset or limited. So I encourage the managers of this bill to look at putting the sunset on the incremental cost-of-living increase that is now provided. I urge them to take another look at raising the retirement percentage from 40 to 50 percent. I urge in the strongest language possible to be very, very cautious about expanding the GI bill of rights to spouses and to their children. 
   If we are going to pass entitlement programs that cost $3 billion a year, we should know it. We should recognize the cost. We should also be thinking about what the spending is going to squeeze out--what area of the military is going to take a hit, or what area of Veterans Affairs. Are we not going to be able to fund veterans' health care as well because that particular provision is in there? 
   So I think we need to think about it long and hard. I am confident that our colleagues, who will be managing this bill in conference, will look at these issues. I am very hopeful they will be addressed before we see a bill brought back to the Senate floor as a conference bill. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. Chief Justice, the United States Senate has nearly concluded only the second impeachment trial of a President in history. We fulfilled our promise to conclude the process in an expeditious and responsible manner in accordance to the Constitution. 
   Americans understand there is really only one person to blame for this ordeal: Bill Clinton. He could have prevented the entire impeachment process if he had chosen the truth instead of lies and obstruction and the well-being of the nation instead of his own personal and political needs. He squandered his opportunity to provide trustworthy leadership on the important issues facing America. 
   The President's actions left the Attorney General with no choice but to ask the Independent Counsel to investigate. They left the Independent Counsel with no choice but to refer charges to the House of Representatives. They left the House with no choice but to impeach him. 
   The day Senators took that impeachment oath was one of the most serious, solemn times that I have experienced  during my 18 years in the Senate. Our oath was to do impartial justice, and that oath was in my mind as I weighed the facts, the law, and the Constitution. 
   The President took an oath too. He took an oath to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. 
   I believe that clear and convincing evidence presented to the Senate demonstrates that President Clinton did indeed commit multiple acts of perjury, as alleged in Article I, and multiple acts of obstruction of justice, as alleged in Article II, and deserves to be found guilty on both articles of impeachment. 
   The President made a serious, serious mistake when he went to his Paula Jones deposition, raised his right hand and swore to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and then lied repeatedly. Following that, he committed more acts of obstruction and more lies, culminating in his testimony before the grand jury where he lied time and time again. He had obstructed justice and he had perjured himself in the Jones case, and he wanted to be consistent, so he perjured himself again. 
   One of many specifics, concerning his ``conversations'' with Betty Currie: ``I was trying to get the facts down. I was trying to understand what the facts were.'' He wasn't trying to understand the facts. He knew what the facts were. He was trying to mislead a witness, and then he lied under oath after being begged, ``Don't do it again, Mr. President.'' 
   I believe the public deserves, and the Constitution permits, that the Senate demand a high standard of conduct in its President. Rather than find a loophole to excuse the President's behavior, the Senate ought to find him guilty. 
   The President's counsel have attempted to frame the question before the Senate as ``[a]re we at that horrific moment in our history when our Union could be preserved only by taking the step that the framers saw as the last resort?'' \1\ His lawyers are asking the wrong question. In fact, as Manager CANADY pointed out, under this standard even the deeds of Richard Nixon may not have been worthy of impeachment.\2\ The proper question is not whether America would survive President Clinton remaining in office: that answer is yes. The proper question before the Senate is whether, knowing what we now know about his conduct, America should have to do so. Footnotes at end of speech. 
   Another of the President's lawyers argued that ``[i]f you convict and remove President Clinton on the basis of these allegations, no President will ever be safe from impeachment again[.]'' \3\ I, for one, have a little more confidence that our future leaders will not commit felonies, but if a future President commits the same crimes as President Clinton, I hope that President will face the same constitutional response. 
   In fact, one familiar lawyer recognized that there is ``no question that an admission of making false statements to government officials and interfering with the FBI is an impeachable offense.'' \4\ That lawyer was William Clinton, speaking in 1974.

    Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to join in offering the U.S. Energy and Economic Growth Act. This legislation is an effort to help revive our domestic oil and gas industry which plays such a vital role in our national security. If our domestic industry is to survive, then Congress needs to act now to provide tax incentives to encourage energy production in America. 
   Since the early 1980's, oil and gas extraction employment has been cut in half. Employment in the oil and gas industry has declined by almost 500,000 since 1984. Imports of crude oil products were $71 billion in 1977, and the import dependency ratio now exceeds fifty percent. From 1973 to 1998, crude oil production dropped 43% in the lower 48 states. We must take action now to save domestic production not only for the sake of the oil and gas industry but for the sake of the national security of this nation. 
   To date, the Clinton Administration has done nothing to encourage domestic production. In the President's State of the Union address, he named no initiatives to aid this troubled industry and recently, his Administration has conspired with the U.N. to almost double the amount of oil Iraq can export under the so-called food-for-oil program.

    Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Senate Republican Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. Joining me in this effort are 49 of my colleagues who recognize the importance of ensuring that all Americans are able to not only receive the care they have been promised, but also the highest quality of care available. The foundation of this proposal is to address some of the very real concerns that patients have about their health care needs and to provide significant opportunities for all consumers in choosing their doctors and health plans. 
   We know that many Americans have believed they were denied coverage that their plans were supposed to cover. We recognize that some individuals fear that their health care plans will not give them access to specialists when they need them. We know that some Americans think their health care plans care more about cost than they do about quality. 
   Last January, the Majority Leader asked me to put together a group of colleagues to address the issue of health care quality. For over eight months, Senators FRIST, COLLINS, HAGEL, ROTH, JEFFORDS, COATS, SANTORUM, and GRAMM worked tirelessly to put together a responsible, credible package that would preserve what is best about our nation's health care while at the same time determine ways to improve upon--without stifling--the quality of care our nation delivers. We set out to rationally examine the issues and develop reasonable solutions without injuring patient access to affordable, high quality care. 
   This was no easy task. We spent month after month talking to experts who understand the difficulty and complexity of our system. We met with representatives from all aspects of the industry including the Mayo Clinic, the Henry Ford Health Systems, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the National Committee for Quality Assurance, the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, Corporate Medical Directors, Commissioners from the President's Quality Commission, Purchasers, Families USA, the Employee Benefit Research Institute, and many others. 
   After many, many months of dissecting serious questions about our system, we determined that there were indeed some areas in which we could improve patient access and quality. 
   Together, we have written an innovative plan that will answer the problems that exist in the industry, while at the same time preserving affordability, which is of utmost importance. After all, Mr. President, I think you agree that if someone loses their health insurance because a politician playing doctor drives prices to an unaffordable level, you have hardly given them more rights or better quality health care. 
   We are proud of what we have been able to accomplish. For the first time, patients can choose to be unencum- bered in their relationship with their doctor. They will be able to choose their own doctor and get the middle man out of the way. There will be no corporate bureaucrat, no government bureaucrat and no lawyer standing between a patient and their doctor. In addition our legislation does what no other bill has done. It provides the patient with more choice in their health plans. 
   Mr. President the bill we introduce today: 
   Protects consumers in employer-sponsored plans that are exempt from state regulation. People enrolled in such plans will have the right to: 
   Choose their doctors. Our bill contains both ``point-of-service'' and ``continuity of care'' requirements that will enhance consumer choice. 
   See their ob-gyns and pediatricians without referral. Guarantees parents and families peace of mind by giving patients direct access to pediatricians and ob-gyns without prior referral from a ``gatekeeper.'' 
   Have a ``prudent layperson'' standard applied to their claims for emergency care. Our bill will require health plans to cover--without prior authorization--emergency care that a ``prudent layperson'' would consider medically necessary. 
   Communicate openly with their doctors without ``gag'' clauses. 
   Holds health plans accountable for their decisions. 
   Extends to enrollees in ERISA health plans and their doctors the right to appeal adverse coverage decisions to a physician who was not involved in the initial coverage determination. 
   Allows enrollees to appeal adverse coverage determinations to independent medical experts who have no affiliation with the health plan. Determinations by these experts will be binding on the health plan. 
   Requires health plans to disclose to enrollees consumer information, including what's covered, what's not, how much they'll have to pay in deductibles and coinsurance, and how to appeal adverse coverage decisions to independent medical experts. 
   Guarantees consumers access to their medical records. 
   Requires health care providers, health plans, employers, health and life insurers, and schools and universities to permit an individual to inspect, copy and amend his or her own medical information. 
   Requires health care providers, health plans, health oversight agencies, public health authorities, employers, health and life insurers, health researchers, law enforcement officials, and schools and universities to establish appropriate safeguards to protect the confidentiality, security, accuracy and integrity of protected health information and notify enrollees of these safeguards.  
   Protects patients from genetic discrimination in health insurance. Prohibits health plans from collecting or using predictive genetic information about a patient to deny health insurance coverage or set premium rates. 
   Promotes quality improvement by supporting research to give patients and physicians better information regarding quality. 
   Establishes the Agency for Health- care Quality Research (AHQR), whose purpose is to foster overall improvement in healthcare quality and bridge the gap between what we know and what we do in healthcare today. The Agency is built on the platform of the current Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, but is refocused and enhanced to become the hub and driving force of federal efforts to improve the quality of healthcare in all practice environments--not just managed care. 
   The role of the Agency is not to mandate a national definition of quality, but to support the science necessary to provide information to patients regarding the quality of the care they receive, to allow physicians to compare their quality outcomes with their peers, and to enable employers and individuals to be prudent purchasers based on quality. 
   Makes health insurance more accessible and affordable by: 
   Allowing self-employed people to deduct the full amount of their health care premiums. 
   Making medical savings accounts available to everyone. 
   Reforming flexibility spending accounts to let consumers save for future health care costs. 
   Mr. President, this bill is a comprehensive bill of rights that will benefit all Americans, and I am proud to join with so many of my colleagues in introducing it. This legislation is built around several basic principles which distinguishes it from other proposals. 
   First and foremost, it recognizes that regulation adds costs and not value. The legislation places a priority on ensuring that we will not increase the number of uninsured or make health care unaffordable through excessive regulation. 
   Second, our legislation rightly places patients ahead of trial lawyers. The inclusion of a strong, internal and external appeals provision holds HMOs accountable, while guaranteeing that patients get the care they need when they need it. 
   Third, our legislation protects the historic and traditional role of states to regulate private health insurance. States are best equipped to determine the needs of their citizens. Our legislation ensures that the Federal Government and HCFA will not be empowered to expand their reach into the private market. The creation of new federal bureaucracies will only serve to stagnate and destroy what is best about our health care system. 
   Finally, our legislation places a high priority on choice. Unlike every other proposal our bill will give every American the right to fire their HMO. Every patient will have their choice of doctor and health plan. 
   Our bill empowers an independent medical expert to order an insurance company to pay for medically necessary care so that patients suffer no harm. Theirs allows professional trial lawyers to sue health plans after harm is done. 
   Mr. President, when my insurance company tells me that they won't cover a service for my family, I want the ability to appeal that decision to a doctor who doesn't work for my insurance company. And I want that appeal handled promptly, so that my family receives the benefit. That is what our bill requires. 
   Other bills create new ways for trial lawyers to make money. According to a June 1998 study by Multinational Business Services, the Democrats' bill would create 56 new Federal causes of action--56 new reasons to sue people in Federal court. 
   That's fine for trial lawyers, but it doesn't do much for patients. Patients want their claim disputes handled promptly and fairly. According to a study by the General Accounting Office, it takes an average 25 months--more than two years--to resolve a malpractice suit. One case that the GAO studied took 11 years to resolve! I'm sure the lawyers who handled that case did quite well for themselves. But what about the patient? 
   Under our bill, patients can appeal directly to an outside medical expert for a prompt review of their claim--without having to incur any legal expenses. In medical malpractice litigation, patients receive an average of only 43 cents of every dollar awarded. The rest goes to lawyers and court fees. 
   Our bill assures that health care dollars are used to serve patients. It does not divert dollars away from patients and into the pockets of trial lawyers. 
   Mr. President, another big difference between our bill and others proposed is that their bill takes a ``big government'' approach to health reform. 
   Our bill relies on State Insurance Commissioners to protect those Americans who are enrolled in state-regulated plans. We protect the unprotected by providing new federal safeguards to the 48 million Americans who are enrolled in plans that the states are not permitted to regulate. 
   Another problem: Some bills impose a risky and complicated scheme that relies on federal bureaucrats at the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to enforce patients' rights in states that do not conform to the federal mandates in their bill. 
   HCFA is the agency that oversees the federal Medicare and Medicaid programs. Last year, in the Balanced Budget Act, Congress created new consumer protections for Medicare beneficiaries--a ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' for the 38.5 million senior citizens and disabled Americans who rely on Medicare for their health care. 
   We asked HCFA to protect those rights. How have they done? I regret to say, Mr. President, that they have not done very well at all. 
   On July 16, 1998, a GAO witness testified before the Ways and Means Committee on how well HCFA was doing in implementing the Balanced Budget Act and enforcing the Medicare patients' bill of rights. According to GAO, HCFA has ``missed 25 percent of the implementation deadlines, including the quality-of-care medical review process for skilled nursing facilities. It is clear that HCFA will continue to miss implementation deadlines as it attempts to balance the resource demands generated by the Balanced Budget Act with other competing objectives.'' 
   Mr. President, I won't detail all of the ways that HCFA has failed--the fact that it is delaying implementation of a prostate screening program to which Medicare beneficiaries are entitled, the fact that it has failed to establish a quality-of-care medical review process for skilled nursing facilities, the fact that it is far behind schedule in developing a new payment system for home health services. The list goes on and on. 
   But let me focus on one failure that is especially relevant. All of us agree that people have the right to information about their health plans. When they have the choice of more than one plan, accurate information that compares the plans is critical. 
   Last year, Congress allocated $95 million to HCFA to develop an information and education program for Medicare beneficiaries. This money was to be used for publishing and mailing handbooks containing comparative plan information to seniors, establishing a tool-free number and Internet website, and sponsoring health information fairs. 
   Well, there haven't been any information fairs and the toll-free number isn't operational. They do have a website, but they've decided to mail comparative information handbooks only to seniors in 5 states: Washington, Oregon, Ohio, Florida and Arizona. So for the pricey sum of $95 million, only about 5.5 million seniors will receive important information about their health plans, leaving 32.5 million seniors without these handbooks. At that rate, HCFA would need more than $1 billion each year just for handbooks. 
   Mr. President, if this agency is struggling to protect the rights of 38.5 million Medicare beneficiaries, how can we ask it to protect the rights of up to as many as 100 million people enrolled in private health plans? 
   We believe that consumer protections are too important to entrust to a cumbersome and inefficient federal government. State governments have long been in the business of insurance regulation and the federal government should not usurp their role. 
   One just has to look at HCFAs record on the Health Insurance and Portability and Accountability Act  (HIPAA). This Act gave HCFA enforcement authority in states that do not meet federal health standards. But how has HCFA done in the enforcement of HIPAA? A GAO report analyzing HCFA's success states that HCFA has done very little in this area. HCFA's activities, to date, have been ``limited primarily to responding to consumer queries and complaints and providing guidance'' to carriers in 4 of the 5 states that are not in compliance. 
   The GAO report goes on to say that even HCFA admits ``the agency has thus far pursued a ``Band Aid'' or minimalist approach to regulating HIPAA. The failure to fully address this regulatory responsibility is due to the fact that HCFA lacks the ``appropriate experience'' in the regulating of the private health insurance market. 
   The federal government should protect those who are enrolled in plans that are exempt from state regulation and those enrolled in the programs it runs, like Medicare and Medicaid. The federal government should start protecting the rights of senior citizens under Medicare, instead of meddling in areas where it doesn't belong. 
   Mr. President, our bill is a truly comprehensive bill of rights for patients, providing new consumer protections for the 48 million Americans who are unprotected by state law, giving the 124 million Americans enrolled in employer-sponsored plans new rights to appeal adverse coverage decisions, protecting the civil rights of consumers to gain access to their medical records, protecting consumers against discrimination based on genetic tests, promoting quality improvement, establishing a new women's health initiative, and giving millions of Americans access to affordable health insurance through medical savings accounts. 
   The doctor-patient relationship is one of the most important in people's lives. Our legislation preserves and protects that relationship, while taking many common-sense steps forward to affirm and expand quality and access. 
   I look forward to a deliberative, thoughtful process this year on examining the complex issues addressed in our Patients Bill of Rights PLUS. Last year, the debate surrounding this legislation was extremely politicized and resulted in a partisan standoff. That was unfortunate. 
   I am hopeful that the Committees will work this year to examine these issues completely and substantively. Health care costs are rising everyday, Mr. President. We must balance the need to protect patients with the need to make health care accessible. The Committees will need to examine the current trends in the market place and evaluate any legislation on all fronts, not just political rhetoric. Health care is just too important to politicize.
