   Mr. MACK. Madam President, last year the Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary Appropriations Subcommittee included funding for the Southern Florida Medical Corrections Options Program, which began operations this spring. Working with the Broward County Mental Health Court and the Broward County Sheriff's office it has had tremendous success in treating mentally ill misdemeanants and preventing recidivism. My colleague from Hawaii shares my interest in the program because Hawaii faces many of the same challenges as Florida in treating mentally ill misdemeanants.

   Mr. MACK. The Fiscal Year 2001 Commerce, State, Justice and the Judiciary Appropriations Committee Report includes a number of programs that the committee has encouraged the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) to examine and fund, if possible, under the Edward Byrne Memorial Discretionary Grants Program. I am hopeful that the BJA will consider funding for the joint Hawaii/Florida demonstration project to develop a national model for future mental health courts.

Mr. President, as the Chairman knows, the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program statutory provisions relating to the ``urban county'' classification do not contemplate the form of consolidated city/county government found in Duval County, Florida (Jacksonville) where there is no unincorporated area. A recent decision by the Bureau of the Census, and subsequently by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), has questioned the status of Jacksonville/Duval County as an entitlement area.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the United States commitment to Israel is strong. It has stood the test of time, and has only strengthened. It is strong because it is grounded in our shared principles of freedom and democracy. It is also strong because we respect and appreciate Israel's commitment to preserve and protect those religious sites considered by all people of the world to be holy. 
   I am very disturbed over recent events in the Middle East. America's response to Israel must be clear and reflect our total support. What we are witnessing is not, as it is often called, an ``outbreak of violence.'' What we are witnessing is a concerted attack against Israel; and this is occurring on the heels of the Israeli government taking the most conciliatory stance ever toward the Palestinians. 
   After the Camp David summit, President Clinton correctly blamed Palestinian Authority Chairman Yassir Arafat for rejecting the compromises that Israel was willing to consider. Since Camp David, Arafat has compounded his rejection of peace proposals with an embrace of violence. The United States must maintain its pressure on Arafat and the Palestinian leadership, and avoid retreating into the moral swamp of ``evenhandedness.'' We must stand with Israel. 
   I am deeply disappointed in the shameful U.S. abstention on a UN Security Council resolution that our own ambassador called ``unbalanced, biased, and really a lousy piece of work.''

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, we must speak the truth and stand on principle, so that Arafat cannot continue blaming Israel for the completely unjustified attack that he 
   initiated. There is a word for a policy of rewarding violence, and that word is ``appeasement.'' 
   Appeasement is not just wrong; it also does not work. Events of recent days have led many Israelis to conclude that their government's generosity toward the Palestinians has--far from being reciprocated--been taken as weakness and invited the beating of war drums against Israel throughout the Arab world. 
   As Israel begins to rethink its course, the United States must not push Israel towards appeasement. We must help Israel find the strength to stand up to aggression and continue the principled fight for justice. 
   As citizens of a democracy that desperately wants peace, Israelis are as pained as anyone by the heart-wrenching pictures of Palestinian children caught in the crossfire. Israel can be counted on to search its soul as to whether she could have defended herself and claimed fewer Palestinian casualties. The result of such an inquiry, however, will not shift the overarching burden of responsibility from the party that chose to abandon the negotiating table and open a shooting war--Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat.

   Mr. MACK. I thank Senator LAUTENBERG for making a point with which I strongly agree: the waiver authority in this legislation is intended to be used on each case or for each asset, but not to be used as a de-facto veto. 
   In drafting this language and negotiating with the administration over the past several months, we believe firmly that using blocked assets of terrorist states to satisfy judgments is completely consistent with the intent of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1996, and more significantly, is consistent with our national security interest. Simply stated, making the terrorists who harm or kill Americans in acts of international terrorism pay for their acts makes for good policy. It should deter future acts of terrorism, as well as provide some small measure of justice to current victims.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I will be leaving the Senate at the end of my term. I want to put a few thoughts on the record over the next few days, depending on the time available. 
   I have four grandchildren--three grandsons and one granddaughter--Ronnie Elam, Brett Elam, Blake Caldwell, and Addison McGillicuddy. The comments I am going to make today really are from the perspective of thinking about them and their future and the desire to see that they will grow up in a country and in a world where their opportunities will be equal to, if not better than, those of their parents, their grandparents, and their great-grandparents. I want them to have a better understanding when they reach that point when they have their own families. 
   As people look back on the last several decades of the 20th century, I want, at least from my perspective, to be able to put on the record what I believe happened from both an economic and foreign policy perspective, and from a national security perspective. So that is what my comments will reflect today, my thoughts with respect to economics primarily and some that will reflect my feelings with respect to national defense. 
   So I would like to talk about economics, a topic that has been one of my passions as a Member of the Congress. Economic policy was the very reason I ran for the House of Representatives back in 1982. As many of us may recall, our country remained in a deep recession at the time, still struggling to recover from the economic policies of the 1970s. Although it was still being phased in, President Reagan's economic program was under attack by our friends across the aisle. But, to me, the Reagan economic program was a bold reaffirmation of the very purpose of America. 
   Many people have noted the happy coincidence that the year 1776 saw the publication of two of the most important documents in world history, Adam Smith's ``Wealth Of Nations'' and Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence. These works share the theme of freedom. Smith made the case for free trade and unfettered markets, as Jefferson put in words the concept that government exists to protect individual liberty. 
   These documents rebutted, refined, and transcended the prevailing views of 1776 Great Britain. For over a century, these principles held firm and the United States stood tall as a beacon of hope and opportunity for people from all points on the globe. 
   Ours was a society without a rigid class structure, a society that promised equal opportunity for all based on individual enterprise and hard work, not government privileges and connections. America had no large bureaucracies intruding upon every sphere of commercial life. We relied on the willingness of individuals to shoulder the risk and responsibility that is part and parcel of private enterprise. 
   But this distinctly American way was challenged by two worldwide crises in the 20th century. First came the Great Depression. Although gross government mismanagement of the money supply and counterproductive trade policies were the cause of this crisis, government was put forward as the cure. This led to the proliferation of alphabet agencies seeking to steer every aspect of the American economy, as government assumed a new income redistribution role. 
   The second crisis was the rise of totalitarianism on the European Continent. The United States won World War II, but in the process of saving Europe from one brand of tyranny, an equally evil force came to occupy half of Europe, and the war effort was used as the justification for price controls and economic intervention that was unprecedented in the United States. 
   The welfare state in America grew by leaps and bounds. Once it was conceded that the Government is the guarantor of income, each successive call for new and bigger programs became harder and harder to resist. At the same time, the consolidation of the Soviet bloc presented the largest threat to freedom in human history, presenting new and costly challenges for America as the beacon of freedom. Exaggerations of Soviet economic success fueled the call for greater Government involvement in the U.S. economy. Over time, high tax rates and regulatory excesses accumulated like barnacles to slow the once mighty ship of American private enterprise. 
   It is hard for younger Americans to imagine how bleak our Nation's prospects appeared before Reagan assumed the Presidency. Recurrent, simultaneous bouts of high unemployment and high inflation confounded most economists, who viewed the two as a tradeoff. It was thought that to reduce unemployment you had to accept inflation and to reduce inflation you had to accept higher unemployment. Producers and consumers suffered from an energy crisis. And real household incomes were shrinking as fast as ``bracket creep'' was raising everyone's tax bill year after year. The response of the incumbent administration was hardly inspiring--ranging from suggesting ``voluntary'' wage and price controls to preaching that we must learn to live within limits. In short, the American establishment was telling the American people to accept the notion that they no longer controlled their own economic destinies. 
   Starting in the 1970s, the media aggressively advanced the notion popular in intellectual circles that America's free enterprise system was failing. This view persisted through the 1980s. The best-seller lists were crowded with books telling of the decline of America and predicting that Japan would be the economic juggernaut of the 21st century. Even in the 1992 campaign, Bill Clinton and AL GORE were extolling the virtues of the European economic systems, of social democracy and industrial planning. We hear echoes of this approach today, with candidate AL GORE's Government-knows-best mentality. GORE proposes to micromanage and fine-tune the economy, social engineering through tax credits designed to make people behave the way the Washington bureaucrats want them to--such as buying ``fuel-efficient'' eighteen-wheeler trucks. 
   Ronald Reagan's ``Program for Economic Recovery'' was the opposite of the Government planning approach advocated by the critics of capitalism. Reagan rejected the idea that policymakers could fine-tune the economy,  much less control it from Washington. Instead, he sought to establish a stable environment conducive to economic growth. This meant getting inflation under control, and reducing taxes, regulation, and the size and scope of Government. It meant restoring the incentives for working, saving, investing, and succeeding. It meant opening America to the benefits and challenges of international trade. 
   Ronald Reagan's economic principles resonated within me. I had seen first-hand the obvious connection between the expansion of Government and our worsening economic performance. When I started in the banking business in 1966, I probably spent 90 to 95 percent of my time engaged in activities that I considered productive--designing new services to attract business, working to increase the market share and profitability of the bank. The rest involved Government paperwork. By the time I left in 1982, this ratio had completely flipped: I was spending 85 to 90 percent of my time trying to figure out how to comply with Government regulations and mandates. There was a constant stream of letters from the Government dictating how we should manage our business, from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve, on topics ranging from flood insurance to so-called truth-in-lending. I remember a letter that went so far as to tell us the specific temperatures to set our heating and cooling thermostats in our businesses. Some people may have forgotten this level of Government intrusion. 
   In fact, others may believe it never could happen in a country such as America, but it has. It has happened before, and if we are not vigilant, it could happen again. 
   I received a letter from Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker detailing which types of loans we could and could not make. To make the example, I could lend a family money to add an additional bedroom to their home. If that same family wanted to add a swimming pool to their home, I was prohibited from making that loan. 
   To some, this may have made sense if you believed that the Government should be managing consumer demand, but that role made no sense to me. 
   With my experience in the banking business, it wasn't hard to understand why we as a nation were having difficulty competing around the globe, when we had moved so many of our resources away from productive activities and into trying to comply with Government regulations. Over the years I had come to realize that all the abstract Keynesian theories I was taught in college ignored how the choices and incentives of individuals are altered by government interference in the economy. By failing to account for the real world, those theories in practice had come pretty close to ruining the economy. But along came Ronald Reagan, with a common sense approach that went back to basics--free markets, free enterprise, free trade. Here was a man who had recognized that big Government was a detriment to the economy, a man who approached things from the perspective of freedom as opposed to Government. I shared that perspective and recognized the importance of President Reagan's election. On election night, November 4, 1980, I knew that I had to get involved in this great campaign to restore freedom--but I would have never guessed that, two decades later, I would be standing here in the United States Senate. 
   Ronald Reagan clearly saw that the problem was too much government, and the solution was more individual freedom. When he assumed the Presidency, we suffered from high inflation and high unemployment. To combat the first, he prescribed reigning in the rapid growth of the money supply, asking the Fed to minimize the damage to the economy caused by high and volatile inflation. The second problem required deep cuts in the high tax rates that were deterring work, saving, and investment. But the Fed delivered tight money a lot sooner than the Congress could deliver the tax cuts, which were phased-in over 3 years. The Fed had overreacted to the stimulus of tax cuts that had not yet arrived, exacerbating the economic downtown, throwing the budget seriously out of balance, and putting the third year of the Reagan tax rate reductions in jeopardy. 
   In the recession of the early 1980s, the economic policies of President Reagan that inspired me to public service came under attack. In the now famous ``Stay the Course'' campaign of 1982, the President's party retained control of the Senate, minimized losses in the House despite the dire economic times, and preserved the Reagan economic program. We also kept on track President Reagan's defense policies, which were under attack from short-sighted critics who were unwilling to pay the price to ensure our freedom. I am proud that my first campaign was in that fateful year, when President Reagan's detractors stood a chance of putting his programs in jeopardy and I was able to make a stand in favor of his programs. 
   As I mentioned, the Reagan economic program was my inspiration to run for office. As a freshman, I cut my teeth in the House by circulating a letter vowing support for the President's veto of any bill that tampered with the third year of the tax cuts. After I obtained the 146 signatures necessary to sustain a veto, that threat disappeared, and the Kemp-Roth tax cuts were allowed to work. President Reagan's most dramatic policy change was without a doubt this supply-side tax cut. It seems also inconceivable today that just two decades ago, marginal income tax rates were as high as 70 percent in the United States. It was little wonder that our country was in economic decline, when its most economically productive citizens could keep only a 30 percent share of their additional earnings. These high tax rates not only discouraged additional work and investment at the margin, but also confiscated capital that could have been used for job creation by the private sector. 
   By cutting income tax rates by 30 percent across-the-board, Reagan restored a large measure of freedom to the American taxpayer--not just the freedom to spend money that would have been taxed away, but the freedom that results when economic decisions are no longer influenced by high tax rates. It was not about the dollars that would have been collected had tax rates stayed high, but the choices that would never have been made because of these high rates--decisions to expand plant capacities or start new businesses, for instance. 
   President Reagan entered the White House with one paramount spending goal: to rebuild our national defense, since national security is the most fundamental responsibility of the Federal Government. He realized that to provide this desperately needed public good, while cutting tax rates to unleash the productive forces of the nation, required fiscal restraint in the non-defense portion of the Federal budget. 
   The difficulties that President Reagan had in taming the congressional urge to spend made a balanced budget and tax limitation amendment to the Constitution one of my top priorities when I entered Congress. It also motivated me to be the main House sponsor, along with Dick Cheney, of the Gramm-Rudman Deficit Reduction Act, which worked for at least a few years to hold spending down. Today, as much as ever, I believe some super majority restriction on the ability of Members of Congress to spend taxpayers' dollars is necessary. Unless taxes are cut to keep the revenues from flowing into Washington, the trillions of dollars of surpluses that are projected over the next decade will not last--if the taxes are collected, Congress will spend them. 
   Reagan also initiated a sea change in monetary policy. He did not want the Federal Reserve to manipulate the money supply in an attempt to target interest or unemployment rates. All he wanted was price stability, the elimination of high levels of inflation from the economy. The Fed should not be responsible for the level of growth in the economy--this is the role of the private sector. The best economic environment that the Fed can provide is one in which inflation expectations play a small or almost nonexistent role in long-term planning. Reagan's appointees to the Federal Reserve Board, people like Alan Greenspan, Preston Martin, Manley Johnson, Martha Seger, and Wayne Angell, shared this view and took politics out of monetary policy.  
   Throughout the Reagan years, the loudest and strongest advocate of stable prices in the Congress was Jack Kemp. Jack would talk tirelessly about the need for ``a dollar as good as gold,'' and his intellectual and political support for this position no doubt influenced President Reagan's selection of Greenspan as Fed Chairman. Alan Greenspan continues to hold sway at the Federal Reserve as part of the Reagan legacy, and his record at containing inflation has set a high standard. As a member of the Senate Banking Committee I have attempted to institutionalize this approach to monetary policy, sponsoring a bill that would make price stability, not economic growth or ``stabilization,'' the goal of the Federal Reserve. Thanks to the monetary policy initiated by President Reagan, this legislation is now a safeguard rather than a necessity. 
   The prevailing attitude concerning trade has also shifted, thanks to President Reagan--who recognized the fallacy of protectionism. In large part, this was due to his belief in competition and free enterprise. But his attitude was also shaped by his confidence in America. He was neither afraid of foreign competition, nor embarrassed that imports might be preferred over American goods. America, as a nation of immigrants, represents the best that the world can offer. More than any consumer good, the main export of America must be the ideal of political and economic freedom, an ideal that is undercut by trade restrictions. 
   By signing a free trade agreement with Canada, opening free trade negotiations with Mexico, and proposing the dismantling of agricultural trade barriers in the Uruguay Round of the GATT, Ronald Reagan went on the offensive for trade liberalization. At a time when Japan-bashing was commonplace--when Members of Congress were literally bashing Japanese-made electronics into pieces on the steps of the Capitol--Reagan did not retreat from his basic free-trade principles. The remarkable success of U.S. industries from computers, semiconductors, software, biotechnology and many others over the past 2 decades has vindicated Reagan's belief that American business prospers best in an open and competitive free enterprise environment. 
   Today, principally as a result of the supply-side policies pursued by the Reagan administration, the U.S. economy is healthy. Both inflation and unemployment are low. Productivity is growing rapidly and incomes are rising. 
   Any doubts that President Reagan is responsible for today's bounty should be dispelled by considering a few fundamental questions. Would American economic growth be as robust today if the Federal Government still took 70 cents of every additional dollar of income from our most productive citizens? If the typical family was hit with a 49 percent Federal income tax rate on top of an effective payroll tax rate of 14.2 percent? 
   Would our economy be so strong if we were still suffering from double-digit inflation and interest rates, due to the politicized use of monetary policy to manipulate consumer demand? If the trend of the last 2 decades were toward managed trade, rather than freer trade? Would entrepreneurs and innovators abound if high inflation and high tax rates on capital gains slashed the returns to their risk-taking? 
   Would the Soviet Empire have fallen if it had not been for the military buildup, diplomatic leadership, and resolute defense of freedom during the presidency of Ronald Reagan? Would our country be as secure as it is today if instead of trading partners, the people of Eastern and Central Europe were still prisoners of the Soviet bloc? If our fellow Americans south of our border were still the potential victims of imported totalitarianism instead of full participants in established democracies? 
   Our debt to Ronald Reagan reminds me of an exchange mission I once went on, with Tom Foley and Dick Cheney. 
   It was a congressional delegation that went to France in 1985. On that trip, we spent most of our time in Paris. But for the last several days, we went out to the French countryside. I went to a little town called Le Mans, where I traveled around with my host, Francois, from that district. I learned a lot about what his country was experiencing. 
   At the end of that tour, we did what many of us would refer to as an old-fashioned town meeting, where I responded to questions from the French audience for almost 2 hours. At the end of the period, I asked Francois if it would be all right if I were to ask the audience a question. And he was gracious in my request, and I asked them: Since I am returning to America tomorrow, I would like to be able to tell other people of the State of Florida what you think about our country. 
   The first person stood up and said: ``We think of America as a dynamic, growing, thriving, exciting place.'' A second person that stood up said basically the same thing. The third person to address me was a fellow who probably was in his late 70's or early 80's. This fellow was stooped over, his weight being supported precariously on an old, gnarled cane. He came over closer to me, looked me directly in the eyes, and said: ``You tell the people of America that we will never forget that it was the American G.I. who saved our little town. You tell them we'll never forget!'' 
   Well, I feel that way about Ronald Reagan, my political hero, who inspired me to enter politics. America will never forget what President Reagan did for us. He gave us back our faith and renewed our belief in this country. He gave America back its pride. He rebuilt America's defenses. His economic policies reduced taxes, reduced inflation, reduced unemployment. He put America back to work again. He reminded America what made us a great nation--our commitment to freedom. And he won the cold war without firing a single shot. 
   The citizens of America and the people of the world will never forget. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of Coptic Christians in Egypt who have been persecuted because of their religious beliefs. According to reports by both the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights and Freedom House in the United States, up to 1,200 Coptic Christians in Al-Kosheh, Egypt, were detained, interrogated, and subjected to police brutality in relation to the murders of two other Coptic Christians in 1998. After weeks of reported torture, these accounts suggest that confessions were obtained under duress that identified Shaiboub William Arsel as the murderer. Mr. Arsel was subsequently sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. 
   Over the last two years I have met with officials from the Egyptian government, including President Hosni Mubarak on several occasions in an attempt to address this issue quietly. Unfortunately, these discussions have failed to produce sufficient action on the part of the government of Egypt. As a result, I rise today to submit a resolution urging the President to encourage the Egyptian government to provide Shaiboub William Arsel with a timely and open appeal that would include international observers, and furthermore to complete an independent investigation of the police brutality in Al-Kosheh.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, as a co-sponsor of the Community Renewal and New Markets Act of 2000, I want to commend Chairman ROTH for his usual fine work in assembling a bill that garners the support of such a large number of our Finance Committee colleagues. I am pleased that a number of items in this bill are provisions that are extremely important to me, and I would like to speak briefly concerning them. 
   But I also want to draw attention to some provisions in this bill that I do not favor. As this bill stands in the place of what would have been a bill reported out of the Committee on Finance, it reflects the compromises that are inherent in the committee process. Unlike typical bills, of which it is reasonable to assume that every provision is supported by every co-sponsor, probably every co-sponsor of this bill can find provisions contained in it that he does not support. Of many, there are two that I find most troubling: the ``new markets tax credit,'' and the ``individual development accounts.'' 
   These two provisions are appropriations masquerading as tax cuts. Under the new markets tax credit, the Secretary of the Treasury would annually pay dividends to investors in ``community development entities,'' which must be certified by the Treasury Department and which must have as their primary mission investing in low-income people or communities. This proposal is premised on the belief that an entity that lacks a profit-motive, under federal bureaucratic supervision, will be an attractive investment for people if dividends are guaranteed. It is the sort of scheme that could only be dreamed up by people who have spent their entire careers in government. A simpler way to direct capital to investment-starved pockets is by eliminating the tax on capital gains--this is the decentralized, market-oriented approach. 
   The ``individual development accounts'' would launder government-matching funds for low income savers through financial institutions. This new entitlement cannot be justified. It is true that, by some measures, the savings rate in the United States appears low. Simple logic dictates that the savings rate have been lowered due to federal tax policies, which impose several layers of taxation upon income that is saved. It is one thing to address this problem at the source, by removing the extra taxation on savings--a we do to the extent that people can make deductible contributions to traditional IRAs and contributions to Roth IRAs. But to give people money to reward them for saving is pure income redistribution, a misuse of the taxpayers' money. 
   Despite my disagreement with some of the provisions of this bill, I am pleased that the bill contains several initiatives that I have proposed over the past few Congresses. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit is boosted to make up for over a decade's worth of inflation, and is indexed to prevent this problem from reoccurring. The First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit for the District of Columbia is extended and the marriage penalty in the credit is eliminated. Section 1706 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which discriminates against high technology workers and the companies that hire them, is repealed. Not-for-hire disaster insurance funds, in my state of Florida and several others, are made tax-exempt entities. 
   I am most encouraged by the extension of my zero percent capital gains tax rate proposal to businesses in the entire District of Columbia, and to businesses in all empowerment and renewal zones. Although I am concerned that the lengthy, five-year holding period is unwise and undermines the power of the proposal, I am nevertheless pleased that the idea is spreading and people are coming to see capitalism as the only true cure for poverty.

   Mr. MACK. Madam President, I rise today to engage my colleague from Florida in a colloquy. Specifically, I want to clarify our understanding of the portion of the legislation we're considering today to restore, preserve and protect the Everglades ecosystem. My understanding is that the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan authorized by this bill create a balance between state and federal interests in ensuring that the predicted Plan benefits--including benefits to both state and federal lands--are attained. It is my view that this bill is intended to recognize and maintain the State's interest in preserving the sovereignty, in State law, over the reservation and allocation of water within the State's boundaries. It is my further understanding that the Agreement called for between the President and the Governor of Florida will not result in a federalization of State water law. Florida water law requires that all reasonable beneficial water uses and natural system demands are subject to a public interest balancing test. Implementation of the Plan will rely upon State law and processes for reserving and allocating water for all users, according to the principles set out in the legislation before us. It is not the intent of this Act, or the President/Governor Agreement required by this Act, to create a procedure where all of the new water made available by the Plan will be allocated to the natural system leaving nothing for other water users. Rather, the agreement will simply ensure that water for the natural system is reserved first, and any remaining water may be allocated among other users according to the provisions of State water law. I yield to my colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM.

   Mr. MACK. Madam President, I rise today to call the Senate's attention to a provision of the bill before us expressing the sense of the Senate concerning Homestead Air Force Base in Florida. I want to take a moment of the Senate's time today to express my understanding of this resolution and my own intent in agreeing to its inclusion in the bill before us today. 
   As my colleagues are aware, this Air Force base is currently in the disposal process set forth by Congress when it established a fair and impartial system for closing military facilities around the country. Since Hurricane Andrew devastated the region in 1992, the citizens of South Florida have waited for a disposal decision from the federal government. It is anticipated the property could provide a stable economic platform for a community that is in need of jobs and economic development. Clearly, it is my intent that whatever use to which the property is ultimately put be accomplished in a manner that does not adversely impact the surrounding environment or the Everglades restoration plan we're considering today. 
   But let me be clear, Mr. President. It is emphatically not my intent that this resolution be read by the United States Air Force to mean they should add to, alter, or amend the existing process for disposing the property at Homestead Air Force Base. It is my strong view that the process for conveying surplus military property is clearly set forth in the law and that process should be followed until the final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement on the property is completed and the Air Force disposes the property.

   Mr. MACK. Madam President, I will only take a moment of the Senate's time today--prior to the vote on the Water Resources Development Act--to acknowledge the importance of this moment and the action the Senate will take today to restore and preserve America's Everglades. 
   My colleague, Senator GRAHAM, and I have worked for eight years to bring this bill to the floor and it gives me great satisfaction that today it will be approved by the Senate. 
   I want especially to thank Chairman SMITH for his dedication to this effort over the past few months. He has worked side-by-side with us to develop the consensus product we're voting on today. As we developed this legislation, he and his staff provided valuable input into the process and we appreciate the long hours they put in on our behalf. 
   Further, I want to--once again--acknowledge my colleague, Senator GRAHAM. He has worked on Everglades issues for years--even prior to his time in the Senate--and it has been a pleasure to work with him over the years as we worked on the legislation before us. 
   The Corps of Engineers, the Department of Interior, and the Council on Environmental Quality have worked long hours to turn this bill into reality. I appreciate the support of these agencies throughout the process and for the proof--once again--that saving the Everglades is not a partisan issue. 
   And finally, I want to acknowledge the hard work and steadfast support of Governor Bush. The State of Florida is a full partner with us in this restoration effort, and I believe the work we've put in together in writing this bill bodes well for a lasting partnership on behalf of the Everglades. 
   The Everglades is an American treasure. Today we in the Senate will take a major step forward in passing a restoration plan that is rooted in good science, common sense, and consensus. I thank everyone who participated in this process for their hard work and dedication to the effort.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to say to my dear friend, the Senator from Virginia, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to his presentation. And I say this with all good humor. It was a great performance. It reminded me a little of Chicken Little in ``The Sky is Falling'' when I listened to equating $86 million in operating expenses to a $1.4 billion budget. The $86 million will be the cost of operating and maintaining this new system 25 or 30 years from now. I think it might be appropriate to try to figure out what the Corps' budget might be 25 or 30 years from now. I think that would bring a more significant understanding of the impact of the operating and maintenance costs to the Federal Government. 
   The second point I will make is that we are already spending more than that now on the Everglades. I suggest that on this project we are proposing today--and I believe strongly that it will pass--we will probably seek a reduction in the long run as a part of the Corps' budget. But, again, I appreciate the fervor with which my colleague presented his argument.

   Mr. MACK. I am sure we will.  
   Mr. President, I am in strong opposition to the amendment offered by my friend from Virginia. This amendment, if passed, will put an end to the unprecedented partnership developed between the Federal Government and the State of Florida in an effort to restore and protect America's Everglades. While I am sure my colleague from Virginia has the best of intentions in offering his amendment, I caution my colleagues that one-size-fits-all solutions can be extremely harmful to 
   something as sensitive and as difficult as Everglades restoration. 
   It may be useful to take a few minutes today to help highlight the Everglades provision in the water resources bill before us and explain how the amendment of the Senator from Virginia will impact our longstanding efforts to restore and protect this unique ecosystem. 
   Let me begin by stating that the legislation before us today is a consensus product supported by a full spectrum of environmental groups and economic stakeholders. It is supported by Florida's two Indian tribes, Gov. Jeb Bush of the State of Florida, and it is supported by the Clinton administration. 
   Nine months ago, my colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, and I set out to write a balanced Everglades bill that addressed the needs of south Florida's environment and its citizens. This was no small task. We asked individuals and groups who have long been divided to set aside their differences and work together with us. We asked them to help us restore this vibrant, natural system to its former glory. With the steady leadership of Chairman BOB SMITH and Senator BAUCUS, we have accomplished our goal. The bill we bring to the floor today is something of which all Americans, and I believe all Senators, can be proud. 
   In the bill we are considering today, we authorize a comprehensive plan to undo the harm done by 50 years of Federal efforts to control flooding in south Florida, without consideration for damage done to south Florida's environment. This comprehensive plan was developed over the past 8 years by the Corps of Engineers, with input from economic and environmental stakeholders, local governments, scientists, restoration engineers, the people of south Florida, and the Congress. It is recognized throughout south Florida and the Nation as a fair and balanced plan to provide for the water-related needs of the region while, for the first time, ensuring that the needs of the Everglades will be met as well. 
   It is terribly important that we do this. Without this plan, the Everglades will die and water, the lifeblood of south Florida's economy, will continue to be siphoned off into the sea without benefiting the environment or the people who live and work in the region. 
   Let me take a moment to share with you some of the principles Senator GRAHAM and I have used to guide our efforts this year in drafting this bill. We wanted to be sensitive to the legitimate concerns and needs of all citizens and interests who have a stake in how the plan is implemented, we wanted to be true to the restoration mandate and ensure that the Everglades got the first benefit of any new water generated by the plan, and we wanted to affirm and establish in law the true partnership we share with the State of Florida in achieving the plan's restoration goal. 
   The cooperation between the State agencies charged with managing this effort and the Federal Government over the years has been truly unprecedented. The State shared the cost of developing the plan we are considering today. The Corps of Engineers has benefited greatly from the engineering talent at the South Florida Water Management District. Florida has been our full partner in bearing half of the cost of the restoration projects already underway in the Everglades. The State has committed to split evenly the cost of implementing the plan once it is authorized. The reason for this partnership is simple. 
   Both the State and Federal Government have a vital interest in the restoration of the Everglades. Both the State and the Federal Government should pay for the cost of operating and maintaining the restoration project once it is built. 
   I say this to provide background for the debate on the amendment before us. This partnership we have established is vital to our efforts, and if this amendment passes, it will be very difficult to accomplish our restoration goals.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, a key part of this partnership has been the commitment by the State of Florida--already enshrined in a bill approved by Governor Bush earlier this year--to pay fully half the $7.8 billion cost of implementing the Everglades restoration plan. This is a significantly greater cost share than the local sponsor typically pays to construct a Corps project. 
   Many Corps projects have a local cost share of as little as 20 percent of the total project and few pay more than 35 percent. In fact, if the State were paying 35 percent, rather than the 50 percent it has committed to, it would increase the burden of the Federal taxpayer by almost $1.2 billion. Let me repeat that. The State has committed to a greater-than-average cost share for constructing the restoration project and will save the Federal taxpayers almost $1.2 billion. 
   I believe the good faith demonstrated by the State's offer--not to mention the resulting savings of the Federal Government--clearly refutes any argument that the State is somehow unduly benefiting from the operation and maintenance cost share proposed in the bill before us today. 
   While I cannot stress enough the damage this amendment will do to our relationship with the State of Florida, I remind my colleagues about the significant Federal investment we are making in the Everglades and the important Federal interest in ensuring this project is operated and maintained properly. 
   Within the boundaries of the proposed restoration area, there are four national parks, including Everglades National Park, one of the crown jewels of our National Park System. There is a national marine sanctuary and many other national interests. All of these important environmental assets are dependent upon the successful operation of the restoration plan. 
   If the project is not operated properly--if the water is not right--these important Federal holdings in south Florida will continue to suffer the same fate they are suffering today. If we and the State of Florida are to come together behind a restoration plan and spend $7.8 billion to implement that plan, it seems we also have the responsibility and obligation to stay in Florida and help with the successful operation and maintenance of the project. That is a reasonable position. 
   I add that the operation and maintenance cost share in this bill is fully consistent with prior central and southern Florida project authorizations. In fact, the Federal Government pays the full cost of operating and maintaining the levees, channels, locks, and control works of the St. Lucie Canal, Lake Okeechobee, and the Caloosahatchee River. The Federal Government pays the full cost--not 50-50, but the full cost--of operating the levees, channels, locks, and control works of the St. Lucie Canal, Lake Okeechobee, and the Caloosahatchee River. All of these areas that I have mentioned are in this restoration area. It pays the full cost of operating and maintaining the main spillways in the system's water conservation area. 
   Further, the Flood Control Act of 1968 provided that the project costs of providing water delivery to Everglades National Park is considered a federal responsibility and on that basis the federal government would share in the operation and maintenance of projects that serve that area of the system. The federal government is also required, under a 1989 law, to participate in the cost share for the modified water deliveries project. And, finally, the water resources bill of 1996 provides that the cost of operating and maintaining water deliveries to Taylor Slough and Everglades National Park be shared between the State and federal governments. 
   That is my argument to this constant mention of the fact that for 14 years we have had this precedent.  
   I have just stated the whole series of issues related to the Everglades in which there is a whole range of the sharing of costs and maintaining the Everglades system. 
   There appears to be ample precedent for a shared cost between the State and federal governments on projects related to the Everglades and Everglades restoration. 
   What the Senator from Virginia is advocating is something far different. He would have the federal government pack up and leave when the restoration project is completed--essentially abandoning precedent and abandoning a national treasure after an unprecedented effort to save it. His amendment would have the federal government abdicate its responsibility, to both the environment and the taxpayer, to protect the substantial investment we're making on their behalf in the Everglades. 
   I would remind my colleagues, the Everglades is a dynamic system. It is dependent on the steady, reliable supply of fresh water this restoration project will provide over the years. 
   It is not like a levee, or a bridge, which the federal government can construct and turn over to the local authorities. This is an enormously complex restoration project managing the water flow over and through 18,000 square miles of subtropical uplands, wetlands and coral reefs. The area covered by this project spans from Lake Okeechobee to Key West; from Fort Myers on the gulf to Fort Pierce on the Atlantic. 
   This is not an investment we can afford to abandon, Mr. President. The investment is too great and the stakes are too high. I would urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MACK. This will be a brief response. I apologize to my colleagues for trying to hop in here, but the Senator raised a question I thought should be responded to: What makes us different? 
   In the State of Florida, in 1994, we passed the Everglades Forever Act which provides for local payment of water cleanup costs. The Federal Government's share in the cost of cleaning up the water that directly benefits Federal areas such as the Everglades National Park--the fact is that the local communities are paying for the cleanup of the waters that the Senator has suggested. 
   The second point I make, I think there is something unique about what we have come up with. The Senator says the uniqueness is the 50-50 cost sharing. The uniqueness that I see--and I don't think there is a Member who has traveled to the State of Florida and become involved and knowledgeable about the Everglades Project, who is not amazed by the partnerships that have been developed--is the various interests in our State that have come together and who have said not only do they support but they are willing to put money into it. 
   As the Senator knows, the State of Florida, during this past legislative session, in fact, put up I believe almost $200 million towards this project. 
   Again, to answer the question directly, the cities are, in fact, paying. The State of Florida anticipated that question in 1994 and passed the act that I referred to a few moments ago. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding.

   Mr. MACK. I believe, if I can respond, and perhaps I can 
   find the language, if you read further on in the act, you will find some language that has to do with some cost sharing of the area that the Senator is referring to as identifying certain aspects of the bill, but there are other references in there about following precedent with respect to cost sharing. There is, as I read in my statement, a whole series of things in which there is even 100-percent participation at the Federal level for operation and maintenance.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I respond to the question raised by the Senator from Virginia when we were talking about cost share. I suggested to Senator WARNER, if he looked in other places in Public Law 104, which is referred to as the Water Resources Development Act of 1996, he would find other language different from the language to which he was referring. That is found in section 316, central and southern Florida Canal, 111. Under ``Operation and Maintenance,'' it says:  
   The non-Federal share of operation and maintenance cost of the improvements undertaken pursuant to this section shall be 100 percent;  
   However, if you go on, it says:  
   ......except that the Federal Government shall reimburse the non-Federal interest with respect to the project 60 percent of the cost of operating and maintaining pump stations that pump water into Taylor Slough and in the Everglades National Park.  
   I wonder what the argument was 14 years ago about changing precedent. People want to refer to precedent. The reality is that Congress does what the Congress believes is necessary to carry out an important project. I think it is pretty clear. In fact, my colleagues who oppose this cost share have indicated they are going to support the resolution, or support the act; therefore, I think, accepting the notion of the significance and importance of what we are doing. And therefore it is reasonable for the Senate to determine on this particular project because of its unusual, unique circumstances, that somehow we should, in fact, have a 50-50 cost share. 
   I do not find that stunning, and I am not impressed with the fact that for the last 14 years which some want to refer to that there has been a precedent established. There are all kinds of indications that we have had different cost shares, to the extent that we find in some areas the Federal Government is picking up 100 percent of the cost of operation and maintenance. 
   I again say to my colleagues, I hope they will support Senator GRAHAM and I and Senators SMITH and BAUCUS and defeat this amendment.

   Mr. MACK. I echo the sentiments of the Senator from Florida about the Adaptive Assessment and Monitoring Program. As this is a long-term plan spanning almost 25 years in execution, it stands to reason that research will yield new information and technology changes will yield new solutions. The Adaptive Assessment and Monitoring Program is critical to ensuring that this new information is incorporated into our planning process for this project. The type of collaboration described by my colleague from Florida will ensure that resources are wisely spent by utilizing and expanding monitoring programs already in operation.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the future of U.S. trade relations with China and the impending vote on China's PNTR status. The prosperity that this nation has enjoyed for the past 50 years has been a result of our commitment to free trade and opening markets. Free trade benefits all--it enhances prosperity and develops markets, essential elements to the spread of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. China's entry into the World Trade Organization will also enhance American competitiveness, further our national interests, and benefit our trading partners. But we must enter into this agreement with our eyes open. China must comply with this agreement for it to have meaning. The United States must vigilantly seek enforcement of all agreements with China, including those addressing national security and human rights. 
   I share the concern of my colleague, Senator THOMPSON, regarding China's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. On August 9th of this year, the Director of Central Intelligence reported that China remained a ``key supplier'' of weapons technology and increased-missile related assistance to Pakistan as recently as the second half of 1999. In the last year it has been reported that China transferred missile technology to Libya and North Korea and may still be providing secret technical assistance to Pakistan's nuclear program. U.S. Intelligence has also provided evidence that the PRC has provided Iran with nuclear technology, chemical weapons materials, and missile technology that would violate China's commitment to observe the MTCR and U.S. laws. I do not suggest that because of these violations we should cut off trade with China, but we must address the fact that they are supplying rogue nations with weapons of mass destruction. This threat to our national security has made my decision on this vote a difficult one, and that has been compounded by my concerns with China's repeated human rights abuses. 
   I suspect that each of my colleagues has had some opportunity over the years to hear about the human rights abuses taking place in China. I think one of the more eloquent spokesmen for the struggle for freedom has been Wei Jingsheng. He reminds us that those of us who live in the luxury of freedom should not forget those who are still struggling for liberty and freedom. 
   Mr. President, because of these very strong conflicting views, the importance of open and free trade on the one hand, and the importance of human dignity and the pursuit of freedom on the other, this has been a difficult decision for me. But, after due consideration, I conclude that moving toward open and free markets advances freedom in China, so long as China is willing to abide by the rules of the WTO. 
   By exposing China to global competition and the benefits it has to offer, Chinese leaders will be both obligated and empowered to more quickly move their country toward full economic reform. And by virtue of their business relationships, over time the Chinese people will be exposed to information, ideas and debate from around the world. This in turn will encourage them and their leadership to embrace the virtue and promise of individual freedom. The reason I am willing to embrace it has much has to do with the kinds of changes we have seen taking place in China over the years. If they were still committed to the ideology of the 1950's and 1960's, I do not think we would be here today. But, they have clearly moved toward opening their economy, and we should continue to push to open the country to freedom. 
   So I think it is time for us to respond to these changes by saying to the Chinese people--we want to be engaged in free trade and competition with you. I think, in the end, humanity will benefit. So I will cast a vote in favor of this legislation. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the 10 days since his sudden passing and the outpouring of expression from many different directions have given me the opportunity to reflect on PAUL's life, the gifts he brought to the Senate, and the impact his life had on people. 
   I want to focus my remarks on PAUL COVERDELL's humility, which I think was his defining quality, his greatest gift, and one which had the greatest impact on the lives of others. 
   Many people might say that humility, sometimes defined as freedom from pride or arrogance, is a quality not found often in our society today. No one disputes, however, that PAUL COVERDELL possessed a deep sense of humility. 
   During the past 10 days, PAUL COVERDELL has been described as: Serious and low key; self-effacing; uncomfortable in the limelight; a humble public servant who became a political giant through selfless dedication and quiet civility; a very gentle and courteous person; a person people went to, felt really comfortable with, and opened up to; a person who really cared for what happened to others; a person many regarded as the Senate's leading mediator; a person of scrupulous integrity and unblemished character; a person with an unsurpassed work ethic and standard of personal ethics and devotion to what he was doing; a person who always kept his word and was someone you could count on--just to mention a few characterizations.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to join us to reduce the marriage penalties in the tax code. This bill will provide married couples the relief that President Clinton denied them last year with his veto of the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999. President Clinton's action last year increased taxes by close to $800 billion and imposed a marriage penalty on middle class American families. 
   There is no place in the Tax Code for marriage penalties. Marriage penalties are caused by tax laws that treat joint filers relatively worse than single filers with half the income. It has of late become common practice to use the Tax Code for purposes of social engineering, discouraging some actions with the stick of tax penalties and encouraging others with the carrot of tax preferences. But there is no legitimate policy reason for punishing taxpayers with higher taxes just because they happen to be married. The marriage penalties in the Tax Code undermine the family, the institution that is the foundation of our society. 
   I view this bill as just a start. Our Tax Code will not truly be family-friendly until every single marriage penalty is rooted out and eliminated, so that married couples with twice the income of single individuals are taxed at the same rates, and are eligible for the same tax preferences--including deductions, exemptions, use of IRAs and other savings vehicles--as those single filers. This bill is an important step toward that ultimate goal. 
   The Democrat criticisms of our bill are misplaced. They argue that our bill contains complicated phase-ins, in contrast to their simple approach. But anyone who reads the bill and their alternative would see that this is false. The Finance Committee bill contains percentages in it, sure enough. And it phases in the relief, that is true. But the percentages and the phase-ins are instructions to the Treasury and the IRS, to make adjustments to the tax brackets. The only people who have to make any new calculations under the Finance Committee bill are the bureaucrats who make up the tax tables, not the taxpayer.  
   By contrast, the Democrat alternative, in phasing in its relief, requires taxpayers to calculate their taxes as joint filers, then calculate their taxes as if they were single--a complicated process that requires the allocation of various deductions and credits. Next, the taxpayer would have to determine the difference between these two calculations and then reduce this by a certain percentage. That is supposed to be simple? The Democrat substitute adds to the headaches of tax filing and the demand for tax preparers and tax preparation software. 
   The Democrats also complain that the Finance Committee bill does more than address their narrow definition of the marriage penalty. They invoke the so-called ``marriage bonus.'' But the ``marriage bonus'' is a red herring. What they call a ``marriage bonus'' results from adjusting tax brackets for joint filers to reflect the fact that two adults are sharing the household income. Under the Democrat approach, single taxpayers who marry a non-working or low-earning spouse should pay the same amount of taxes as when they were single, even though this income must be spread over the needs of two adults. 
   This approach is fundamentally flawed. The Democrat approach would enshrine in the law a new ``homemaker penalty.'' The Democrats would make families with one earner and one stay-at-home spouse pay higher taxes than families with the same household income and two earners. 
   But why discriminate against one-earner families? Why would we want a tax code that penalized families just because one of the spouses chooses the hard work of the household over the role of breadwinner? The Democrat alternative discourages parents from staying home with their infant children, and penalizes a person who works longer hours so that a spouse can care for elderly parents. That is just plain wrong. 
   The Finance Committee bill reduces the marriage penalty in a rational, sensible way, by making the standard deduction for joint filers twice what it is for single filers, and by making the ranges at which income is taxed at the 15 percent and 28 percent rates twice for joint filers what they are for single filers. This recognizes that marriage is a partnership in which two adults share the household income. Our approach cuts taxes for all American families. The Democrats call this a ``bonus.'' We call it common sense.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to vote to bury the death tax once and for all. This tax is anti-family and anti-capitalist, smothers the American Dream, and is rationalized only by the greed of government and envy of success. 
   The debate over death tax repeal highlights, as much as any issue that we will consider, a fundamental difference in philosophy among members of this body, and between the Republican Congress and the current Administration. We in the majority believe that the federal government has no right to claims the lion's share of any person's wealth just because that person had the misfortune of dying. The proponents of the death tax think otherwise. 
   At the root of this philosophical difference are two vastly different views of the nature of wealth creation and its role in society. The supporters of the death tax seem to harbor a pessimistic, zero-sum view of wealth--the belief that every dollar saved by one person is one less dollar for the rest of us. This belief makes it easier to argue that a ceiling be placed on the level of wealth attained by any individual or family in America--people justify the confiscation of wealth above this level by attacking as greedy any family that seeks to accumulate more at the expenses of the rest of society. 
   But this view is flawed. There is no finite limit to the amount of wealth that can be created in a society. People become wealthy in a market economy by satisfying the wants of others. Wealth is not a windfall to people with natural intelligence or ability, or who happen to stumble across valuable resources; it is created by providing consumers the goods, materials, and services that they desire at a price that does not exceed their estimate of its value. 
   When one understands this concept, the death tax cannot be justified. If Bill Gates had chosen a career as a government bureaucrat instead of being a software entrepreneur, the tens of billions of dollars he has amassed in wealth would not have been distributed to others in society--instead, this fortune would never have been generated. It came about because Mr. Gates has provided goods and services to the public that they valued as much or more than the price he charged. Every voluntary exchange between that free individuals in a market economy creates wealth, and the businesses that provide the most consumer satisfaction will create the most wealth. When those goods and services are not offered, this wealth is not created, and everyone in society is poorer because their preferred choice does not exist. 
   Proponents of the death tax argue that the heirs and legatees of an individual's fortune did nothing to deserve this bounty. Since it is a windfall to these individuals, why shouldn't the government get a piece of the action? Some death tax supporters go one step further, and have argued on this very floor that, unlikely the heirs, the government has a claim to this wealth because it is responsible for the prosperous American economic environment. This argument amounts to the claim that, since government refrains from confiscating property while people are alive, the government is entitled to confiscate upon death. 
   It makes no sense to terminate property rights at death as the price to pay for their protection while living. The inheritors of property have a right to the property not because of anything they have done, but because it is the will of the decedent. If people cannot leave to their family and friends the wealth they create, they lose the incentive to create it. The higher the rate of death tax falling on their estate, the smaller, the motive to invest in and build a business. The inheritors of property have earned the right to receive it, because they served as the motivation behind the creation of wealth beyond what decedents would consume in their respective lifetimes. 
   It has been estimated that the death tax will cost the economy almost one trillion dollars over the next decade and almost 275,000 jobs in large part because it robs people of the incentive to invest. I regularly receive letters from older constituents explaining that they have no desire to reinvest profits in their business only to have the government claim 55 percent of the business's increase in value. I am sure all of my colleagues receive similar 
   letters. 
   The death tax robs people of the incentive to build up their businesses, smothering the American Dream. The death tax eliminates the jobs that these discouraged entrepreneurs would have created. The death tax reduces the savings pool, reducing capital investments and reducing future productivity. The death tax reduces the choices of goods and services available to consumers. And, perhaps worst of all, the death tax places the interest of government over that of families. 
   Why do we have to impose a tax upon death? Every person spends a lifetime paying taxes on the earnings from which their life savings comes. The income from inherited assets, such as stock dividends or business profits, will be taxed as it is earned. And, under our death tax repeal bill, any capital gain above the exemption amount will result in capital gains taxes when the asset is actually sold. Why the hurry to impose a tax at the time of death, a tax which forces families to sell land, personal property, and business interests that had been in the family for generations? 
   The only reasons are the greed of the government and the death tax supporters' disapproval of inherited wealth. Under current law, the federal government will be collecting over $4 trillion more in taxes than it is budgeted to spend in the next decade alone. It is the federal government that needs a limit to its ability to enjoy the fruits of the hard work of our taxpayers, not the families of these taxpayers. 
   The supporters of the death tax seem genuinely puzzled that the American people, in poll after poll, overwhelmingly support repeal of the death tax. They cannot understand why do many people would oppose a tax that directly affects so few. But the American people understand economics much better than the death taxers. They recognize the loss of jobs and opportunity. They also harbor in their hearts the dream that one day they, too, might be so successful as to amass the wealth that is subject to the confiscatory rates of the death tax. But, most of all, they recognize that a tax may be unfair even though it targets a small segment of the population--indeed, a tax may be unfair because it does so. This part of the American spirit does not seem to be appreciated by the death taxers. 
   Mr. President, the specter of the federal death tax should no longer hover over our citizens, waiting to swoop down and confiscate the savings that has taken a lifetime to build. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the Death Tax Elimination Act.

   Mr. MACK. I was most pleased to see that the Senate report accompanying this bill urged the Department to act in a timely manner to issue a Notice of Proposed Rule Making to include psychology into the Graduate Medical Education program. As you know, the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways & Means Committee have been working with the Department of Health and Human Services on this matter since 1997. Both the Conference Report on the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Report 105-217 issued on July 30, 1997) and the Conference Report on last year's Omnibus bill (Report 106-479 issued on November 18, 1999) urged the Department to act favorably on this matter. In fact last year's Conference Report urged the Secretary to issue Notice of Rule Making to accomplish this modification before June 1, 2000. 
   Mr. President, we thank you for including language in your report--Report 106-292--to further support this effort. I am saddened to report that the advice the Appropriations Committee has given the Secretary is being given little notice, just like all the previous requests to her on this matter. Mr. President, at this point, I would request unanimous consent that a letter I wrote to Secretary Shalala, along with Senator GRAHAM, Congressman SHAW, and Congresswoman THURMAN on April 27, 1998 be published in the RECORD, following this colloquy. 
   Mr. President, many letters have been written to the Secretary and Nancy Ann Min DeParle, the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, on this subject. Language has been included in two Finance/Ways & Means Conference Reports on this subject. Language has been included in the L-HHS Report. Despite all of these urgings, the desired result has not been produced. Would the Chairman of the Subcommittee consider including bill language in the final bill mandating this action if the Department has not issued the Notice of Proposed Rule Making by the time the Subcommittee goes to Conference with the House.

   Mr. MACK. Mr, President, as many of my colleagues are aware, cancer has played a prominent role in my family's history. Some in our family--me, my wife Priscilla, our daughter Debbie--have been lucky enough to have fought cancer and won. Others in our family have not been so lucky. My father died of esophageal cancer, my mother died of kidney cancer and my younger brother Michael died of melanoma at the very young age of thirty-five. 
   As a result, Priscilla and I have become very active in the fight against cancer and in spreading the message that early detection saves lives. It's a part of who we are as a family. 
   And there are other families with their own stories. Michael J. Fox and his family are waging war against Parkinson's disease. Mary Tyler Moore and her family are fighting diabetes. Christopher Reeve and his family are searching for a cure to paralysis. And millions of other families across the United States are fighting their own battles against AIDS, sickle-cell anemia, Lou Gehrig's disease, Alzheimer's and the many, many other diseases that take our loved ones away from us. 
   What I've come to realize in my fight against cancer is the crucial role the federal government plays in funding basic medical research at the National Institutes of Health, and how important basic research is to finding breakthroughs not just for cancer but for all of the diseases which affect our families. 
   For several years now, doubling funding at NIH has been a primary goal of mine in the Senate. The Federal Government, mainly through the NIH, funds about 36 percent of all biomedical research in this country, and plays an especially large role in basic research. 
   Recently, the Joint Economic Committee, released a first-of-its kind study: ``The Benefits of Medical Research and the Role of the NIH,'' which examines how funding for the NIH cuts the high economic costs of disease, reduces suffering from illness, and helps Americans live longer, healthier lives. And I'd like to take a moment, Mr. President, to share with my colleagues some of the findings in this extensive report. 
   According to the JEC, the economic costs of illness in the U.S. are huge--approximately $3 trillion annually, or 31 percent of the nation's GDP. This includes the costs of public and private health care spending, and productivity losses from illness. Medical research can reduce 
   these high costs. But, the NIH is fighting this $3 trillion battle with a budget of $16 billion. That's just half of a percent of the total economic cost of disease in the United States. 
   In addition to lowering the economic costs of illness, advances in medical research greatly help people live longer and healthier lives. A recent study found that longevity increases have created ``value of life'' gains to Americans of about $2.4 trillion every year. A  significant portion of these longevity gains stem from NIH-funded research in areas such as heart disease, stroke and cancer. If just 10 percent of the value of longevity increases, $240 billion, resulted from NIH research, that would mean a return of $15 for every $1 invested in NIH. 
   Also according to the JEC, NIH-funded research helped lead to the development of one-third of the top 21 drugs introduced over the last few decades. These drugs treat patients with ovarian cancer, AIDS, hypertension, depression, herpes, various cancers, and anemia. Future drug research holds great promise for curing many diseases and lowering the costs of illness by reducing hospital stays and invasive surgeries. In fact, one study found that a $1 increase in drug expenditures reduces hospital costs by about $3.65. 
   We know that past medical advances have dramatically reduced health care costs for such illnesses as tuberculosis, polio, peptic ulcers, and schizophrenia. For example, the savings from the polio vaccine, which was introduced in 1955, still produces a $30 billion savings per year, every year. 
   Medical advances will help cut costs by reducing lost economic output from disability and premature death. For example, new treatments for AIDS--some developed with NIH-funded research--caused the mortality rate from AIDS to drop over 60 percent in the mid-1990s, thus allowing tens of thousands of Americans to continue contributing to our society and economy. 
   And medical research spending isn't just about reducing the enormous current burdens of illness. The costs of illness may grow even higher if we fail to push ahead with further research. Infectious diseases, in particular, are continually creating new health costs. The recent emergence of Lyme disease, E. coli, and hantavirus, for example, show how nature continues to evolve new threats to health. In addition, dangerous bacteria are evolving at an alarming rate and grow resistant to every new round of antibiotics. 
   This report extensively shows the benefits of medical research and reaffirms the enormous benefits we achieve from funding the National Institutes of Health in our fight against disease. But there is still a lot more work to be done. I am hopeful my colleagues will take a few moments to look at this report and recognize the important work done by the scientists and researchers at the NIH. It can be read in its entirety on the JEC website at: jec.senate.gov. 
   Funding for NIH is really about-- hope and opportunity. The challenge before us is great, but America has always responded when our people are behind the challenge. America landed a man on the moon. We pioneered computer technology. America won the Cold War. Now it is time to win the war against the diseases that plague our society. We have the knowledge. We have the technology. Most important, we have the support of the American people. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in the effort to double funding for the National Institutes of Health. It's good economic policy, it's good public policy, and most importantly, it's good for all Americans.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support for the Everglades restoration bill introduced today by my friend, and chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator BOB SMITH. This bill represents a tremendous amount of effort and hard work and I am grateful to all my colleagues who have joined Senator GRAHAM and me in this effort. 
   Today is an important day in the nearly twenty-year process of restoring America's Everglades. It is important because we are standing at last at the historic juncture between planning and action. It is important because now--at long last--we have a realistic chance of restoring, and protecting for future generations, a unique environmental treasure that is fractured, starved for water, and locked in a steady state of decline. And it is important because the bill we're introducing today represents the cumulative efforts of all those who did the work on the largest and most significant environmental restoration project in our nation's history. 
   Why does this bill matter? Why are the Everglades deserving of Congress' time and effort? Let me offer a few reasons. This bill matters because in the last century a wonderful, pristine natural system in the heart of South Florida was systematically robbed of its beauty and uniqueness in the name of short-term human interest. This bill matters because the America's Everglades is a national treasure, unique in the world, and deserving of a better fate than what is currently written for it in the laws of this country. Our bill matters because we Floridians--after years of acrimony and conflicting goals--have come together behind a balanced plan that fully reconciles the needs of the natural system with those  of the existing water users. And the restoration matters--to us, as legislators--because past Congresses caused this problem, and we in our generation should fix it. 
   It has been well documented how the Congress in 1948--acting under the pressures of the day--authorized the systematic destruction of the Everglades in the name of flood control, urban development, and agriculture. That is history and we cannot change that. Instead, we must respond to the needs and priorities of our own generation, and pass this good bill to restore America's Everglades. 
   Let's be clear, Mr. President. Passing this bill, this year, is all that remains between the long years of study and the actual restoration of America's Everglades. The administration has done their part in devoting a tremendous amount of time and effort on the document before you. To Governor Bush's credit, the State of Florida has already written this plan into Florida's laws and arranged funding for Florida's share of the cost. There is only one task remaining: we in Congress must pass this plan, this year, and let the work of restoration begin. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting the bill we're introducing today. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I begin by saying to my friend, Senator DODD, how much I appreciate his comments at the beginning of his speech to the Senate. I appreciate the relationship we have developed. Certainly, one of the things I will truly miss as I leave the Senate at the end of this year is the relationships that have been developed and the opportunity to expand on those relationships with others. Again, it has been a delight. However, we do have very strong differences of opinion on this issue. 
   I will begin by pointing at the chart that has been put up next to Senator DODD. There is one very fundamental difference. Each of those leaders reached out; they wanted to bring about change. We have seen absolutely, positively none of that from Fidel Castro. There is no indication--not an iota of evidence--that Fidel Castro wants to change. 
   Later today, we will be voting on this amendment to the Defense Department authorization bill, which is designed to establish a commission to review and report on the United States policy toward Cuba. 
   I have spoken with many colleagues recently about this amendment and the idea of forming a commission. I understand from some Senators that they have concerns that they want a chance to discuss regarding Cuba. But the goal of those Senators seems to be either broad sanctions reform or the enactment of specific changes in our policies toward Cuba. But today we are debating an amendment on forming a commission. 
   This commission is blatantly political, in my opinion, so much so that no serious effort can come from a commission designed to be so skewed. This commission accomplishes nobody's goal. 
   Let me make three points: First, we don't need a national commission to study only Cuba sanctions; second, we should not tie the hands of the next President to set his own Cuba policy; and, third, we should not set policy through a partisan commission outside of the normal conduct of foreign policy by the executive branch. 
   The legislation on which you are being asked to vote establishes a 12-person panel to review and report on various aspects of Cuba policy. But this is why we have a Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate, an International Relations Committee in the House, and a U.S. Department of State. Why are we making Government bigger and more expensive than it needs to be? Especially, as my friend from Connecticut has argued, this amendment does not take a position or implement a policy.  
   Let me highlight a few of the details. This commission is appointed as follows--and, again, I note that my friend indicated this is not a partisan issue, but we who have been around here for a long time all know these issues end up being influenced by politics. 
   What we are going to have is a commission of 12 people, 6 appointed by the current President. The current President will put six members on a commission to tell the next President what his policy toward Cuba should be. And there will be three from each House--two majority, one minority. That means two-thirds of the commission would be appointed by Democrats; that is, 8 of the 12 members of the commission would be appointed by Democrats. One-third, that is, four members of the commission, would be Republicans. That is not the way to set foreign policy. 
   Our current policy, set by the State Department and the President, has been endorsed by the Congress over the years with significant legislation. The only reason for this special commission is to try to change current policy through abnormal means. 
   Let me talk for a moment about American foreign policy in general. I hear the rhetoric often that, after 39 years, clearly, our Cuba policy has not brought democracy to Cuba and therefore it must be abandoned as a failure. Think about that argument for a moment. What if Ronald Reagan had come into office and declared in 1980: After 40 years, since there is no democracy in the Soviet Union, our Soviet policy must be abandoned? 
   Reagan did the opposite. He had the courage to call the Soviet Union what it was, an ``evil empire.'' His courage and commitment brought democratic reform to Russia. America's foreign policy must reflect America's commitment to the principles we believe in: freedom, democracy, justice, and respect for human dignity. 
   My friend from Connecticut has stated that the policy is aimed at one man, Fidel Castro, but it denies basic necessities to the entire 11 million people of Cuba. The reality is that Cuba can purchase goods from the entire world. By closing the American market to Cuba, we are denying the people nothing. Fidel Castro keeps Cuba poor, not the United States embargo. 
   By maintaining the current policy, however, of isolating Fidel Castro, we are doing as a Nation what we have done for so many generations: We are standing shoulder to shoulder with 
   people struggling for freedom. We are standing for truth and dignity and supporting heroes when we oppose Fidel Castro and deny him the means to build up his resources. 
   Since trade has been an important issue of discussion lately given the pending vote on trade with China, perhaps some more detail would be helpful on the differences between China and Cuba. 
   Simply stated, China began policy changes and economic reforms as early as 1978. Today, they continue to open their economy, seek engagement in the community of nations, and look for investment and trade. 
   Let me tell you about Cuba. I will provide details from a study conducted by the University of Miami: Cuba does not permit trade independent from the state; most of Cuba's exportable products to the United States are produced by Cuban state-run enterprises with workers being paid near slave wages; many of these products would compete unfairly with United States agriculture and manufactured products, or with other products imported from the democratic countries of the Caribbean into the United States; Cuba does not permit individual freedom in economic matters; investments in Cuba are directed and approved by the Government of Cuba; it is illegal for foreign investors to hire or fire Cuban workers directly and the Cuban Ministry of Labor does the hiring; foreign companies must pay the wages owed to their employees directly to the Cuban Government in hard currency; the Cuban Government then pays the workers in Cuban pesos, worth one-twentieth of a dollar, and the Government pockets 90 percent of the wages paid in by the investor; Cuba has no independent judicial system to settle commercial disputes. 
   In short, Fidel Castro has failed to make any of the changes made by Beijing. An investment in China today can empower a Chinese middle class and move power away from the center. An investment in Cuba today benefits Fidel Castro and disadvantages the 11 million people struggling for freedom. It is that simple. 
   As recently as 1997, Fidel Castro argued against the wisdom of economic reforms and reasserted the supremacy of Communist ideology. In addition, political parties remain outlawed. Dissidents are either exiled, banished to the far reaches of the island, or simply imprisoned. The church continues to complain that the promises made during the Pope's visit have not been complied with. The daily activities of the average Cuban citizen continue to be monitored by the state's notorious ``neighborhood watch committees,'' known as the Committee for the Defense of the Revolution. These have been in place for 40 years and continue in place today. Amnesty International counts at least 400 prisoners of conscience, but this does not include the thousands convicted under trumped up charges for political purposes. 
   I am not simply arguing ideology here today. We have empirical evidence of the failure of the policy recommendation to trade with Cuba; we need only to look at Canada's recent experiences. After arguing for a policy of opening trade with Cuba, our neighbors to the North are now pulling out. I will quote from The Globe and Mail of June 30, 1999:  
   The Canadian government had hoped that investing directly in the Cuban economy by building plants and infrastructure would not only deliver an economic return, but also lead to wider-ranging reforms. Those hopes have been largely dashed as Canadian companies report woeful tales of pouring good money into bad investments in Cuba.  
   Mr. President, policies of so-called engagement with Castro have failed for those who have tried. We all shared great hope when the Pope visited Cuba in January 1998. The United States promised to respond positively to any changes made by the Castro regime following the Pope's visit. We expected to see more space for the Cuban people: freedom of speech and more freedom of religious expression. We know now that even these hopes have been dashed. The Pope just last December expressed his disappointment in the changes in Cuba. A December 2, 1999 Reuters wire story reports,  
   The clear wording of the Pope's speech indicated that the Vatican felt that not much has changed on the predominantly Catholic island in two years.  
   We know that President Reagan's wisdom remains true--after 39 years of isolating Cuba, we must not fear calling things as we see them. Fidel Castro is an evil tyrant. He impoverishes the Cuban people in spite of the efforts of many to open the society to freedom and the economy to investment. Fidel Castro denies his people the basic necessities for life, liberty, and happiness. 
   Mr. President, I do not object to evaluating our policies, but we must be honest, this is not the way. When Cuba changes, the United States must also change. Until then, we must remain committed to our principles, because it is our principles which make us strong. No missile system, no fleet of warships, will keep the United States the shining city on the hill--the beacon of freedom which we all saw when Ronald Reagan was President. I hope that my colleagues will join me. And I hope that they will stand with me for freedom. stand with me for democracy, stand with me for justice, and stand with me for respect for the human dignity of the 11 million people in Cuba.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote to table this amendment. It is blatantly political in its nature. Of the 12 positions, 8 will be determined by the Democratic Party and 4 by the Republicans; 6 by the President, 2 by the majority in each of the Houses, 1 by the  minority in each. That is 8 of 12--two-thirds. 
   We should not, today, be telling the next President of the United States what his policy should be with respect to Cuba. This Congress and this President should not be doing that. 
   Third, I only had the opportunity to speak with Frank Carlucci and Howard Baker. While they accept the concept of a commission, they don't support one that is so blatantly political, and they don't support one being established at this time. 
   I ask my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I move to table the amendment.

    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a common sense piece of legislation that would prohibit the rescheduling or forgiveness of any outstanding bilateral debt owed to the United States by the Government of the Russian Federation until the President of the United States certifies to the Congress that Russia has ceased all operations and permanently closed its intelligence facility at Lourdes, Cuba. Currently the Government of the Russian Federation maintains a signals intelligence facility in Lourdes, Cuba from which it conducts intelligence activities directed against the United States. The Secretary of Defense has reported that the Russian Federation leases the Lourdes facility for an estimated $100 to $300 million every year. This is several hundred million dollars flowing to support a brutal tyrant for the purpose of supporting espionage. 
   Mr. President, the United States should prohibit debt rescheduling and forgiveness for a country that is conducting espionage activities against America, while infusing Castro's despotic government with between $100 million and $300 million per year.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise with my friend and colleague Senator GRAHAM to introduce the Florida Keys Water Quality Improvements Act. This bill is identical to legislation that passed the House on May 4, 2000 by a vote of 411-7, and would provide Federal resources to help improve and maintain one of our Nation's real treasures, the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. 
   The Florida Keys are a spectacular natural resource of international significance. Within the Florida Keys lies the only living coral reef bed in the United States and the third largest living coral reef in the world. The reef is home to plants and animals unique to this area and that comprise a rare and sensitive ecosystem at the southern end of the Everglades ecosystem. While the spectacular coral reef is the Keys' most popular feature, they are also known for native seagrass beds, lush tropical hardwood hammocks, mangrove forests, rocky pinelands, the endangered key deer, and a wide array of aquatic life. 
   The Florida Keys marine ecosystem is dependent upon clean, clear water with low nutrient levels for its survival. Water quality experts have found that the inadequate wastewater treatment and storm water management systems are major contributors of pollution in the nearby waters off the Florida Keys. This increased pollution has had devastating effects on the marine environment, and is threatening the reefs on the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Unless decisive action is taken to stop the flow of pollution, scientists warn the ecosystem will continue its decline towards total collapse. 
   The source of the problem is clear. The Keys have almost no water quality infrastructure. Lacking adequate technology, untreated wastewater now travels easily through porous limestone rock into the near-shore waters. Polluted stormwater also flows from developed land into the same near-shore waters. 
   Our bill is a natural extension of the Federal commitment to the Florida Keys made under the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary Protection Act approved by Congress in 1990. This legislation established a Federal role in the research and protection of the Keys marine ecosystem. The Act directed the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Florida to establish a Water Quality Steering Committee which was charged with developing a comprehensive water quality protection program. In fulfilling this directive, the steering committee worked closely with dedicated citizens, scientists, and technical experts. In the final analysis, it found that inadequate wastewater and stormwater systems are the single largest source of pollution in the Keys. 
   This bill authorizes Federal assistance to help local officials afford the necessary improvements to protect the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. It establishes a grant program under the Environmental Protection Agency for the construction of treatment works projects aimed at improving the water quality of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The administrator of EPA, after consultation with State and local officials, would be authorized to fund treatment works projects that comply or are consistent with local growth ordinances, plans and agreements, as well as current water quality standards. Projects funded under this program would be cost-shared, with local sponsors providing a minimum of 25 percent of the project costs. 
   This bill authorizes $213 million in Federal funding for the deployment of water quality technology throughout the Keys. To make the necessary wastewater improvements, the estimated cost to improve near-shore water quality in the Florida Keys is between $184 million and $418 million. To make the necessary storm water management improvements, the estimated cost is between $370 million and $680 million. The Federal government is not going to bear the entire cost, even though this is a national resource. The State of Florida is obligated to come up with 25 percent cost share. 
   Moneys authorized by this bill will be utilized to replace the dated, inefficient system of sludge ponds and septic tanks currently being used in the Keys with modern waste and storm water treatment works. By ensuring that the nutrients associated with such wastes are not discharged or released into the surrounding waters, we can prevent further damage to the marine environment and achieve dramatic improvement to the water quality in the National Marine Sanctuary. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this reasonable approach to maintaining an essential national resource. I hope there will be a broad, bipartisan support for this bill.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, let me make just a couple of comments before I give my prepared remarks. 
   It is interesting how this debate is being engaged rather vigorously so quickly and so early this morning. I remind my colleagues that this is basically this same amendment that was adopted by the Senate 63-35 in the last Congress. 
   I imagine the reason for it is that all of my colleagues received a letter from the National Education Association, the teachers union, in opposition to this amendment. This letter from the National Education Association on behalf of its 2.5 million members strongly urges opposition to the amendment offered by Senator ABRAHAM and myself. They are opposed to it because it authorizes ``federal funds for [the purpose of] testing of current teachers, tenure reform, and merit pay.'' 
   I find it interesting that the NEA previously came out in support of testing--NEA President Bob Chase has said the NEA:  
   ......wholeheartedly supports and endorses the recommendations of the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future's new report, ``Doing What Matters Most: Investing in Quality Teaching.''  
   The report recommends: Teachers should be licensed based on demonstrated performance, including tests of subject matter knowledge, teaching knowledge, and teaching skill. 
   The report recommends: To encourage and reward teacher knowledge and skill, we should develop a career continuum for teaching linked to assessments and compensation systems that reward knowledge and skill. 
   That sounds to me like a broad endorsement of the concept of testing teachers to understand where they are with respect to the knowledge they have in the courses they are going to be teaching. I think it clearly indicates the idea of moving away from pay being based on someone's seniority to one based on merit--pay should be based on the ability to teach, the ability to be able to show, in testing, that they have the knowledge in the areas in which they are teaching. 
   So I make that comment to begin. 
   Further, with respect to questions about merit pay, again, my colleague already referred to the fact there have been States experimenting with this idea since the late 1960s. But Denver, CO, has a merit pay system. Interestingly enough, the Secretary of Education, Secretary Riley, when he was Governor of South Carolina, endorsed merit pay. 
   In Florida, we encourage teachers to participate in what I believe is the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. If a teacher in the State of Florida successfully completes that process and becomes certified by this board, they are going to receive a bonus. I think that is merit pay. 
   So this idea that I think the Senator from Massachusetts tried to imply, that this is something no one is pursuing and there is no value to it, I would say, is not accurate. 
   Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague, Senator ABRAHAM, to offer this critically important amendment. It focuses on the single most important, yet most overlooked, aspect of education--the quality of America's teachers. 
   Education is the engine of social and economic progress, and the ladder of opportunity. The rungs of that ladder must be supported by exceptional teachers. I have little doubt that the American spirit of ingenuity and innovation will continue to lead the world in providing new economic opportunities, expanding medical research and improving the quality of life for everyone. But there is a catch. For our children and grandchildren to achieve the high standards we expect of them, we must provide them with the tools they need to help them excel. The economic security of our children depends upon the quality of their education. 
   Each time we debate education reform in America, there is a growing sentiment that continued viability of the American dream could slip away simply because our children are unprepared to face tomorrow's challenges. The academic performance of America's students in international exams can hardly be considered world class. In fact, the longer our students attend American schools, the further behind they fall in performance. Consider these statistics: 
   While America's 4th graders score above the international average in math tests, they continue to trail students in countries like Austria, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, and Singapore. By the 8th grade, American students barely meet the international average, and by the 12th grade, American students lag far behind their international peers. 
   In science, U.S. students score above the international average in both 4th and 8th grades. But, in 4th grade, U.S. students are outranked by only one country--Korea. By the 8th grade, thirteen countries outrank U.S. students. 
   Again, that is an indication that the longer they are in school, the further behind they fall with other countries in the world. 
   In international physics tests, American 12th graders ranked sixteenth, and far behind countries like Russia, Slovenia, Latvia and the Czech Republic. 
   In both math and science, the performance of U.S. 12th graders is among the lowest in the industrialized world. Of the 21 countries that participate, the United States placed 16th in science and 19th in math skills. 
   Our students will be denied basic opportunities because they have not been adequately equipped to face a new, competitive, and global economy. We can and must do better. 
   Without qualified teachers in America's classrooms, all other attempts at reform are meaningless. We have long focused on the need to hire more teachers--as many as two million over the next decade. Our focus shouldn't be on the number of teachers, but rather, on the quality of those teachers. 
   As long as students are compelled to attend school, we should be compelled to staff those 
   schools with the best and brightest teachers. Parents all over the state of Florida, and I imagine the same is true around the country, are concerned that the success--or failure--of their child's entire academic year will be determined by the quality and expertise of their child's teacher. Studies show that the most important factor in determining student success on standardized tests is the teacher's ability to present the material. As States are taking important steps to challenge their students with high-stakes tests for promotion and graduation, we must encourage states to step up to the plate and provide students with teachers who are better prepared than ever before. 
   Further complicating the situation is the shortage of teachers nationwide, which has led many school districts to assign teachers to subjects for which they have no formal training. Four million American students are currently being taught English, Math, or History by teachers who have neither a college major or minor in the subject they are teaching. Four million kids! 
   Mr. President, maybe I have a slightly different perspective in looking at these numbers today than I would have, say, 5 or 6 weeks ago. Priscilla and I were just blessed with our first granddaughter. We already have three grandsons, but this is our first granddaughter. While all of us in the family are engaged in the early days of raising that little baby and trying to get through the night, we are also concerned about the future for little Addison. Is she going to be among the one out of five students in America being taught English by a teacher who doesn't have a major or minor in English?  
   Think about that for a moment. I think one out of four math students are being taught by teachers who do not have a minor or major in that subject. So when I think about little Addison's future, and I realize the competitive world in which we live today, and how much more competitive it is going to be in the future, I know she is not going to be able to compete and have the same opportunities we all have enjoyed if she doesn't have an education second to none. Frankly, that can only come about as a result of having high-quality teachers in the classroom--teachers who my son and his wife, Ann, can be comfortable in knowing have the knowledge and expertise to provide that education. 
   Requiring secondary school teachers to earn a major or minor in their subjects might make sense if there were not a clearly superior policy that could be adopted instead, such as requiring teachers to pass a subject knowledge test for the subject areas they teach. 
   Teacher testing is an important first step toward upgrading the quality of instruction in the classroom. Testing provides a valuable opportunity for teachers to demonstrate knowledge of subjects for which they do not hold a major or minor degree. It will also enable principals to evaluate their staffing needs and to staff classrooms with the most qualified teachers. You simply 
   can not teach what you don't know. 
   Common sense also dictates that we should not focus solely on under-performing teachers. We must also recognize that there are many great teachers who are successfully challenging their students on a daily basis. Teaching is one of the most important and challenging professions. While many excellent, enthusiastic, and well prepared teachers already work in America's schools, their work often goes unrecognized and unrewarded. Salaries for teachers lag far behind other professions for which a college degree is expected or required, and as a result, many exceptional teachers leave the profession and others who would be exceptional teachers never even consider teaching. 
   We have created a system of clear incentives for our best teachers to leave the classroom. Instead, we should be enacting policies to keep the best and brightest teachers in the classroom. To do this, we need to evaluate and reward teachers with a compensation system that supports and encourages them to strengthen their skills and demonstrate high levels of performance. That, in turn, will enhance learning for all children. 
   Today, schools compensate teachers based almost solely on seniority, not on their performance inside the classroom. It rewards underperforming teachers and penalizes exceptional ones by grouping them together in a single pay scale based primarily upon length of service. Merit-pay would differentiate between teachers who are hard-working and inspiring, and those who fall short. It is true that good teachers cost money. But the fact is, bad teachers can cost more because they limit the education of a child and his or her ability to contribute to society. 
   We hear quite often that merit pay won't work in public schools because it is too difficult to compare the accomplishments between teachers teaching smart, wealthy, well-disciplined, well-fed children versus those teaching poor, inattentive, hungry and unruly children. These conditions are no different than the differences faced by other professionals like doctors or lawyers who face both unwinnable cases or deadly diseases. Teachers should also be rewarded proportionately to their accomplishments in enhancing student learning, attitudes, and behavior. 
   This is not to suggest that simply throwing more money at schools and teachers will rescue schools from mediocrity. Some suggest we try throwing more money at the problem, although I would point out that we have already tried that. The United States spends more money per pupil than any other industrialized nation, and as I mentioned earlier, our children are not achieving high levels of performance on international standardized exams. The reality is that no amount of money will save mismanaged, bureaucratic, red-tape ridden schools from failure. And no amount of money will rescue a student who is placed in a classroom led by an unprepared, unenthusiastic, and uninspiring teacher. This debate is less about money and more about giving teachers a greater stake in the education they provide. We can do this by offering them real incentives to do their best so that their dedication and expertise will be recognized and rewarded. This will benefit all students. 
   Our amendment, known as the MERIT Act, will enable states to use their limited federal dollars on a number of initiatives to enhance teacher quality. First, this amendment provides funding for states to develop rigorous exams to periodically test elementary and secondary school teachers on their knowledge of the subjects they are teaching. Secondly, this amendment provides funding to states to establish compensation systems for teachers based upon merit and proven performance. Finally, this amendment provides states with resources to reform current tenure programs. 
   This broad approach will enable states to staff their schools with the best and most qualified teachers, thereby enhancing learning for all students. In turn, teachers can be certain that all of their energy, dedication and expertise will be rewarded. And it will be done without placing new mandates on states or increasing the federal bureaucracy. 
   Last Congress, the Senate passed a similar amendment with bipartisan support by a vote of 63-35 during debate on the Education Savings Account legislation. Unfortunately, the President vetoed that bill, despite his previous support for teacher testing. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues as we continue the fight to give dedicated professionals, who teach our children, a personal stake in the quality of the instruction they provide. I hope there will again be broad, bipartisan support for this amendment. I thank the chair and I yield the floor.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, that is a story I remember very well. To cut it short takes away, I think, the strength of its message. So maybe a little bit later on in the debate we can discuss it, but I would be glad to yield the time back to the Senator so she can continue.

   Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator for the opportunity to do this. A number of years ago, my wife and I visited a school called the Marcus Garvey School in Los Angeles. I went there because I was trying to learn more about the different types of schools in America--what works, what does not work. While I am going to be talking about the Marcus Garvey School, I am not endorsing or embracing everything the school does. But the thing that stood out to me was the role of the teacher in this school. So this is what happened. 
   I went to the Marcus Garvey School and met the administrator, the principal, the owner of the school--all one person, Anyim Palmer, who was in a room probably no bigger than 10 by 10, filled with furniture that was probably 35 or 40 years old. The phone was on a stack of papers. There was no secretary. When the phone rang, he answered it. The point I am making is there were not a lot of amenities. This is basic stuff. This is a building with rooms in it, an administrator, teachers, and students. 
   He said: I want to take you down and show you what some of our students are doing. Unfortunately, the school is not filled today because of the time of the year it is. 
   Priscilla and I went down to a room where there were three different groups of children being taught in the same room. The first group of students we saw were 2-year-old children. Again, I emphasize 2-year-olds, not second graders; 2-year-old children. There were eight of them sitting at a little table. The teacher said to the children: Show the Senator and Mrs. Mack how you can say your ABCs. You can imagine the cute little voices of those children as they recited their ABCs. When they finished that, the teacher said: Now that you have done it in English, do it in Spanish. So then these little 2-year-old children went through their alphabet in Spanish. When they finished that, the teacher then said to them: Now do the alphabet in Swahili, and they did that as well--2 years old. 
   We went across the room to where 3-year-old children were doing math problems. The teacher said to me: Give one of the students a math problem. As I would suspect most people would have done, I gave a problem such as 5 plus 8--you know, pretty straightforward. But, again, 3 years old. She  said: No, no, no, give them a tough problem. So I said something like 325 plus 182. And this 3-year-old child, standing at the board, put down little dots, wrote down a number, another series of dots, wrote down a number and got the right answer at 3-years-old. 
   We went across the room where 4-year-old children were reading. We were told that these children were reading at the second, third, and fourth grade level. They were 4 years old. 
   We went into another room in this facility where there were 5-year-old children. A little boy was asked to stand up and recite for me, in the proper chronological order, every President of the United States. That little fellow stood up, looked me right in the eyes, and he rattled right through every President of the United States in the proper order. I must admit I knew he did that because they gave me a cheat sheet to look at. He was 5 years old. 
   Every time we went to a different area and saw these students, these children at work, Priscilla and I would say to this person who was taking us around: How can this be? How can this possibly be? What makes this work? Every single time we asked the question, the answer was: It is the teacher. It is 
   the teacher. It is the teacher. 
   Anyim Palmer challenged what was then considered the best private school in Los Angeles County, their sixth grade against his third grade students. I think it was in math and English. You know who won--Anyim Palmer's third grade beat the sixth graders. How did he do it? What he said to me was: It was the teacher. 
   What I found out later is Anyim Palmer was a public school teacher in California who became so frustrated and angry that the system was failing to teach children in his community that he quit the public schools and started his own school. Do you know what he did? He also trained his own teachers. He said: Forget everything you have learned. I am going to train you. I am going to teach you how to teach. 
   Again, I thank the Senator for asking me to restate that story. It made a major impression on me. We can talk about all these other things, but we must focus on how to make sure that the teacher standing up in front of our children and grandchildren has the knowledge in the subject they are teaching--this is not fancy. We are not asking for special degrees. I am asking a very simple question. If a teacher is standing in front of my little granddaughter, Addison, a few years from now, I want my son and his wife to know the person who is teaching their little daughter has the knowledge in the subject they are teaching. That does not seem to be an unreasonable request to make. 
   I thank the Senator for asking the question. I yield.

   Mr. MACK. I say to the Senator he is exactly right, there is no mandate. As strongly as I feel about it, I would like to, but I do not think that is our role. I think we can make some serious mistakes by mandating certain things, to say to a particular school district or a particular State they have to do what I say. They might say, what if we put this kind of testing program into effect but our concern is we need more computers. We need more books. We need--whatever. 
   This is not a mandate. It never has been a mandate. It never will be a mandate, at least as far as the Senator from Michigan and I are concerned. It is merely a statement of importance and it says to the schools if they want to, these dollars can be used for the purpose of developing the concepts for creating tests, developing some merit pay program, or in reforming tenure, all three of which we think can in fact go to the heart of the matter about what is necessary to improve the ability of the teacher. 
   The inference was made earlier that somehow or another those of us who are talking about this are out to degrade the teachers in this country. That is absolutely a false challenge. Most of us can remember those teachers who made a difference in our lives, who challenged us, who demanded from us that we do better. Each of us responded in a little bit different way. But we understand the importance of having good, quality teachers, and there are a lot of them. That is why we put the merit pay in, to recognize that. 
   Again, as to this notion that somehow or another if we were to put in place a merit pay system that, highlights teachers who are doing well, and encourages those who are not teaching our children to do better and somehow or another people would know and there would be divisions that would take place, let me tell you something. There is probably not a school in America where every teacher doesn't know who is carrying the load and who is not. You do not need a merit pay program for students and teachers alike to know who the good teachers are. You can just hear the kids talking about it: Boy, I hope I don't get in so-and-so's class. 
   It doesn't take a merit program. Merit pay is not going to do that. Children and parents already know the good ones and those who are not carrying their load. 
   What we are trying to do is the right thing.

   Mr. MACK. I certainly hope it would do that. I believe it would. As both of us have indicated, the State of Florida has developed a program that provides an incentive for teachers to get certification by a national board. If they receive that certification, they get a bonus. 
   They also get a bonus if they encourage another teacher to do the same thing. 
   What we are saying is, we are recognizing, not only through the dollars but through our interest, the importance of that individual teacher and the importance of the quality of that individual teacher. I believe it would encourage them to stay in the system longer. Most of the teachers love the children they are teaching. They want them to do better. We just need to give more encouragement to those teachers.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, in the early morning hours of Holy Saturday, a little piece of America died. America's shining beacon of freedom faded in the Florida sky as many of us grieved over the astounding actions of the United States Government. This administration betrayed America's past and joined history's inglorious list of governments that have chosen to use excessive force against its own law-abiding citizens. 
   Our founding fathers believed in a Government of, for, and by, the people, a Government designed to serve and benefit the people, not to serve and benefit the needs of Government, and certainly not to substitute brute force for the rule of law. These are reminiscent of the tactics used by tyrants and despots. The decisions by this administration that led to the events of last Saturday will be remembered as a day of shame in our American history. 
   My comments today are not directed toward the law enforcement officers who carried out the operation; I understand they are charged with a duty and must follow the directives of the Attorney General and the President of the United States. My comments today are not directed at the ultimate disposition of Elian's residency or custody, and they are not intended to be partisan or political, but they do go directly to the heart of who we are as a Nation and what we expect of our Government. 
   As most people know, the Elian Gonzalez matter is pending in Federal court. Just last Wednesday, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ordered that Elian Gonzalez must remain in the United States during the review of his Federal court case. The opinion of the court suggests the INS and the Department of Justice were wrong in not granting Elian an asylum hearing. In the final footnote of the opinion, the court encouraged the parties to avail themselves voluntarily of the Eleventh Circuit's mediation services. The court believed that mediation was an appropriate avenue to resolve this heart gripping situation. 
   The Attorney General did not listen to the court. She was obsessed with reuniting Elian with his father at any cost. Perhaps she would have been wise to listen to the words of Daniel Webster: ``Liberty exists in proportion to wholesome restraint.'' Perhaps she should have listened to her own words: ``I'm trying to work through an extraordinary human tragedy. And the importance of working through it is that we do so in good faith, without violence, without having to cause further disruption to the little boy.'' This statement was made nine days before the raid. 
   The night before the raid, mediation between the Department of Justice, the Miami family and Juan Miguel Gonzalez had gone on all night and into the wee hours of Saturday morning. Even as the negotiations continued on the telephone with all parties, agents of the administration dressed in fatigues and masks exploded into the home of Lazaro Gonzalez with machine guns drawn--and one machine gun that was pointed dramatically in the face of a screaming child. 
   The Government held all the power, and the Government used intimidation to force a family, a loving caring family, into a corner. Remember this is the family originally selected by the Attorney General to care for Elian. 
   The administration offered ultimatums when fair mediation was needed. This administration resorted to the power of a machine gun to intimidate an American family. What possible benefit could come from this act? 
   Tactics such as these deserve a full explanation. 
   Why would the Department of Justice stage a raid when mediator Aaron Podhurst stated that a deal between the parties was ``minutes to an hour away''? Why would they be so impatient with a solution so near? The Attorney General said that they had a window during which to conduct the raid of Saturday through Monday. Why could they not have waited for negotiations to play out. 
   What credible information existed to suggest this level of force needed to be used? 
   Another question that deserves fuller explanation speaks to the impact of the raid on the boy. Wouldn't any psychologist or psychiatrist who actually examined the child say this action would further traumatize the boy? But sadly, the INS team of experts never did examine the boy to make an informed evaluation. 
   How could such tactics possibly be in the best interests of a child who has suffered so much? What right did this administration have to add this trauma to the terrible loss Elian has already suffered? And why did he have to suffer at the hands of the people who are supposed to defend the rule of law, the INS, the DoJ, and the President of the United States. 
   Let's think for a moment about the decision the father and the Justice Department made in putting Elian's life at risk with the plans for the pre-dawn raid. I have never questioned the father's love for the boy, but I cannot imagine any father would choose to put his son's life at risk a second time. But it is not an unloving father who put his son in harm's way-the father is as much a victim as Elian in many ways. The father had a simple choice: travel to a safe house in Miami and have Elian voluntarily transferred into his custody or insist on remaining in Washington and have the U.S. government seize his son in a violent, dangerous raid. Just as it wasn't the father's decision not to come to his boy's side for the first four months of this ordeal, it was not his decision to remain in Washington, forcing a raid at gunpoint. Castro would not allow the father to travel then and he would not allow him to travel last weekend. 
   President Clinton promised my colleague Senator GRAHAM that Elian would not be seized in the middle of the night, and now we must ask again, why did he promise one thing and yet do another? 
   Elian deserves access to all of his legal options, Elian deserves an asylum hearing, and he deserves the protection of U.S. law. Yet that is for another day. The use of force must be dealt with today. Does the end justify the means? Will these means ever be justified? 
   There have been accusations of playing politics with this issue. 
   But perhaps we ought to recognize what several of the Attorney General's long-time supporters have said. The four mediators from Miami that were involved in the negotiations with Janet Reno have clearly challenged the administration's characterization of the events of last Saturday. They said they were close to an agreement and felt confident a peaceful solution could have been reached. 
   We cannot simply sweep these issues away and dispense of them in the name of politics. This is a long, sad story and I'm sure many would wish it would simply fade away. But if we accept and commend the actions of our government for acting hastily in choosing excessive force over peaceful mediation, we have traveled down a very troubling road. We dare not condone such use of force to settle legal disputes. This strikes at the very heart of the balance of power and the integrity of our judicial process. 
   This child and no child should face the intimidation and trauma of an automatic weapon in his face--especially when perpetrated by the American government--a government that has always stood for freedom and human rights throughout the world. As a father and grandfather, I am heartbroken for the frightened, vulnerable child in that photograph. My hope is that no other administration official utter the words, ``I am proud of what we did'' and instead express regret and sorrow for the trauma and pain suffered by the entire Gonzalez family. 
   What happened saddens me as an American, a father, and a Senator. Mr. President, last Saturday morning, a little bit of America died in that raid and I hope we never again dim the light of freedom for those who look to us for hope. I yield the floor. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of Senate Resolution 287, expressing the sense of the Senate regarding U.S. policy toward Libya. It is of grave concern to me that the United States is currently considering a change in its ``Travel Ban'' policy with Libya, prior to the resolution of the Pan-Am 103 Bombing trial. 
   Libya is a state sponsor of terrorism and a global agent of instability. Two Libyan intelligence operatives, with prior terrorist activity convictions, are now on trial for the explosion of Pan Am flight 103 in 1988 and the loss of 270 lives, 180 of them Americans. Libya is engaged in one the most advanced Bio-Chemical efforts in the third world, including the acquisition of delivery vehicles. It has repeatedly engaged U.S. military forces, including an attempted missile attack on U.S. military installations in Italy in 1986. 
   Taking into account its past behavior, we all agree that Libya has a long way to go to become a member of the family of law-abiding nations. Libya must take concrete actions to provide its sincerity. It must show complete adherence to the Pan Am 103 Judicial Authorities in Hague. If a conviction is reached, Libya must accept responsibility for any court judgement and make full payment to all judgement creditors. It is my sense that Libya must prove its vigilant and sincere cooperation in anti-terrorism efforts. 
   U.S. policy towards Libya must remain balanced. The ``Travel Ban'' is an important tool and should not be abandoned without clear justification. A verdict is not yet at hand; I urge you to await the conclusion of the Pan Am 103 trial, and calculate our steps from there.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I hope that our colleagues across the aisle will not prevent us from reducing the marriage penalties in the tax code. This bill will provide married couples the relief that President Clinton denied them last year with his veto of the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999. President Clinton's action last year increased taxes by close to $800 billion and imposed a marriage penalty on middle class American families. 
   There is no place in the tax code for marriage penalties. Marriage penalties are caused by tax laws that treat joint filers relatively worse than single filers with half the income. It has of late become common practice to use the tax code for purposes of social engineering, discouraging some actions with the stick of tax penalties and encouraging others with the carrot of tax preferences. But there is no legitimate policy reason for punishing taxpayers with higher taxes just because they happen to be married. The marriage penalties in the tax code undermine the family, the institution that is the foundation of our society. 
   I view this bill as just a start. Our tax code will not truly be family-friendly until every single marriage penalty is rooted out and eliminated, so that married couples with twice the income of single individuals are taxed at the same rates, and are eligible for the same tax preferences--including deductions, exemptions, use of IRAs and other savings vehicles--as those single filers. This bill is an important step toward that ultimate goal. 
   The Democrat criticisms of our bill are misplaced. They argue that our bill contains complicated phase-ins, in contrast to their simple approach. But anyone who reads the bill and their alternative would see that this is false. The Finance Committee bill contains percentages in it, sure enough. And it phases in the relief, that is true. But the percentages and the phase-ins are instructions to the Treasury and the IRS, to make adjustments to the tax brackets. The only people who have to make any new calculations under the Finance Committee bill are the bureaucrats who make up the tax tables, not the taxpayer. 
   By contrast, the Democrat alternative, in phasing in its relief, requires  taxpayers to calculate their taxes as joint filers, then calculate their taxes as if they were single--a complicated process that requires the allocation of various deductions and credits. Next, the taxpayer would have to determine the difference between these two calculations and then reduce this by a certain percentage. That is supposed to be simple? The Democrat substitute adds to the headaches of tax filing and the demand for tax preparers and tax preparation software. 
   The Democrats also complain that the Finance Committee bill does more than address their narrow definition of the marriage penalty. They invoke the so-called ``marriage bonus.'' But the ``marriage bonus'' is a red herring. What they call a ``marriage bonus'' results from adjustment tax brackets for joint filers to reflect the fact that two adults are sharing the household income. Under the Democrat approach, single taxpayers who marry a non-working or low-earning spouse should pay the same amount of taxes as when they were single, even though this income must be spread over the needs of two adults. 
   This approach is fundamentally flawed. The Democrat approach would enshrine in the law a new, ``homemaker penalty.'' The Democrats would make families with one earner and one stay-at-home spouse pay higher taxes than families with the same household income and two earners. 
   But why discriminate against one-earner families? Why would we want a tax code that penalized families just because one of the spouses chooses the hard work of the household over the role of breadwinner? The Democrat alternative discourages parents from staying home with their infant children, and penalizes people who sacrifice income in order that they can care for their elderly parents. That is just plain wrong. 
   The Finance Committee bill reduces the marriage penalty in a rational sensible way, by making the standard deduction for joint filers twice what it is for single filers, and by making the ranges at which income is taxed at the 15% and 28% rates twice for joint filers what they are for single filers. This recognizes that marriage is a partnership in which two adults share the household income. Our approach cuts taxes for all American families. The Democrats call this a ``bonus.'' We calm it common sense.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today to tell a story--a modern day tragedy about a mother, Elizabeth, who so loved her son, Elian, that she tried to bring him to the shores of the United States of America from Cuba--to the shores of freedom. Had she succeeded, she would have joined her family members already in the United States: her cousin  who arrived only last year; her son's great uncle and his family who have been in the United States for many years; and another cousin who has been here for over fifteen years. She would have been reunited with many other relatives who must today remain anonymous for fear of retribution by Castro against those still trapped in Cuba. Instead, she met with tragedy in the Florida straits. Elizabeth died. Her five-year-old son survived. 
   Let me be a little more specific. On November 21, 1999, a group of 14 Cuban citizens boarded a boat bound for the United States and the shores of freedom. The motor failed shortly after departing and the group was forced to return to Cuba. Think of the anxiety at this moment, having to return after risking everything. The anticipation. The disappointment. The fear. 
   When the boat returned to Cuba, one of the other female passengers, Arianne Horta, placed her young daughter back on the shore of Cuba. She then wanted to make sure that Elizabeth was positive in her decision to take Elian. And despite the fact that Elian had a father in Cuba, Elizabeth brought her son back on the boat to set sail for the second time that night--seeking freedom on the shores of America. 
   If you are interested in what Elian's mother really wanted, think about the act of choosing to keep her son on the boat, while Arianne took her child off the boat. This is as clear a message as a mother can send that she wanted freedom for her child. She wanted freedom despite the risks involved, despite a failed attempt to flee hours earlier, and despite the fact that the father remained in Cuba. 
   Think about that moment of choice for Elizabeth--put my son on the beach and he can live with his father, or keep him with me so we could have the hope of freedom. It is clear to me that she valued freedom above everything. Now think--if that was you, and you died, would you want the child returned to Cuba? 
   Think of yourself in Nazi Germany. A mother successfully smuggles a child out, but dies in the process at the hands of the Nazis. The father, probably under duress, demands the return of his child. Would we contemplate returning him? Would we return a child under the same circumstances to Saddam Hussein's Iraq? If a mother and child were scaling the Berlin wall and the mother was shot, but the child was pushed over--would we send the child back? Absolutely not. 
   On the night of November 21, this group of Cuban nationals repaired their boat and set sail a second time. On the following night, the boat capsized. The survivors clung to anything that would float and hung on for dear life. After a day struggling for her life, Elizabeth died. But before she passed on, she told a fellow passenger who did survive, Nivaldo Fernandez, to make sure that Elian touches land, to make sure he touches dry land. 
   As many of my colleagues know well, if a Cuban refugee reaches American soil they will not be sent back to Cuba. Every Cuban knows that reaching ``dry land'' means they will be free from Castro's iron fist. Elizabeth's dying wish was for her Elian to reach dry land. There can be no doubt about what she wanted for her son. 
   Mr. President, I come to the floor today with great disappointment--disappointment in this Administration and disappointment in the Attorney General. Elian Gonzalez's mother's death will be in vain and this little boy's struggle for freedom, his struggle to live in America, simply is being dismissed if the boy's best interests and the family's legal rights are not considered. 
   Many will say that this is a simple decision, the INS and the Department of Justice should merely reunite a father with the son he loves. I think all of us recognize the intense and profound bond between parent and child. It is to be respected and cherished. It is a natural instinct to want to reunite parent and child. But these are by no means ordinary circumstances. I ask the American people to look beyond the headlines, to understand the intense pressure this father is under. It is unlike anything you or I will ever experience in a free America. I have no doubt the father loves his little boy. But how many of us have stopped and thought about why this father did not come to his son the day he was found, exhausted and dehydrated having survived a treacherous trip at sea. Consider why he has not come for almost 5 months to support his son, hug his son, comfort his son. Again, I would suspect it is not out of lack of concern for his boy. I would suspect it is because Castro would not let him. 
   Is it possible the father wants the boy to remain with his family in Miami and live in freedom? My understanding is that the father knew Elian and his mother were coming to this country and even told other family members that he would get to America if he ``had to do so in a bowl.'' 
   I can't imagine anyone disagrees with the notion that Castro controls the father's words and actions through duress--through intimidation. The fact is that none of us knows the true wishes of this father. Castro has used this father and son to manipulate both Cuba and the United States. 
   Today, the United States is not about to reunite a boy and his father, instead we are about to reunite a child and his dictator. And we are doing so against his mother's wishes. We may be doing so against his father's wishes, as well. 
   Last week, a spokesman of the Cuban embassy stated ``Elian Gonzalez is a possession of the Cuban Government.'' In Castro's Cuba, the state always has the last word in how a child is raised--it does not matter if a parent disagrees. According to Cuban law, any parent who questions the regime or takes any action deemed to run contrary to the revolution's goals could be imprisoned or executed. 
   Let me quote a former Cuban Government official from a recent Washington Post op-ed.  
   Within Cuba, the return of Elian will not be seen as an act of justice by the U.S. government, but rather as yet another victory for the bully-boy tactics of Fidel Castro. This is why the dictator is trying to recover Elian--to convert him into a different kind of symbol--a symbol of the Revolution--even though for that to happen, Elian would have to renounce his mother, the family in Miami that took care of him and even in fact, his father, Juan Miguel. Because upon returning to Cuba, he will not belong to his family. He will be another son of the Revolution.  
   If Cuba were a free country, this situation would have been easily resolved. But Cuba is not free, it is a police state. In fact, Article 8 of Cuba's Code for Children and Youth states: ``Society and the State work for the efficient protection of youths against all influences contrary to their communist formation.'' 
   Make no mistake, in Cuba, Elian will not have a normal childhood. 
   In Cuba, Elian will be allowed to live with his father until he is eleven; thereafter he will be sent to work in a farm-labor camp for 45 to 60 days per year. 
   In Cuba, Elian will face compulsory military service until he is 27. 
   In Cuba, Elian will be indoctrinated in the glories of ``the revolution'' and taught to regard any Cubans who reject Castroism--including his dead mother--as counterrevolutionaries and traitors. 
   In Cuba, Elian will be allowed to attend college only if his ``political attitude and social conduct'' satisfy the regime in Havana. 
   Returning Elian to Cuba means returning him to Fidel Castro. When I was a child, my parents had the last word in my upbringing. In Cuba, Castro's wishes carry the day--he can override any parent. Be assured Castro will begin his manipulation of Elian from the day of his return. I can see the images now--parades and banners, welcoming home the young defender of the ``Communist Revolution.'' Elian may remain closer to Fidel than any other child may be forced to suffer. The boy may get better treatment as a result, but this will be only on the surface. This innocent child will be captive--a prisoner in his own homeland. The regime cannot afford for this boy to return to Cuba only to renounce Castro's ways. Elian will be treated, not as a child, but as an opportunity to exploit. His home, his education, his father's salary, everything, will be provided as Fidel dictates. The pathetic efforts of a desperate tyrant to legitimize his method of oppression will make Elian a test. My colleagues, he is a child. Instead of Fidel's cruelties, he needs compassion. 
   There is a reason Elian's mother and countless others have risked everything and have given their lives in the hope that their children will taste freedom. And while Elian's mother's voice  cannot be heard now, her actions were loud and clear. 
   I would not be so angry if we were truly reuniting a parent and child. But if we return Elian, the United States will be caving to the demands of the last tyrant in the Western Hemisphere and will be sending a six-year-old boy to a place that Human Rights Watch states has a ``highly developed machinery of repression.'' And the United States will be doing this without providing basic civil rights to Elian--without permitting his legal options to play out. 
   Instead, our Government is short circuiting justice for political expediency and we will have to live with that. The outrage and fury I feel toward the administration, the Department of Justice and the INS for the manner in which they have handled the Elian Gonzalez case is overwhelming. 
   The United States is a Nation committed to the principles of freedom, justice, democracy and respect for human dignity. We are a nation built upon a rich diversity of heritage. We celebrate the uniqueness of our roots, family traditions and cultural experiences. And while this rich diversity is the strength of our great country, we, as Americans, share a common bond that is even stronger. That common bond is our precious freedom. Freedom to pursue our dreams, freedom to raise our children, freedom to speak our minds, and freedom from a government that dictates what we say, where we should live, and what we will become. 
   These principles strengthen our democracy, our nation. These principles are what continue to draw people to America's shores. Our democracy is designed to preserve and protect the rights of the weak and the strong. Our judicial system is designed to promote access to justice for all Americans. But what we have seen in the past several weeks from our own Justice Department in its' handling of the Elian Gonzalez case shakes the very foundation of our American principles. 
   Instead of defending these principles, this Administration has intimidated Elian's American family with the sheer weight, power, and force of the United States Government. This Administration has chosen to grind down this family's emotions and trample on the family's rights. In the process, the best interests of this boy have been undeniably neglected and his mother's wishes ignored. This Administration's treatment of a young child has evolved into an exercise of cruel and unusual punishment to preserve a pre-determined outcome and to placate an old and bitter dictator. 
   The United States is a free country. We have a Bill or Rights, a code of laws, and a separation of powers which guarantees no administration shall be able to sidestep the law. We are a country in which the judicial system should be permitted to work without presidential influence for political expediency--and certainly without bringing the mighty weight and power of the government down on the weakest of all people--a child. 
   But, in the last four months, this administration, our United States Government, has overstepped its bounds. Mr. President, I am disillusioned by the present status of this struggle for freedom. Disillusioned that these calls to honor freedom have fallen on deaf ears. But, then I think of the Cuban parents who so loved their children that they sent them unaccompanied to the United States in the 1960's in what became known as ``Operation Pedro Pan.'' Fourteen thousand and eighty-four children were sent away from the clutches of Castro by their loving parents to go to America to live in freedom. These parents willingly sent their children in order to escape Castro--in order to escape oppression. Many, if not most, of these children had no family in the United States. But they were sent to the United States with their parents wish for freedom--freedom at all costs. 
   We know Elian's mother sought freedom for her son--and she paid the ultimate price. We know many in Elian's family had already come to the United States; some recently, some long ago. But we have taken the sad, sad action of assuming a man whose very life and that of his family, depends upon the goodwill of a tyrant, has the ability to speak freely. What a tragedy that this man cannot speak openly and freely about his true desire. What a sad day in the history of the United States of America. 
   Our founding principle--our Declaration of Independence--declares, ``we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' We, the inheritors of this legacy, must not force people into tyranny. 
   I appeal to the President and the Attorney General to resolve this in such a manner that Elian's struggle and his mother's tragic death will not have been in vain. Perhaps we, the United States of America, will realize that if we don't, we are making a tragic mistake in the handling of this case. It is not too late, though, to do the right thing for this little boy. I call on the President of the United States and the Attorney General once again, to consider what is in the little boy's best interest.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, there was an interest here, certainly. There are some who have discriminated against one group or another, who have not spoken out for one group and have spoken out for another. 
   In my career representing the State of Florida and the Senate, I have spoken out for every group looking for honest and fair treatment, whether they be Cuban, whether they be Nicaraguan, or whether they be Haitian. I have done that. I am proud that I have done that. Some of those positions have not been particularly popular in my State. But I have always taken that position. 
   Again, I think the right thing to do is to ask a very simple question: What is in the boy's best interest?

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate to speak about an incident that occurred just before Thanksgiving Day 1999, when a mother who so loved her son that she tried to bring him to the shores of the United States of America from Cuba. Had she succeeded, she would have joined her family members already in the United States. Instead, she met with tragedy in the Florida straits. The mother died. The five-year-old boy survived. Now, we are being forced to consider young Elian's future. 
   Today, the freedom sought by a mother for her son is being mocked. Elian Gonzalez finds himself in the middle of a struggle between his Miami family and the Department of Justice, an agency unwilling to consider what is in the best interest of the child, an agency continually impairing a fair presentation of the merits of this case. 
   I ask my colleagues to open their minds and their hearts and listen to why the current process being used by the DOJ and the INS represents a grave injustice and denies a decision that should be based upon Elian's best interest. Remember when Elian first arrived, the INS stated that the matter was a custody decision for a Florida state family court. Forty-eight hours after Castro threatened the United States, the decision flipped, and continues to bend to Castro's will. Now the administration wants to rush an appeals process to send him back to a country that Human Rights Watch states has ``highly developed machinery of repression.'' 
   In the past week, the Department of Justice has put unrealistic demands on the family of Elian to expedite the appeal of the federal district court decision. The Department of Justice has repeatedly threatened to revoke Elian's parole and remove the child to Cuba if the family fails to agree to their demand that both sides have an appellate brief prepared in one week. These unprecedented tactics short-circuit and dismantle the judicial process in which an appellate is typically allotted a minimum of 30-60 days to prepare a brief. This is plain and simple--Elian's family's civil rights are being denied. 
   This past Monday, the family under great pressure filed a motion with the Eleventh Circuit to expedite the appeals process, and still, the government's threats have continued. In a letter sent to the family at 10 p.m. on Monday night, the government demanded that the family's attorneys appear for a meeting on Tuesday morning at 9 a.m. with INS officials to discuss the revocation of Elian's parole. The government has continually dictated the terms of all meetings and has bulldozed over the right of Elian and his Miami family. 
   Today, the Department of Justice has summoned Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, to a meeting where he is expected by the INS to sign a unilateral demand ``to comply with the instructions of the INS,'' yet the INS has failed to provide the attorneys and the family with what those instructions will be. After all this child has been through, is it too much to ask how the government plans on removing him from the only home he now knows? Should his family agree to having INS agents come to his Miami home and take him? Probably not. But one thing is for sure: they should know the details of what they are agreeing to. 
   Keep in mind that this same agreement, if signed, destroys any shred of dignity left in our judicial process. It demands that the family's attorneys have a brief prepared to submit to the Supreme Court within 5 days of the appellate court decision, a time line virtually impossible to meet. 
   In its effort to dictate terms for the family's appeal, the government has betrayed the very integrity for which the Attorney General is charged with defending--equal protection under the law and the right to pursue justice in a free America. In the past week, I've heard justice department officials say they are taking more aggressive action against the family because they want  to prevent them from invoking more ``legal maneuvers.'' These ``legal maneuvers'' happen to be the legal rights of Americans--properly exercised in the middle of an appeals process. These ``legal maneuvers'' are tools in which all Americans are empowered to seek a fair hearing in the United States of America. I find it unconscionable that the justice department would so blatantly express their desire to dictate terms and influence the outcome of this case. 
   My reason for coming to the floor today is express my sheer frustration and anger in the manner in which the DOJ and the INS has handled this case. The recent acts of these two agencies demonstrate that the administration is no longer interested in resolving this case in a fair, unbiased way. The offer by the Department of Justice is a deeply flawed offer, one that no American would ever accept, one that no person in America should ever have to accept. Elian's mother sacrificed her life for the freedoms of America, freedoms she never had in Cuba, freedoms she never thought our country would deny her son in his moment of need. We should all, despite our views on this issue, be deeply ashamed at any attempt to short circuit justice in order to reach a resolution in the quickest possible way. 
   In the United States, we stand up to injustice in the world by zealously guarding our laws. We consistently and rightly argue that our strength and power come from our commitment to America's principles: freedom, justice, democracy and the protection of basic human rights. We are a nation founded upon these principles and we remain strong because we defend them. Mr. President, today and throughout the course of Elian's stay in the United States the INS and our Attorney General have not stood up for the one thing they are supposed to defend--justice for all. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for repealing the Social Security Earnings Test for working seniors. Many of my colleagues and I have been working together for the past 12 years to pass this legislation. At long last, the Senate is going to retire the Social Security Earnings Test. 
   The Social Security Earnings Test is a 70 year old dinosaur of a law which was initiated to insure that Social Security benefits were granted specifically to retired persons. Today, unfortunately, economic reality dictates the need for many senior citizens to continue working in order to achieve a basic standard of living. The Social Security Earnings Test stands as a roadblock to independence for tens of thousands of seniors throughout the United States. Furthermore, America's seniors represent a wealth of talent and skill. A national policy which discourages them from working is simply counterproductive. 
   Clearly, few other states have been as impacted by the unfair Social Security Earnings Test as the people in my home state of Florida. I've seen first-hand the impact upon Seniors of laws which limit income. We have already seen the impact caused by President Clinton's 1993 tax hike on Seniors, when he raised the Social Security benefit tax from 50% up to 85%. When are we, as a nation, going to stop penalizing success? 
   It's not a group of greedy millionaires who are being impacted by the earnings test restrictions. It's lower and moderate income Seniors who need some relief from their government to simply survive. In Florida, we are talking about grandparents who live on Social Security plus any outside work they can get. And if you have grandma in the hospital or a nursing home fighting Alzheimer's Disease, and grandpa has go find some work to pay the bills, the Social Security Earnings Test is simply another hurdle they have to overcome. 
   Several years ago, I was visiting a worksite in Safety Harbor, Florida where I met with a group of working Seniors. I asked them why they were working past the traditional retirement age. Some said they simply wanted to have a reason to get out of the house and do something productive. Others said they needed the additional income to take care of a loved one. Still others said they wanted to maintain a certain lifestyle without Federal interference. 
   But I was most struck by one gentleman who said to me, ``Senator, we live in a throw away society. Don't let them throw us away.'' What this gentleman was saying was that the message the Earnings Test sends is that society no longer needs you. How can we, as a society, say such a thing? Clearly, we shouldn't. 
   Finally, consider this thought. Baseball fans might remember my grandfather, Connie Mack, who spent many years in major league baseball. In 1929, he managed the World Champion Philadelphia Athletics. In 1929, he was 66 years old. Suppose he had succumbed to the idea that, at that age, there was no purpose for pursuing one's ideas, one's dreams in life. Suppose he had been told by our nation that he was no longer of value to society. He might not have had the opportunity to produce that great team. Fortunately, we didn't have a law which could have forced him into retirement. 
   The Federal government is sending a message to working Seniors that they are over the hill. The only thing that is over the hill is the Earnings Test. We need to retire the Earnings Test, not our Seniors.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks regarding the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act. 
   Floridians know all too well the impact of natural disasters on the agriculture community. While I am proud of the ability of our growers to rebuild their farms after such devastating losses, enormous disaster aid bills only serve as a band-aid fix to the problem. We must work harder to ensure that all farmers have access to the necessary risk-management tools. This bill encourages growers to purchase appropriate levels of crop insurance, hopefully avoiding the band-aid fix in future appropriation measures. 
   Florida is the ninth leading agricultural state in the nation, with annual farm receipts totaling $6 billion. The industry employs over 80,000 people and generates more than $18 billion in related economic activity. In 1998, hard working Floridians produced more than 25 billion pounds of food, and more than 2 million tons of livestock feed. I am proud to say that Florida leads the nation in production of 18 major agricultural commodities including oranges, sugarcane and fresh tomatoes. With these statistics in mind, it is imperative to ensure that federal programs work with, not against, Florida's farmers. 
   As an original co-sponsor of S. 1401, the Specialty Crop Insurance Act of 1999, I support the effort to reduce the dependence of the specialty crop industry on catastrophic loss insurance coverage by improving its access to quality crop insurance policies. By failing to account for the unique characteristics associated with farming specialty crops, current crop insurance policies do not include many specialty crop producers. 
   Through promotion of affordable crop insurance policies, S. 1401 would increase specialty crop producer participation in the Federal Crop Insurance Program. Today's legislation, S. 2251, the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act, includes many of these specialty crop provisions. 
   This legislation requires that 50% of the funds dedicated to research and development for the new crop insurance products are focused on specialty crop product development. At a level of $20 million per year, the legislation authorizes the Risk Management Agency to enter into partnerships with private and public entities to increase the availability of risk management tools for specialty crops. The expertise of outside agencies will most certainly help the Risk Management Agency develop sound specialty crop insurance policies. 
   The Risk Management for the 21st Century Act also includes an expansion of Risk Management Agency pilot authority, removal of the Non-insured Assistance Program (NAP) area trigger, incentives for growers who purchase ``buy-up'' coverage, and it proposes a premium refund for low-risk producers. These reforms will ease our nation's growers dependence on short sighted disaster relief bills. 
   This bill is the product of countless hours of negotiation, and I believe it represents an incredible opportunity to improve our Federal Crop Insurance Program. The Agriculture Committee has been extremely helpful in including the interests of specialty crop producers, and I thank them for their time and effort. I urge my colleagues to support the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment 2827. This amendment, cosponsored by Senators HATCH and MURKOWSKI, is very simple and straightforward. It eliminates the marriage penalty in the education savings accounts. 
   Married couples should not suffer a tax increase just because they are married. The so-called marriage penalties in the Tax Code do just that. Married couples often have to pay higher taxes than the couple would owe if they were single filers. The House has recently addressed this issue in the broader Tax Code, and we will soon do the same. But it makes no sense to have marriage penalties built into newer programs we have created, such as the tax-free education savings accounts. 
   Under this amendment, as under the administration's HOPE scholarship tax credit and Lifetime Learning credit, the income eligibility for joint filers would be double the amount for single filers. People who qualify for these accounts when they are single should not lose this valuable opportunity to provide for their children's education just because they got married. 
   When the Senate first passed education savings accounts in the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act, all Americans  were eligible to use these vehicles to save for their children's education. While that bill was in conference, however, income limits were added to this tax benefit, but these limits injected a marriage penalty into this provision. There is absolutely no policy justification for a marriage penalty in education tax benefits. This should not be a partisan issue. 
   As I mentioned earlier, the administration's education proposal did not contain a marriage penalty, but the income limits the administration negotiated when the 1997 bill was in conference created a marriage penalty in the education savings accounts. Now is the time for us to eliminate this marriage penalty. 
   According to my Joint Economic Committee staff, this amendment will allow over 2 million households to establish education savings accounts for their children. 
   We should be looking to remove marriage penalties in the Tax Code instead of making them worse. Our amendment will ensure that married couples can save for their children's education on an equal basis, as single individuals can. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and yield the floor.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I wanted to put some information in the RECORD. It is unfortunate that all Members did not have the information as to what the cost of this amendment would be. It is nowhere near what was implied by my friend who just concluded his comments. 
   The Joint Tax Committee has estimated the amendment will reduce taxes by only $7 million over 10 years. That is point one. Point two, the reason that is the case is because the individuals who would be affected by this already have the option to use prepaid tuition plans. 
   Now, there seems to be agreement with respect to tuition tax plans of people of high income, as Senator REID indicated a moment ago. We have all agreed it was fair to them. Why is it not fair to allow the same benefits to derive to them under the education savings accounts as under the prepaid tuition plan? 
   So, again, the cost is $7 million over 10 years. Roughly 2 million families would be affected, not 20 percent of potential families. It is narrowly focused and it is addressing the issue of a marriage penalty; there is no place in our proposal, the education savings plan, for discriminating against those who are married. 
   I thank the Chair for the time.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my friend and colleague Senator GRAHAM to introduce a resolution contragulating Florida State University's football team on winning the 1999 Division 1-A Collegiate Football National Championship. As a Senator from Florida and the father-in-law of an avid Seminole, I join with all those in my home state and those across this country in honoring Coach Bobby Bowden, his staff, and the football team for this outstanding accomplishment. Not only is this a special achievement that will long be remembered by the coaches and the players but it is also a moment to savor for the students, alumni and supporters of Florida State University. 
   Florida State University has one of the most exciting, prolific and successful college football teams in the country. In fact, they won 108 football games between 1990 and 1999, more than any other Division 1-A college football team during this timeframe. By finishing the 1999 season undefeated and untied, they have also extended their NCAA Division 1-A record streak of top-four finishes in the final Associated Press poll to 13 years in a row, the only football team to have accomplished this feat. 
   But as impressive as all these achievements are, they have accomplished what no other football team has been able to do. The 1999 Seminoles are the first Division I-A collegiate football team in the country to be ranked number one for the entire season by the Associated Press since the preseason rankings began in 1950. 
   1999 will also be remembered fondly by my good friend Bobby Bowden for reasons other than surpassing the 300 victory mark, or winning his second football national championship, or for obtaining his first perfect season in 40 years as a head football coach. In 1999, Coach Bowden and his lovely wife, Ann, celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Coach Bowden, Priscilla and I wish you and your wife our sincere congratulations on this most important milestone. 
   The State of Florida is indeed fortunate to be the home to three of the finest college football teams in the nation: Florida State University, the University of Florida and the University of Miami. Together, these three schools have won seven Division 1-A college football championships since 1984. That's seven college football championships in the last 16 years. This proves that the road to the college football national championship goes right through the State of Florida. 
   For those who love to wear the Garnet and Gold and do the Seminole Chop and the FSU War Chant, I am honored to introduce this resolution on their behalf, which honors the 1999 Florida State football team, the coaches and staff for winning the Division 1-A Collegiate Football national championship.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to commemorate four brave Americans. Theirs is a story of courage, it is a story of heroism, and it is a story of freedom. 
   Four years ago today, on February 24, 1996, Fidel Castro sent Cuban MiG fighters into the Florida Straits and killed Carlos Costa, Armando Alejandre, Mario de la Pen 6a, and Pablo Morales. 
   These men were members of a humanitarian organization known as ``Brothers to the Rescue.'' These volunteers search the Florida Straits for rafters. Too many Cubans die each year in their flight to freedom. The Brothers try to save lives. 
   So my thoughts and prayers today are with the families of the brave and courageous humanitarians who lost their lives 4 years ago. I know this day must be especially difficult for the families--today reminds them of the terrible loss suffered, and today also  marks another year passed without closure. 
   People need to be able to put the past behind them and move on. But when the President and his administration give assurances and advice, and American families trust and obey this advice only to be dragged along and let down, the administration commits a great injustice. 
   Think for a moment about Armando's sister or Mario's mother, or any other family member. Think for a moment, how you would feel if your brother or son was murdered while volunteering with a humanitarian organzation--killed by state-of-the-art fighter jets flown by the air force of one of the world's last totalitarian dictators? I know the pain for me would be unbearable. 
   I join with the families today in remembering these brave men. I want to tell their story of freedom, their story of courage, and their story of heroism. 
   Armando came to the United States from Cuba as a child. He so loved his life here, his freedom, that he joined the U.S. Marine Corps and volunteered for a tour in Vietnam. He volunteered to fight for his adopted home. He survived his tour only to be murdered by Fidel Castro. He was 45 years old. His wife of 21 years and his daughter have now lived with the struggle for justice for 4 years. They are in our thoughts today. 
   Carlos, a Florida native, was 29 years old when the Cuban government shot him out of the sky. He was always interested in aviation and dreamed of one day overseeing the operations of a major airport. He received his college degree from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and worked for the Dade County Aviation Department. His parents and sister today are in our thoughts. 
   Mario, a New Jersey native, was only 24 years old when Castro's MiG's took his life. He was in his last semester at Embry-Riddle, working toward his dream of becoming an airline pilot. His parents and brother are in our thoughts today. 
   Pablo left Cuba on a raft in 1992, and the Brothers to the Rescue saved his life. Indebted to these heroic pilots, he joined them and began training to obtain his pilot's license. Pablo often talked of his family still in Cuba and how much he missed them. Since his death, there are reports that they have been persecuted and discriminated against. Our thoughts are with his family in Cuba today. 
   Remember, as you think of these men this afternoon, what they were doing when they lost their lives--they were working to save the lives of others. This humanitarian effort must have so enraged Fidel Castro that he ordered the interception of these small, unarmed aircraft by his huge fighter jets to be blown from the sky with air-to-air missiles. 
   Two days after their murder four days ago, the President so moved by this tragedy said on national television;  
   I am asking that Congress pass legislation that will provide immediate compensation to the families, something to which they are entitled under international law, out of Cuba's blocked assets here in the United States.

   Mr. MACK. Two months later the Congress passed the bill--the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1996--and the President signed it in a large ceremony on the White House lawn. 
   The Brothers' families wanted to understand the new rules before they chose to proceed with any civil suit. They met with officials from the U.S. State Department to clarify the meaning of the new law. 
   In their meeting at the State Department, the families were told the U.S. Government encouraged them to file the civil lawsuit against the Cuban government.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, they took the Cuban Government to court. It took a long time, but eventually they won. In December of 1997, almost 2 years ago, a United States Federal court entered judgments against Cuba for the murders of their family members. Justice seemed to be won. The end appeared to be near. But the very same U.S. Government and the same Clinton administration that encouraged the families to postpone closure and pursue legal justice began to oppose them. They entered the lawsuit on the side of Fidel Castro. 
   I quote from Maggie Khule's testimony of last October before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Maggie Khule is the sister of Armando Alejandre:  
   No words can possibly explain our shock when we went to court and found U.S. attorneys sitting down at the same table as Cuba's attorneys. How can you explain to a mother who has lost her son, to a wife who has lost her husband, to a daughter who has lost her father, that their own government is taking the murderer's side?...... The Clinton administration has shut its doors to us. Secretary of State Albright, for example, won't meet with us on any of our other concerns because, to quote an aide, ``We are on the opposing side of this civil action.'' Are we? We thought we were the victims' families, victims ourselves. We thought we were Americans entitled to protection from our own country. We thought Cuba was the terrorist, the guilty party.  
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to take a moment from their busy schedules today, on this fourth anniversary of the murder of four brave humanitarians, and think about the blight of terrorism and the cost it has extracted from too many families of our country. 
   Think also this afternoon about what we ask to deter terrorism and promote justice. I want to read one more quote, this time from a Federal judge who heard the case brought by the families against Cuba. After observing this administration's change of position from support to opposition, he states the following in the March 1999 ruling:  
   The court notes with great concern that the very President who in 1996 decried this terrorist action by the Government of Cuba now sends the Department of Justice to argue before this court that Cuba's blocked assets ought not to be used to compensate the families of the U.S. nationals murdered by Cuba. The executive branch's approach to this situation has been inconsistent at best. It apparently believes that shielding a terrorist state's assets are more important than compensating for the loss of American lives.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the story of these four brothers, the Brothers to the Rescue, is a story of heroism and freedom. These men risked their lives for their own freedom as well as for the freedom of others, and their families have fought tirelessly for justice. I hope my colleagues will think about these courageous families. We must, indeed, honor them and their memories and the memories of their loved ones this afternoon. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. MACK. For the information of all Senators, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m. Following morning business, it is expected that the Senate will then begin consideration of the nuclear waste disposal bill. If that consent is not granted, then there is an understanding that a cloture vote will occur at 2:15 on Tuesday with respect to a committee amendment. Members should be aware that amendments to the nuclear waste bill are anticipated, and those concerned are close to reaching an agreement providing for a limited number of amendments and debate time. Therefore, Senators can expect votes throughout tomorrow's session of the Senate. It is hoped that Senators who have amendments will work with the bill managers in an effort to complete this legislation in a timely manner.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill granting Elian Gonzalez American citizenship. 
   What it means is that the most important decision in this young boy's life will not be made by a political bureaucracy--but by a family court. 
   Mr. President, neither the President of the United States, his Attorney General, nor the dictator ruling Cuba is qualified to decide the fate of this little boy. The United States is a country of laws, and we zealously believe in the rule of law. Elian deserves access to the legal protections of our family courts. These courts are in the business of considering family cases day after day. And they would consider ``what is in the boy's best interest.'' Today, the only concern of the INS is ``who speaks for the boy,'' not about his future. 
   The primary purpose of this legislation is to ensure Elian has access to America's family courts: a court that will consider the choice that his mother made when she gave her life for freedom. 
   Mr. President, we will continue this debate sometime later in the week and make no mistake, I believe that Elian should remain here in the United States where he can live in freedom. But it is not my purpose to make that decision; that is the function of a family court. 
   This bill is intended to allow a family court to settle this dispute based upon the best interests of Elian Gonzalez. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to address a problem that ought to be a concern to all of us: natural disasters and the exposure of the private insurance industry to catastrophic risks. In my state of Florida, we have a particular concern about hurricane risk, but many areas of the country are exposed to the risks of other major catastrophes--whether they be volcanoes, earthquakes or tornadoes. Increasingly, I am concerned about the state of the private insurance industry and its ability to withstand a major catastrophe--a catastrophe of Hurricane Andrew size ($15 billion in insured losses) or greater. 
   Today, I am introducing legislation to help address this problem and strengthen disaster protection for homeowners and businesses while protecting the interests of the taxpayer. I am pleased my friend from Texas, Senator HUTCHISON, has joined me in this effort. I believe our approach is an innovative, private-sector solution to the problem of catastrophic risk and I encourage my colleagues to review this proposal carefully. 
   Consumers of property and casualty insurance must be able to rely on their insurers for protection against the risk of catastrophic loss. However, protection for policyholders in today's system is weak; a major future catastrophe could leave consumers without protection and--if past experience is any indication--the government would intervene to ensure the people in the disaster areas receive timely compensation. It is important to note that current law actually poses a disincentive for insurers to set aside special reserves for catastrophic events. Any money set aside to cover potential risk is considered taxable income. To fix this flaw in America's insurance system, we need to provide incentives for insurers to set aside a portion of their policy premiums in secure reserve funds that will be available to meet policyholder needs in the event of future catastrophes. Our bill does just that. 
   The typical property and casualty insurance company in the United States is exposed to multiple forms of catastrophic risk. This risk can take the form of major disasters that occur only once in a decade or once in several decades (e.g., severe earthquakes, major hurricanes). These can also be in the form of localized natural disasters (e.g., tornadoes, wildfires, floods, winter storms) that cause unusually large policyholder losses in a region and imperil the ability of smaller insurance companies to help their policyholders in the area. 
   The nation's exposure to these large natural disasters is staggering. While millions of families and small businesses rely on insurance payments to recover from natural disasters, it is important to remember that--under our current insurance tax and regulatory systems--many private insurers may not be able to pay all claims arising from a major disaster. Hurricane Andrew and the Northridge Earthquake opened our eyes to the country's massive exposure to catastrophic losses. Insured losses in my state from Hurricane Andrew exceeded $15 billion. But if this storm had passed over Miami, rather than Homestead just 40 miles south, insured losses could have reached $50 billion, leaving the Florida economy crippled and more than a third of all insurers in that market insolvent. 
   There is always the potential for a major disaster in any given year in the United States. Estimates of insured losses from highly probable events range from about $75 billion in California and Florida to $100 billion or more in areas of the Midwest. The Gulf, Intermountain West, and Atlantic states all face exposures of approximately $20 billion or more. 
   Unfortunately, our current system of tax laws and accounting rules work against consumers and taxpayers because they discourage private market preparation for future major disasters. Present tax laws do not permit portions of consumers' insurance policy payments to be set aside and tax deferred in order to provide for the risk of truly catastrophic loss events. Ironically, our tax system allows insurers to set aside funds on a tax-deductible basis to address disasters that have already happened but it gives them no incentive to prepare for those major disasters that have not yet happened. 
   Policyholder premiums needed to fund policyholders' catastrophic losses in future years are subject to current tax if not used in a particular year. This diminishes the power of insurers to protect policyholders against future losses. This structure is inadequate for assuring that property-casualty policies will protect consumers from future major catastrophic losses. 
   The tax law should be revised in order to make accommodation for disaster protection reserves and bring about a more practical, and sensible, system for insurance companies and consumers. 
   Under the Policyholder Disaster Protection Act, insurers could set aside portions of policyholder payments in a tax-deferred disaster protection fund. Amounts from this fund used to pay for losses from a major disaster would be subject to taxation. This concept is similar to programs presently in place in many other developed countries. 
   I believe this legislation would result in greater stability for insurers providing catastrophic coverage and fewer insolvencies after a major disaster. A recent study by a major U.S. accounting firm determined that approximately $21 billion in pre-funded reserves would be accumulated within the first ten years of the program.  Also, the tax incentive in the bill will encourage insurers to serve disaster-prone areas in a responsible manner by setting aside funds to pay for major losses. 
   The treatment of the fund by insurers would be closely regulated. Following is a general description of the provisions of the bill: 
   Insurers would be able to set aside special tax-deferred reserves to cover potential catastrophic events. 
   The maximum amount any insurer could set aside in a given year would be determined by reference to each insurance company's exposure to the risk of catastrophic loss events. 
   Deductible contributions to disaster protection funds would be voluntary, but would be irrevocable once made (except to the extent of ``drawdowns'' for actual catastrophic loss events, or drawdowns otherwise required by state insurance regulators). No company could use these funds to shelter income from taxation. 
   The maximum allowable reserve for any given company will increase or decrease as they enter or exit lines of business that pose catastrophic risk. 
   Insurers would only be allowed to drawdown the disaster reserves if the loss event in question is declared an emergency or disaster by certain recognized bodies or government officials (for example, a disaster declared by the President under the Stafford Act) and that losses in a year exceed the specified high level. The amounts distributed from the fund are added to company's taxable income for the year in which the drawdown occurred. 
   Insurance companies would pay taxes on income generated when funds in the disaster reserve are invested. This income would be distributed out of the fund to the insurance company and taxed to the company on a current basis. 
   The maximum reserve (or ``cap'') would be phased in at the rate of five percent per year over 20 years. Industry estimates indicate private reserves of $40 billion would be built up over this time. 
   Various concepts to address the problem of catastrophic losses have been proposed over the years. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to craft a comprehensive solution to both the short-term and long-term problems presented by the risk of catastrophic disasters. In my view, the private-sector focus of this bill, which puts a strengthened private insurance market for consumers in the forefront of disaster protection, is an approach designed to ensure disaster relief is efficient and cost-effective for taxpayers. While the federal government may still need to provide last-resort safety net for disaster victims, it is important to do what we can to ensure private insurance is available, affordable and secure for those citizens in those areas of the country at risk to a catastrophic disaster. This bill will help to bring precisely that availability, affordability and security to insurance policyholders throughout the country, and I believe it is worthy of support and consideration. 
   The bill we're introducing today mirrors a bill introduced by Congressman FOLEY and MATSUI in the House of Representatives. It is also supported by taxpayer, homeowner, consumer, business and emergency service organizations, as well as local and state policy makers and insurance organizations. I believe it is a sensible approach and I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my good friend Senator GRAMM, chairman of the Committee on Banking, on section 507 of the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. I want to confirm that section 507 is intended to apply only to the amendments made by subtitle A of title V of the bill, and that section 507 is not to be construed, under any circumstances, to apply to any provision of law other than the provisions of subtitle A. For instance, subtitle A of title V relates only to disclosure of nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. This means that section 507 of the bill does not supersede, alter, or affect laws on the disclosure of information among affiliated entities. In particular, section 507 does not supersede, alter, or affect the provisions of the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (or FCRA) regarding the communication of information among persons related by common ownership or affiliated by corporate control, nor does section 507 supersede, alter, or affect the existing FCRA preemption of state laws with respect to the exchange of information among affiliated entities. I yield to my friend.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the conference report accompanying S. 900, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. And I want to begin my remarks today by congratulating Senator GRAMM, my friend and the chairman of the committee. We would not be here without his hard work, dedication, and skillful negotiation and he deserves the lion's share of credit for the fine bill we have before us today. 
   We are making history here. It has been 66 years since Congress passed the Glass-Steagall banking act in the depths of the Great Depression. It has been at least twenty years since determined efforts began in the Congress to repeal this outdated law and modernize the country's banking code. Today--finally--we have come to the end of the road. 
   As we stand on the verge of passing this bill, we have a great view both backward and forward. We can see a past in which the country's financial services industry led the world despite an archaic code recognized by everyone to be insufficient. And we can look ahead into a future that offers the American financial consumer: New and innovative products, better choices, information and service, and workable regulations that allow our financial firms to compete in the global marketplace to an even greater extent than today. 
   This much-needed legislation modernizing our nation's banking laws is happening none too soon. I want to spend some time talking about the two reasons I believe we're here. The first is the transformation of our economy over the past 20 years, and by extension the remarkable changes in our financial services sector. And the second is the tremendous impact of the technological revolution on the banking industry. 
   We are currently in the eighth year of the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history. When you look at the data, there is only one conclusion to draw: we are now reaping the economic benefits of the hard decisions on economic fundamentals we made back in the 1980s. Under the leadership of President Reagan, we dramatically lowered marginal tax rates, began the rollback of burdensome and overlapping regulations, promoted openness to trade and investment around the world, lowered interest rates, and defeated the inflation menace that crippled our economic competitiveness. In the 1990s, Congress finally completed the job by producing the first balanced federal budgets in a generation. 
   You cannot overestimate the impact of these fundamental economic victories on the prosperity the nation is enjoying today. One of my biggest concerns, as I think about the history of this era, is people will be left with the impression that President Clinton's 1993 tax increases created this economic expansion. Nothing could be further from the truth. We must not forget the hard--and ultimately correct--decisions made on fundamental questions like taxes, regulation, interest rates, and inflation in the 1980s that freed up the marketplace and allowed American businesses to capitalize on their inherent advantages. 
   The country's financial sector has certainly shared in this prosperity. We have witnessed a revolution in the delivery of financial services during the 1990s as the traditional barriers between banking, insurance and securities began to come down. Freedom and our free enterprise system ensured that new financial products and alliance emanated from America to service the demands of the global economy. These products and alliance provide American businesses, investors, and consumers with the ability to secure more easily the capital they need to finance their hopes and dreams. As this new economic and financial dynamic became more clear, it was also apparent our existing banking code was outdated and in need of change. 
   As part of the new economy, it is hard to overstate the impact of the technological revolution on the financial marketplace. Earlier this year, during hearings on the bill before us, Chairman Greenspan noted the financial sector:  
   ..... is undergoing major and fundamental change driven by a revolution in technology, by dramatic innovations in the capital markets, and by the globalization of the financial markets and the financial services industry.  
   Indeed, the financial marketplace is changing with lightning speed. In September, we held a high-technology summit at the Joint Economic Committee. One of those who testified before our committee was a 
   twenty-nine-year-old entrepreneur who created an electronic stock trading network. Nine of these electronic trading networks make up about twenty percent of the NASDAQ market and are posing a serious challenge to more traditional stock exchanges and markets. Mortgages and traditional banking services are available over the internet. And anybody who watches television advertisements knows a new generation od web-based businesses are transforming the traditional image--and, incidentally, the fee structure--of stock brokers and stock trading. These businesses and the many others who have gone online to challenge the existing orthodoxy are prompting sweeping changes in the financial marketplace. And they are creating yet another imperative for this bill. 
   As the American financial industry seized on technological advances to lead the world into new financial markets and new financial products, they awoke from their long slumber of lobbying wars and turf protection and realized it was in everybody's best interest to pass this bill. If our financial firms are to lead and compete in the world marketplace, they must be able to compete from a position of strength. And they must compete from the foundation of banking laws that reflect the new realities of the world marketplace. 
   The end game on this legislation was by no means easy. During the eleven months we spent writing this bill, we had to continually strike careful balances between the broad, over-arching goals of the bill and the temptation to tinker with the marketplace and predetermine the shape of future financial products and services. The fast pace of change presents a difficult choice for policymakers. We are often too cumbersome in the Congress to lead, we can be irrelevant if we follow, and some among us believe it could be risky to get out of the way. In the face of this dilemma, some of our colleagues wanted us to anticipate every possible side-effect of this financial transformation and write the laws accordingly. This is just not possible, and the resultant regulatory burdens would have stopped this financial revolution in its tracks.  
   In the bill before us today, we tried to embrace the following principles: 
   First, banks, insurance companies and securities firms should be able to enter one another's business and create a financial dynamic for the next century; 
   Second, new banking products should be regulated by the regulator that knows them best. 
   Third, institutions should disclose to customers what they are doing with their sensitive personal information--both within and outside the financial firm. And customers should be able to stop these companies from sharing their information with third parties. 
   Next, new financial activities conducted through subsidiaries of banks should be conducted so as to ensure taxpayer guaranteed deposits are not threatened. 
   And finally, the burdensome regulations on banks with respect to community lending should not be increased as a result of what we're doing in this bill. 
   There are sensible guidelines and I'm satisfied we've created the basis here for a safe, sound and flexible financial industry that will serve the interests of American consumers, investors and businesses well into the future. 
   As I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are making history here. A hundred years from today, I believe the primary thing people will remember about this Congress is that we finally did the right thing and passed this bill. 
   Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks on a personal note. As I begin to recognize the reality that my service in the United States Senate will end in slightly more than a year, I find I am engaging in the occasional reflection. 
   During the last 12 years of my 18 years in the Congress, I served on the Senate Banking Committee--the committee responsible for writing and overseeing the laws of the land that regulate the banking and financial industry. This has been special to me because I spent the first sixteen years of my career in the banking business. It was work I enjoyed as the years went by. It was also work I found increasingly frustrating because of the stifling regulatory burden placed on banks by the federal government. It was for these and other reasons I left my position as President and LEO of my bank in Cape Coral, Florida and ran for the Congress. 
   I will not stand here today and claim the credit for the far-reaching and far-sighted bill before us today. My friend and colleague Senator GRAMM deserves the credit on the Senate side. I nonetheless feel a strong sense of pride and institutional accomplishment for the legacy we are leaving to the United States in passing this bill. It will benefit the people, the industry, and the economy as a whole and it is truly a document we can all be very proud of. I urge my colleagues to support the conference report

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. ROTH, for including in the manager's package an amendment by Mr. SARBANES and myself expressing the sense of the Congress with respect to the issue of debt relief for poor countries. Our resolution simply expresses the desire of this body to work with the President and the international community to forgive the debt owed to us by the world's poorest countries in exchange for commitments from these countries to reform their economies and work toward a better quality of life for their people. This follows on legislation we introduced earlier this month to accomplish this important objective. 
   Our effort today is premised on the notion that we must help these poverty-stricken nations break the vicious cycle of debt and give them the economic opportunity to liberate their futures. This issue has united people of diverse interests and backgrounds from all around the world. There is a growing sense across the cultural and political spectrum that debt burdens are a major impediment to economic reform and the alleviation of the abject poverty facing the world's poorest countries. And there is increasing certainty that debt forgiveness--if done right--can be a positive force for change in the developing world. Our resolution makes clear that the objectives of debt relief should be the promotion of policies that promote economic growth, openness to trade and investment, and the development of free markets. I am glad the full Senate is joining us in this endeavor. 
   Today, Mr. President, the world's poorest countries owe an average of $400 for every man, woman, and child within their borders. This is much more than most people in these countries make in a year--in fact more than one billion people on Earth today live on less than a dollar a day. Debt service payments in many cases consume a majority of a poor country's annual budget, leaving scarce domestic resources for economic restructuring or such vital human services as education, clean water and sanitary living conditions. In Tanzania, for example, debt payments would require nearly four-fifths of the government's budget. In a country where one child in six dies before the age of five, little money remains to finance initiatives that would improve the country's economic prospects, its openness to trade and investment, or the standard of living of its people. Among sub-Saharan African countries--many of the very countries we're looking to help in the trade package before us today--one in five adults can't read or write. 
   Mr. President, the problems in the developing countries that yield such grim statistics will never be solved without a monumental commitment of will from their leaders, their citizens, and the outside world. We cannot solve all these problems today. Rather, we are simply affirming to the world that the small step of debt relief is one that can and should be taken without delay. 
   The effort to forgive the debts of the world's poorest countries has been ongoing for more than a decade. During this time the international community and the G7 came to the realization that the world's poorest countries are simply unable to repay the debt they owe to foreign creditors. What's more, the payments that are being made are hampering progress toward more free, open, and economically vibrant economies. The external debt for many developing nations is more than twice their gross domestic product, leaving many unable to even make interest payments. We must accept the fact that this debt is unpayable. The question is not whether we'll ever get paid back, but rather what we can encourage these heavily indebted countries to do for themselves in exchange for our forgiveness. 
   In Uganda, for example, debt relief obtained under the existing debt forgiveness programs has cleared the way for a doubling of classroom size, allowing twice as many children to attend school as before. This type of benefit is real. It is tangible. And it will bring untold benefits to the country in future years. We must do more to encourage these types of programs and debt relief is one vehicle that can help effect real change in the developing world. 
   Prudent debt relief is in all of our best interests. It is an investment in the commitment of the world's poorest countries to implement sound economic reforms and help their people live longer, healthier and more prosperous lives. 
   Our amendment today is another step toward this goal and I thank my colleagues for their support.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the very important trade package that the Senate is currently considering. At a time when our global marketplace is expanding faster than ever, we need to ensure that the poorest countries around the world are not left behind. 
   This comprehensive package uses trade to promote economic self-sufficiency, at the same time allowing for broader access to American goods and services to these markets. While many believe the economic and financial answer for these underdeveloped countries may lie in direct financial assistance, I believe the answer is found by facilitating direct private investment. 
   I want to share with colleagues the plight of one of these countries which I experienced firsthand this past weekend. I spent 2 days in Haiti meeting with political, business, and humanitarian groups. 
   By far, the most dramatic portion of my trip was witnessing the extreme poverty and despair that grips that Nation. I saw the face of an economy suffering from 17-percent inflation and unemployment of between 60 and 80 percent. 
   Let me tell the story of one little boy I met. Only through a humanitarian organization and through the support of private donations is this 9-year-old boy able to obtain an education. As a tool to economic and democratic stabilization, aid is simply not enough. Many children just aren't able to stay in school. They are required to work in order to contribute to their families' survival. 
   Again, I make the point that for a good number of the people in Haiti, their per capita income is around $50 a year. A straight calculation of the per capita income is about $500. But if you look at the makeup of that distribution, you can see easily that there are literally millions of people in Haiti who live with a per capita income of around $50. 
   If these children are to have a future, revitalization and expansion of economic opportunities are needed to reach the goal of economic self-sufficiency. By creating a framework for using trade and investment as a development tool, the United States will be fostering reform at the economic base of these countries, taking direct aim at lowering unemployment and high inflation rates. 
   This legislation creates this framework by extending enhanced trade benefits to the countries of the Caribbean Basin. Since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, U.S. imports from Caribbean countries have been at a distinct disadvantage. The measure would build on the existing Caribbean Basin Initiative program, often referred to as CBI, by providing additional trade benefits to Caribbean countries similar to that which Mexico and Canada currently enjoy. 
   Since its inception, CBI has had a significant positive economic impact on both the United States and the Caribbean countries, helping to promote regional security and stability of our Caribbean neighbors. Opening this market even further, particularly following the recent devastation inflicted by hurricanes, will help to stimulate job growth by increasing exports and expanding market access to these countries for U.S. businesses. 
   Another important component of this trade package establishes U.S. support for economic self-reliance in sub-Saharan Africa. The United States stands to benefit a great deal from a strong and prosperous Africa. By fostering growth-oriented economic policies, we will help support broader access to African markets for American goods and services. Sub-Saharan Africa makes up a market of more than 700 million people and is potentially one of the largest markets in the world. As economic reforms and market-opening measures spur growth in Africa, it will create new and bigger markets for U.S. exporters. 
   A particularly sensitive, albeit important, provision included in both the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act deals with textiles. The textile and apparel industries have historically provided the first step toward industrialization in many countries. This is because production is fairly simple, can be done on a small scale, and often uses locally abundant raw material. 
   In seeking to address the concerns raised by the U.S. textile industry, this legislation has sought compromise by restricting preferential treatment to apparel produced by U.S. fabric and yarns. 
   Additionally, this legislation provides strong protections against illegal transshipment of goods through Africa  or eligible CBI countries. We need to ensure that these countries do not become stop-over points for products from countries not eligible for preferential treatment under the legislation. 
   International trade has been an important part of the growth we have enjoyed in the United States. Since 1994, international trade has created more than 11 million American jobs, and accounts for 30 percent of our Nation's gross domestic product. 
   Imports have helped to hold down inflation, lower the cost of production, provide greater choice to consumers, and have given incentives to raise productivity. 
   As emerging markets seek to grow, it is important that the United States take the lead in offering these countries incentives to continue their economic reforms. By doing so, we will be providing the citizens of these emerging countries with more jobs, more opportunities and genuine hope. I believe a strong trade relationship is the best form of ``foreign assistance'' we can offer another country. 
   I thank the chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in paying tribute to the memory of our friend and colleague, Senator John Chafee. 
   Senator Chafee was the living embodiment of Senate decorum. He always honored this body through his thoughts, deeds and actions. His ideas and messages were delivered thoughtfully and respectfully. He truly followed his heart and soul while representing the people of Rhode Island and this great nation. 
   His honorable service in both World War II and the Korean Conflict, as well as his distinguished tenure as Secretary of the Navy, reflect his profound respect for America's armed forces and his deep love of country. 
   I am especially appreciative for all he did to advance causes near and dear to the state of Florida. He took time to visit the Florida Everglades, and his work on this important issue will ensure the preservation of this unique natural system, and will always be a part of his lasting legacy. 
   Senator Chafee devoted his life to public service. He will be remembered as a thoughtful and patriotic American who cared passionately about those he served, the issues he fought for, and the institution of the United States Senate. He was not only a fellow Republican, but a colleague who was respected on both sides of the aisle. He will be sorely missed in the U.S. Senate. 
   My heartfelt sympathies go to his wife Ginny, to their five children and 12 grandchildren, and to his staff here in Washington and throughout Rhode Island.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator JOHN BREAUX, in introducing the Fuel Tax Equalization Credit for Substantial Power Takeoff Act. 
   This bill would create a simple mechanism to reimburse owners of concrete mixers and sanitation trucks for the Federal excise taxes that they pay on fuels used to power the off-road function of their vehicles. 
   Today, IRS regulations impose the Federal fuels excise tax on ``single engine, dual-use vehicles.'' Two prominent examples of such single-engine, dual-use vehicles are concrete mixers and sanitation trucks. The IRS taxes the entire amount of fuel used in these vehicles, despite the fact that a substantial portion of the fuel consumed is used to power an off-road function--the trash compactor of a sanitation truck, or the rotating drum of the cement truck. 
   Mr. President, the Federal fuels excise tax is meant to pay for our Nation's roads. If fuel is used for an off-road purpose, it is a well-established principle that we do not tax the fuel. In this case, fuels used to power the trash compactor or rotate the drum on a concrete mixer do not result in wear and tear on the roads and, therefore, should not be taxes. 
   Contrary to this well-established principle, the IRS imposes the excise tax on single engine, dual-use vehicles. The simple reason given by the IRS for this distinction is administrative convenience. But the convenience of the IRS is no reason to overtax diesel fuel consumers. 
   Mr. President, our bill corrects the discrepancy created under IRS regulations, and does so without creating any administrative red tape. The $250 income tax credit crafted in the bill would be easy to administer. While it will not fully and precisely compensate these truck owners for the taxes paid on fuel used off-road, this credit has been calculated based on industry data and using conservative estimates, and reduces a tax that these truck owners should not be paying in the first place. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join Senator BREAUX and me in supporting this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. MACK. Madam President, as Congress considers various plans to overhaul the current campaign finance system, I think everyone can agree on one fact: the status quo is indefensible. The system needs to change in order to restore the American people's faith in their government. 
   The imbalances which exist in our election laws today were created by the Federal Election Campaign Act in the name of equality. They resulted in unfair advantages which are institutionalized in the name of fairness, protecting some forms of political speech while criminalizing others. Enacting more laws along the same lines will only lead us further down the path of destruction. Freedom matters. Freedom works. Free speech works. Free participation works. The current system does not. If we want real reform, we will scrap this bill, repeal current law, and start over. 
   Campaign finance reformers think the solution is new regulations and methods that I believe work only to preclude participation in politics. They believe that new laws, more restrictions, and additional bureaucracy are the answer. This position is based upon the assumption that current laws are working and they just need a few modifications to make them better. I  strongly disagree. Freedom of expression is an end in itself and can not be subordinated to any other goals of society. Information is the backbone to freedom, ignorance is the backbone to oppression. 
   Reformers tolerate these inequalities because they believe they will result in lower-cost elections, less influence in the process by special interests, and will make the electoral system more accessible to challengers. Even if these goals could be achieved in this way, the trampling of the First Amendment in the process is unacceptable. 
   The fact is, current laws do not work. Let's admit that. We wouldn't be debating this issue if they did. They were passed in haste, as a knee-jerk reaction to the Watergate era, and while they were enacted with good intentions, their result has been a disaster. We should recognize that a mistake was made when the Federal Election Campaign Act was enacted, and no modifications to this law will improve the system. 
   Campaign finance laws restricting free speech should be repealed, and the absolute freedom to engage in the political process should be promoted and defended. The American people should know that their participation is encouraged, respected, and welcome. If that participation includes fully disclosed contributions to candidates and parties, so be it. Disclosure is the key factor here. Let's give the American people some credit. They are smart enough to judge for themselves where conflicts of interest lie. They do not need the bureaucracy of the Federal Elections Commission to police their speech and thwart their involvement. The only job of the FEC should be the posting and reporting of all contributions in a timely manner so that the American people can judge for themselves. Current law is an insult to the intelligence of the American people. 
   Soft money is perceived as a loophole in current law. Banning soft money is only one more step toward the elimination of free speech in elections. The First Amendment right to freedom of speech is not a loophole. It is a fundamental freedom that protects, among other things, political speech. Again, let Americans 
   decide whether and to what extent they want to participate. 
   We should be protecting freedom of speech over everything else. We should not enact legislation to preclude the public from voicing their opinions on the work we do here. We may not like what is said about us, but we can all agree that people have a right to speak their mind, especially their political mind. 
   This bill also recognizes that current law does not protect working Americans' ability to decide which causes they will support. While this bill codifies the Beck decision which enables non-union workers to request a refund for the portion of their union fees used for political causes. If it does not address the concerns of union members who are forced to participate in political causes without their consent. 
   No American should be faced with the direct or indirect threat of losing their job because of their political beliefs. No one should be forced to participate in advocating for a cause or causes they find repugnant. The rights of individuals to be free certainly extends to their political beliefs and the way in which they choose to participate or not to participate. No forced participation under any guise should be tolerated or encouraged. Let individuals make choices for themselves. That is the most fundamental freedom in a democracy. 
   A vibrant democracy depends on the ability of all voices to be heard, and how loudly one may wish to speak should be limited only by that individual, not by government. If an individual can and is willing to expend over $1,000 in support of a candidate, they should be able to do so. If they wish to express their support with their time or in any other fashion, then this, too, should be applauded and encouraged. And if individuals wish to ignore the political process altogether, then this, too, is a right to be defended. To tinker with this fundamental right gives power to some at the expense of others. 
   Finally, I would submit, that we need to re-examine our attitude toward money in the electoral process, and I would propose that spending money to communicate one's message is not the root of all evil in politics. Candidates for public office have the important task of getting their message out to the voters. In statewide races across the country, candidates must spend substantial amounts of money for print and electronic media, since it is the best current method of reaching the maximum audience. 
   Take a moment and think about the power of the media today--television, newspapers and radio frame the debates of important issues. A candidate must be able to raise enough money to get his or her message out to the public. 
   When I was campaigning for my Senate seat back in 1988, I faced enormous opposition from the newspapers. Newspapers have vast resources to openly campaign for a candidate. Had I not had the freedom and ability to counter their message, I would not be a Senator today. 
   True reform will not strip candidates, parties, or individuals of their ability to counter the messages in the media. True reform should recognize the imbalance current law has created, and would seek to level the playing field between candidates and the media. Remember, the First Amendment protects freedom of the press, but it also protects the freedom of individuals to speak loud and clear. 
   Madam President, I believe in the First Amendment. Protecting that right must be our primary goal.

    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Maryland, Mr. SARBANES, to introduce the Debt Relief for Counties Act of 1999. This bill simply forgives much of the debt owed to us by the world's poorest countries in exchange for commitments from these countries to reform their economies and work toward a better quality of life for their people. Our effort today is premised on the fact that we must help these poverty-stricken nations break the vicious cycle of debt and give them the economic opportunity to liberate their futures. I ask my colleagues to join me in this worthwhile effort. 
   Today, the world's poorest countries owe an average of $400 for every man, woman, and child within their borders. This is much more than most people in these countries make in a year. Debt service payments in many cases consume a majority of a poor country's annual budget, leaving scarce domestic resources for economic restructuring or such vital human services as education, clean water and sanitary living conditions. In Tanzania, for example, debt payments would require nearly four-fifths of the government's budget. In a country where one child in six dies before the age of five, little money remains to finance public health programs. Among Sub-Saharan African countries, one in five adults can't read or write, and it is estimated that in several countries almost half the population does not have access to safe drinking water. 
   Mr. President, the problems that yield such grim statistics will never be solved without a monumental commitment of will from their leaders, their citizens, and the outside world. That is not what we propose to do here today. Our bill is only a small step in the right direction, but it is one we can do quickly and for relatively little cost. 
   The effort to forgive the debts of the world's poorest countries has been ongoing for more than a decade. During this time the international community and the G7 came to the realization that the world's poorest countries are simply unable to repay the debt they owe to foreign creditors. The external debt for many of the developing nations is more than twice their GDP, leaving many unable to even pay the interest on their debts. We must accept the fact that this debt is unpayable. the question is not whether we'll ever get paid back, but rather what we can encourage these heavily indebted countries to do for themselves in exchange for our forgiveness. 
   Our bill requires the President to forgive at least 90 percent of the entire bilateral debt owed by the world's heavily indebted poor countries in exchange for verifiable commitments to pursue economic reforms and implement poverty alleviation measures. While roughly $6 billion is owed to the United States by these poor countries, it is estimated the cost of forgiving this debt would be less than ten percent of that amount. The U.S. share of the bilateral debt is less than four percent of the total, but our action would provide leadership to the rest of the world's creditor nations and provide some savings benefits to these countries as well. 
   Our bill also requires a restructuring of the IMF and World Bank's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC). This program was begun in 1996, but to date only three countries 
   have received any relief. While the premise of HIPC is sound, its shortcomings have become evident during the implementation. It promises much, but in reality it benefits too few countries, offers too little relief, and requires too long a wait before debt is forgiven. A process of reforming the HIPC was begun this year during the G7's meeting in Cologne, and our bill meets or exceeds the standards set out in the Cologne communique. 
   Specifically, we shorten the waiting period for eligibility from six to three years. We extend the prospect of relief to more countries. And we ensure that savings realized from the relief will be used to enhance ongoing economic reforms in addition to initiatives designed to alleviate poverty. This is a sound and balanced approach to help these poor countries correct their underlying economic problems and improve the standard of living of their people. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is not a handout to the developing world. Rather, it is an investment in these countries' commitment to implementing sound economic reforms and helping their people live longer, healthier and more prosperous lives. In order to receive debt relief under our bill, countries must commit the savings to policies that promote growth and expand citizens' access to basic services like clean water and education. 
   We have included a strict prohibition in our bill on providing relief to countries that sponsor terrorism, spend excessively on their militaries, do not cooperate on narcotics matters, or engage in systematic violations of their citizens' human rights. We are not proposing to help any country that is not first willing to help itself. 
   Mr. President, the debt accumulated in the developing world throughout the Cold War and into the 1990s has become a significant impediment to the implementation of free-market economic reforms and the reduction of poverty. We in the developed world have an interest in removing this impediment and providing the world's poorest countries with the opportunity to address their underlying economic problems and set a course for sustainability. 
   I believe our bill is an important first step in this process and I look forward to the support of my colleagues in the Senate.

    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague Senator ABRAHAM, to introduce the Merit Act, which is legislation to ensure that every classroom in America is staffed with a competent, qualified and caring teacher. Last Congress, the Senate debated a number of initiatives to further this goal and passed this legislation as an amendment to a comprehensive education reform bill, which was vetoed by the President. Earlier this year, I joined Senator GREGG in cosponsor the Teacher Empowerment Act. Both the TEA, and the MERIT ACT are important reform bills to enable local schools to staff their classrooms with the best and brightest teachers. 
   The 21st Century begins in just under 100 days. If our children are to be prepared for the challenges ahead, educational excellence must become our first order of business. As Congress continues to focus on a number of important reforms to federal K-12 education policy, I strongly believe that any real education reform must confront the most basic, the most important, and the most neglected aspect of public education: the quality of instruction in the classroom. 
   Parents all over the state of Florida, and I imagine the same is true around the country, are concerned that the success --or failure--of their child's entire academic year will be determined by the quality and expertise of their child's teacher. Studies show that the most important factor in determining student success on standardized tests is the teacher's ability to present the material. Studies also show that when a student is assigned an ineffective teacher, the damage is not limited to one year. In fact, student test scores do not recover for three years, even if their subsequent teachers are excellent. 
   America's classrooms are staffed with many dedicated, knowledgeable, and hardworking teachers. Nevertheless, the case for sweeping reform is not difficult to make. While the United States already spends more money per pupil than virtually any industrialized democracy in the world, our children frequently score near the bottom in international exams in science and math. Without exceptional teaching, no amount of resources will be able to turn bad schools into good schools. Throwing more money at the problem is no longer the answer. 
   Our schools and classrooms should be staffed with teachers who have the appropriate training and background. Students deserve teachers with a thorough knowledge of the subjects they are teaching and the ability to convey complex material in ways that students can understand. One way to determine the competency of teachers would be to test them on their knowledge of the subject areas they teach. 
   At a time when states are raising the bar for student achievement, few are raising standards for teachers. Today, seven states have no licensing exams for new teachers, and of the 
   43 states that do have licensing exams, only 29 require high school teachers to pass an exam in the subject they plan to teach. However, in many cases, these requirements are waived when there is a shortage of qualified candidates. 
   We have a clear interest in ensuring that beginning teachers are able to meet high standards and are knowledgeable about the subject matter they are presenting, and a number of states have taken the initiative to test their prospective teachers. However, when you consider that many teachers--especially teachers in low income districts--do not even have a minor degree in the subject they teach, it is important to periodically evaluate the performance of all teachers. Schools are often strapped for good teachers and will simply staff a science class with a math teacher. These are cases where testing could provide valuable insight as to the mastery of the teacher in additional subjects, and would identify those teachers who need additional encouragement. 
   Common sense also dictates that we should not concentrate all our attention on under-performing teachers. We must also recognize that there are many great teachers who are successfully challenging their students on a daily basis. Today, our public schools compensate teachers based almost solely on seniority, not on their performance inside the classroom. Merit-pay would differentiate between teachers who are hard-working and inspiring, and those who fall short. 
   The legislation we are introducing today, known as the MERIT ACT--which stands for Measures to Enhance Results in Teaching --is the same legislation that passed the Senate last Congress with bipartisan support by a vote of 63-35. It rewards states that test its teachers on their subject matter knowledge, and pays its teachers based on merit. 
   Here is how it works: we will make half of any additional funding over the FY 2000 level for the Eisenhower Professional Development Program available to states that periodically test elementary and secondary school teachers, and reward teachers based on merit and proven performance. There will be no reduction in current funding to states under this program based on this legislation. As funding increases for this program, so will the amount each state receives. Incentives will and should be provided to those states that take the initiative to establish teacher testing and merit pay programs. 
   Again, I want to emphasize that all current money being spent on this program is unaffected by this legislation. Only additional money will be used as an incentive for states to enact teacher testing and merit pay programs. 
   Finally, this legislation enables states to also use federal education money to establish and administer teacher testing and merit pay programs. This broad approach will enable states to staff their schools with the best and most qualified teachers, thereby enhancing learning for all students. In turn, teachers can be certain that all of their energy, dedication and expertise will be rewarded. And it can be done without placing new mandates on states or increasing the federal bureaucracy. 
   It is interesting to note that as Governor of the State of Arkansas, Bill Clinton enthusiastically supported teacher testing, and as Governor of South Carolina, Secretary of Education Richard Riley advocated a merit-pay plan. In fact, then-Governor Clinton in 1984 said that he was more convinced than ever that competency tests were needed to take inventory of teachers' basic skills. He said, ``Teachers who don't pass the test shouldn't be in the classroom''. While President Clinton vetoed this legislation last year, I am hoping he will stand by his State of the Union address where he stated that new teachers should be required to pass performance exams and all teachers should know the subject matter they are teaching. 
   I would also like to mention the important steps being taken by schools around the country to address the need for merit-based pay. Most recently, in Denver, Colorado, schools have reached an agreement with the unions to commence a two year demonstration program which will pay teachers based on  performance. It is important to note the two largest unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, have approached the Denver plan with an open mind. In this program, teachers can earn an additional $1500 by the end of an academic year if a majority of the teacher's students ``improve.'' I am encouraged by the initiative taken by Denver's schools to implement innovative approaches to teacher compensation, and I look forward to the continued cooperation of America's teacher unions. Without their cooperation, reforms to education in America are often frustrated. In the end, I believe teachers, administrators, parents and students will be able to devise a system that is fair and one that works to improve teacher and student performance alike. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues as we continue the fight to give dedicated professionals who teach our children a personal stake in the quality of the instruction they provide. I hope there will again be broad, bipartisan support for this bill.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, Senator GRAHAM and I rise again to introduce the Florida Coast Protection Act of 2000. This legislation will amend current law to give states the ability to have all pertinent environmental information on hand before they are forced to rule on oil and gas drilling development plans, and it would also implement a permanent ban on leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. 
   Mr. President, Floridians have always been justifiably concerned about the prospect of oil and gas exploration in the waters off our coast. We are well aware of the risk this activity poses to our environment and our economy because, in Florida, a healthy environment means a healthy economy. Millions of people come to Florida each year to enjoy the climate, our beaches, and our fine quality of life. The tourism industry in Florida provides millions of jobs and generates revenues in the billion of dollars. It would take only one disaster to end Florida's good standing as America's vacationland. We cannot afford to let that happen. 
   Throughout my tenure in the Senate I have opposed exploration and drilling off Florida's coasts. My goal--and the goal of the entire Florida Congressional delegation--is to permanently remove this threat from Florida's coast. In recent years, we have stood together in opposition to drilling and have successfully extended the annual moratorium on all new leasing activities on Florida's continental shelf. While the opposition of Floridians to oil drilling is well-documented, the reality remains that leases have been issued, potential drilling sites have been explored, and it is likely that actual extraction of resources could take place within the next few years. 
   In order to prevent a repeat of the past mistake of leasing in the OCS off Florida, our legislation makes permanent the ban on any new leasing activity within 100 miles of our coast. In addition, it gives states the flexibility to make a determination regarding the consistency of oil and gas development and production plans as required by the Coastal Zone Management Act after an environmental impact statement detailing the direct and cumulative impacts of the project is completed by the Minerals Management Service. 
   It is this second provision which is so important. Many in this body may not be aware that my state is currently engaged in a battle to keep drilling rigs off its coasts. In the process, the government of the state of Florida was forced, by current law, to make a consistency determination on a pending development plan without the benefit of the environmental impact statement. In fact, the state was forced to conclude that the plan is inconsistent with its own coastal zone management  program months before the environmental impact statement was concluded. As I stand here, the EIS for this development plan is still not finalized and its draft is currently the subject of public hearings. Without the benefit of this detailed study, the state is unable to accurately assess the primary, secondary and cumulative impacts drilling will have on our coast, estuaries, marine life and our economy. No state should be put in a similar position and our bill seeks to correct this.

   Mr. MACK. Given the merits of the project, we were disappointed that Barry University was not included in the legislation before us that allocates funds to the ``Economic Development Initiatives'' for such purposes. Barry University's proposal meets the criteria established by the Subcommittee in terms of serving low-income populations. Our hope is that this project can be re-considered during final deliberations on the bill. Specifically, we would request that favorable language be included in this bill directing the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to spend a minimum of 1.5 million dollars from the Economic Development Initiative fund to finance this important program that promotes economic and social revitalization. We would appreciate the Senator's support, along with the Chairman's in the funding of the Barry University Intercultural Community Center in the Conference Report.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, to engage the distinguished Chairman, Senator BOND, in a colloquy. Specifically, I wish to make the Chairman aware of an important priority for the State of Florida which was not funded in this bill. Last year, the public housing reform act passed by Congress contained authorization for the construction of a community services student union building at Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida. Accordingly, we included this project as one of our important priorities for the legislation before us today.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, to engage the distinguished Chairman, Senator BOND, in a colloquy. Specifically, I wish to make the Chairman aware of two critical projects in Florida that did not receive funding in this bill. The first is the City of West Palm Beach's water reuse project. This wetlands-based potable water reuse program is critical not only to the water supply of the City of West Palm Beach but also to the Everglades restoration effort. 
   During dry season, the City takes water from Lake Okeechobee which is a critical primary source of water for the Everglades. West Palm Beach is attempting to eliminate this water use through their innovative water reuse project. The City has received federal support in each of the past three fiscal years. Work is progressing on schedule, but a final installment of federal funding is needed to complete the work and bring the project on line. 
   I would point out to the Chairman that this project is funded in the House VA/HUD and Independent Agencies appropriations bill. I would urge the Chairman to work with our House colleagues during the upcoming conference to ensure that funding for this critical project is completed in this fiscal year.

   Mr. MACK. I thank my distinguished colleague for yielding me that time. 
   Mr. President, the vote on our tax relief bill is nothing less than a vote of confidence, reaffirmation of our belief in the wisdom of the American people and of our faith in the capitalist system. It all boils down to one basic, fundamental question: who has first claim on the income of Americans--does it belong to the government or to the individual families who create the income through the sweat of their brows and the genius of their (brains?) 
   The President and the vast majority of our friends on the other side of the aisle act like the money belongs to the  government. They reject our tax relief bill as ``too big,'' as if taxpayers earn income at the sufferance of the government. Under this view, Uncle Sam does not live under a budget he sets the budget for every American family, which must be content with the table scraps after the enormous appetite for spending in Washington has been satiated. 
   Two and one-quarter centuries ago, the rejection of this arrogant, government-comes-first theory of taxation was the impetus for the founding of our Nation. Our political forefathers would not stand for the notion that Americans were mere pawns of a distant court, which could raid their purses and pocketbooks at any whim. America was founded not on concepts that divide peoples, such as race, or geography, but on the American Idea that brings us all together: the inalienable right to liberty. 
   From our Nation's very conception, this idea has served as a beacon for people of all creeds and colors seeking refuge from he heavy hand of meddlesome government. In America, the government serves the people, and must necessarily trust the people to do what is right by and for themselves. The government should not try to do it all. We provide a safety net for the least fortunate, those who cannot help themselves, but everyone else is trusted with the responsibility of providing for their own financial security. 
   And by all accounts, this combination of liberty for our citizens and restraint on the part of the public sector has, in fact, succeeded. By the end of the 19th Century, America was in the forefront of the Industrial Revolution. By the mid-20th Century, despite the MIRE of a worldwide depression, the United States was able to mobilize its industries and its men to rout one own of the twin evils of tyranny in the Second World 
   War. And by the close of this Century, we succeeded in defeating the other Soviet Communism, by the force of our will, the commitment of a strong Commander-in-Chief, Ronald Reagan, and the power of our competing idea of liberty. Our Nation is President Reagan's shining city on a hill, the economic envy of the world and the destination of all who yearn for freedom. 
   But this President and his supporters in the Congress just don't get it. The tax burden on our citizens is at an all time, peacetime high--20.6 percent of the economy. Meanwhile, the federal government will be overcharging the taxpayers by more than $3 trillion over the next 10 years. A Nation that trusted its people, that protected their liberty, would not flinch from the right thing to do: cut taxes so that our families can enjoy the fruits of their labors, instead of greedy Washington programs. This tax bill does just that, leaving $792 billion in the hands of the people to whom it belongs. 
   This tax cut is a measured, balanced response to the surpluses that will be flowing into the capital. It leaves 75% of the surpluses to be used to retire debt, and finance important priorities like Medicare and national defense. Every penny in the Social Security trust fund is left in a lockbox to be used to shore up the retirement security of our citizens. And the tax cuts are phased in over time, so the bulk of the cuts are in the last 3 years of the coming decade, when surpluses would otherwise skyrocket and tempt a government spending spree. 
   But voices are raised in opposition to the tax cut. It is said that the government cannot afford a tax cut of this size. But that is exactly backwards: our taxpayers cannot afford to continue to shoulder a record-high tax burden. Back in 1993, without the vote of a single Republican member of Congress, President Clinton pushed through a tax increase totaling $241 billion over 5 years. The rationale for this tax increase was the need to reduce our budget deficit. Well, the budget deficit is gone and we now have surpluses as far as the eye can see. The on-budget, non-Social Security surpluses will exceed $1 trillion over the next decade. We propose to let the American people keep $792 billion of these overpayments. Is that too much? 
   Not when you consider that the 5-year tax cut of $156 billion pales in comparison to the Clinton tax hike, imposed 
   on what was then a much smaller economy. According to my Joint Economic Committee staff, the 1993 Clinton tax increases will take some $900 billion from the American people over the next decade. Our tax cut of $792 billion does not even offset the lingering ill effects of that tax hike. Are we being too generous? Or have the taxpayers been too generous for too long? 
   It is hard to find fault with the specifics of our tax cut package. Is it right that we should double-tax business investments, so our innovators lack the resources for research and development? Is it wrong to extend the R&D tax credit, to liberate our scientists and engineers? Is it right that people should pay higher taxes just because they are married? Do we want people to build their own nest eggs for retirement security, or do we want to force everyone to rely exclusively on the Social Security system? 
   This tax relief package helps everyone. We make health and long-term care insurance fully deductible, and allow a dependent deduction for elderly family members. Education is more affordable through enhanced savings vehicles--IRAs and pre-paid tuition plans. Tax rates are lowered across-the-board. We eliminate the marriage penalty for taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket and repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax for individuals. 
   Most significant is what this tax relief does for our future. As we enter the 21st Century, America needs a tax policy that will facilitate, not smother, innovation and new technology. Our tax relief bill improves the environment for pioneers in new products and services. The R&D tax credit is extended for 5 years--the longest extension ever, so business can count on it. The R&D credit will continue to fuel innovation in new technologies, leading to health and safety breakthroughs, and enriching our quality of life. 
   Capital gains tax rates are also cut to their lowest levels in 58 years. Lower taxes on capital gains will help our entrepreneurs find the seed capital they need to launch new businesses, create new jobs and provide new products and services. And capital gains are indexed, eliminating the tax on phantom gains due to inflation--ending the government raid on the savings of long-term investors, particularly retirees. 
   We also eliminate the most unfair tax of all, the estate 
   and gift tax. No longer will business owners be discouraged from reinvesting their hard-earned profits because the specter of the federal death tax is hovering, waiting to swoop down and scoop up 55 percent of the increased value of the business. By eliminating the death tax, cutting the capital gains tax, and expanding IRAs, some of the largest barriers to capital formation are pulled down, and the result should be a rising tide of investment that carries our economy through the coming Century of Knowledge. 
   I want to commend Chairman ROTH, and all of the conferees, for producing a balanced, thorough, and fair tax cut that benefits all taxpayers. High taxes are an infringement on the liberty of our families, who should not be struggling to make ends meet while their Federal servants hoard the wealth our families have created. When the question comes down to whether we trust the Federal Government or the family to use money wisely, I choose the family every time. I urge my colleagues to do the same, to side with the people, not the bureaucracy, and vote for the conference report. 
   I yield the floor.

We had joined with the President in requesting slightly more than $100 million for land acquisition in Everglades National Park, state assistance grants, infrastructure investment, and modified water deliveries to the Park and Florida Bay. This funding is critical to keep the restoration effort on budget, on schedule, and consistent with the Congress' commitment in 1997 to fully fund Everglades restoration.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator MIKULSKI, Senator WELLSTONE, and Senator GRAMS, in sponsoring the Medicare's Elderly Receiving Innovative Treatments (MERIT) Act of 1999. 
   This legislation ensures that frail elderly persons residing in nursing homes continue to have the opportunity for improved quality of care and better health outcomes provided by the EverCare program. This program is reimbursed by Medicare on a capitated fee basis to managed care organizations that deliver preventive and primary medical care geared to the special needs of this population. Care is given by nurse practitioner/physician primary care teams which also coordinate care when the patient is hospitalized. Ideally, as much care as possible is provided at the nursing home thus preventing the expense of hospitalization. A major goal is to maintain stability in the patients' life by caring for them in their place of residence. The typical patient is over 85, 82 percent are female, 75 percent are on Medicaid and 70 percent have dementia. 
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) requires the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to establish a new risk-adjusted methodology for payments to health plans which is to go into effect on January 1, 2000. An interim risk adjusted payment will be based on inpatient hospital encounter data. However, an unintended consequence of this methodology may be a dramatic drop in EverCare payments by more than 40 percent, according to Long Term Care Data Institute study. This would jeopardize the program, which is currently comprised of demonstration and non-demonstration components, since providers could not afford to remain in business. HCFA recognized the possibly of this and did grant an exemption from the interim methodology for one year, 2000-2001. HCFA, however, has not yet presented a methodology that would be fair and adequate to ensure the continuance of EverCare. 
   This legislation exempts programs serving the frail elderly living in nursing homes from the phased in risk-adjustment payment methodology and continues payments using the current system. It directs HCFA to develop a distinct payment methodology which meets the needs of these patients and to establish performance measurement standards. It also allows the frail elderly to join EverCare on a continual basis without regard to enrollment periods.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the amendment before us today by the Senator from Mississippi. While I know my friends who support this amendment have the best of intentions in offering the agricultural relief package, I must say I am concerned with the direction of this debate. 
   We find ourselves today, Mr. President, in an increasingly familiar place. Once again, there is a crisis in farm country and the Congress is called on to construct a comprehensive package of relief and support. The amendment before us would spend more than $7 billion on--among other things--direct cash payments to farmers. This follows our efforts last year when we provided just short of $6 billion in emergency payments to America's farmers. Since 1988 emergency supplemental acts and farm disaster acts have amounted to approximately $17 billion in emergency supplemental funding for USDA programs. 
   Now I understand that much of this money was spent helping farmers who had suffered crop losses through drought, seasonal storms and other natural disasters. In fact, a portion of last year's emergency appropriations went to farmers who were harmed by weather conditions related to the El Nino phenomenon and other acts of God. 
   In other words, we were attempting to help farmers in previous years because times were bad. What concerns me about this effort today is that we are helping farmers because times are good. Increasingly in these relief bills we are seeing the bulk of support going in response to low commodity prices. In fact, much of the rhetoric we're hearing is going to the issue of declining farm income and the difficulty farmers in the heartland and elsewhere are having finding markets for their goods. 
   Today we're not addressing a crisis borne of declining productivity. It is not that America's farmer's aren't extremely good at what they do. Rather exactly the opposite. We are here because--stimulated by science and technology--farm productivity has persistently grown more rapidly than other sectors of the economy. More importantly, agricultural productivity has outstripped demand. And it leaves us faced with the one of the most basic economic functions: in the face of overwhelming supply and insufficient demand, prices will fall. 
   In nearly all sectors, this phenomenon is a quiet one. The ``unseen hand'' of the market in most cases allocates resources among the population and prevents market saturation. But in the farm sector, Congress is often asked to intervene in this process and all too often in the past, we have. For far too long, we have allowed politics rather than economics to allocate agricultural resources and determine business success or failure. As seen by the overwhelming failure this century of centrally planned economies across the globe, political allocation leads to economic stagnation and long-term failure. 
   It is for these reasons I fear our continued subsidization of the farm sector thwarts the free market process and will ultimately harm well-run farms by enabling continued market saturation. I understand the production of food is essential to the past and future of our country. I also recognize the instability and risk farmers face on a year to year basis and appreciate the need for occasional assistance. The New York Times, for example, contains an article yesterday discussing the drought disaster facing farmers in Maryland and West Virginia and the need for assistance in those areas. I do not discount the need for federal disaster relief. In Florida, Agriculture is a major part of our economy, and certainly there have been circumstances when we've called on Congress to assist us after hurricanes or winter freezes. These natural events warrant Congressional consideration and our best efforts. However, it seems our debate here is increasingly about politics rather than economics or weather-related disasters. 
   In 1996, the Congress passed a Farm Bill which provided farmers of our major export crops with direct payments to transition them off the old subsidy programs and onto the free market. These direct payments were supposed to diminish each year until 2002. Instead, we are here--for the second year in a row--considering legislation to increase these payments. Once again, Congress is using emergency payments to undo the 1996 Farm Bill and circumvent the free market. I hear my colleagues blaming the free market for price failures and I find this to be a somewhat misguided notion. In fact, the market is working all too well; the overcapacity in agriculture that was papered over by government price supports for generations is now in full view. And the results are evident in the low commodity prices we're seeing on the markets today. 
   I support the ideals and practices of family farming. I do not, however, support continually subsidizing businesses that fail. This is wasteful and destructive. By paying farmers who are unable to make profits in farming, you only delay their ultimate failure, and deter them from seeking other alternatives for income and employment. In addition, these farms that would otherwise fail still can produce crops that dilute the market and drive prices down, thereby creating a vicious cycle that we are seeing realized in this year's crisis in farm country. 
   This problem far outstrips any two-day debate on emergency cash payments for farmers. What we need, Mr.  President, is long-term structural solutions that solve the underlying problems of oversupply in the face of insufficient world demand. One major impediment to the movement of people out of the farming sector and into other areas of the economy is the punitive capital gains taxes owed by farmers who sell their land. I will be introducing legislation soon to repeal the capital gains tax on the sale of farmland. This will allow farmers to realize an additional dollar in five on the sale of their land. They can then use this money to help them in the transition to non-farm businesses or work. While I agree with my colleagues that we need solutions to the crisis in American agriculture, I submit we need solutions that solve the underlying economic problems rather than patchwork measures that do little more than treat the symptoms and defer the problem to another year and another Congress. 
   Mr. President, my opposition to this amendment is not based on a disdain or lack of appreciation for American agriculture. On the contrary, I believe it is a vital part of our economy and food security is clearly in our national interest. But the farming way of life is not served by government handout and bailouts of alarming size and regularity. Rather--like most other businesses--it is only preserved through sound business practices, hard work and an understanding of market fundamentals. Agriculture does not operate outside of the laws of supply and demand, and I urge my colleagues to carefully consider the long-term impact of continual subsidization on this important sector of the American economy. 
   I hope my colleagues will oppose this amendment and explore ways to help farmers who are facing natural disasters rather than price disasters. We cannot allow the short-term politics to deter us from the long-term effort to steer agriculture towards the free market. Nobody wants to see failure in America. Nobody wants to see families lose their farms. Nobody wants the agrarian way of life in America to fade from existence. For these very reasons, Congress has an obligation to stay the course and lay the free-market groundwork for a prosperous farm economy.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the amendment my colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, and I have offered on behalf of the Florida Center for Climate Prediction. 
   The Center is a consortium between the University of Florida, Florida State University and the University of Miami to study climate variability in the Southeast region. The objective of this unique partnership is to explore the potential value and practical application for long-term climate data and science to the agricultural community in my state and throughout the Southeast. 
   The consortium's purpose is to develop and evaluate a useful set of tools and methodologies for assessing the regional agricultural consequences of the El Nino/La Nina phenomenons and applying these forecasts to agricultural decision-making. This is a truly innovative project and I am pleased this partnership is making good progress on these important agricultural issues. 
   Our amendment will provide $300,000 in funding for the Center in the Federal administration section of the Cooperative State Research and Education, and extension Service [CSREES]--Research and Education Activities section of the bill before us today. I appreciate the support my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee provided this important research initiative.

   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chair. 
   First, I want to address a point that was made a few moments ago, an argument that went something like this: If we were to open up our markets, that action would, in essence, allow terrorists or countries to buy more food products. I just think that is fundamentally wrong. I think in fact they are buying all of the product that they can afford to buy now. And I would make the case that if they buy the product from us at a cheaper price because of it being subsidized, we are in fact subsidizing terrorist states. 
   So I just fundamentally disagree with where the proponents of this amendment are going.

   Mr. MACK. Again, I say to my colleague who has raised this question that I do find it strange that at just the time when Members are coming to the floor and asking the American taxpayer to come to the aid of the American farmer, they are at the same time asking us to lift sanctions to allow them to sell products to terrorist states. 
   I think, in fact, there is a connection between what is happening today--that is, some $6-$7 billion, depending on what this bill finally turns out to produce, $8-$9 billion in aid to American farmers, just after a few months ago with the additional aid to the American farmer--that you would find it appropriate to say to the American taxpayer: Now that you have given us this aid, we would like to have permission to sell our product to terrorist countries. I just find that unsupportable. 
   I thank the Senator for raising the question.

   Mr. MACK. It clearly is a subsidy to the American farmer. What kind of effect it will have on the world price I do not think I am qualified to say. But it seems to me it is clear that if in fact there is a subsidy being received by the American farmer, that farmer could sell the product at a lower price.  
   I thank the Senator for his question. 
   Mr. President, I oppose trade with tyrants and dictators, and I emphatically oppose subsidized trade with terrorist states. Again, make no mistake, that is exactly what this amendment does. Specifically, with my colleagues from Florida, New Jersey, and the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, we oppose the amendment to prevent any action by this body to limit the President of the United States' ability to impose sanctions on terrorist states. 
   We had a similar vote last year, in which 67 Senators voted to oppose trade with terrorists. At the risk of stating the obvious, let me try to explain once again why the Senate should not change this position. 
   Freedom is not free. I know my colleagues understand this simple axiom--this self-evident truth. But today we hear from our colleagues that the farmers of our Nation are undergoing a difficult time. So today, they have put before us a fundamental question: Does this great Nation, the United States of America, support freedom, or do we support terror? 
   A few weeks ago, as I was preparing a statement on another issue, I came across a letter from His Holiness, the Dalai Lama of Tibet. In this letter the Dalai Lama says, and I quote, ``America's real strength comes not from its status as a `superpower' but from the ideals and principles on which it was founded.'' 
   How may times have my colleagues been with me when a visiting head of state delivered to us the same message as the Dalai Lama's? I will provide one example. 
   Last summer, the President of Romania addressed a joint session of Congress. He began his remarks by reminding us that Romania considered the United States the country of freedom and the guardian of fundamental human rights all over the world. He went on to say:  
   Throughout its history, your country has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed and the needy, a source of inspiration for the creative, the courageous and the achieving. It has always been, and may it ever remain, the land of the free and the home of the brave.  
   We are a nation founded on principles--the principles of freedom, liberty, and the respect for human dignity. And our commitment to these principles gives us our real strength today. It is that simple. 
   I began this statement by posing a question on freedom versus terror. We know, even take for granted, the answer to that question--the United States opposes terror. But what about the strength or our commitment to these principles? On occasion, a short-term crisis can blind us--cause us to lose sight of our values and their importance to who we are and from where we derive our strength. 
   Today's debate typifies one such moment. The poster which has been shown on this floor indicates the issue before us with respect to terrorist nations and their leaders--Qadhafi, Castro, and others. 
   In exchange for very limited market expansion, some would take away the President's authority to restrict trade with six terrorist regimes--six countries whose combined markets represent a mere 1.7 percent of global agricultural imports; yet these minor importers perpetrate or harbor those who commit the world's greatest acts of terror. 
   Some would have us open trade in agricultural products with these terrorists--in effect placing our principles up for sale. So what is the strength of our commitment to these principles? If we are to choose freedom over terror, what price should we expect to pay? There can be no doubt in anyone's mind the value of our commitment to freedom certainly exceeds the U.S. share of 1.7 percent of the world's agriculture market. 
   But for those who may actually find this less clear than I do, it gets easier. The request by those who wish to trade with terrorists gets more extreme. With this amendment to language providing subsidies of U.S. agriculture, we are in effect being asked to subsidize global terrorism. The supporters of this amendment are asking the taxpayers of the United States to subsidize American farmers, who will then sell to terrorist states. 
   The United States must not subsidize terrorist regimes. I find it unconscionable that we would even consider such a proposal. When two countries engage in a trade, even if just one commodity is being exported, both countries benefit from the exchange. So by opening agriculture exports to Iran, Sudan, Cuba, Iraq, Libya, and North Korea, we are offering direct support to the regimes in power. If they chose to purchase from the United States, they would be doing so because they see it as being in their best interest. Their benefit would be greater in this case because the products sold to terrorists would be subsidized by the U.S. taxpayer. 
   Terrorism poses a direct threat to the United States. The terrorist threat was considerable during the cold war when the Soviet Union and its allies often backed movements or governments that justified the use of terror. The threat is even greater today, when chemical or biological weapons, no bigger than a suitcase, can bring death and devastation to tens of thousands of people. 
   The deaths in the World Trade Center bombing or in Pan Am 103 remind of us what terrorism can produce. Another important reminder is the image of American humanitarian aircraft being blown out of the sky by Cuban Air Force MiG fighters in the Florida Straits. We are moving from a world where terrorists use dynamite or rifles to one where they may use a weapon of mass destruction. The world today is more dangerous in many ways than it was 10 years ago, and the form of that danger is terrorism, which makes it even more dangerous for the United States to engage in trade with terrorist states. 
   So where does this leave us? With this simple principle--the United States must not trade with any nation that supports terrorism in any way, direct or indirect. We must insist that there can be no business-as-usual approach to nations that threaten our national security and national interests. We are well aware of the counterarguments. If we don't sell, some other country will, so what is the point? Or why not sell food? You can't turn wheat into a bomb, can you? Well, maybe not, but it is possible for a government that supports terror to use our food exports to win popular support, and it is possible to use the money saved by purchasing subsidized American goods for yet more terror. 
   We can all agree that the United States must stand for freedom and against terror, and I hope the strength of our commitment to this principled stand runs deep. Today we are being asked how deeply are we committed to opposing terrorism. Make no mistake, our principles provide the real source of America's strength. If we are serious about battling terrorism, there can be no compromise with terror and no trade with terrorist nations. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the Teacher Empowerment Act, which is legislation introduced by my friend and colleague Senator GREGG. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, which responds to several critical needs facing American education. In particular, it addresses teacher quality and quantity. It addresses local control of educating our children. It requires accountability to parents and students. In short, it is a plan to ensure that every child in America is prepared for global competition in the 21st Century. 
   The Teacher Empowerment Act recognizes the expertise of our state and local governments in educating our children. American parents trust their teachers and principals to make appropriate educational decisions for their children. In reality, Washington bureaucrats have called the shots for far too long. The results indicate that in lieu of achievement, we now have reams of paperwork and a myriad of programs to address local problems at the national level. We can and must do better. 
   The Teacher Empowerment Act puts decision making authority back into the hands of local schools. It encourages states to implement innovative teacher reforms and high quality professional development programs to increase teacher knowledge and student achievement. Local schools would be encouraged to fund innovative programs such as teacher testing--a concept which I have strongly supported and which this body supported last year in a bipartisan vote--as well as tenure reform, merit-based pay, alternative routes to teacher certification, differential and bonus pay for teachers in high need subject areas, teacher mentoring, and in-service teacher academies. 
   Our children are counting on us to ensure that they receive an education second to none. That starts with exceptional teachers and schools that are  able to address the individual needs of its students. This bill returns to local schools the ability and authority to accomplish these goals. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to talk a few minutes about one particular provision in the tax bill we are debating, the extension of the Research & Development tax credit. Last week the Finance Committee took an historic step, and reported a bill which would have made the R&D tax credit a permanent feature of our tax code. Yesterday, unfortunately, every single member of the minority voted to sunset the provisions of the tax bill, so instead of a permanent R&D tax credit, we have a ten-year extension. 
   Though the actions of our colleagues across the aisle prevented us from having a permanent R&D tax credit, I am pleased that the on-again, off-again nature of the credit will not undermine America's innovators for the next decade. I have long supported federal policies to increase the nation's R&D investment because of the central importance of scientific research to the health and well-being of our people, its positive contribution to our economic growth and our higher standard of living, and the improvements which add to our quality of life. 
   Both business and government play important and complementary roles in making sure that America continues to lead the world in research and innovation. The federal role in R&D is focused on investment in long-term basic research. I will continue to do my best to increase federal R&D spending on basic research, particularly on biomedical research which leads to huge benefits to all Americans. 
   Today, private industry plays the largest role in the nation's research effort, funding 65% of all R&D. Industry's role makes it clear ..... that if overall R&D is to increase, we must pursue policies which create a good business climate for firms to pursue long-term increases in their R&D budgets. We want America's leading-edge companies to hire new scientists, invest in new technologies and new research facilities--and the R&D tax credit provides that crucial incentive. 
   To see the benefits of R&D, look no further than America's economic performance today. We are in the eighth consecutive year of non-inflationary growth, and technology industries deserve a large share of the credit. In fact, high-tech industries have accounted for about one-third of real GDP growth in recent years. 
   Advancements from R&D lead to a huge number of improvements to our quality of life. The most dramatic impact of R&D on our quality of life is evident in biomedical research and health care. Here are some examples of the payoff to medical R&D: 
   It used to be that patients with kidney failure had to undergo frequent transfusions, which are expensive, carry substantial risks, and leave many patients anemic. Many kidney patients had to cut back on work or quit their jobs, or go on public assistance. Through extensive R&D, one of America's top biotech companies created a new drug that allows the body to create red blood cells again and enables people to restore their energy. In the past decade, this drug has helped millions to remain productive. It has reduced transfusions in the United States by nearly one-fifth, and fewer people have contracted blood-born disease. 
   Another example of the real-life benefits from R&D is the new class of drugs, developed in the late 1980s, which are giving millions of people who suffer from depression a new lease on life. Because of these new depression drugs, the cost of treating depression in the United States has plummeted--expensive psychiatric care and in-patient stays, which many could not afford, are now disappearing in favor of these new treatments. 
   There are two telecommunications companies which invested in R&D to create new technologies to bring state-of-the-art medicine to previously underserved and remote locations. These new technologies allow transfer of high-resolution photographs, radiological images, sounds, and medical records from leading medical centers to physicians and patients in remote locations. 
   These are just a few of hundreds of great success stories coming out of America's medical research labs--successes coming from companies responding to the R&D tax credit incentive. These examples make clear that R&D is not simply a dollars and cents issue. Federal R&D policy makes improvements to the quality of life across-the-board for all Americans. 
   The R&D tax credit has proven its effectiveness. Numerous studies during the past decade have found that each dollar of tax credits generates between $1 and $2 of additional R&D. Therefore, taxpayers are getting a solid return on their investment in terms of greater economic growth, a higher standard of living, and in numerous cases--a longer and healthier life span. 
   As chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, last month, along with Senator BENNETT, I hosted a high-tech summit which brought together business leaders from all across the high technology industries. One issue everyone seemed to agree on was that a permanent R&D tax credit would advance the development of new technologies, leading to breakthroughs which benefit the environment, increase transportation safety, treat serious illnesses and save lives. And on top of all this, a Coopers & Lybrand study found that a permanent extension to the credit would raise American incomes due to higher productivity growth and contribute substantially to our economic growth. 
   The R&D tax credit has proven its worth many times over. Mr. President, though I am pleased we have extended R&D for 10 years, it is my hope that the R&D tax credit will one day be a permanent fixture in our Tax Code so it can spur innovation and economic growth throughout the next millennium.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleagues, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. HELMS and Mr. ROBB, in sponsoring the Medicare Return to Home Act of 1999. 
   This legislation will ensure that senior citizens enrolled in Medicare+Choice health plans who normally reside in continuing care retirement communities or nursing homes have the opportunity to return to the same facility after a period of hospitalization. Many of the retirement communities contain fully licensed facilities established to provide skilled nursing services to their residents when required them. Often, people choose a continuing care retirement community because of the different levels of care that will be available to them as they age in that community. These living arrangements allow couples and individuals to maintain their independence by having the ability to move in and out of various levels of care according to their needs over time. People who are fully independent when they move into a residential community often require assisted living, skilled nursing care or some other assistance over the course of their lifetime in residence. 
   An increasing number of seniors have chosen Medicare+Choice plans as the way that they wish to receive health care services under Medicare. These plans reduce the potential for substantial out-of-pocket costs for the very sick which might be the experience with the traditional original Medicare plan. 
   One unfortunate consequence of the Medicare+Choice option involves the inability of seniors to return to their chosen community or nursing home where they resided following a period of hospitalization. Some Medicare+Choice plans will only permit patients to be discharged from the hospital to a facility with which the Medicare+Choice plan has a contract. Then, patients cannot return to the residential community that they selected, which may have been chosen because it included a skilled nursing facility. Nor can they return to the nursing home in which they had previously resided. This can be traumatic for frail elderly patients and may contribute to their disorientation and impede their recovery. It places them in an unfamiliar setting away from home, possibly separating them from a spouse and friends. Staff at their chosen retirement community or nursing home may also be familiar with their individual needs and habits which could only assist in their return to wellness. It makes little sense for them to be sent elsewhere upon discharge from a hospital. 
   Passage of this legislation ensures the ability of Medicare+Choice beneficiaries to return to the residential home facility of their choice or nursing home in which they previously resided following hospitalization under the following conditions: 
   1. The enrollee chooses to return to the residential community facility where they had been living. 
   2. The facility is licensed and qualified under state and federal law to provide the required services. 
   3. The residential community or nursing home agrees to accept the managed care plan's payment which must be similar to the payment made to contracted facilities. 
   This legislation provides for continuity in the lives of the elderly following a period of hospitalization. It does not increase costs to Medicare+Choice plans or to beneficiaries. 
   It allows people to return to their loved ones in the facility where they have chosen to live.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, although I agree with many of the specific provisions in the Democrat alternative tax package--including a few bills that I have introduced--I must rise in opposition to this amendment. The plain fact is that the tax cut offered is just too small. We have budget instructions to cut taxes by $792 billion over the next 10 years, and we should cut taxes by $792 billion. 
   I am glad I have this opportunity to talk about tax cuts, one of my favorite subjects. 
   We are in the midst of what should be a very easy task: reducing the tax burden on our citizens by $792 billion over the next ten years. After all, over the next decade, the federal government is on track to collect over $3 trillion dollars more than we have budgeted for spending. 
   In other words, we will be overcharging the taxpayers by $3 trillion. You would think that the suggestion to return to the taxpayers a mere 25 percent of these overpayments would not be controversial. But we have heard, over the past few months, the defenders of the status quo, the advocates of big government, raise their voices in criticism of our tax cut goal. 
   These critics say that tax cuts are not needed, that taxpayers do not deserve to keep more of their hard earned money. It has even been suggested that the tax burden on our families has been falling. Well, the facts could not be any clearer: the federal government will tax away 20.6 percent of our nation's gross domestic product this year. That is an all-time, peacetime record, a level that was only exceeded when we mobilized to win World War II. 
   But even though the tax burden is a record high, even though we will be overcharging the taxpayers by $3 trillion over the next decade, every excuse under the sun is being raised against tax cuts. Some of these arguments are contradictory, and all are wrong. 
   Some argue, from a Keynesian demand-side perspective, that tax cuts will overstimulate the economy. But even after a $792 billion tax cut, the federal government will run up over $2 trillion in surpluses over the next ten years--from a Keynesian viewpoint, $2 trillion in surpluses is not considered a stimulus. And with all of the lags, the delays, and the phase-ins, the bulk of the tax cuts will not arrive until years 2007, 2008, and 2009. 
   Can anyone seriously suggest that, in a $9 trillion economy, a $4 billion net tax cut for fiscal year 2000 will overstimulate consumer demand? Or even a $25 billion tax cut in 2001? Would a $39 billion tax cut in 2002 overheat the economy, when this is only .004 percent of projected GDP?  
   Clearly, the facts do not support the argument that our tax cuts will overheat the economy. In any event, from the demand-side perspective, the tax cut would be irrelevant. If we do not cut taxes by $792 billion, it is safe to say that spending will increase by $792 billion over the next decade--spending by the government, that is. That is what President Clinton means when he says we cannot afford a tax cut--his bureaucrats are working overtime to dream up new ways to spend the money, as if the government has first claims to the fruits of our citizens' labor. 
   What kind of spending initiatives can we expect? A few years back, as many of us recall, President Clinton's so-called stimulus package included spending on such urgent needs as building parking garages at the beach, resurfacing tennis courts, researching the sicklefin chub fish, renovating swimming pools, building golf courses, soccer fields, and softball diamonds, and constructing an ice skating warming hut. 
   Now, the President is not the only source of such wasteful spending ideas--we in Congress are very susceptible to pressures to spend, spend, spend. But no one here doubts for a minute that if the $792 billion in taxes are instead brought to Washington, the money will all be spent. That is one very good reason why we must keep the money out of Washington in the first place. 
   The argument is also raised that a $792 billion tax cut leaves no money to meet some other important government goals such as debt reduction. But we still have $1.9 trillion in social security surpluses that will be in a ``lock-box'' to retire debt and shore up our citizens' retirement security, and another $505 billion in non-social security surpluses that can be used for Medicare, National Defense, and our other priorities. It is my hope that these surpluses will be used for real priorities, not the ice skating warming huts and beach parking garages. It should be clear that this half-trillion dollars is more than enough to cover our priorities. 
   The rest of the arguments against our tax relief goal are similarly mistaken. Some people argue that the money is needed to retire publicly-held debt--although, after the tax cut, the remaining 75% of the surplus is available for debt reduction. Even with our tax cut, publicly-held national debt will be reduced from 40% of GDP to just 12% of GDP by 2009. 
   Other people argue that the Federal Reserve Board would react to the tax cut by tightening the money supply. I have already noted that the very small size of the tax cuts over the next two years--just .0015% of GDP--does not add up to a dramatic increase in consumer demand and, in fact, will not increase demand since government spending would have increased by that same amount were we to collect the taxes. And I will point out that, on many occasion, including today, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has stated that he believes that government spending is the worst possible use of the surpluses, and that he would support tax cuts if spending is the alternative. Furthermore, a tax cut that removes government barriers to savings and investment is not an ``artificial stimulus'' that should worry the Fed one bit. Inflation, after all, is caused by too many dollars chasing too few goods, not by too many investors creating wealth and opportunity. An even stronger economy, fueled by the freedom and enthusiasm of our entrepreneurs, is not something to fear. 
   It is even argued that a sizable tax cut passed now makes a future economic downturn more hazardous, as if the tax cuts needed for an economic rebound will have already been wasted by our efforts this year. Of course, that argument makes the case for tax cuts, as any tax cuts that would succeed in getting us out of a recession should keep us out of one in the first place. That is why former Fed Governor Lawrence Lindsey considers a tax cut a good insurance policy against an economic downturn. 
   When you consider all of the arguments, there really is no case against cutting taxes by at least $792 billion. Chairman ROTH is to be commended for sticking to his guns and reporting out of Committee a bill that cuts taxes by that full amount, despite all of the pressure exerted by all of the advocates of big government, who would rather spend the money. 
   One final point I want to make is that these abstract discussions tend to obscure the real reason we are here. Tax cuts are not about numbers, they aren't about aggregate statistics, they aren't about increasing demand by 4 thousandths of a percentage point--tax cuts are about people. We are cutting taxes because of the 67-year-old owner of a family business in Florida's panhandle, who is discouraged from reinvesting his hard-earned profits because the specter of the federal death tax is hovering, waiting to swoop down and scoop up 55% of the increased value of his business. We are cutting taxes because of the two-earner family, struggling to make ends meet, that has to pay over $1,000 extra in taxes just because they are married. 
   We are cutting taxes so that waitresses, truck drivers, teachers and carpenters can put an extra $1,000 in their IRAs each year, to build a better nest egg for retirement. We are cutting taxes to enable a biomedical company to budget that one additional research project that just might lead to a breakthrough in the treatment of glaucoma or a cure for cancer. And we are cutting taxes to reduce government barriers to saving and investment, so the capital is available for the American entrepreneurs of the 21st Century to develop markets in technologies we cannot even imagine today. We need to cut taxes to get government out of the way and give people the freedom to pursue their own dream--not Washington's. 
   I thank the Chair. 
   I yield whatever time I did not use.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, on this occasion of the almost annual debate on NED, the National Endowment for Democracy, we can and we must declare our commitment to promoting freedom in the world. 
   Freedom often exacts a price--it indeed is not free. Ronald Reagan understood this when he created NED, as have successive Presidents and Congresses who have consistently funded NED. 
   Freedom is sacred. It is to be honored, protected, and shared with the world. It is the core of all human progress, and therefore, the spread of freedom enriches us all. 
   But let us not forget, the price of freedom can be great. Just as we focus in this body these days on our abundance we must not forget those who have come before us; we must not forget in whose shoes we are walking. How many Americans have died; have put their lives on the line in the glorious pursuit of that sweetest of goals--emancipation from oppression and tyranny. We are the direct benefactors of the dedication, selflessness, and even the spilled blood, of countless people.  
   Should we be proud of those achievements? Of course, but we must also accept the weight--the responsibility--of this gift. The awesome responsibility which we have inherited. Because, when I said that freedom is not free, I was not only speaking of the cost to those currently suffering in the world to throw off the yoke of tyranny, but also the price to us, the benefactors of past actions. 
   We are once again on the floor of the Senate to defend the National Endowment for Democracy. The last time we fought this battle, 2 years ago, 72 Senators voted to restore the funding to NED after the subcommittee zeroed the account. We are here today facing the same circumstances. The good news with the regularity of this debate, if we look for the bright side, is that we know very well of the strong support in the Senate for NED. And let me explain why. 
   The history is important. In 1983, Ronald Reagan outlined an initiative for the United States to publicly lead the struggle for freedom around the world. A policy which I remember well as a young House Member and in many ways continues to influence my thinking about American foreign policy. A fundamental pillar of that policy was the National Endowment for Democracy. 
   Let me read to you from a letter by President Reagan, from July 4, 1993.  
   On this 217th anniversary of our nation's independence, I am reminded that America's greatness lies not only in our success at home, but in the example of leadership that we provide the entire world. 
   Our work, however, is not complete. As I look abroad, I see that the struggle between freedom and tyranny continues to be wages. Disappointly, in some places, it is autocracy, not freedom, that is winning the day. That is why I strongly support continued Congressional funding for the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Ten years ago, at Westminster, you will recall that I outlined a new, bold initiative for our country to publicly lead the struggle for freedom abroad. As past of this effort, at my request, the National Endowment for Democracy was created.  
   Mr. President, let me point out a few fundamental things. First, NED is not a ``cold war relic,'' as some critics argue. You will note that President Reagan did not say that the purpose was to defeat communism, to defeat the Soviet Union, or to contain any particular ideology. He said that the mission of NED was to support America's efforts to ``lead the struggle for freedom.'' You should also note that the letter from which I read is dated July 4, 1993--2 years after the fall of the Soviet Union. So let me be clear: NED is not about the cold war and has never been exclusively about fighting communism or the Soviet Union. The National Endowment for Democracy is about freedom. 
   My second point is that the need for NED is as great today as it has ever been. 
   We opposed communism because the flawed ideology oppresses people and empowers tyrants. Communism has almost disappeared as a threat today; but tyranny has not--oppression has not. Indeed, tyranny and oppression continue to rule in far too many places around the globe. If you accept that we were right in the past to oppose freedom's foes, then we have the same task today, perhaps even more complicated than in the past. 
   This vote, therefore, comes down to a simple issue: does the struggle for freedom continue in the world and does the United States continue to have a role in the struggle for freedom abroad? Does tyranny still reign in far too many places on earth? The answer is quite obviously, ``yes.'' 
   Let me address some critical questions others have raised. 
   Does NED work? NED works extremely well by providing resources to the freedom-activists throughout the world. NED identifies people struggling for economic, political, labor, press, and other reforms and gets them the resources necessary to fight against local oppression. 
   His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet says the following about NED:  
   The National Endowment for Democracy furthers the goals of your great nation and has provided moral and substantive support for oppressed peoples everywhere. Its unique independent mission has brought information and hope to people committed to peace and freedom, including the Tibetans. I sincerely hope that this institution will continue to receive support, because America's real strength comes not from its status as a `superpower' but from the ideals and principles on which it was founded.  
   So the final question which someone may rightly put to this debate: why not the State Department? Isn't NED redundant? 
   To answer this question, I defer to some experts who understand the executive branch and State Department well. I turn to a bipartisan group of former Secretaries of State and National Security Advisors. 
   In a 1995 letter, former National Security Advisors Allen, Carlucci, Brzezinski, and Scowcroft state that NED:  
   ..... operates in situations where direct government involvement is not appropriate. It is an exceptionally effective instrument in today's climate for reaching dedicated groups seeking to counter extreme nationalist and autocratic forces that are responsible for so much conflict and instability.  
   Let me emphasize that these National Security Advisors state that NED is operating where the U.S. government cannot. 
   I also have a letter from former Secretaries of State, including Secretaries Baker, Muskie, Eagleburger, Shultz, Haig, Vance, and Kissinger. This distinguished group states the following:  
   During this period of international change and uncertainty, the work of NED continues to be an important bipartisan but non-governmental contributor to democratic reform and freedom. We consider the non-governmental character of the NED even more relevant today than it was at NED's founding.  
   Let me review the main arguments. First, NED's necessity did not end with the cold war, but remains an integral part of America's opposition to the enemies of freedom. Second, the world continues to need America's invaluable work in promoting freedom--perhaps even now more than ever. And finally, NED makes a unique contribution to America's initiative to ``lead the struggle for freedom abroad.''

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to engage the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee in a colloquy. First let me begin by thanking my friends for ensuring the committee report included $2 million under the National Ocean Service account to support scientific research and coral reef studies. It is my understanding this money is to be divided equally between the National Coral Reef Institute in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, and the University of Hawaii. This research is critical to our understanding of the factors at work in the degradation of reef ecosystems around the world and I appreciate all my colleagues did in Committee to support this effort. 
   I say to my colleagues, it is my understanding the Chairman's amendment contains additional funding for this account. Is it correct to say these funds are in addition to the $2 million currently provided by the Committee to the National Coral Reef Institute and the University of Hawaii?

   Mr. MACK. First, let me say I appreciate my friend from New Hampshire's hard work for the strong support he's given to the State of Florida in the bill before us today. But I would like to bring to the Chairman's attention an initiative undertaken by Florida's top three research universities: the University of Florida, Florida State University and the University of Miami. These three institutions came together to ensure their extensive capabilities in the areas of marine, atmosphere and climate prediction research were focused on the needs of the entire Southeast region. They have especially come together to study the El Nino phenomenon. Their effort has been recognized by NOAA and they have become one of the agency's first regional assessment centers. 
   My concern, Mr. President, is about the possibility that NOAA may reduce resources available to Florida and this valuable research initiative. Clearly, Florida and the Southeast region are significantly impacted by climatic developments. A strong and continued investment in Florida and the region--along with a balanced investment in the regional assessment centers--is essential. I would ask the support of the Committee to continue the base level funding of this important collaborative  effort. The institutions had been receiving approximately $500,000 per year through the Office of Global Programs, and I would like the Chairman's assurances that this level of funding should and will be continued during the next fiscal year.

   Mr. MACK. Yes. I know the chairman is aware of the Florida Congressional delegation's strong commitment to the restoration of the Everglades and Florida Bay. I have heard some concern, however, that internal reallocations within NOAA could result in at least a $1 million reduction in South Florida based Florida Bay activities. The administration asked for significant funding of the Everglades-Florida Bay initiative in both FY 99 and FY 2000 through the Coastal Ocean Science Program. But the concern I'm hearing from Florida indicates that NOAA may reallocate funds away from this initiative and toward other programs and purposes. I would like the Chairman to join me in stressing to the agency that funds in this bill currently allocated for critical Florida Bay initiatives not be depleted. I would like the Chairman to join me in working to ensure the NOAA contribution to the interagency program for Florida and adjacent coastal marine waters is continued at the current levels.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman of the subcommittee in a brief colloquy regarding Barry University in Miami Shores, Florida. Barry University has a strong history of addressing important Miami community issues like urbanization, ethnic diversity, community development and cultural understanding. Recently the University announced the planning of an Intercultural Community Center which is designed to promote necessary neighborhood and small business revitalization. The facility will provide conference space, meeting rooms, executive seminars and continuing education courses related to international business and commerce. 
   It is my understanding Barry University will be requesting an Economic Development Administration grant for this project from the Department of Commerce during the next fiscal year. I would appreciate the Chairman's support in recommending the Department of Commerce give strong consideration  to the merits of University's grant application.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President today I am pleased to join my colleague, Mr. BREAUX, in sponsoring The Medicare Home Health Beneficiary Equity and Payment Simplification Act of 1999. 
   This legislation sets forth a fully developed prospective payment system for Medicare home health benefits that can be implemented easily using currently available data and can be accurately monitored to prevent fraud and abuse. Most importantly, the bill restores access to covered services for the sickest, most frail Medicare beneficiaries while providing incentives for efficient treatment of all patients regardless of the acuity of their medical condition. 
   The bill provides for a simple four-category prospective payment system for home health services (similar to the four-category system which has been in place for hospice services since 1983) which is based on data from a 1997 study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation on characteristics of Medicare patients in need of covered home health services. The Kaiser Foundation study found that Medicare patients in need of home health services historically have fallen into one of the following categories: 
   1. Post-hospital, short stay beneficiaries 
   2. Medically stable, long-stay beneficiaries 
   3. Medically complex, long-stay beneficiaries 
   4. Medically unstable and complex, extremely high use beneficiaries 
   Beneficiaries who meet all eligibility and coverage requirements for Medicare will be assigned to the appropriate category by a physician who does not have a prohibited relationship with the home health agency as defined in the ``Stark II'' law. Beneficiaries who do not clearly fit in one of the four categories will be placed in the first, lowest rate category. 
   Payment rates for each of the categories is the average cost of treating patients in that category in 1994 as determined by the Kaiser Foundation study. Those rates are adjusted for wage variations in different parts of the country and updated by the home health market basket for each fiscal year. The Secretary of HHS is given the authority to provide additional payments to certain agencies that have higher costs due to reasons beyond their control. 
   The bill would eliminate the 15% cut in Medicare home health reimbursement which is scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 2000. The bill would also simplify the reimbursement system by making payments based on the location of the agency rather than the residence of the patient. The bill is inten ded to provide a ``fail safe'' prospective payment mechanism in the event that HCFA falls behind in its schedule to implement a prospective payment system by October 1, 2000 that can be administered efficiently and monitored effectively. 
   I urge my colleagues to join us in co-sponsoring this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak for just a moment to express my profound sympathy and condolences to our colleague and friend, Senator TED KENNEDY, and the members of the Kennedy family, and for the Bessette family, as well. 
   Although I know the pain of losing a loved one, I have little conception of the pain which Senator KENNEDY and his family are feeling with the multiple losses of family members at such early stages in their lives, and under such tragic conditions. 
   My heart is heavy with grief for the family, and my thoughts and prayers are with them. I can only pray that they realize and are comforted in some small manner by the love, affection, and support of the Members of this body, as well as people all across this nation, for whom the Kennedy family is a symbol of courage, achievement, and service to mankind.

   Mr. MACK. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator FRIST, Senator JEFFORDS, and Senator COLLINS, and others, as we offer this amendment to provide cancer patients with coverage of health insurance benefits when they participate in approved clinical trials. 
   Many health plans will not pay for the cost of routine patient care if patients want to participate in a clinical trial. As a result, beneficiaries with cancer are denied access to these trials of promising new therapies because these therapies are deemed ``experimental'' by most health plans and, therefore, not qualified for coverage. This means many cancer patients have two choices when they have exhausted all traditional therapies: either pay the cost of participating in a clinical trial themselves or go without additional treatment. 
   For all but the most wealthy patients, it is cost prohibitive to take part in a clinical trial. This amendment will help ensure that a patient's decision about whether or not to participate in a clinical trial is based upon science and not cost. 
   Clinical trials are one of the most effective ways of determining which treatments are beneficial. Yet cancer researchers have told me they have had difficulty enrolling the required number of patients to participate in the clinical trials they are conducting. Scientists have identified noncoverage by private insurers, as well as Medicare, as one of the primary reasons why patients do not participate in clinical trials. 
   For example, approximately 2 percent of cancer patients are participating in clinical trials. This amendment will help scientists recruit cancer patients who wish to participate in clinical trials by breaking down the financial barriers which may preclude most patients from participating. 
   Clinical trials are one of the most effective techniques for assessing the effectiveness of a scientific and medical intervention. Many of my Senate colleagues have joined with me in a bipartisan effort to double biomedical research funding through the National Institutes of Health. Last year, Congress appropriated $15.6 billion for NIH. This represented a $2 billion increase, the largest increase in NIH history. At a time when American researchers are making such tremendous progress in scientific areas such as cancer genetics and biology, it is essential that this knowledge be translated into new therapies through well-designed clinical trials. This amendment is a natural extension of the historic effort to double funding for medical research in our country. 
   When my brother, Michael, was diagnosed with cancer, there were only three basic forms of treatment--surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Today, scientists are revolutionizing the treatment of cancer by developing many new weapons to kill cancer, including gene therapy and immunotherapy. 
   On a personal note again, every time I get into these discussions, and every time I see the new efforts that are being pursued, and the successes that have been developed, I cannot help but think if Michael's melanoma had been discovered or if he had found the disease much later in his life, when these new procedures--gene therapy and immunotherapy were available--and if he had been able to participate in a clinical trial, which he attempted to do throughout his treatment many years ago, his life may have been saved. 
   This amendment will help scientists continue the unprecedented progress being made to find new methods of treatment. 
   Coverage of cancer clinical trials is a bipartisan issue. Earlier this year, for example, Senator ROCKEFELLER and I introduced legislation to provide for Medicare coverage of cancer clinical trials. I am pleased to say that 36 additional Senators, from both sides of the aisle, have cosponsored this legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important legislation during the 106th Congress. 
   The reason Senator ROCKEFELLER and I targeted our legislation to cancer is the same reason we have targeted this amendment to cancer today--there is a legitimate debate about what the true cost may be. Senator ROCKEFELLER and I believe the cost will be insignificant. And we have the studies to prove that. 
   However, there are legitimate concerns with respect to cost which have been raised. Both the amendment we offer today and the Rockefeller-Mack legislation, call for a study and report to Congress in 2005 on the cost implications of covering cancer clinical trials. 
   I support comprehensive coverage of clinical trials. But, at this time, we need more information before we go further. This amendment will help provide the information we need to make a better informed decision. 
   During markup of S. 326, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions considered an amendment offered by my friend and colleague, Senator DODD, to provide clinical trial coverage. 
   Since then, my colleagues and I have more thoroughly studied this amendment. We have examined what barriers exist that impede enrollment in clinical trials. We looked into the cost implications. We considered the best way to define the term ``routine patient costs.'' 
   Let me first highlight the many similarities in our amendment and the amendment which Senator DODD offered during committee consideration. 
   Our amendment requires plans to provide coverage of routine patient costs. I will get back to that term in a few minutes. 
   Our amendments ensures that health plans are not required to pay for costs of items and services that are reasonably expected to be paid for by the sponsors of a clinical trial. This includes tests or measurements conducted primarily for the purpose of a clinical trial. 
   Our amendment permits plans to require clinical trial participants to use in-network providers, if they are available. If coverage is provided by a nonparticipating provider, payment would be at the same rate the plan would pay for comparable services to a participating provider. 
   Our amendment is limited to those health plans over which Congress has sole and exclusive jurisdiction. 
   Our amendment is limited to only the highest-quality clinical trials. These include trials approved and funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Veterans Affairs,  and the Department of Defense. Only those trials which have undergone the rigors of peer-review will be considered. 
   Our legislation differs with Senator DODD's proposal in three ways. 
   The first difference is how to best define the term ``routine patient cost.'' In researching this issue, we have found that there is not a generally accepted definition of the term, ``routine patient cost'' associated with participation in a clinical trial. The Balanced Budget Act required the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study on the issue of cancer clinical trial coverage, including the definition of routine patient costs. This study is due in September, and it will likely help us to better define this highly technical term. There are other experts who have opinions on how to define the term ``routine patient cost.'' We believe it is best to leave this task to patients, employers, health plans and those with true expertise in the field of clinical trials. 
   It is essential to remember that protocols for clinical trials vary widely, and routine patient costs for clinical trials also vary. Scientific researchers have indicated that developing one standard for determining routine patient costs will be a daunting task. I don't believe Congress is best qualified to make this important scientific determination. 
   Therefore, our amendment provides for a negotiated rulemaking process to establish a time-limited committee charged with developing standards relating to the coverage of routine patient costs for patients participating in clinical trials. This way, organizations representing cancer patients, health care practitioners, hospitals, employers, manufacturers of drugs and medical devices, medical economists and others will be involved in the process of defining routine patient costs with respect to clinical trials. 
   By May, this committee is required to develop standards for routine patient costs for individuals who are participating in those trials. If the committee is unable to reach a consensus, then the Secretary must develop these standards and publish a rule by June 30, in the year 2000. In either case, coverage for these benefits would begin for plans beginning on, or after, January 1, 2001. 
   We believe that a negotiated rulemaking process is the best way for organizations representing all who are affected to collectively determine what costs should be considered in ``routine patient costs.'' These decisions will have a major effect of the cost of covering clinical trials. 
   I will just underscore that again. These decisions will have a major effect on the cost of covering clinical trials. 
   Under the Democratic bill, these organizations can only submit a comment to the Secretary, who has broad authority to determine what constitutes routine patient costs. However, those comments could be rejected out-of-hand by the Secretary. 
   By contrast, the negotiated rulemaking process ensures that all who have an interest in the outcome have a seat at the negotiating table to make the decision. We believe it is essential that cancer patients have an opportunity to be involved in establishing standards for routine patient costs, and a negotiated rulemaking procedure affords them that opportunity. 
   Second, as I mentioned earlier, our amendment differs from the Dodd amendment in that it is limited to cancer clinical trials. There are more clinical trials involving cancer than perhaps any other disease. This targeted approach will not only provide a needed benefit to a large patient population, but it will also provide significant information for the study and report called for in this amendment. 
   Finally, our amendment includes a study and report to Congress on the costs to health plans and any impact on health insurance premiums. Senator DODD's amendment did not include this study and report, which I believe is extremely important. Congress can then use this important information to determine if they wish to expand coverage for patients with other diseases. 
   Like most of my colleagues, I am very concerned about the ever-increasing costs of health insurance. According to the Congressional Budget Office, our amendment will result in an increase in health insurance premiums of less than one-tenth of one percent. The Dodd proposal would cost five times that amount. 
   I have met with thousands of cancer patients throughout Florida and the rest of the United States, patients desperately wanting to participate in clinical trials when traditional therapies are no longer beneficial. 
   Let me conclude my comments here today by relating an experience which puts a human face on why this issue is so important. 
   As my colleagues may know, I frequently visit the National Institutes of Health to meet with scientific reserchers so I may gain a better understanding of the many advances which are taking place to detect and treat cancer and other diseases. 
   Over the years, I have been fortunate to get to know Dr. Steven Rosenberg, a world-renowned scientist and oncologist who is an expert in the field of melanoma research and treatment. I first met Dr. Rosenberg after reading his book, ``The Transformed Cell.''

   Mr. MACK. Last year, I was meeting with Dr. Rosenberg to learn about a clinical trial he is conducting on a state-of-the art melanoma vaccine. During our conversation, Dr. Rosenberg mentioned that one of my constituents was at NCI participating in that clinical trial. I asked if I might meet him. Before we went to his hospital room at NCI, Dr. Rosenberg showed me photographs which had previously been taken. This patient had purple, bulbous melanoma lesions several inches in diameter down the side of his body. 
   Dr. Rosenberg introduced me to my constituent, and we engaged in casual conversation. 
   At one point I asked him how he was doing. To show me how he was doing, this brave man took off his hospital gown and showed me that these lesions of huge size on both his arm and his side were totally gone. That is why I think it is so important that we have this amendment included in the legislation, so that other cancer patients will have the same opportunity. 
   To conclude, what is this amendment really about? Most importantly, it is about giving patients fighting cancer the hope that an experimental therapy being tested in a well-designed clinical trial might save their lives. In addition to providing hope, it paves the way for new therapies that will, one day, not only provide hope, but a cure. It is about allowing cancer patients to make what may be the final major health care decision of their lives--whether to participate in a clinical trial. 
   Mr. President, I've met with many patients who were participating in clinical trials. To me, these patients are, in many ways, like America's astronauts. Later this month, we will celebrate the 30th anniversary of man's landing on the Moon. Like the astronauts of Apollo, clinical trial participants are pioneers. They are heroes, who are helping to push science and medicine into new frontiers. We must provide hope to these brave Americans. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am not sure I need 5 minutes. I could not help but listen very closely to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle with respect to the issue of clinical trials and the idea of targeting clinical trials to cancer. 
   One could draw the conclusion from what they had to say either they never heard of the idea of targeting clinical trials to cancer or there was some confusion. I remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have supported a clinical trial expansion of the Medicare program that is limited to only cancer --let me say that again. The clinical trial legislation that Senator ROCKEFELLER and I introduced earlier this year is limited to cancer only; just as this amendment is limited to cancer: Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator SARBANES, Senator JOHNSON, Senator  BINGAMAN, Senator KERRY, Senator LEAHY, Senator KERREY, Senator SCHUMER, Senator AKAKA, Senator MURRAY, Senator BREAUX, Senator MIKULSKI, Senator CONRAD, Senator WELLSTONE, Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator INOUYE, Senator GRAHAM, Senator HARKIN, Senator KENNEDY, Senator BOXER, Senator DURBIN, Senator ROBB, Senator BIDEN, Senator DODD, and Senator HOLLINGS. 
   I submit that one of the reasons we have this not only in this amendment but also in the Medicare approach is because there is truly a concern about what the true cost of clinical trials is. As I said in my earlier comment, Senator ROCKEFELLER and I happen to believe the cost is quite small. In fact, there are arguments out there that Medicare is already picking up the cost of those clinical trials. We have limited it to cancer because we, in fact, believe we can develop information that will allow us to expand it.

   Mr. MACK. If the Senator would wait. What I have found, as I have listened to this debate now for 4 days, is the term ``compartmentalization'' comes back into my mind: The ability on the other side of the aisle to think of one procedure, one amendment, one concept at a time, as if it has no influence or no effect on the cost of health care and what it might do to those individuals who could lose their health care coverage because of increased costs. It is very reasonable to ask the question: What does it cost; how do you define certain aspects of the clinical trial that is going to take place? 
   I will be glad to yield.

   Mr. MACK. First of all, the impression created that HMOs or most HMOs cover all clinical trials is inaccurate. 
   There is a second component to this thing. ERISA plans versus the plans that we have control over may be confusing the issue as well. 
   In addition, though, I think it is important to focus. Again, this discussion has come down to a discussion about cost. I happen to agree with the Senator from Connecticut about the data that we have from those two health organizations. But I think he knows as  well that there are those out there who make claims that the cost of the clinical trials would be substantially higher than that--from OMB, CBO, the administration. 
   So the point is that there is a legitimate debate about the cost of clinical trials. I am saying I think, before we go to the full extent of comprehensive coverage, we ought to fully understand what we are getting ourselves involved in. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator FRIST for yielding me time. I also appreciate greatly the comments made with respect to the clinical trials. Again, I look forward to continuing to work with him in the future on this issue. 
   Mr. President, I want to respond to one provision of the amendment offered last night by my friend from Connecticut, Senator DODD. This provision goes to a concern that has been raised by patients throughout our country--the issue of health coverage for patients who are participating in clinical trials. 
   As Members of the United States Senate, we must seek legislative solutions to a wide array of public policy issues. These issues include health policy, as we are doing today. They include tax policy, economic policy, foreign policy, and education policy. The list is quite expansive. Frequently, we find ourselves divided on issues of the day. 
   However, I can think of no issue which better unites Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, as the issue of biomedical research. 
   In addition to Senator DODD, we are fortunate to have many, many leaders in the Senate on this important issue. Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN are leading the historic bipartisan effort to double funding for the National Institutes of Health. Senator JEFFORDS, Senator FIRST, Senator KENNEDY, and Senator MIKULSKI have worked hard in their committee to authorize and oversee the activities of the HIH. Any many more of my colleagues have each contributed in their own way to help make funding for HIH the national priority it is today. As I said, few issues unite the Senate like medical research. 
   One of the highlights during my 17 years as a Member of the Senate and House of Representatives has been to meet the scientists who are revolutionizing the way man fights disease, and to improve our quality of life. It doesn't matter if they are a young bench scientist or a Nobel Laureate, their mission remains the same--to find ways to detect and treat diseases. Today, there is a level of commitment and enthusiasm to this monumental endeavor that I've never seen before. Today, researchers dare to use the word, ``cure.'' That wasn't the case very long ago. 
   As we work to make sure that scientists have the necessary resources to continue their remarkable progress, we must also address the ethical, legal and social implications of biomedical research. Science is moving faster than public policy can keep pace. It's as though science is on the Concorde, and Congress stalled at Kitty Hawk trying to get off the ground. 
   There are very difficult, complex scientific issues which require Congressional action, but these issues also require thoughtful and careful deliberation. For example, Congress has been working for many years to ensure that health plans do not discriminate against people because of their genetic information. As a cancer survivor, I know how important it is to have confidence in knowing that a genetic test will be used for information, not discrimination. I've been part of a bipartisan effort to resolve this issue, starting with legislation introduced by our former colleague, Senator Mark Hatfield. 
   Genetic nondiscrimination is a very complex issue with wide-ranging ramifications. There have been many questions to answer. Congress has struggled with how best to define medical and scientific terms. We have examined the impact of our actions on the cost and availability of health insurance. Frequently, we have determined that much more information was needed before deciding the best approach. 
   We have addressed the issue of genetic nondiscrimination with thoughtful deliberation, and I believe the Congress must take the same thoughtful, deliberative approach when it comes to coverage of clinical trials. 
   There are many questions to be answered. What are the cost implications? How will this new benefit impact the availability of health insurance? What impact will coverage of clinical trials have on health insurance premiums? How will it impact small business owners, who are struggling to provide health insurance for their employees? What is the best approach to defining medical and scientific terms, such as ``routine patient costs''?--becasue that definition will determine what the underlying costs of this effort will be. 
   These are very important questions, involving very complex issues, with very significant implications. 
   Mr. President, I support comprehensive coverage of clinical trials. But, as this time, we need more information before we go that far. 
   Later today, or tomorrow, I will be introducing an amendment, along with Senator FRIST, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator COLLINS, and others, which will help provide patients, scientists, lawmakers, employers, health plans and others with answers to the many questions associated with health insurance coverage for clinical trials. I will outline our approach at that time. 
   Mr. President, medical research is a bipartisan issue. We all agree that the basic scientific research funded by the National Institutes of Health must be translated into new forms of treatment through well-designed clinical trials. Earlier this year, Senator ROCKFELLER and I introduced legislation to provide Medicare coverage for cancer clinical trials. I am pleased to say that a bipartisan group of 36 Senators have cosponsored this bill. Senator SNOWE and others have introduced legislation to provide coverage through private health plans. We may approach the issue in different ways, but we all agree that the Senate must address the issue of clinical trial coverage, and we must do so now.  
   Mr. President, I look forward to discussing my amendment later in the debate. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, proponents of the quota legislation to be considered later today have spoken with vigor and passion regarding the ``injury'' that was suffered by domestic steel companies and the threat imports pose to the workers at those companies.  
   However, I am compelled to rise today to respond to many of the assertions raised regarding the steel industry specifically, and more generally I think it is important to speak to several other factors related to the bill. First, there are economic benefits all Americans enjoy as a result of lowering trade barriers; second, the harmful message a quota bill would send to our trading partners; and, third, the inappropriateness of Congress singling out a specific industry for special treatment. 
   The first point I would like to make is that the import surge is over. According to the Department of Commerce, imports have returned to their traditional levels. In fact, overall steel imports in the first 4 months of 1999 were below the ``pre-import'' surge level. Moreover, even with the import surge of 1998, U.S. steel producers reported profits of over $1 billion. 
   Furthermore, in reviewing data provided by the Steel Manufacturers Association, I was surprised to find that U.S. steel production has increased over the last 10 years. The 1998 steel output of 107.6 million tons was 10 percent greater than 1990 and the highest for any year since 1981. 
   Additionally, I was interested to discover that since 1987, imports as a percentage of domestic consumption have remained constant at around 20 percent. Again, according to this data, no ground has been lost despite protestations to the contrary. 
   Some have argued that the financial ill health of several specific companies such as Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Weirton Steel Corporation, Laclede Steel Company, Acme Metals Incorporated, and Geneva Steel Company are the direct result of last year's import surge. However, the fact is that many of the integrated steel mills have a history of declining financial health evident well in advance of the Asian crisis and the 1998 import surge. This is reflected in their stock performance which, without exception, shows a pronounced decline in the value of the stock over the last 5 years. Again, it has nothing to do with the surge in imports. 
   Noting the declining employment figures in the steel industry, proponents of the quota bill suggest that the United States is losing market share, but the fact is imports have not led to a decrease in market share. U.S. steel production in traditional integrated mills has remained fairly flat. Import competition has merely forced U.S. steel to become more efficient. The growth in domestic production that has allowed U.S. steel to retain its domestic share has been almost exclusively a result of our Nation's mini-mills which now account for almost 50 percent of domestic steel production. Mini-mills use an innovative production technique to recycle scrapped steel. These highly efficient and environmentally friendly producers are transforming the steel industry, and I think here it is worth noting that the association of mini-mills is neutral with regard to the proposed quota legislation. 
   Finally in this area, some argue our foreign competitors are playing by a different set of rules. 
   This is exactly what our current antidumping laws are intended to address. The steel industry has shown itself to be intimately familiar with and more than willing to take advantage of these laws. Even though steel accounts for only 5 percent of our imports, the industry has generated 46 percent of the unfair-trade complaints brought before the U.S. International Trade Commission during the last 2 decades. Our current laws provide appropriate protection for all industries. They should not be circumvented in order to provide extraordinary protection for a single industry. 
   All too often we hear complaints of lost jobs and invariably the blame is laid on trade. This allegation has gone unanswered for far too long. Trade has given us far more jobs than would otherwise be available. The fact is that the size of the trade sector has grown steadily during the last 50 years. As a share of the economy, trade doubled between 1950 and 1980, and it has doubled again between 1980 and 1998. Not surprisingly, employment has expanded from 99 million in 1980 to 133 million today. And, the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.2 percent, the lowest level in 30 years. 
   Far from harming our economy, trade has been a major contributing factor to our growth and our prosperity. Real GDP is now 64 percent greater than it was in 1980 and we have experienced only 9 months of recession during the last 16 years. Moreover, our growth rate is now the highest and our unemployment rate the lowest among the G-7 nations. 
   Trade makes it possible for us to focus on the production of the things we do best, and thereby produce a larger output and enjoy a higher standard of living. For goods and services that we produce cheaply, we can expand our output and sell abroad at attractive prices. And for things we do poorly, we can acquire them more economically from foreign producers. Thus, trade promotes prosperity. 
   We have fought for open markets both through GATT and now the WTO. And we have been engaged in this fight, this battle for almost 50 years. For some time, we have told the world that economic freedom and a market economy are key ingredients of prosperity. The steel quota bill undermines this message. 
   Let me make four points with respect to the message. 
   A quota bill would send the wrong message to the European Union. A quota bill would send the wrong message to the former Communist countries seeking to establish market economies. A quota bill would send the wrong message to investors. And a quota bill would send the wrong message to our trading partners. 
   Let me just touch lightly on each of those. 
   With respect to the European Union, 
   we are currently in the midst of a trade dispute with the EU regarding their restrictions on both bananas and beef. The steel quota bill undercuts our position on these issues. How can we complain about the restrictions of others while we ourselves are erecting trade barriers? 
   With respect to the leaders of the former communist countries, this bill says when we think it is convenient, it is all right to substitute political manipulation for markets. I can assure you, the leaders of the former communist countries are watching. If a prosperous America with a low unemployment rate is willing to bail out troubled firms, how can we expect them to refrain from such action. 
   With respect to investors, while much of the world has been in recession, investment flowed into the United States and the U.S. economy remained strong. In no small degree, this confidence of investors was due to the openness of our economy and our reliance on markets rather than politics. 
   Again, with respect to our trading partners, our trading partners--most of which have lower and slower rates of growth and higher unemployment--are unlikely to stand idly by while we impose trade barriers. Retaliation and escalation of trade barriers are likely side-effects. 
   Finally, it bears mentioning that it is a serious mistake for Congress to play favorites. This is precisely what is involved here. 
   This bill imposes a tax on steel-users in order to subsidize steel-producers. A substantial share of the U.S. steel industry refines raw steel into finished and specialty goods. The U.S. steel industry is therefore a major purchaser of imported steel. Higher steel prices which will surely accompany import quotas will increase the cost of refined steel and make these products less competitive than would otherwise be the case. 
   Moreover, this bill would treat the steel industry different than other industries. Steel is not the only industry that has been adversely affected by currency devaluations and weak demand due to the Asian crisis and recession in several parts of the world. The sales of many firms were affected as the result of these factors. Why should this industry be singled out for special treatment? 
   In conclusion, I want to stress that the legislation we will be considering later today proposes that the Congress intervene in the market, risk a trade war, and endanger the future health of our economy in order to insulate a segment of out steel industry from competition. I maintain there is already sufficient legislation on the books to protect industries against unfair competitive practices. Quotas and trade barriers are the wrong path. The world has already gone down this ``trade  war'' road once before with the Smoot-Hawley Law of 1930. Let's not make that same mistake again. 
   Additionally, I should note that Chairman Greenspan recently has sounded the dangers of protectionism. He now believes that rising protectionism is the single most dangerous threat to our future growth and prosperity. I share his concern. 
   Make no mistake about it--important principles are at stake here. We should be reducing trade barriers rather than increasing them. We have no business playing favorites. As our recent High-Tech Summit indicated, trade in both goods and ideas has made an enormous contribution to our prosperity. We must not allow this misguided effort to assist some at the expense of others and endanger American prosperity. 
   With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President. 
   Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. This bill was introduced by Senator JEFFORDS and co-sponsored by 77 members. The primary purpose of this legislation is to expand the availability of health care coverage under the Social Security Act for working individuals with disabilities. This bill establishes a Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program in the Social Security Administration to make available meaningful work opportunities for the disabled. 
   Some months ago, in Florida, I met a woman who does not have the use of her arms. This woman is an accomplished artist who uses her feet to create beautiful works of art. She spoke with me about the difficulty she has had over the years obtaining health insurance for routine medical care and asked me to support this bill. It is with her in mind and the many other talented, hard-working disabled Americans that I support this act which will make it possible for them to obtain health coverage and lead productive working lives. 
   This bill allows states to offer Medicaid coverage to workers with disabilities beyond what is currently available to them under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It creates two new optional eligibility categories and allows states to offer buy-ins for the working disabled so that they can maintain health care coverage, work, and have as much independence as their disability allows. One option permits states to offer a Medicaid buy-in to people with disabilities who work and have an earned income above 250% of poverty with specified levels for assets, resources and unearned income set by the state in which they reside. This is important to many of the disabled who have income or assets that exceed the current level and have an earned income that has exceeded $500 per month during the past year. The state can and should impose a sliding scale of cost-sharing of the premium, up to 100% of the premium, based on the income of the individual. This will allow many of the disabled who simply cannot get health insurance because they have income or assets above a certain level, to obtain health coverage. With the passage of this legislation, a person with disabilities who may be an artist, computer programmer or run a telephone answering service can now be successful at work and have no fear of being unable to obtain health coverage. 
   The second option allows states that elect to participate in the first option to also cover people who have a severe impairment but can lose eligibility for Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Insurance because of medical improvement. In certain cases, the only reason a person improves is because they receive medical treatment. This bill prevents a person from losing their health care coverage when their health improves due to medical treatment. The state can allow this type of person to buy into the state Medicaid program at a premium set by the state. This is a blessing to persons with disabling conditions which are amenable to treatment such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, depression, or sickle cell anemia. It allows people who can work to work and receive treatment for what may be a chronic disease and have no fear of losing their health coverage. 
   An additional benefit of this bill provides for the continuation of Medicare coverage for working individuals with disabilities. An extended period of eligibility will allow people who receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) to continue to receive Part A Medicare coverage without payment for up to six years after returning to work. At present, disabled people may receive Medicare coverage for nine months followed by 36 months of extended eligibility but after that, they have to pay the Part A premium in full. Often, people returning to work following a period of coverage by SSDI, work part time so they are ineligible for health insurance or they cannot obtain insurance through their employer or from the private market. This bill would permit them to receive Part A coverage and have coverage they could not otherwise obtain. 
   I join with my colleagues in support of this legislation to help the disabled help themselves.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to remedy a problem in the way the U.S. taxes the foreign operations of U.S. electric and gas utilities. With the 1992 passage of the National Energy Policy Act, Congress gave a green light to U.S. utilities wishing to do business abroad, lifting a long-standing prohibition. U.S. utilities were allowed to compete for the foreign business opportunities created by the privatization of national utilities and the need for the construction of facilities to meet increased energy demands abroad. 
   Since 1992, U.S. utility companies have made significant investments in utility operations in the United Kingdom, Australia, Eastern Europe, the Far East and South America. These investments in foreign utilities have created domestic jobs in the fields of design, architecture, engineering, construction, and heavy equipment manufacturing. They also allow U.S. utilities an opportunity to diversify and grow. 
   Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Code penalizes these investments by subjecting them to double-taxation. U.S. companies with foreign operations receive tax credits for a portion of the taxes they pay to foreign countries, to reduce the double-taxation that would otherwise result from the U.S. policy of taxing worldwide income. The size of these foreign tax credits are affected by a number of factors, as U.S. tax laws recalculate the amount of foreign income that is recognized for tax credit purposes. 
   Section 864 of the tax code allocates deductible interest expenses between the U.S. and foreign operations based on the relative book values of assets located in the U.S. and abroad. By ignoring business realities and the peculiar circumstances of U.S. utilities, this allocation rule overtaxes them. Because U.S. utilities were until recently prevented from operating abroad, their foreign plants and equipment have been recently-acquired and consequently have not been much depreciated, in contrast to their domestic assets which are in most cases fully-depreciated. Thus, a disproportionate amount of interest expenses are allocated to foreign income, reducing the foreign income base that is recognized for U.S. tax purposes thus the size of the corresponding foreign tax credits. 
   The allocation rules increase the double-taxation of foreign income by reducing foreign tax credits, thereby increasing domestic taxation. The unfairness of this result is magnified by the fact that the interest expenses--which are the reason the foreign tax credit shrinks--are usually associated with domestically-regulated debt, which is tied to domestic production and is not as fungible as the tax code assumes. 
   The result of this economically-irrational taxation scheme is a very high effective tax rate on certain foreign investment and a loss of U.S. foreign tax credits. Rather than face this double-tax penalty, some U.S. utilities have actually chosen not to invest overseas and others have pulled back from their initial investments. 
   One solution to this problem is found in the legislation that I am introducing today. This remedy is to exempt from the interest allocation rules of Section 864 the debt associated with a U.S. utility's furnishing and sale of electricity or natural gas in the United States. This proposed rule is similar to the rule governing ``non-recourse'' debt, which is not subjected to foreign allocation. In both cases, lenders look to specific cash flows for repayment and specific assets as collateral. These loans are thus distinguishable from the typical risks of general credit lending transactions. 
   The specific cash flow aspect of non-recourse financing is a critical element of the non-recourse debt exception, and logic requires that the same tax treatment should be given to analogous utility debt. Thus, my bill would exempt from allocation to foreign source income the interest on debt incurred in the trade or business of furnishing or selling electricity or natural gas in the United States. The current situation is a very real problem that must be remedied, and I urge my colleagues to support the solution I am proposing.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in support of additional funds to be made available for Air Force Research, Development, Test and Evaluation in the Fiscal Year 2000 Department of Defense Authorization measure to be used to complete development of a state-of-the-art 3 dimensional optical imaging and tracking instrumentation data system. 
   The 3 Data System is a laser radar system that provides high fidelity time, space, positioning information (TSPI) on test articles during flight. The instrumentation can be applied to air, ground, and sea targets. Additionally, it will provide the potential capability for over-the-horizon tracking from an airborne platform or pedestal mounted ground platform. It includes a multi-object tracking capability that will allow simultaneous tracking of up to 20 targets throughout their profile. The system will enable testing of advanced smart weapon systems; force-on-force exercises where multiple aircraft and ground vehicle tracking is involved; over water scoring of large footprint autonomous guided and unguided munitions; and enable an improvement to existing aging radar presently in service. It is mobile and can support testing at other major ranges and locations in support of other Service's requirements. 
   The Air Force has identified the 3-Data System as having high military value as it will enable the effective evaluation of the performance of advanced weapon systems to be utilized in future conflicts. The Air Force has informed me that precision engagement is one of the emerging operational concepts in Joint Vision 2010. The 3-Data system would provide a capability to effectively evaluate the performance of advanced precision guided munitions and smart weapons prior to their use in a wartime environment. It would also directly support ongoing activities abroad through Quick Reaction Tasking that may require a multiple object tracking device to evaluate engagement profiles. This requirement is documented through 46th Test Wing strategic planning initiatives, developmental program test plans, and munitions strategic planning roadmaps.  
   The Air Force is presently attempting to meet this requirement through existing radar systems and optical tracking systems which cannot track multiple objects to the fidelity levels required and which require extensive post-mission data reduction times. This system will provide the capability to effectively track multiple targets simultaneously. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Committee for their willingness to support this amendment. The 3-Data System will play a important role in enabling the Air Force to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of multiple smart weapons and their delivery systems during their develpoment.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Defense Jobs and Trade Promotion Act of 1999. This bill, cosponsored by Senator Feinstein and 16 of our colleagues, will eliminate a provision of tax law which discriminates against United States exporters of defense products. 
   Other nations have systems of taxation which rely less on corporate income taxes and more on value-added taxes. By rebating the value-added taxes for products that are exported, these nations lower the costs of their exports and provide their companies a competitive advantage that is not based on quality, ingenuity, or resources but rather on tax policy. 
   In an attempt to level the playing field, our tax code allows U.S. companies to establish Foreign Sales Corporations (FSCs) through which U.S.-manufactured products may be exported. A portion of the profits from FSC sales are exempted from corporate income taxes, to mitigate the advantage that other countries give their exporters through value-added tax rebates. 
   But the tax benefits of a FSC are cut in half for defense exporters. This 50% limitation is the result of a compromise enacted 23 years ago as part of  the predecessor to the FSC provisions. This compromise was not based on policy considerations, but instead merely split the difference between members who believed that the U.S. defense industry was so dominant in world markets that the foreign tax advantages were inconsequential, and members who believed that all U.S. exporters should be treated equally. 
   Today, U.S. defense manufacturers face intense competition from foreign businesses. With the sharp decline in the defense budget over the past decade, exports of defense products play a prominent role in maintaining a viable U.S. defense industrial base. It makes no sense to allow differences in international tax systems to stand as an obstacle to exports of U.S. defense products. We must level the international playing field for U.S. defense product manufacturers. 
   The fifty percent exclusion for sales of defense products makes even less sense when one considers that the sale of every defense product to a foreign government requires the determination of both the President and the Congress that the sale will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace. This is more than a matter of fair treatment for all U.S. exporters. National security is enhanced when our allies use U.S.-manufactured military equipment, because of its compatibility with equipment used by our armed forces. 
   The Department of Defense supports repeal of this provision. In an August 26, 1998 letter, Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre wrote Treasury Secretary Rubin about the FSC. Hamre wrote, ``The Department of Defense (DoD) supports extending the full benefits of the FSC exemption to defense exporters.*.*.*.[P]utting defense and non-defense companies on the same footing would encourage defense exports that would promote standardization and interoperability of equipment among our allies. It also could result in a decrease in the cost of defense products to the Department of Defense.'' 
   The bill we are introducing today supports the DoD recommendation. It repeals the provision of the Foreign Sales Corporation laws that discriminates against U.S. defense product manufacturers, enhancing both the competitiveness of U.S. companies in world markets and our national security.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator GRAHAM and I introduce legislation that would help protect Florida from economic devastation in the event of a catastrophic windstorm or other peril. 
   Our legislation would amend Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code to grant tax-exempt status to the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association (FWUA), the Florida Residential Property and Casualty Joint Underwriting Association (JUA) and similar state-chartered, not-for-profit insurers serving markets in which commercial insurance is not available. The FWUA and JUA are non-profit entities established by the state to provide property and casualty insurance coverage in those markets not adequately served by other insurers. 
   In most years, Florida is not hit by a major hurricane or natural catastrophe. In those years, the FWUA and JUA take in more premiums than are paid out in claims or expenses. Since these entities are not-for-profit, state law prevents those funds from being distributed--they are instead literally saved for a severely rainy or windy day. Nonetheless, the Internal Revenue Code requires 35% of those funds to be sent to Washington as federal income taxes rather than used to fund reserves. Designating the FWUA and JUA as tax-exempt will help Florida to accumulate the necessary reserves to pay claims brought on by a catastrophe. This bill gives the two Florida catastrophe funds the same tax-exempt status that is already enjoyed by a number of not-for-profit insurance provers. 
   State law authorizes the FWUA and the JUA to assess property insurance policyholders throughout Florida to pay for losses generated by catastrophic storms or other perils. Thus, the benefits of the tax exemption would reduce the frequency and severity of assessments levied against individual policyholders. Greater funds would be available to cover losses which otherwise would be paid for by higher assessments on Florida policyholders--cutting taxes for the approximately 5,000,000 property owners in the state of Florida. 
   This legislation has the bipartisan support of the entire Florida Congressional delegation in addition to strong backing from Governor Jeb Bush, the State Insurance Commissioner, the Florida Senate President and Florida's House Speaker. And this change in the tax code would result in only a negligible loss of federal tax revenue, according to Joint Tax. 
   Our legislation is extremely important to homeowners and businesses throughout the state of Florida, all of whom are subject to assessment if reserves are not sufficient to pay claims in the event of a severe hurricane or other catastrophe. With hundreds of miles of magnificent coastline, Florida remains sensitive to the perils of nature. Enactment of our legislation permits Florida to prepare for the next Hurricane Andrew while alleviating some of the economic hardship exacted on Florida property owners.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, two years ago in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, we included a provision to correct an unfair and unsound tax policy of the Clinton Administration concerning business meal deductions. The 1993 Clinton tax increases included a reduction in the percentage of business meal expenses that could be deducted, from 80 percent down to 50 percent. The Administration marketed this as an attack on the ``three martini lunch,'' but the tax increase was in fact a big blow to the wallets and pocketbooks of working class Americans whose jobs require them to be stranded far from home. 
   Workers who are covered by federal ``hours of service'' regulations--long-haul truckers, airline flight attendants and pilots, long distance bus drivers, some merchant mariners and railroad workers--have no choice but to eat their meals on the road. Their meal expenses are a necessary and unavoidable part of their jobs. The Clinton Administration's business meal tax increase hit these occupations hard. For the average trucker, making between $32,000 and $36,000 annually, this tax increase might be greater than $1,000 per year. This is a lot of money to these hard-working taxpayers. 
   Congress addressed this inequity in 1997, passing a provision that would gradually raise the meal deduction percentage back to 80 percent for these workers. But a slow, gradual fix is not good enough. Today, Senator KOHL, Senator GRASSLEY, and I are introducing a bill that would immediately restore the 80 percent deduction for truckers, flight crews, and other workers limited by the federal ``hours of service'' regulations.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator BOB GRAHAM and I, along with 17 of our colleagues, are introducing legislation to modernize the tax rules that apply to real estate investment trusts (``REITs''). 
   This legislation is designed to remove barriers in the tax laws that impose unnecessary administrative burdens and make it more difficult for REITs to compete in an evolving marketplace. Our bill is similar to a proposal included in the President's Fiscal Year 2000 budget that permits REITs to establish a new type of subsidiary called a ``taxable REIT subsidiary'' (``TRS''). As with the President's proposal, the legislation we introduce today would permit REITs to establish a TRS to provide non-customary services to their tenants and to provide services to third parties. In return for these new rules, the TRS would be subject to a number of rules designed to prevent any income from being shifted out of the taxable subsidiary to the REIT. 
   Congress created REITs in 1960 to enable small investors to invest in real estate. The REIT provisions were modeled after the rules that applied to mutual funds. If a number of requirements are met, a corporation electing to be a REIT may deduct all dividends paid to its shareholders. One of the major requirements for REIT status is that REITs must distribute virtually all of their taxable income to their shareholders. Thus, unlike other C corporations that tend to retain most of their earnings, the income tax burden for REITs is shifted to the shareholder level. Unlike partnerships, REITs cannot pass losses through to their investors. 
   REITs are subject to a number of rules to ensure their primary focus is real estate activities. For example, at least 75% of a REIT's assets must be comprised of rental real estate, mortgages, cash items and government securities. A REIT also must satisfy two income tests. First, at least 75% of a REIT's annual gross income must consist of real property rents, mortgage interest, gain from the sale of a real estate asset and certain other real estate-related sources. Second, at least 95% of a REIT's annual gross income must be derived from the income items from the above 75% test plus other ``passive income'' sources such as dividends and any type of interest. In addition, a REIT cannot own more than 10% of the voting securities of a non-REIT corporation, and the securities of a single non-REIT corporation cannot be worth more than 5% of the REIT's assets. 
   Although REITs were created in 1960, they did not really become a significant part of the real estate marketplace until the 1990s--partly because the original legislation did not permit REITs to manage their own property. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 changed this, by permitting REITs to manage their own properties through the provision of ``customary services'' to tenants. 
   The market capitalization of REITs grew from about $13 billion at the end of 1991 to over $140 billion today. The taxes generated from REITs similarly have increased, with dividends from public REITs increasing from about $1 billion in 1991 to more than $8 billion today. While REITs remain a small portion of the entire real estate sector--in the range of 10% nationally--they account for as much as half of some sectors that require immense amounts of capital, such as shopping centers. While the REIT industry has come a long way in recent years, it continues to fulfill its original mission: permitting small investors access to attractive real estate investments. Almost 90% of REIT shareholders are individuals either investing directly or through mutual funds. 
   Although REITs have seen remarkable growth in the 1990s, their ability to meet new competitive pressures in the real estate sector is in question as a result of tax law limitations on their activities. These rules limit the ability of REITs to provide full services to their tenants and to third parties. In general, REITs may only provide services to their tenants which the IRS has determined to be ``customary'' in the business, meaning services already provided by the typical real estate company in the market. REITs may only provide real estate-related services to third parties through preferred stock subsidiaries which they can own but not control. REITs are thus prohibited from offering leading edge, full service options to their tenants and limited in the use of their expertise to serve third parties. This presents competitive problems for REITs as the real estate marketplace has evolved and property owners have sought to provide a range of services to their tenants and other customers. 
   As a result, REITs increasingly have been unable to compete with privately-held partnerships and other more exclusive forms of ownership. Today, the rules prevent REITs from offering the same types of customer services as their competitors, even as such services are becoming more central to marketing efforts. Examples abound: (1) offering concierge services to office and apartment tenants to pick up tickets or dry cleaning, to walk pets, etc.; (2) offering a branded credit card at shopping malls, with rebates to be used as store credits at stores in the mall; (3) high speed Internet hook-ups, including enhanced telecommunications services (e.g., creating and maintaining a website) offered by a landlord's partner; (4) partnering with an office supply provider to offer reduced prices on office supplies; and (5) pick-up and delivery services at self-storage rentals. 
   Without greater flexibility to provide competitive services to tenants and other customers, REITs will become less and less competitive with others in the real estate marketplace. REITs will have to wait for services to be deemed ``customary.'' As a practical matter, that means a REIT must wait until the IRS concludes that almost everybody else has been providing the service. If a REIT is forced to lag the market, it can be neither competitive nor provide its investors with a satisfactory return on their investment. Certainly, this is not consistent with what Congress intended when it created REITs, and when it modified the REIT rules over the years. In keeping with the Congressional mandate to provide a sensible and effective way for the average investor to benefit from ownership of income-producing real estate, REITs should be able to provide a range of services through taxable subsidiaries. 
   The Administration's proposed Fiscal Year 2000 Budget acknowledges this problem. The Administration proposes modernizing REIT rules to permit REITs, on a limited basis, to use taxable subsidiaries to provide the services necessary to compete in the evolving real estate marketplace. The Administration proposal is a good start, but I believe additional refinements would further promote competitiveness. The legislation that we are introducing today builds upon the Administration proposal. Our bill addresses the  appropriate needs of the REIT industry and its investors in a manner consistent with the underlying rationale for REITs and the requirements of the highly competitive, evolving real estate marketplace. 
   This legislation would give greater flexibility to REITs by permitting them to establish ``taxable REIT subsidiaries'' (``TRSs'') that could provide non-customary services to tenants and services to third parties. The 5% and 10% asset tests would not apply to the TRS. REITs would continue to be subject to the 75% asset tests so the value of their TRS, together with the value of other non-real estate assets, could not exceed 25% of the total value of a REIT's assets. In addition, the REIT would have to continue to satisfy the 95% and 75% income tests, with dividends or interest from a TRS to a REIT counting towards the 95% test, but not the 75% test. Accordingly, at least 75% of a REIT's gross income would continue to consist of rents, mortgage interest, real estate capital gains and the other miscellaneous real estate-related items already listed in the Code. The income a TRS would receive from both third parties and REIT tenants would be fully subject to corporate tax. 
   To ensure that a TRS could not inappropriately reduce its corporate tax liability by shifting income to the REIT, the bill includes a number of stringent rules that limit the relationship between the REIT and the TRS. To prevent the TRS from making excessive intra-party interest payments to its affiliated REIT, the proposal contains two safeguards. One, it would apply the current anti-earnings stripping provisions of Code section 163(j) to payments between a REIT and its TRS. This would prevent the TRS from deducting intra-party interest beyond a modest amount regulated by objective criteria in the Code. Two, a 100% excise tax would be imposed on any interest payments by a TRS to its affiliated REIT to the extent the interest rate was above a commercially-reasonable rate. 
   Also, to be certain that a TRS could not reduce its tax obligations by deducting rents to its affiliated REIT, our legislation would retain the current rules under which any payments to a REIT by a related party would not be considered qualified rents for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. The only exception would be when a TRS rents less than 10% of a REIT-owned property and pays rents to the REIT comparable to the rents the REIT charges to its unrelated tenants at the same property. Under this exception, any rents paid to the REIT that turn out to be above comparable rents would be subject to a 100% excise tax. 
   Under our bill, a 100% excise tax is also imposed on any rents a REIT charges its tenants that are inflated to disguise charges for services rendered to the tenant by its affiliated TRS. Limited exceptions would be made when: (1) the TRS charges the same amounts for its services to both REIT tenants and third parties; (2) rents for comparable space are the same regardless of whether the TRS provides a service to the tenant; and (3) the TRS recognizes income for its services at least equal to 150% of its direct costs of providing the service to an affiliated REIT's tenants. 
   To discourage a REIT from allocating its expenses to its TRS (which would reduce the TRS's corporate tax obligation), the proposal would impose a 100% excise tax on any improper cost allocations between a REIT and its TRS. The Treasury Department would issue guidance on proper ways to allocate such costs. 
   Finally, the bill proposes to eliminate the use of preferred stock subsidiaries by REITs. These subsidiaries, which have been established pursuant to IRS letter rulings since 1988, allow a REIT to provide services to third parties. While the asset test rules prevent a REIT from owning more than 10% of the voting securities of these subsidiaries, they typically own more than 95% of the value of the subsidiary. We propose to eliminate these subsidiaries by prohibiting REITs from owning more than 10% of the vote or the value in another corporation other than a TRS. REITs would be given three years to convert, tax-free, their preferred stock subsidiaries to taxable REIT subsidiaries. 
   In addition, the bill includes some miscellaneous changes to the REIT rules that were under consideration when Congress approved a REIT simplification package a few years ago. The first provision deals with health care property. Under current law, a REIT can conduct a trade or business using property acquired through foreclosure for 90 days after it acquired such property, if it makes a ``foreclosure property'' election. After this period, the REIT can only conduct the trade or business through an independent contractor from whom the REIT does not derive any income. A health care REIT faces special challenges in using these rules when its lease of a nursing home or other health care property expires. 
   To remedy these challenges and to ensure that care to patients remains uninterrupted, the proposal would make two technical changes to the REIT foreclosure rules. First, the foreclosure property rules would be extended to include leases that terminate (they already apply to leases that are breached). Second, for purposes of the foreclosure rules, a health care provider would not be disqualified as an independent contractor solely because the REIT receives rental income from the provider with respect to one or more other properties. For this purpose, other rules would be made to ensure that the terms of leases of other properties could not be manipulated to circumvent this rule. 
   Another provision deals with the 95% distribution rule. From 1960 through 1980, REITs and mutual funds shared a requirement to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income. Since 1980, REITs have had to distribute 95% of their taxable income. The proposal would restore the 90% distribution requirement. 
   Mr. President, I believe this is a major improvement in the REIT rules that preserves the original intent of Congress when it first created REITs in 1960, while permitting the industry to adapt to a changing marketplace. Most importantly, these REIT modernization rules would not expand the activities that can be conducted within the REIT, they simply give the REIT greater flexibility to establish fully-taxable subsidiaries that will enable the REIT to better serve its customers. 
   This legislation is supported by the American Resort Development Association, the International Council of Shopping Centers, the National Apartment Association, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, the American Seniors Housing Association, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties, the National Association of Realtors, the National Multi Housing Council, and the National Realty Committee.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Affordable Housing Opportunity Act of 1999. My colleague from my home state, BOB GRAHAM, my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator SANTORUM, and 42 other members of the Senate join me as original cosponsors of this effort to make sure that the Low Income Housing Tax Credit is not undercut by the effects of inflation. 
   The Low Income Housing Tax Credit is one federal housing program that works. It works to produce affordable rental housing by allowing states to distribute tax credits to those who invest in apartments for low income families. It works because it is decentralized, it is market-oriented, and it relies on the private sector. 
   The Low Income Housing Tax Credit works because it is based on sound economics. This is in stark contrast to the alternative government approach to the problem of a scarcity of privately owned, affordable housing units, the approach of rent control. Under rent  control, owners are restricted in the price they can charge for their apartments. Since this dramatically reduces the return on their investment in housing, potential owners of rental units take their money elsewhere. The result, confirmed in a study of rent control in California in the early 1990s, is that rent control actually reduces the number of rental units available for low income families. 
   There is a better way. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit is that way. Under this program, tax credits are allocated by states and their localities to investors in low income housing. In return for agreeing to charge low rents for the units produced, the investors receive a tax credit that makes up for the financial risk of the investment. Instead of mandating low rents, the program provides an incentive for property owners to charge low rents. 
   And, as Adam Smith would have predicted, this incentive does the job. Since 1987, state agencies have allocated over $3 billion in Housing Credits to help finance nearly one million apartments for low income families, including 70,000 apartments in 1997. In my own state of Florida, the Credit is responsible for helping finance over 52,000 apartments for low income families, including 3,300 apartments in 1997. The demand for Housing Credits nationwide currently outstrips supply by more than three to one. 
   Despite the success of the Housing Credit in meeting affordable rental housing needs, the apartments it helps finance can barely keep pace with the nearly 100,000 low cost apartments which are demolished, abandoned, or converted to market rents each year. This is because the credit has been set at an annual amount of $1.25 per resident of each state, since its creation in 1986. To make up for the loss in value of the credit due to inflation, we propose to increase this amount to $1.75 per resident and to index the amount for future inflation. It has been estimated that this will increase the stock of critically needed low income apartments by 27,000 each year. 
   There has long existed in this body a dedication to affordable housing, an interest that knows no party lines. One of the major, early proponents of federally supported affordable housing was Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, known in his day as Mr. Republican, whose monument chimes regularly just a few hundred yards from here. With this strong, bipartisan pedigree, I have no hesitation in asking my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me to enact this proposal--which is similar to one contained in the President's budget and is supported by the nation's governors and mayors and the affordable housing community--to ensure the continued vitality of a program that works.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am here today because finally, Tax Freedom Day has arrived--the day the average American has earned enough income to cover his or her Federal, State and local taxes for the year. Only today--after one-third of the year has already passed--have our working men and women earned enough money to pay their taxes for the year! This is truly amazing, and it is also truly wrong. 
   Tax Freedom Day has moved successively later into the year for the past 7 years, as the Federal Government seeks to claim a larger and larger portion of the American family income. Since 1993, Federal tax revenues have grown 52 percent faster than personal income growth. And last year alone, Federal revenues grew 80 percent faster than personal income. 
   Florida's Tax Freedom Day is even later--Floridians will not finish earning enough to pay their taxes for the year until Friday, May 14. They also shoulder the 5th heaviest total tax burden in the country. 
   In 1999, Federal, State and local governments are projected to collect an average of $10,298 in tax revenue for every person in the country. This year, the Federal Government will collect more tax revenue as a share of GDP--that is 20.7 percent--than at any time since 1944. This is the highest level in peacetime history. 
   If that isn't enough to put the high Federal tax take into perspective, let me share with you a few examples of just how much taxes impede our freedom every day of the year. 
   I brought with me a daily tax clock to illustrate just how many different times we are taxed in ways we may not even realize. Think about the different things you do in the course of your average day. Planning your family's summer vacation? Forty percent of the cost of an airline ticket is taxes! When you drive to and from work today, 54 percent of the price of a gallon of gasoline is taxes. Did you call your mother on Mother's Day? Fifty percent of the cost of your phone bill is due to taxes. 
   Taxes infringe on our freedom--our freedom to work, our freedom to invest and our freedom to provide for our families. It is more apparent than ever that the mammoth Federal Government we have created will never be satisfied--if there is money to be had, the Federal Government will take it. 
   That is why it is more important than ever to provide tax relief to our families. We have a balanced budget, and soon we will be working with a Federal surplus. If the Federal Government has its way, this overpayment of taxes by the American people will be spent in Washington on new Federal programs. We need to give the American people their money back. I have proposed a tax plan which will do just that by, No. 1, providing tax relief for all American income taxpayers, No. 2, encouraging economic growth and, No. 3, ensuring U.S. technological leadership in the 21st century. 
   We need to ensure the United States keeps its status as an economic powerhouse in the next millennium. The Federal Government's role in ensuring this happens is to cut taxes and get out of the way to give the American people the freedom to pursue their own dream--not Washington's.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague JOHN BREAUX in sponsoring the Medicare Psychiatric Hospital Prospective payment System Act of 1999. 
   This legislation will ensure the continuance of available impatient psychiatric care by reforming how Medicare pays for services in free-standing psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of general hospitals. It will establish a prospective payment system (PPS) Currently psychiatric hospitals are the only institutional providers of care under Medicare not scheduled to move to a PPS system. 
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) made major changes in the way psychiatric hospitals are paid. It reduced incentive payments and imposed a limit on what will be paid. The result of this was that many of these providers were hit by a big cut in the first year with no transition period to adjust to the reductions. It is important that these cuts not be continued because patient care may be put at risk. A recent study found that 84% of psychiatric hospitals had payment reductions due to BBA. The average margin went from minus 3% to negative 8.7%. 
   This legislation proposes to transition psychiatric inpatient providers to a PPS which will allow these institutions to be able to plan and adjust for the future and insure their ability to provide quality care. The proposal also provides a measure of financial relief by limiting payment reductions to no more than 5% in the next two years. This relief will then be paid back in a few years under PPS. After the third year, PPS will be in effect and per diem rates can be adjusted downward by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to pay back savings temporarily lost through the limitation of initial payment reductions. The goal is for the bill to be budget neutral over five years and fully comply with the BBA. 
   The most important feature of this legislation is that it moves psychiatric facilities out of a cost based system and into a system where they will be paid prospectively, like most other Medicare Providers, and can manage their finances effectively to provide high quality psychiatric care. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in co-sponsoring this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I thank Senator GRAMM for providing this time to me to make a statement with regard to a tax cut proposal that I have. 
   Mr. President, my job as chairman of the Joint Economic Committee is to help Congress stay focused on the right policies to keep the U.S. economy energized. What that comes down to is finding ways to make sure Washington does less of what today it does most--tax, spend, and regulate--in order to let the American people do more of what they do best--which is to build, create and innovate. 
   With that in mind, I instructed the JEC staff to focus on creating a tax plan that would accomplish three goals: first, provide tax relief for all American income taxpayers; second, promote even stronger economic growth; and third, ensure continued technological leadership in the 21st century. The plan I would like to talk about today accomplishes these three goals, and does so within the parameters of the on-budget surplus as estimated in this year's budget resolution. It does not use one penny from the Social Security surplus. 
   As Ronald Reagan once said, when he was defining a taxpayer--``that's someone who works for the Federal Government but doesn't have to take a civil service examination.'' This comment really gets to the heart of how the size and scope of the Federal Government affects the way we live our lives. Americans are spending more and more time working to give more and more of their hard-earned dollars in taxes every year to the Federal Government. 
   According to the non-partisan Tax Foundation, the average dual-income family will work until May 11 this year to pay their federal state and local taxes. So, as of today, the average American family has not even finished working to pay off their taxes for 1999. 
   This year, the Federal Government will collect more tax revenue as a share of GDP than at any time since 1944. This is the highest level in peacetime history--20.7 percent of GDP consumed by the Federal Government. 
   Since 1993, federal tax revenues have grown 52 percent faster than personal income growth. Last year alone, federal revenues grew 80 percent faster than personal income. 
   We have a balanced budget in 1999 and we've got balanced budgets as far as the eye can see. Soon, we'll have a federal surplus as far as the eye can see. 
   Our challenge now is to deal with that surplus. And, I think it's easy to see what will happen to this overpayment by the American taxpayer--if we leave it in Washington's hands. There will be numerous new government programs and they will be paid for by the Federal surplus. 
   We have to change the terms of debate--and we have to do it now before the surplus is spent. First, let's not forget that the American economy does not exist to feed the Federal budget. Now that the budget is balanced, we have to get our priorities straight. 
   To begin with: there is no such thing as ``public money.'' Every dollar of the Federal surplus was paid into the U.S. Treasury by American taxpayers. If we have a persistent surplus, we have to give the money back. 
   For years, my fellow Republicans and I argued that it was wrong for the Government to spend more than it took in. We were right. But now, it is equally wrong for the Government to take in more than it spends. 
   Yes, we should cut taxes so that people can keep more of what they earn. Yes, we should cut taxes because lower taxes spur economic growth. But the real rationale for lowering taxes--the reason tax cuts are an article of faith in the Republican Party--is that high taxes trespass on our freedom--our freedom to work, our freedom to invest, our freedom to support our families. 
   So in my mind, it is not a matter of if we cut, but how much, and how can we maximize the pro-growth impact of whatever tax cuts we decide to enact. 
   With these thoughts in mind, I would like to focus on what they Joint Economic Committee staff has come up with as a way to give the American income taxpayer meaningful tax relief, promote savings and economic growth, and ensure the United States remains a technological leader in the 21st century. And, Mr. President, I would like to elaborate on how this plan will accomplish each of these goals. 
   The first goal is tax cuts for all American income taxpayers. 
   Under this plan we would double the standard deduction to $14,400 for married filers and raise the standard deduction for single filers to $7,200. Increasing the standard deduction would provide much-needed relief to all low-income taxpayers. Moreover, this provision would significantly reduce the much-discussed marriage penalty and simplify the Tax Code. Nearly three-  quarters of all taxpayers use the standard deduction and would benefit from this increase. 
   In addition, our plan would repeal the 1993 Clinton tax increase on Social Security benefits. In 1993, President Clinton imposed this tax increase on the elderly's benefits because he said it was needed to eliminate the budget deficit. Since there is no longer a deficit, we no longer need this tax. It is time to repeal this unnecessary surcharge on Social Security recipients. 
   The second goal is economic growth.

   Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank Senator GRAMM for yielding me time. 
   This was an issue that I did not expect to be drawn into as far as the debate was concerned. But as I have listened to it, and as I have observed my colleagues over the last several days, as the lobbying on both sides of this issue has been going on, and seeing people move back and forth, I have become concerned about how people are making decisions. 
   Finally, we have gotten down to the crux of the matter here, and that is, at least in my opinion, how monetary policy in the United States is going to be carried out. 
   I believe it is so important that we focus on the issue of monetary policy, because one of the underlying strengths, one of the major factors in the economic growth that we have experienced for almost 16 years is the role of the Federal Reserve, a Federal Reserve that has been committed to price stability. 
   To do something that will weaken the influence of the Federal Reserve with respect to monetary policy would be a tragic mistake. 
   Here is my reasoning as to how this will come about. The Treasury is selling their idea to Members that all we really want to do is give the bankers a choice--that seems to be a fair and reasonable thing to do--let them decide. 
   I was in the banking business. This is really not a choice. You are saying to the bankers, you make a choice about where you are going to put this. They know where the cost of capital is the cheapest, and the cost of capital is going to be the cheapest in an operating subsidiary. 
   Why is the operating subsidiary going to be the cheapest cost to them? Because there is a subsidy attached to the bank, and so the bankers naturally will go to where their costs are the cheapest. They will, in fact, put these new powers into an operating subsidiary. Having done that, there is no longer a need for them to be involved in a holding company. The holding company is the vehicle, if you will, that allows the Federal Reserve to carry out its monetary policy. 
   The second thing that is going to occur is by voting for the use of an operating subsidiary, you are really saying you want the taxpayers to expand the subsidy that goes into the banking industry or into the financial services industry. That is an individual decision that people can make. But I think it is wrong to try to approach this question about whether I am for the bankers or whether I am not for the bankers. This is an issue about whether you want to have a monetary policy that is of value to this country. 
   I ask Members to consider what has happened in this country in these past 16 years as far as growth is concerned. The foundation of that growth has been the commitment that this Federal Reserve, and Alan Greenspan in particular, has had to the objective of price stability. We have finally reached the point where we have attained price stability, and we are talking about tinkering around with legislation that could lessen the influence of the Federal Reserve. 
   As Senator DOMENICI indicated earlier, as you lessen that influence, you are going to increase the influence in the executive branch over the banking industry and monetary policy in this country. That would be a tragedy. 
   I ask my colleagues who may be wavering on this issue, this is not a choice between Secretary Rubin or Alan Greenspan or commercial banks. This is a decision about monetary policy in this country and who should, in fact, have control of it. 
   I ask you to support the position outlined by the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator GRAMM. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. President, I thank Senator GRAMM for yielding me the time. I have a comment or two with respect to the process that we have gone through in putting this legislation together. 
   I commend Senator GRAMM. I can't think of a time in my now 17 years in the Congress where I have had a chairman of a committee that has spent as much time with the other members of the committee, walking through a particular piece of legislation, each aspect of it, making sure that each of us was prepared and educated on the various issues. There are some difficult issues that face us--the whole issue of CRA, unitary thrifts, the mixing of banking and commerce, the issue of operating subsidiaries versus affiliates, all of them complicated. 
   I can remember not too many years ago when there was this sense in America that the model which should be followed was the Japanese banking system that people looked at and said, we ought to look at Japan, the dynamic economy they were producing in the late 1980s. I think about how much things have changed in those 10 years.

   Mr. MACK. It is a dramatic change, and here we are. We have been talking about this legislation for all those years and we haven't made the modifications we needed to make. I hope we will be successful this time. 
   I rise in support of the underlying bill and in opposition to the Sarbanes substitute. We all know that legislation to overhaul the bank regulatory structure is long overdue, and I join many of my colleagues in thanking the chairman for his hard work in writing this bill and bringing it to the floor. 
   I will begin by quoting the words of the Senate Banking Committee report, which I believe presents a strong case for financial modernization. It states:  
   The argument for legislation to rationalize our financial structure is strong. Regulatory and court decisions have eliminated many of the barriers between commercial and investment banking. The barriers separating commercial banks from investment banks have been perforated in both directions. Finally, changes in the technology and practice of financial intermediation have rendered the restrictions of Glass-Steagall increasingly ineffective and obsolete.  
   There is nothing particularly remarkable about that language, Mr. President. In fact, those same arguments will be made by many of my colleagues here today. But what is remarkable about the statement I just read is that it comes from a committee report on banking legislation in 1991. Just as I believed those words to be significant 8 years ago, I believe them to be even more so today. Unfortunately, there was no overhaul of our banking system in 1991. And despite much hard work and a clear need for action, there has been none since. We are long overdue for this debate and I am pleased the Senate is addressing this important issue. 
   Freedom and free enterprise have allowed our corporate and financial institutions to respond to changing times and to adapt to a changing financial environment. But this ability has reached its limits within the confines of present law. For our financial institutions to continue to grow, to compete, and to evolve, we must give them a new legislative climate in which to operate. That is the purpose of the bill before us today. 
   Mr. President, our banking system is truly a model for the world. Emerging economies from Asia to Africa to Central Europe look to the United States for the blueprint and technical expertise to build an effective financial infrastructure. This is happening because we have found a remarkable balance between community banks and global institutions, between the regulators and the regulated, between the States and the Federal Government, and between ordinary people and the money they need to finance their hopes and dreams. In recent years, we have witnessed a wave of high-profile mergers, as institutions across the sectors hope to create ``synergy'' from offering a broad range of financial products to an expanding global customer base. For their part, many smaller, community-based institutions are using the new regulatory authorities to offer their customers one-stop shopping for individual financial needs--from ordinary retail banking to insurance products and securities instruments. 
   All of this is very important to the continued financial well-being of our Nation and to the global competitiveness of our financial services industry. However, the expansions I speak of are not taking place with the approval of the Congress and are not occurring through any action on our part to change the law. Rather, these things are happening because--as the 1991 report mentioned--court decisions and the broadened interpretations of present law by the banking regulators have allowed them to take place in an ad hoc manner. In order to access the right to affiliate with other sectors, financial companies have to jump over increasingly complicated regulatory hurdles in order to adapt and survive. It is high time Congress weighed in on this important trend. It is high time we cleared the way for these affiliations and repealed the underlying web of Depression-era restrictions on our banking industry. 
   That is what we accomplish in the bill before us today, Mr. President. This legislation allows companies to diversify holdings by lifting the prohibitions on affiliations among banks, insurance companies, and securities firms, thus allowing them to compete fully in a free-market environment. If Congress fails to act, we will once  again limit the potential of our financial sector and we will continue to impose needless and unnecessary regulatory burdens on individual financial institutions. The other body is moving with its own legislation. The Senate needs to act now to ensure that our financial sector is on solid footing for the new century. 
   The bill before us repeals the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law prohibiting affiliations between commercial and investment banks. It allows banks and insurance companies 
   to affiliate under the same corporate umbrella. It contains provisions outlining the appropriate regulation of bank sales of insurance, and it allows banks with assets of less than $1 billion to engage in a broader range of financial services through operating subsidiaries. Of course, Mr. President, the relationships between these entities are carefully constructed to ensure institutional safety and soundness and that the taxpayer-insured deposits of retail banking institutions are protected. 
   The structure provided for in this legislation will end the ad hoc expansion and administration of our banking sector and provide the industry with a clear roadmap for the 21st century. In my view, it will lead to greater stability, enhanced safety and soundness, and improved choices for customers and consumers. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important bill and defeat the Sarbanes substitute. 
   With that, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I thank Senator GRAMM and the other Members on the floor for this time. I will be brief. 
   I have spoken on this issue throughout my time in the Senate serving on the Banking Committee which now is into its 11th year. I also make these comments from the perspective of an individual who was president of a small bank in southwest Florida for 5 years out of a 16-year banking career. 
   One would think, listening to the comments that have been made by the distinguished Senator from Maryland, that we were proposing to repeal CRA. We are not proposing that at all. There may be Members who want to do that, but that is not what the issue is about. The issue is about regulatory overkill. 
   This little bank that I was president of had about $60 million in assets--very small bank--in a community that was developed, one of these Florida developments, that began in the late 1950s. To suggest that this small community bank in a very well-defined and confined market was not providing resources to that market is just absurd. If we did not lend money into that market, we would, in fact, have gone broke. So all I am suggesting is the amendment being proposed here is being sold as if we were trying to repeal CRA. The information I have is with the committee position: Only 2.8 percent of the total assets of the banking industry in America are affected by this carve-out, 2.8 percent. There were 16,000 banks audited over a 9-year period and only three of those banks--I am talking about small banks now--only three of those banks were found to be significantly out of compliance. 
   Small banks in America need some regulatory relief. That is all we are suggesting here. Again, my experience was this little bank of $60 million in assets had to assign one individual whose job it was to put pins into a map in our market showing where we had made real estate loans. That is all we had to do. But I had to assign one person to do that. She had to put programs into effect in the bank to make sure we were complying with lending to our community. It was the only place we could have loaned. 
   So the idea that we needed to have the Community Reinvestment Act for my bank and for small community banks is absurd. I ask my colleagues to reject the amendment and to support the committee position. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank Senator DODD for his vote for this resolution. I respect immensely his viewpoint and what he has stated over all these years, but I respectfully disagree with him. Again, I will just point out, all we are suggesting here is that the least America can do is to say we ought to ask the United Nations to condemn Fidel Castro for his human rights violations. That is not an extreme position to take, to ask the world body to condemn Fidel Castro for human rights violations. 
   The reason we are doing this is because I think it is appropriate to respond to the impression that has been created over these last several months after the Pope visited Cuba. There has been this kind of love affair that Cuba has changed, that the world is now going to open up. The Senator said a moment ago, if Cuba would open up, if we would open up, we could come together. 
   Clearly, what has happened since the Pope's visit, Fidel Castro has arrested more dissidents than he has released following the Pope's visit. He has instituted new laws which restrict the freedom of speech, even more restrictive than in previous years. He arrested 15 people trying to celebrate the birthday of Martin Luther King this year, and just this month he arrested and sentenced four prominent activists for writing about the basic rights of the Cuban people.  
   Mr. President, it seems to me that this country, a country that has been willing to stand up in defense of human rights, basic human rights all over the globe, is doing the right thing. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to support this resolution. 
   I yield back my time and yield the floor to Senator GRAHAM.

   Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity today 
   to speak about Cuba and why the United States must make every effort to pass a resolution in Geneva at the U.N. Human Rights Commission condemning the Cuban Government. 
   The reality which I seek to convey today is very simply stated. Fidel Castro continues to run Cuba with absolute power, based upon the failed ideals of the Marxist revolution that he led 40 years ago. He is a tyrant, a dictator, and an enemy of freedom, democracy, and respect for basic human dignity. 
   As many of my colleagues know, I have been reflecting on my Senate career lately as I weighed my decision on seeking another term. Let me share one of those memories with you right now. 
   It was October 19, 1987, when I announced my candidacy for the Senate. I traveled to Key West, the southern most point in the Continental United States, to make my announcement. I chose this location for one simple reason. I knew my passion for foreign policy arose from a deeply held conviction that America's freedom could not be taken for granted, that our freedom was not complete so long as others suffered under the yoke of tyranny. Only 90 miles from where I declared my aspiration to be a U.S. Senator in order to take part in the fight against the enemies of freedom, Fidel Castro ruled with a failed ideology and a cruel iron fist. 
   It seems that I have been in the Senate for a long time--10 years--but if I were to travel to Key West today, I am sad to say, I could still point toward Cuba and ask the same questions I did on October 19, 1987: What does it mean to live in peace if there is no freedom to worship God, no freedom to choose our livelihood, no freedom to read or speak the truth or to live for the dream of handing over a better life to our children and our grandchildren? Peace without freedom is false. The Cuban people are only free to serve their masters in war and in poverty. 
   Mr. President, I have many good friends in the Senate, and I have great respect for my colleagues. We share so much of our lives with each other each day. And even though we are divided on many issues, in our hearts there can be no division on our feelings for the suffering people of Cuba. 
   The island so close to our shores serves as a tragic reminder of the human cost of tyranny and oppression and that freedom is not free. 
   Let me propose today that Fidel Castro has not changed in 10 years; in fact, he has not changed in 40 years. In the history books, 40 years can be covered in a single sentence. But in Cuba, it can also be an eternity. 
   I think about the 12 years since I made that speech. How many people have suffered and died needlessly in 12 years? How many screams of agony have reached for the heavens from Havana in 12 years? How many tears of sorrow and anguish have fallen in 12 years? I fear we will never know the true scale of suffering, even though it takes place so close to our shores. 
   Some of us have served in the Senate for a few years, some of us for 10 or 12, and some of us have been here for 30 years or more. Think what it must be like serving instead in one of Fidel Castro's prisons for all that time. In Cuba you could be imprisoned simply for doing what we do each day, and that is engage in the debate of ideas. Think about how different our lives would be if we lived in a similar environment. 
   I assure you, Mr. President, that the human spirit is a powerful thing. We know that throughout the world and throughout history mankind has struggled for freedom against the greatest of obstacles. That struggle lives, breathes, sweats, and thrives in Cuba today. But it does so at a great cost. 
   I have two short stories I want to share to demonstrate the price being paid in Cuba today. 
   There is a famous man known as Antunez. He began supporting freedom in Cuba in 1980. He has been in and out of prison for much of his adult life. As of February 1999, reports out of the prisons have him in poor health. 
   I want to read a quote from a letter he wrote and successfully smuggled out of Cuba 2 years ago. I quote:  
   On March 15 [1997], it will be seven years that I have been imprisoned but I have yet to lose my faith and confidence in the final triumph of our struggle. I am proud and satisfied that they will have been unable to--and will never be able to--bend my will, because I am defending a just and noble cause, the rights of man and the freedom of my country.  
   A second story: I have recently seen a March 10, 1999, statement of Dr. Omar del Pozo, which I want to share with you today. He was a prisoner of conscience, sentenced to 15 years in prison for promoting democracy and civil society in Cuba. Through the intercession of Pope John Paul II, Dr. Pozo was released and exiled to Canada after serving 6 years of the sentence. 
   It is interesting to note the comments of a man who owes his freedom from Cuba's prisons to the Pope's visit to Cuba. Listen to what he has to say about the so-called changes taking place within the Cuban Government. And I am now quoting:  
   In Castro's man-eating prisons, lives are swallowed, mangled, and spit out in what can only be described as his revolving-door of infamy. Some may claim that the fact that I am able to stand before you here today is because I am a product of engagement with Castro. While I am certainly grateful for the international outcry that created pressure on Castro to release me, it would be negligent of me not to recognize that as long as the dictator remains in power, there will continue to be political prisoners who are destined to become pawns to be handed over as tokens depending on the occasion.........my release in no way benefited the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of men and women who were left behind.  
   Dr. Pozo's statement certainly rings true--that the visit of the Pope and his personal release and exile from his home do not, counter to popular belief, indicate a new day in Cuba. 
   He continues on in his statement. Again, I quote:  
   Forty years have passed, and a new millennium dawns, and still political prisoners exist in a country only 90 miles from the shores of the freest nation on earth........In the confusion of cliches Cuba has become in the mass media: Castro and cigars, Castro and tourism, Castro and baseball, the terrible tragedy of Cubans and their legitimate needs and desires takes a backseat to the priorities set by the Comandante en Jefe and his regime. The truly tragic part is that there are some who, in the name of profit, are willing to compromise justice and play by his rules, with no regard for the welfare of the Cuban people.  
   Just as actions indicate no improvement in the Government of Cuba, one could argue that things are not really getting worse. In fact, the recent crackdown in Cuba is only a manifestation of the nature of the ruling regime. Again, let me quote from Dr. Pozo:  
   These past days, I have heard even experienced Cuba observers question why Castro has raised the level of repression at this point in time, considering the many gestures of goodwill he has received internationally prior to and following the Papal visit. The only possible answer is that it is the nature of the beast. Castro can not help it any more than he can help being a totalitarian dictator. It is who he is and will always be. It is because he is motivated by one thing and one thing alone: [and that is] absolute power. He wants to continue to stand on the backs of the Cuban people and he will persecute, torture and kill in order to accomplish his goal of being Cuba's ``dictator for life.'' By now, everyone knows who Castro is and what he is capable of. From this point on, the field can only be divided between those who are willing to overlook his crimes and those who are not.   
   Again, I just point out, those were not my words. These are the words of an individual who was released from Castro's prison because of the pressure brought on by the international community and by the Pope's visit. What he is saying here is that nothing has changed as a result of the Pope's visit to Cuba. He is saying nothing has changed. And he is saying to us--not me saying, but he is saying to us--that ``the field can only be divided [now] between those who are willing to overlook [Castro's] crimes and those who are not.'' 
   Mr. President, in conclusion, let me once again say freedom is not free, but it is the most valuable thing that we know; it is, in fact, the core of all human progress. Freedom has everything to do with our spiritual, physical, and political lives. Without it--without freedom--what would we do? It is important to think about this in order to appreciate the words of the brave men and women in Cuba fighting for freedom, because they are, after all, fighting for everything and paying a large price indeed. 
   I want to reach out to my colleagues today. We loathe tyranny and oppression. So let us stand united behind our delegation in Geneva; let us proclaim our views at the United Nations Human Rights Commission. Let us stand tall and speak with unity, conviction, and strength. Let us proclaim: ``The 
   United States of America abhors tyranny and loves freedom. We oppose the enemies of liberty and we support those struggling for LIBERTAD.'' 
   That, Mr. President, represents the meaning of this resolution in its entirety. I hope my colleagues will join me today in making this most important statement. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. 
   Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.

    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today with my esteemed colleague and friend, Senator GRAHAM, to introduce the Florida Federal Judgeship Act of 1999. I would not be here today if I did not wholeheartedly believe that the problem facing the court system in the Middle and Southern Districts of Florida is one of the most acute judgeship problems in the nation. If judicial resources are not increased in these two districts, the problem will become irreversible. Mr. President, the situation that presently exists in Florida rises to the level of an emergency and thus, the problem needs attention today. 
   The legislation that Senator GRAHAM and I are introducing would create seven new judgeships for the state of Florida. The Middle District would receive five new permanent judgeships, and the Southern District would receive two new permanent judgeships. These numbers were officially recommended by the United States Judicial Conference earlier this week. 
   The Middle District of Florida is nearly 400 miles, spanning from the Georgia border on the northeast side to the south of Naples on the southwest coast of Florida. This district includes, among others, the cities of Jacksonville, Orlando, and Tampa. The Southern District encompasses Ft. Lauderdale and Miami, along with other cities in the southern portion of the state. 
   Additional judgeship positions have not been created for these districts since 1990. Since this time, the Middle District alone has had a 62 percent increase in the total number of cases filed. Moreover, Florida's population has increased nearly twice as fast as the nation during the 1990s. By 2025, the United States Census Bureau projects Florida will surpass New York as the third largest state with 20.7 million residents. 
   Each year, Florida becomes a winter home to people from all over the United States and the world. In addition, the Middle and Southern Districts  are home to major tourist attractions such as Disney World, Universal Studios, Sea World, Busch Gardens, and South Beach. The heavy flow of both winter residents and tourism, along with Florida's growing number of permanent residents, causes the needs of these two judicial districts to be unique in this nation. 
   In addition, the Middle District contains the federal correctional center at Coleman. When the penitentiary is completed in Spring 2001, this will be one of the largest prison complexes in the country and the largest in the state of Florida. The capacity at Coleman will be approximately 4,700 inmates and all complaints filed by these prisoners regarding the facilities and their individual care will be sent to the Middle District for resolution. 
   To add to the problem, a portion of the Middle District has been designated a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. While I am pleased that Florida will be receiving additional assistance in the war against drugs, we also must recognize that this law enforcement initiative is expected to dramatically impact narcotic related arrests and therefore, prosecutions in the Middle District. 
   Thus, it is apparent that without the addition of new judges, access to justice will no longer be swift in the Middle and Southern Districts. To provide Floridians with a safe environment and access to justice, a court system must be put in place which can handle the demands of this dynamic and growing part of our country. Accordingly, I urge the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to consider and pass this legislation expeditiously.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today, along with Senators GRAMS, LIEBERMAN, and KYL, I introduce the Printed Circuit Investment Act of 1999. This bill would allow manufacturers of printed wiring boards and printed wiring assemblies, known as the electronic interconnection industry, to depreciate their production equipment in 3 years rather than the 5 year period under current law. 
   As we approach the 21st century, our Nation's Tax Code should not stand in the way of technological progress. Printed wiring boards and assemblies are literally central to our economy, as they are the nerve centers of nearly every electronic device from camcorders and televisions to medical devices, computers and defense systems. But the Tax Code places U.S. manufacturers at the disadvantage relative to their Asian competitors, because of different depreciation treatment. This disadvantage is particularly difficult for U.S. firms to bear, as the interconnection industry consists overwhelmingly of small firms that cannot easily absorb the costs inflicted by an irrationally-long depreciated schedule. 
   As technology continues to advance at light speed, the exhilaration of competition in a dynamic market is dampened by the effects of a tax code that has not kept pace with these changes. Obsolete interconnection manufacturing equipment is kept on the books long after this equipment has gone out the door. Companies with the competitive fire to enter such a rapidly-evolving industry must constantly invest in new state-of-the art equipment, replacing obsolete equipment every 18 to 36 months just to remain competitive. U.S. investments in new printed wiring board and assembly manufacturing equipment have nearly tripled since 1991--growing from $847 million to an estimated $2.4 billion. 
   But this investment is taxed at an artificially-high rate, because deductions for the cost of the equipment are spread over a period that is several years longer than justified. The industry is at the mercy of tax laws passed in the 1980s, which were based on 1970s-era electronics technology. It is no wonder that the market share of U.S. interconnection companies has been cut in half over this period. Our Tax Code should not continue to undermine the competitiveness of American businesses. The opportunity is before us to correct the tax laws that dictate how rapidly board manufacturers and electronic assemblers can depreciate equipment needed to fabricate and assemble circuit boards. 
   The Printed Circuit Investment Act of 1999 will provide modest tax relief to the electronics interconnection industry and the 250,000 Americans, residing in every state in the Union, whose jobs rely on the success of this industry. This industry should get fair and accurate tax treatment.

    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, in an effort to help increase awareness and education about cervical cancer, and to pay tribute to women who have battled the disease, today I am submitting a Senate Resolution to designate the month of January as ``National Cervical Health Month.'' I am pleased that Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN and 31 bipartisan colleagues in the Senate have agreed to be original co-sponsors of this Senate Resolution. I understand that Representative JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD will be introducing similar legislation in the United States House of Representatives, and I would like to commend her for the leadership she has shown in this important effort. 
   I would also like to pay tribute to Ms. Carol Ann Armenti, Director of the Center for Cervical Health in Toms River, New Jersey. Ms. Armenti has worked tirelessly on behalf of cervical cancer patients and their families, and she has been a true leader in educating women about this disease. In January, her organization, along with the American Medical Women's Association, launched the National Cervical Cancer Public Education Campaign. The leadership of Ms. Armenti will have a lasting impact upon the lives of women of today, and future generations will be the beneficiaries of her work. 
   Mr. President, the issue of cervical cancer is one which is deeply personal to my wife, Priscilla, and to me. In 1990, our daughter, Debbie, was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Because of our family history with cancer, Debbie was aware that she had an increased risk of cancer and she made sure to take advantage of early detection screening procedures. Fortunately, her cervical cancer was detected at an early stage, and she was treated successfully with surgery. Not long after her treatment, she have birth to our third grandson. Debbie's experience with cervical cancer exemplifies the fact that early detection saves lives. 
   According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 1,000 women in Florida will be diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1999. This year, Florida will have the third largest number of new cases of cervical cancer. Yet, despite significant progress being made in the war on cancer, not all segments of the U.S. population have benefitted to the fullest extent from the advances made in the understanding of cancer. According to the U.S. Institute of Medicine report, ``The Unequal Burden of Cancer,'' rates of cervical cancer are significantly higher in Hispanic and African-American women. We simply must reinforce our efforts to eradicate this terrible disease. 
   Research, education, and early detection are the most effective weapons we have in the war on cervical cancer.  
   Research is the key to finding a cure for cervical cancer, and significant progress is being made in this regard. Last month, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) took the rarely-used step of issuing a Clinical Announcement urging physicians to give strong consideration to adding chemotherapy to radiation therapy in the treatment of invasive cervical cancer. According to NCI Director Rick Klausner, this will likely change the standard of treatment for cervical cancer. Dr. Mitchell Morris of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center called this new treatment approach, ``the first fundamental advance in the treatment of cervical cancer in more than 40 years.'' 
   I'm also proud to say that several cutting-edge cervical cancer studies are taking place in my home state of Florida. Scientists at the University of Miami Sylvester Cancer Center are studying a new type of cervical cancer immunotherapy. They are developing ``killer cells'' specifically designed to target cancer cells which express human papilloma virus (HPV). By eradicating these cells, the hope is to kill the tumor, even if the cancer has spread. At the H. Lee Moffitt Comprehensive Cancer Center in Tampa, studies are underway to develop a cervical cancer vaccine using some of the same characteristics of the human papilloma virus. They are also examining biomarkers to detect cervical cancer before malignant changes occur.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, a unilateral statehood declaration by chairman Arafat would constitute a gross violation of the Oslo accords, in effect ending the peace process. And any state that he might declare, outside of the peace process, would be illegitimate, irresponsible, and wrong. 
   I am pleased to see this initiative has been cosponsored by 90 Senators as of this morning. But we must realize that this show of support grows from a very deep and heartfelt concern. We want peace to succeed, but Chairman Arafat's threat to unilaterally declare a state clearly threatens peace. 
   Mr. President, last week in a statement on the Senate floor, I asked how can peace be reached while the Palestinian leadership teaches children to hate. Today I ask, how can peace be reached when the Palestinian leadership threatens to unilaterally impose a final status. 
   I rise today to oppose this threat to the peace process. I hope the President will join us in making this statement to Chairman Arafat.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator BREAUX and I introduce a bill reaffirming that the lawmaking power is the province of the Congress, not the executive branch. Our bill prohibits the Treasury Department from issuing regulations that would impose taxes on U.S. companies merely because one of their subsidiaries pays money to itself. 
   As a general rule, U.S. corporations pay U.S. corporate income tax on the earnings of their foreign subsidiaries only when those earnings are actually distributed to the U.S. parent companies. An exception to this general rule is contained in subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code, which accelerates the income tax liability of U.S. parent companies under certain circumstances. The Treasury Department has announced, in Notice 98-35, an intention to issue regulations that will accelerate income tax liability for U.S. companies--not based on the specific circumstances enumerated in subpart F, but instead on a new ``interpretation'' of the ``policies'' that Treasury infers from that 36-year-old provision. This action crosses the line between administering the laws and making the laws, and cannot be allowed by Congress. 
   Notice 98-35 concerns so-called ``hybrid arrangements.'' These involve business entities that are considered separate corporations for foreign tax purposes, but are viewed as one company with a branch office for U.S. purposes. U.S. companies organize their subsidiaries in this manner to reduce the amount of foreign taxes they owe. Transactions between a subsidiary and its branch have no impact on U.S. taxable income of the parent, as its subsidiary is merely paying money to itself. But the Treasury Department intends to impose a tax on the U.S. parent to penalize it for reducing the foreign taxes it owes. 
   This effort is wrong for several reasons. First, the Treasury Department possesses only the power to issue regulations to administer the laws passed by Congress. New rules based on Congressional purpose are known as laws, and under the Constitution laws are made by Congress. 
   Second, the Treasury Department is elevating one policy underlying subpart F--taxing domestic and foreign operations in the same manner--over the other policy of maintaining the competitiveness of U.S. companies in foreign markets. This proposed tax would put U.S.-owned subsidiaries at a competitive disadvantage. 
   Finally, the Treasury Department should not impose a tax on U.S. companies to force these companies to reorganize in a way that increases the taxes they owe to foreign countries. The Treasury Department is not the tax collector for other nations. And by raising the foreign tax bills of U.S. companies, the Treasury Department is also increasing the size of foreign tax credits and thereby reducing U.S. tax revenues. 
   The Treasury Department is not only making policy that it has no right to make, it is also making bad policy. Our bill places a moratorium on this lawmaking. It also directs the Treasury  Secretary to study these issues and submit a report to the tax-writing committees of Congress. Many people and organizations, including the Treasury Department, desire changes in the tax laws. But only Congress has the power to make these changes, and this is a power we intend to keep.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the Tibetan people are suffering today in the name of freedom, and I am pleased to rise with Senator MOYNIHAN to submit a resolution in solemn commemoration of this day, March 10, in Tibetan history. 
   It was on March 10, 1959 that the Tibetan people said, ``enough is enough.'' The city of Lhasa organized into what later became known as the ``Lhasa revolt'' on this day forty years ago, to protect their beloved leader, the 14th Dalai Lama, and to reject the impositions of Beijing. Let me provide some details. 
   The new communist government in Beijing sent an army to invade Tibet in 1949. The People's Liberation Army quickly overwhelmed Tibetan defenses. In 1951, a Tibetan delegation went to Beijing to negotiate a peace agreement. But negotiation is too kind of a word. The Tibetan delegation was forced to sign a PRC-written document known as the ``17 Point Agreement.'' Even though it was forced upon the Tibetan government, it promised to preserve Tibetan political, cultural, and religious institutions, and so was warily accepted by the Tibetan government. 
   Mr. President, going back to the early days of the PRC, we can see a pattern. The terms on paper protected the Tibetan way of life. But the promises proved empty. I suggest this is a lesson our President today would be wise to learn. Whether regarding Hong Kong, weapons proliferation, or trade, we must remember what Ronald Reagan taught us--``trust, but verify.'' This is especially true of our dealings with communists and authoritarian rulers. 
   In Tibet, nine years of trying to compromise with the communists, from 1951 to 1959, failed. In fact, the restrictions on Tibet increased progressively, as did the oppression and brutality of Beijing's rule. 
   March 10, 1959 stands out as an important day, not only in Tibet's history, but also in the history of humanity's struggle for freedom. On this day, the people of Lhasa organized a permanent guard around the Dalai Lama's palace, and demanded the withdrawal of the Chinese from Tibet and the restoration of Tibet's independence. 
   One week later, the Dalai Lama was forced to flee his home and his people while his palace was being shelled by the PLA. It is important to note that, in a great and triumphant official act, he repudiated the 17-Point agreement. 
   According to Chinese statistics, 87,000 Tibetans were killed, arrested, or deported to labor camps during this ``Lhasa Revolt.'' Countless tried to follow the Dalai Lama to India--unfortunately, only a very small percentage of the thousands who attempted to escape through the Himalayas to India survived. If they could successfully avoid the Chinese military--then they would succumb to malnutrition, cold, and disease. 
   Mr. President, we are today honoring the memory of the more than 87,000 Tibetans who paid with their lives for the preservation of Tibet. We also honor the 6 million Tibetans today who keep alive the hope of one-day returning home. 
   Mr. President, we believe in certain inalienable rights; it is part of our constitution. I believe that our freedom cannot be complete, and we as a nation cannot achieve our fullest greatness, so long as others suffer from the yoke of tyranny and oppression. Tibet today suffers from cultural genocide at the hands of the PRC. And yet, don't they also have inalienable rights: to reject tyranny? to determine their political future including independence? to chose freedom and reject oppression? 
   The answer, very clearly, must be a resounding ``yes.'' We have introduced  this resolution today, to register this ``yes.'' We do it for His Holiness, the Dalai Lama of Tibet. We do it for the 6 million Tibetans in the world today facing the very real and unfortunate threat of seeing their homeland destroyed and culture obliterated. And, we do it for each of us who believe that the gifts we have in our lives here do not excuse us from caring about the struggles of others. 
   I am pleased to submit this resolution, and ask my colleagues to support its immediate adoption.

   Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator for yielding. I will not use that much time. I thank the Senator for the leadership he has provided on this legislation. 
   It was really not my intention to speak on this bill because I was under the impression that this bill had great bipartisan support, that we would bring this to the floor after coming out of committee, and it would breeze through the Senate. This is a piece of legislation that is supposedly--supposedly--supported by everybody. 
   I am pleased to speak in favor of the Ed-Flex bill. Our children will thrive when State and local communities are given the freedom to craft their education plans according to the unique education needs of their children. Local schools do more when Washington bureaucracies do less. That is what this bill does. 
   We are beginning the second week of consideration of this bill. We have been forced to file three cloture motions on what may be the most popular, most bipartisan legislation we will consider this Congress. 
   I fear this may set the tone for the remainder of the 106th Congress, where consideration of any bill will be filibustered by the Democrats and drive partisanship to new heights. 
   As I implied a moment ago, I am in some ways confused by what is happening. I do not understand how a bill that supposedly is supported by an overwhelming number of Members on both sides of the aisle has been caught up in this constant and continuous effort to amend the bill. 
   I think the actions we have seen during this past week, and what we are anticipating through the balance of this week, raise the question about those who have cosponsored the bill and who say they are in support of it. I question whether they truly support the idea of Ed-Flex, which is to allow State and local communities to have more control over how dollars are spent. I think there is a ruse underway here. I think our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to claim that they support the idea of giving local communities  and States more authority and more flexibility in how to spend their dollars, yet they come out here and offer amendment after amendment on this bill, knowing full well--and I ask the Senator from Tennessee if this is not the case--knowing full well the majority leader has said to them there will be other opportunities to offer these amendments on other education bills when they come forward. Is that an accurate statement?

   Mr. MACK. As I said a minute ago, I really am serious now in raising questions about the sincerity of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who purport that they are in favor of Ed-Flex but, yet, want to bog this piece of legislation down with a whole series of amendments they know are controversial. 
   There is nothing wrong with us dealing with controversial amendments and controversial issues. We do that throughout our entire political careers. The question is the timing of it. The question is the approach. I am, again, dismayed by the attitude that is being projected here. I, again, question sincerity. 
   Recently, we went through a 5- or 6-week period at the beginning of this new Congress with a very contentious issue dealing with the impeachment trial. But each side made a sincere effort to work with the other, and as a result I think we did a credible job. I think most people in the country think we did a credible job. Yet, on this the second piece of legislation we are considering, we are being forced to offer cloture motion after cloture motion after cloture motion--three so far. There should be no question in anyone's mind that the intention here, I believe, is now to kill this piece of legislation because it goes against their political interests. It goes against their philosophy. 
   In all honesty, the differences in the approach about education in America is clear. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are convinced the only way to improve education in America is to have a larger group of wiser bureaucrats in 
   Washington make a determination about how resources ought to be allocated and what regulations ought to come down from Washington in order to solve this problem. 
   We have a totally different view. We think if we give this money to the States and the local communities, they can make better decisions about what their top spending priority is. In some local school districts that is school buildings. In other school districts that is school books. In others, that is teachers. We ought to allow them to make those decisions. We should not stand in their way. 
   Again, I came here to raise these points with respect to the process, as much as anything else. I remind everyone that, in the last Congress, there were 69 cloture motions that were filed--69 cloture motions. And here we are again battling along party lines about a bill that we were told might pass with 100 votes. I have serious reservations now whether that is going to happen. I think the actions of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are very clear. They are now trying to kill the idea of allowing States and local communities to have more flexibility. 
   Again, I appreciate the work and the effort of the Senator from Tennessee on this issue. He has provided great leadership and I appreciate the opportunity and the time he has given me. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for Senate Resolution 57 condemning the Cuban government's human rights record and calling on the President to make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution condemning Cuba at the UN Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. 
   Many people have written and spoken about the latest crackdown in Cuba as if they were discovering for the first time the nature of Fidel Castro's brutal regime. Fidel Castro is a tyrant. He rules with absolute authority and uses fear and greed to maintain his power. For forty years he has demonstrated to us his nature. He has not changed. We must continue our pressure on him--voice our opposition to him. And we must continue our support for the struggling Cuban people. The choice should not be difficult to make: we must stand with those suffering under one of the few totalitarian Marxists remaining in power in the world, and we must stand up to condemn the actions of the brutal regime. 
   One clear reminder of who we are dealing with is the murder in the Florida straits of four Americans in 1996. They were flying a humanitarian mission when the Cuban Air Force shot their unarmed aircraft out of the sky. For three years, Mr. President, we have all known about this murder, and for three years, I have been struggling to understand why this administration refuses to take appropriate action. 
   The Boston Globe published a very powerful essay by columnist Jeff Jacoby to mark this anniversary. I'd like to read from it. Jeff captures the starkness of the mismatched foreign policy in place, comparing the act, which Fidel Castro committed with this administration's unprincipled response. His piece is titled ``Murder Over the High Seas.''  
   They were trying to save lives. Three years ago this week, they paid with their own. 
   When Armando Alejandre, Carlos Costa, Mario de la Pena, and Pablo Morales took to the skies that day in their little blue-and-white Cessna 337s, their plan was to search the Florida Straits for stranded boat people, refugees fleeing Cuba in makeshift rafts or flimsy inner tubes. There was little enough the fliers could do for any rafters they came upon--toss down food and bottled water, radio their location to the Coast Guard--but that little could make the difference between life and death. 
   Of the four, Carlos was the most experienced. He had flown more than 500 such missions for Brothers to the Rescue, and had saved scores of boat people from drowning or dying of thirst. Armando, by contrast, was going up for only the second time. What all four had in common was a love of American liberty--and a profound concern for any Cubans so desperate to escape Fidel Castro's Caribbean hellspot that they would risk their lives to get away. 
   On Feb. 24, 1996, Carlos, Armando, Mario, and Pablo took off from an airfield in Opa-Locka, Fla. They intended to fly just below the 24th parallel, well north of Cuba's territorial waters. Both planes contacted Havana air-traffic controllers as they approached the 24th parallel, identifying themselves and giving their position. Whereupon the Cuban Air Force, without warning and without reason, scrambled two MiG fighters and blew the rescue planes out of the sky. 
   The Cessnas and their passengers were disintegrated by the Cuban MiGs. Only a large oil slick marked the spot where they went down. No bodies were ever recovered. 
   Three of the men--Carlos, Mario, and Armando--were US citizens. Pablo, a former refugee who had himself been saved by Brothers to the Rescue in 1992, was a permanent US resident. What happens when four American civilians are butchered in cold blood, over international waters, by the air force of a Third World dictatorship? What terrible retribution does the United States exact for a quadruple murder so barbaric and unprovoked? 
   The astonishing answer is: Nothing happens. There is no retribution. Indeed, the Clinton administration takes the position not only that Castro must not be punished for the four lives he destroyed, but that the victims' families must not be permitted to recover anything for their loss. 
   In the wake of the shootdown, under intense political pressure, President Clinton agreed to sign the Helms-Burton Act. Title III of the statute allows American citizens whose property was confiscated by the Cuban government--Castro nationalized billions of dollars' worth of American assets in the 1960s--to file suit against any foreign company using that property. Title IV bars any officer of a foreign company trafficking in stolen American property from receiving a visa to enter the United States. 
   Properly enforced, Helms-Burton would weaken Castro's grip on power by reducing the flow of foreign capital into his treasury. But Helms-Burton is not properly enforced. Title III has never taken effect because Clinton keeps suspending it (as the law permits him to do if he finds that a suspension ``will expedite a transition to democracy in Cuba''). Title IV has never taken effect because the State Department refuses to carry it out. 
   The hobbling of Helms-Burton is a stinging insult to the memory of the four murdered men. But the Clinton administration has delivered a cut unkinder still. 
   In 1996, the families of Armando, Carlos, and Mario sued the Cuban government for damages caused by the wrongful deaths of their loved ones, a legal remedy specifically authorized by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. In December 1997, Senior US District Judge James Lawrence King awarded the plaintiffs $187.7 million in damages. ``Cuba's extrajudicial killings ..... were inhumane acts against innocent civilians,'' he wrote in his final judgment. ``The fact that the killings were premeditated and intentional, outside Cuban territory, wholly  disproportionate, and executed without warning ..... makes this act unique in its brazen flouting of international norms.'' 
   But when the families attempted to collect their judgment out of frozen Cuban assets, the Clinton administration blocked them. The president famous for feeling people's pain is less concerned with the pain of grief-stricken Americans, it would appear, than with the pain Castro might feel if the judgment were paid. 
   The administration's position is staggering. Castro is an open and declared enemy of the United States and has been for 40 years. In sending combat aircraft to slaughter four unarmed Americans engaged in humanitarian rescue work, he committed an act of war. The response of the United States should have been to remove Castro from power and put him in the dock for crimes against humanity. (for the murder of just ``one'' American in 1989, the United States invaded Panama and seized Manuel Noriega.) 
   Clinton's appeasement of Castro is a cruel betrayal. The families of the dead Brothers of the Rescue deserve better from their government. And the tormented people of Cuba, bleeding under Castro's whip, deserve better from their free and powerful neighbor to the north.  
   Mr. President, it is clear to me that the United States has failed to stand up for the protection of the individual when damaged by international terrorism. I spoke last week about this administration's failure to adequately address terrorism in the Middle East. The pattern remains consistent--appease the enemies of freedom, the advocates of terror, in the hopes that they will not strike again. This approach simply fails. I don't know how to say it any more directly that that. This approach fails. 
   The Congress passed a law last year supporting the awarding of damages from the frozen assets of terrorist states being held by the Treasury Department to American victims. This law can help the families of the Brothers to the Rescue pilots. The President, however, waived this relief asserting our national security interests would be better served by protecting Castro's money. How can this be? Nobody has provided to me an adequate explanation of what interest would cause us protect terrorism and shun American victims. 
   Mr. President, this resolution calls on the United States to stand up for freedom, justice, and human dignity. It states that the President of the United States should lead on this issue by having the United States introduce and make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution in Geneva condemning the human rights record of the Cuban government. Mr. President, if there is one time and one place where we are obliged to condemn human rights practices, it is at the UN Commission meeting in Geneva each year. That is what this resolution calls for, and I calls for its immediate passage.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my distinguished colleagues, Senators CHAFEE, LIEBERMAN, and others, in introducing the Credit for Voluntary Early Action Act. This measure is an important first step towards reducing the regulatory uncertainty surrounding any possible regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. This bill will provided us a valuable platform for a thorough discussion of this important issue and I encourage all my colleagues to join us in our efforts. 
   In my state of Florida, we learned long ago that a healthy environment is fundamentally necessary for a healthy economy. This is evidenced by our congressional delegation's historic bipartisan consensus on such important national issues as the protection of the Florida Everglades and our efforts to stop oil and gas exploration off our beaches. The citizens of my state know full well how necessary it is we keep our environment clean and pristine. 
   I'm proud to stand with my colleagues here today and take Florida's common sense, market-based attitude on the environment to the national level. The legislation we're sponsoring today would encourage and reward voluntary actions businesses take to reduce the emission of potentially harmful greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. 
   Under our bill, the President would be authorized to provide regulatory credit to companies who take early voluntary action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This credit could be used to comply with future regulatory  requirements and--in a market-based approach--traded or sold to other companies as they work to meet their own environmental obligations. 
   Participants in this innovative program would agree to annually measure, track and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions. Credit given would be one-for-one, based on actual reductions below an agreed-upon baseline. Credits issued under the program would be subtracted from total emissions allowed under future regulatory emissions requirements. 
   I believe this approach makes sense for many reasons. For one, there are many uncertainties surrounding the issue of greenhouse gas emissions and their relation to global warming. The complexities and uncertainties associated with understanding the interactions of our climate, our atmosphere and the impact of human behavior are enormous. I have my own concerns about the science behind this issue, and have tremendous concerns about the regulatory approach outlined in last year's Kyoto agreement. It is not my intent--in cosponsoring this bill--to validate Kyoto or the underlying science. Those issues are best left to the scientists and future congresses. Today, we are simply trying to clear the way for voluntary emissions-reductions projects that would otherwise be delayed for years. And we accomplish this in a way that is not costly to the taxpayers. 
   It makes sense to provide appropriate encouragement to businesses who want to invest in improved efficiency--those who want to find ways to make cars, factories and power production cleaner. Under our bill, these companies are encouraged--not based on government fiat or handout--to get credit for their own initiative and problem solving skills. 
   Another reason I believe this legislation would be beneficial is because today's businesses have no control over the regulations that could be required of them down the road. Although today's Congress has no desire to legislate requirements on greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, it is extremely difficult to predict where the scientific and economic data will carry future policymakers. In my view, it makes sense to encourage businesses to be proactive in protecting themselves from any future restrictions enacted by a more regulatory-minded Congress and administration. 
   Mr. President, all of us agree that a healthy environment is important to our future. It's time to put partisanship aside and solve our environmental problem in a way that will allow business to be in control of their own future while doing their part to address global warming. By allowing companies to earn credit for actions they take now, businesses can be prepared for any regulations in the future. 
   I look forward to beginning an earnest debate about this issue with my colleagues in the United States Senate. I believe we have an innovative approach to confronting as issue fraught with uncertainties. We should be looking to solve more of our problems by using our free market philosophy rather than by costly Washington mandates that my not work. The Credit for Voluntary Early Reductions Act is responsible effort to validate on the national level what we've always known in Florida: a healthy environment is key to a healthy economy.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I very recently traveled to Israel. It had been several years since my last visit, and I expected this year we would bring some  important measures to the Senate floor. The timeline on the Oslo accords expires in May, and Arafat has threatened to unilaterally declare an independent state. The supplemental appropriations for the Wye River accords will soon be before us, and the timetable on the Jerusalem Embassy Act requires that the President report to the Congress why the United States Embassy has not been set up in Israel's capital city, Jerusalem. I learned a great deal during the week and I rise today to share a few simple thoughts regarding what I saw and what went through my mind as the week in Israel unfolded. 
   Let me begin with the question that is on my mind today: How is it possible to engage in peace negotiations with people who maintain the right to obliterate you, who are filled with hatred toward you, and who harbor the dream of one day destroying your homeland? Peace is a matter of the heart. I believe in the depths of every person's heart is a desire to live in peace. But what I saw, which was the outcome of the Palestinian Authority rule, convinced me that their hearts and minds are set on other goals. The Palestinian leadership does not want peace. They want, first, their own state which they can control with total power. Then they want to use that state to eliminate the State of Israel. 
   Let's be clear. The peace process, to be meaningful, must be about more than rules and laws and lines on a map. We can reach a short-term agreement on these points, but if the Palestinian leadership fails to abandon incitement of hatred, persecution, and terrorism, then we are all dreaming, only dreaming, and our President's behavior must be labeled foolish appeasement. There will not be peace until hearts and minds are changed, and we must focus our attention on these issues. 
   Mr. President, many of my colleagues in the Senate and in the House are aware of the promotion of hatred contained in the Palestinian media, and more significantly in the Palestinian schoolbooks. Let me provide some examples. 
   This is a picture that was taken off of Palestinian Authority-controlled television. It is a picture of a young girl, probably 6 or 7 years old. This is a young girl singing into a microphone. She is on a television show that would be what we would refer to as kind of a Mickey Mouse Club type of show that would be shown to children by the Palestinian Authority. I want to read to you what this little girl is singing. Again, this is a program that was produced by the people who are sitting across the table from you, supposedly negotiating peace. This is what the little girl is singing:  
   When I wander into the entrance of Jerusalem, 
   I'll turn into a suicide warrior in battledress, 
   In battledress. In battledress.  
   There is no way I can convey to you the emotion of actually seeing that scene on television. There is no way I can put the emotion into what she was expressing and the emotion that she was expressing as she sang those words. And after her song, she got an ovation from her classmates and from her teacher. 
   This focuses us on the fundamental difference in approach between the Palestinians and the Israelis. I have a grandson about that age, about the age of that little girl. How would I feel if he were being taught hatred in school? If he were being taught hatred on television, how would I feel? How would you feel if your Government was teaching your children to hate? Could you conclude that they were serious about long-term peace with their neighbors? 
   I also have some examples from Palestinian textbooks for a third-grade grammar lesson. Here is the task: ``Complete the following blank spaces with the appropriate word.'' And the sentence is, ``The Zionist enemy blank civilians with its aircraft.'' The correct answer is, ``The Zionist enemy attacked civilians with its aircraft.'' 
   For seventh graders: ``Answer the following question: Why do the Jews hate Muslim unity and want to cause division among them? Give an example of the evil attempts of the Jews, from events happening today.'' These are from Palestinian textbooks today. 
   One would expect, rather than focus on hatred, if they were serious about peace, they would focus on how the two peoples are working to live side by side. A history book for 12th graders published only last summer teaches: ``The clearest examples of racist belief and racial discrimination in the world are Nazism and Zionism.'' 
   To see this taking place today is chilling. If you can, think about it in the context of being in Israel and being briefed by a member of the Government with respect to what is happening in what they refer to as the anti-incitement committee, which was set up by the Wye Agreement. To be sitting there and seeing this, I must say to you, was chilling. I found it to be extremely chilling. 
   While the Government of Israel makes good-faith efforts to come to a peace agreement, the Palestinian Authority teaches children hatred. This causes me to ask, How can peace be obtained when the children are being taught hatred? 
   Let me share another story. I attended Shabbat dinner at the home of Saul and Wendy Singer in Jerusalem. Saul worked on my staff for 7 years before moving with his wife to Israel. They just had their second child, a girl named Tamar. Wendy told the story of the day she was checking out of the hospital in Jerusalem, 2 days after giving birth. In a very ordinary and matter of fact way, the hospital gave her the necessities for bringing home a newborn baby. In addition to providing for diapers and other things we would expect, she was handed a gas mask for her baby. It is actually a tent which you put your baby under in case of a chemical weapons attack. 
   In Israel, this preparation is routine. Everyone in Israel knows to have a gas mask ready. It just becomes a part of the craziness of everyday life. But when you bring home a newborn baby, when you bring home your baby and you get the chemical weapons tent at the hospital, then you realize how unordinary life is in Israel today. You realize that you are really simply struggling for a normal life, hoping for peace and security, praying to God, while actually living in a war zone. 
   I had another profound meeting during this week. I met one evening privately--secretly--with Arabs who were being persecuted for their Christian faith. I met with about 10 Palestinian Christians. I will tell you just one of their stories, but I will change some of the details to protect the person I am describing. 
   I remember an energetic man, in his early 40s, at the end of the table. I remember him because he seemed so full of life and love. He had a great smile on his face and displayed a wonderful sense of humor. I say this was memorable because, frankly, after hearing what he had been through, I do not know if I could express the sense of peace and love he did. This is his story. 
   He had many children and very little money. He converted to Christianity in 1993. He clearly loved God, and he loved to tell people about his conversion. He described to me how in 1997, the Palestinian Authority asked him to come to the police station for questioning. When he arrived, he was immediately arrested and detained on charges of selling land to Jews. He denied this charge, since he was very poor and owned no land. He was beaten. He was hung from the ceiling by his hands for many hours. He showed me what I just said. He showed me how his hands were tied behind his back and then raised from the floor and hung that way for many, many hours. 
   After 2 weeks, he was transferred to a larger prison where he was held for 8 months without trial. He was released in February 1998, after his family borrowed thousands of dollars to pay off the local authorities. And even though he is free, they are keeping his father in prison. They believe it is for his son's beliefs. He feels his father is being held hostage to prevent him from talking with people about his faith. Needless to say, these Christians met with me at considerable risk. They conveyed to me a message of fear and desperation. But their mere presence in the room with me demonstrated their hope, and it also caused me to ask, how can the people of Israel find peace with the Palestinian Authority while the Palestinian Authority engages in coercion and torture based upon religious beliefs? 
   I also met with the parents of American children killed by Palestinian terrorists. In this meeting, I was struck by the courage displayed by these families after suffering the tremendous loss  of a child brutally murdered. These families told me of the hopes and dreams they had for their children. I couldn't help thinking about my own. My daughter, Debbie, traveled with me on this trip. She was in the room as these stories of brutality and murder were related. There was scarcely a dry eye in the room. 
   I am sure Debbie was thinking about her three little boys, ages 14, 11 and 5. We were moved by the comments made by the parents as they described to us what had happened. 
   I understand that the Palestinian Authority knows a great deal about these murderers, but they are not being punished. Some of them have gone to trial and were sentenced, but we don't know if they remain in prison. I was told that we know some have been released. 
   There are reports that the Palestinian Authority allows them to leave prison each day and return in the evening--like free room and board more than like prison. I was also presented with stories of the lionization of these murderers in the press and again in the classrooms. Try to imagine how you would feel, try to imagine what would be going through your mind when you are dealing with the grief of the loss of your child. You know who is responsible. You know they know who is responsible. You saw them go on trial. You saw them then released. You have to ask yourself, what are we going through this peace process for? 
   I would like to mention one story of many that I heard. Mrs. Dosberg sat directly across the table from me. When she told us of the loss of her daughter and son-in-law, the lesson of these murders became so clear--we must fight terror and we cannot back off. Mrs. Dosberg's family, her daughter, American son-in-law, and their 9-month-old daughter attended a wedding in central Israel on June 9, 1996. They decided not to bring their 2-year-old daughter along. Thank God. On the way home from the wedding they were stopped by Palestinian terrorists and killed in a so-called drive-by shooting. Fifty bullets were found to have been used in this murder, and yet, by some miracle, the baby survived. Even with a crime this gross, the Palestinian Authority did not arrest 
   everyone involved or suspected in the shooting. One of those who remained free, it is believed, later took part in the bombing of the Apropos Cafe, killing many others. 
   Another suspected killer, according to the Israeli Justice Ministry, was under arrest but given permission to come and go as he pleases from prison. 
   Mohammed Dief, another suspected Palestinian terrorist, took part in the murder of two other Americans, at two different times, according to the mothers with whom I spoke. Mrs. Sharon Weinstock lost her 19-year-old son in a drive-by shooting masterminded by Dief. And only a year later, Mrs. Wachsman told me of the kidnap-murder of their son, also believed to have been planned by Dief. 
   I am told Mohammed Dief remains a free man today. The obvious lesson--terrorists kill and those who are not jailed remain free to kill and to kill again thanks to the Palestinian Authority. 
   How would I feel in their place? I couldn't keep the thought from my mind, as I listened. If I had lost a child and knew that the murderer or accomplices were on the loose, how would I feel? And if I knew the killer remained free to kill other people's children, how would I feel? It is so hard, hard to even consider, but I do know that I left there committed to doing whatever I could to help each of those families. 
   Once again, I began to better understand the way the Palestinian Authority leadership was approaching peace. How can one find peace with people who do not condemn terrorism? Mr. President, how is it possible to engage in peace negotiations with people who want to teach their children to die in a holy war against you? How is it possible to engage in peace negotiations with people who persecute those of other faiths? How is it possible to engage in peace negotiations with people who keep terrorists on the loose to wreak havoc and evil against you and praise them for heroism? 
   Today the Israeli people are exhausted by 50 years of violence against their homes and families, of sending their sons and daughters into the army, and they dream of a promised peace now. This is our hope and our dream as well. But we must not get confused. History is replete with examples of compromises which bring terror and destroy dreams. 
   In the United States, many people seem to think that if we do not confront these obstacles to peace and if we look the other way, then we will be able to come to an agreement. The reality, however, is just the opposite. If we do not acknowledge the attitudes and acts of those at the peace table, then the peace process is already over, and we just won't admit it. 
   In other words, the surest way to kill the peace process is to avoid confrontation, to fear upsetting a belligerent force and to avoid addressing incitement, violence, persecution and terrorism. The only way to keep the peace process alive is to focus on truth, freedom, security and justice. 
   Israeli efforts, to date, have sought to keep the peace process alive, improve security during the negotiating process, and obtain reciprocity as a vital element of implementation. 
   The process remains alive, but terrorism continues and is exalted by many in the Palestinian Authority, and reciprocity does not exist. The United States role has been to seek the middle ground. Unfortunately, this only rewards those willing to go to new extremes. 
   The middle ground between Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat is not halfway between the two. The United States must not engage in moral equivocation. We must not shy away from holding Arafat responsible for acts of violence, incitement and persecution. 
   The United States must demonstrate principled leadership and end the appeasement that perpetuates the cycle of violence. The peace process can only work when leaders uphold their agreements and answer to the people, and the United States remains a vigilant defender of the principles which bind us to Israel: freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. 
   What should we do? I believe there are three things. First, we should insist upon the strict adherence to Oslo and the reciprocity codified at Wye. The purpose of the Wye accord was at long last to force the Palestinians to comply with commitments before further territory would be turned over. 
   So at Wye, Israel agreed only to turn over territory in phases, in which it could verify Palestinian compliance at each and every step. In the first phase, Israel completed its redeployment after the Palestinian Authority completed its tasks. In phase 2, the Palestinians did not meet all their obligations and, therefore, Israel has not yet turned over the additional land. Reciprocity makes no sense unless it is based upon this formulation. Once Israel has ceded territory, it is unlikely it ever could recover it. The Palestinians, on the other hand, can turn on and off their promises. In fact, this is exactly what they have done. 
   Second, we should stop paying Arafat. Any funds provided to the Palestinian people should continue to go through private voluntary organizations. We should also monitor much more closely the rampant corruption and mismanagement of funds provided currently. 
   And third, we must aggressively seek the bringing to justice of Palestinian terrorists who killed American citizens. I am told that our Justice Department can do a better job here, that they have a great deal of information on the murderers of the Americans who are free in the Palestinian areas and, indeed, can make some requests for indictments. It is time to do this. Let's put the needs of the American families and other victims' families over the needs of those engaging in or supporting terrorism. 
   Mr. President, these are very basic principles. I am not discussing today the intricacies of the peace process, U.S. funding, embassies, or any other number of issues we will be discussing this year in the Senate. We need to focus on a more fundamental level first. And I hope that this message will be heard at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. 
   What I mean when I say this is that I hope the President will hear the message. I say this from a standpoint not of arrogance, not of confrontation, and I do not mean it in a political way. I just hope that the President will listen  and take another look at what he and his foreign policy team are trying to force the Israeli Government to do. 
   There cannot be peace until there is a change of heart. I returned from this trip with a newfound concern for the future of Israel. I saw examples of incitement. I heard examples of persecution and hatred being taught throughout Palestinian society by their leaders. When the people engaged in peace talks return from the negotiating table only to disparage compromise and incite violence, there can be no progress towards peace. 
   Israel has come a long way since I first began following the fate of this state and the people of Israel. In so many respects, life appears and feels normal. The economy is developing, the standard of living is growing and improving. But just below the surface of this normalcy, Mr. President, Israel still faces a threat to the state's very existence. Israel's survival remains, unfortunately, a very real and central concern 50 years after its independence. 
   Some people believe, however, that by ignoring this threat, that the peace process can succeed. Mr. President, it will fail. It is clear to me that many in the Palestinian leadership today see the peace process toward the goal of eliminating the State of Israel. 
   I suggest today that we get back to the basics. Peace is not possible while teaching children to hate and kill. Peace is not possible while persecuting those of other faiths. Peace is not possible while lionizing terrorism. We must stand up for freedom, security, and human dignity. We must stand up to ensure the security of Israel. We must stand up in the Congress, and we must insist that our President stand with us. 
   Today is the day to end American pressure on Israel to force a peace agreement. Today is the day to remember it is up to the people of Israel to determine their own fate--their own security. We should pressure those who fill children with slogans of hatred and holy war; we should pressure them to change. We should pressure those who torture; we should pressure them to change. We should pressure those who encourage and support terror and murder, and those who rejoice in hatred. That is where the pressure should be. 
   Now is the time, Mr. President, for a return to our principled stand. The only way to truly attain peace is to support freedom, democracy and justice, and oppose the cycle of hatred. We must face tyranny and oppression where it exists, condemn it, and stand up for peace--real peace based upon security, freedom, and a change of heart.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, if there is ever a time and place to raise human rights concerns, it is at the annual meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland. That Commission is meeting right now. And I rise today to urge my fellow Senators to join with me and the 17 other cosponsors of this resolution to make a simple statement. We disapprove of the human rights abuses occurring in China and in Tibet. 
   Since last year, when we passed this resolution with 95 votes, the President has engaged in two summits with Chinese President Jiang. During that time, many promises were made and agreements were concluded, and the United States did not introduce a human rights resolution in Geneva. 
   We were told the United States would make progress by not introducing a resolution. And Wei Jingsheng, a prominent dissident, was released. Tomorrow, Mr. Wei will be here in Washington, DC, and he will urge the United States not to make the same mistake as last year. Mr. President, we must now make this statement of condemnation of China's human rights practices. 
   We received many promises from the Chinese Government last year as well. But we know that the human rights conditions have only deteriorated. The State Department's human rights report clearly delineates the atrocities occurring in China and Tibet. And we know from press accounts that the crackdown on human rights and political activists has hardened. 
   It is unconscionable that the United States would not take a stand against these blatant atrocities, especially when they are documented by our own State Department. By remaining 
   silent, we do a great injustice to those fighting for freedom, democracy, and the rule of law inside China and Tibet. 
   Mr. President, I want to quote from a statement made by Mr. Wei not long after he was released and exiled from his country. And this is what he said:  
   Democracy and freedom are among the loftiest ideals of humanity, and they are the most sacred rights of mankind. Those who already enjoy democracy, liberty and human rights, in particular, should not allow their own personal happiness to numb them into forgetting the many others who are still struggling against tyranny, slavery and poverty, and all of those who are suffering from unimaginable forms of oppression, exploitation and massacres.  
   Mr. President, this is an easy one. It does not matter whether the world votes with us or against us or abstains in Geneva. It does not even matter if this resolution will change the minds of anyone in Beijing. We do know, however, from the firsthand testimony of released dissidents, that the actions of the United States are important to those engaged in the struggle for freedom. We know from those released that by simply making this statement we demonstrate our solidarity with those who are engaged within the daily struggle for freedom, justice, and the respect for human dignity. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in calling for this expression of solidarity--this stand for freedom.

   Mr. MACK. Mr. Chief Justice, today the Senate finds itself at an unlikely crossroads in American history. We have assembled as a court of impeachment to sit in judgement of our President, William Jefferson Clinton, on the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. We have worked our will in this matter according to a process rooted in English common law, written by our Founders into the Constitution, and exercised against the Chief Executive only once before in American history. 
   This is not a task to be taken lightly, and we have not arrived easily at our decision. The Senate today is engaged in weighty struggles that go to the very heart of our private and public lives. We are at an unlikely juncture between principle and public opinion, repentance and the rule of law, perception and punishment, forgiveness and findings of fact. These are difficult issues, Mr. Chief Justice. We approach our task fully aware that our decisions today will reverberate across this great land and throughout the length and breadth of history. 
   There has been much discussion about how we got here. And while the answer to that question may be varied in all its permutations, then amplified in the echo-chamber that is our modern public debate, it can be said with assurance that this whole unseemly business began when the President, caught in an improper private act, took deliberate steps to conceal it. And for all the other parties blamed for our presence here today--the media, the independent counsel, the political factions opposed to the President, the House of Representatives--it must be clearly understood that this process began with the deliberate and wilful acts of the President of the United States to lie in a Supreme Court sanctioned civil rights inquiry and obstruct the due course of justice. It all started with the high-handed disregard for the law exhibited by the nation's Chief Executive. It ends today. 
   Mr. Chief Justice, when the sound and fury of the moment has passed, and this episode can be observed with the objectivity that comes with the passage of time, I believe it will be self-evident that we have followed the Constitution to the best of our abilities. In a free, democratic society such as ours, the foundation of freedom is an independent judiciary, the rule of law, and most importantly the Constitution. Our Constitution is the framework for American society, and I have been constantly reminded throughout these proceedings of the importance of our duty to honor the dignity of this document. 
   The magnitude of this undertaking deserves no less than a sincerity of purpose and an absolute confidence in the wisdom of our Founders. The American people should not be swayed by those who argue the prominence of this case--in all its tawdry and unseemly detail--has made unnecessary a thorough process of determining the truth. We stand in judgement of the President. Our decisions will be remembered throughout history. Our precedent may be followed by future Senates. Yet, still we have heard throughout this exercise the unfortunate call to end these proceedings, save a few weeks, and inject the politics of expediency into a monumental Constitutional undertaking. I find these arguments display a remarkable lack of confidence in the  sound and just system outlined by our Founders to address very serious charges levied against the President of the United States. 
   I am grateful the Senate rejected those calls and put in place a responsible mechanism for the thorough airing of fact and argument. I am confident our process during this trial, though far from perfect, was appropriate. We allowed time for detailed presentations on the part of the House of Representatives and the President. We held an extensive question-and-answer session to review and clarify matters presented by both sides. And we have allowed for the appropriate and necessary deposition of key witnesses. Unfortunately, the simple fact is that the outcome of this matter was, in many minds, predetermined. In spite of this, the integrity of the process was, time and again, fought for and protected. Now--today-- it only remains for us to cast our votes. 
   BACKGROUND 
   I wish to address my remarks not so much to the people listening in this room today, but rather to those future generations who will look back at the record and transcripts for guidance, direction, and a more thorough understanding of the process that played out in this chamber during the first two months of 1999. I mentioned earlier the significance of the Constitution. I cannot stress enough the essential role that this historical document has played in the trial of William Jefferson Clinton. This document laid the framework for what has taken place. Be it understood, the Senate tried the President because the Constitution requires that we do so. There is no exception for popular Presidents, such as William Jefferson Clinton. The Constitution provides for this process to be applied to everyone evenhandedly. 
   Although the trial of this President was not a trial in the traditional sense, it is important to note that if the impeachment of a President presents itself again, there is nothing restricting a more traditional trial from occurring. In fact, I would encourage future Senates to utilize a judicial proceeding more closely aligned to a typical courtroom trial. Every impeachment trial will have its own dynamic environment, determined by the political and social context in which it occurs. The 
   trial of William Jefferson Clinton occurred in a prosperous time. The citizens of this nation are largely satisfied, the President enjoys consistently high approval ratings, and the economy is outstanding. Impeaching and then trying the President has not engendered popular public support. I make these observations for future generations who reflect on this process simply to explain the mood of our nation and the political environment in which this proceeding occurred. As a result, we should not deceive ourselves into believing that public opinion did not impact this process. I would like to believe, however, that the competing demands of expediting the process versus honoring our Constitutional duties created a struggle that produced the most fair trial possible under the circumstances. Accordingly, the process we followed and the rules complied with may not be appropriate for the next trial. The decisions made in this environment should not be considered to set precedent that is inflexible. In fact, the precedent we set deserves thoughtful consideration and reasoned critique when reflected upon in the years and decades to come. 
   In that light, our official duties in this matter began on December 19, 1998, when the United States House of Representatives impeached the President, William Jefferson Clinton. After listening to the evidence, reading the trial memorandums and the record, and carefully considering the arguments presented by both the House Managers and White House counsel, I believe the President is guilty of both articles. 
   Before I address the merits of the case against the President, I think it is necessary to discuss whether the crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice constitute high crimes and misdemeanors as contemplated by the Framers of our Constitution. This topic has been the subject of much controversy in the past months. 
   It is true that private acts are the genesis of the matter before us. Had the acts stayed private, we would not be here today. The President, however, brought these private acts under our public purview and created a matter of public concern when he used his position and his power to deny and obstruct the civil rights of Paula Jones. 
   Contrary to what has been asserted, this is not just a case about a sexual encounter between the President and a young White House intern. This instead is a case about depriving Paula Jones, an individual who sought and was granted the right to file a civil rights action against the President, of her constitutional right to a day in court, a right which nine justices of the Supreme Court unanimously decided that she deserved. And--almost unbelievably--on the heels of this Supreme Court mandate, the President seemed to strengthen his efforts to deny Paula Jones' civil rights. Once these acts moved into the public arena, forming the basis for charges as serious as perjury and obstruction of justice, it is my opinion these acts became high crimes and misdemeanors as envisioned by our Founders. While our only precedent involves the impeachments of federal judges, I am satisfied the standards used in these cases also apply to the charges levied against the President. 
   The President of the United States is the head of the Executive Branch and the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of this nation. When the Founding Fathers established our tripartite system of government, it was decided that the three branches of government would operate as checks and balances on one another. As a result, no branch would be more powerful than the other. This structure is at the very core of our success as a Republic. 
   By obstructing justice and lying under oath, William Jefferson Clinton violated his duty as Chief Law Enforcement Officer, disrespected the Judicial Branch of the government, and undermined the foundations of our judicial system's truth-seeking process. If I were to determine that the President's actions did not constitute high crimes and misdemeanors, I would be asserting that the Executive Branch and the Office of the Presidency are more important than the Judicial Branch, and that the President of the United States is not obligated to abide by the rule of law. As a citizen and as a Senator, I cannot, in good faith, ignore the separation of powers argument. In my view, the President's conduct was in violation of the rule of law and his actions have betrayed the trust of the people of the United States. It is my firm belief that the serious offenses committed by William Jefferson Clinton are high crimes and misdemeanors and warrant impeachment, conviction, and removal from office. 
   Amazingly, we continue to hear the argument that although the President's actions rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors, he should not be removed from office. The Constitution provides if a President is found guilty of high crimes, then he is automatically removed from office. Our Constitution does not allow for finding the President guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors, and then permitting him to stay in office. Only an amendment to the Constitution would make such a step permissible. 
   There were several points during the trial of the President when I had a visceral reaction to certain charges raised by the House Managers. This reaction occurred, each time, at precisely the point when the Managers discussed the President's strategy to attack the character of Monica Lewinsky, Kathleen Willey and others. The callous disregard for the soul of another human being and the unsympathetic wounding of the character of another carried out by the President using the apparatus of the Presidency is chilling and deserves condemnation by 
   those who cherish freedom. 
   Before I proceed to my view of the specific articles, it may help to explain that I approach this process unencumbered by a law degree. While that in no way gives me license to disregard the legal aspects of the matter before me, it does permit me to translate legal concepts into layman's terms. As I worked my way through the voluminous record and sat through days of the trial, I found it easiest to understand this case if I approached it in chronological order. Given that, I will discuss the Obstruction of Justice count first, because in the course of this tragic series of events, I believe the President started down this slippery slope by the actions he took, as  opposed to the words he spoke. Sadly, the words, uttered under an oath to tell the truth, came later.

    Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 346, a bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to prohibit the recoupment of funds recovered by states from one or more tobacco manufacturers. Starting in 1989, several states filed lawsuits against tobacco companies to recover the costs of smoking related illnesses borne by states. The lawsuits led to final settlements between each state and the tobacco industry. 
   Now, after providing no assistance to states in their legal battles, the Administration, through the Health Care Financing Administration, is attempting to claim a portion of this money. It is my opinion that this money belongs to the individual states, and should be spent as each state sees fit. This legislation accomplishes exactly that goal. 
   The Health Care Financing Administration's pursuit of these monies also could jeopardize state programs all over the country. In Florida, Governor Jeb Bush announced an endowment, funded by tobacco monies, to insure the financial health of vital programs for children and seniors. The endowment fund is named in honor of the late Governor Lawton Chiles, who played a key role in obtaining the tobacco settlement for the people of Florida. Other programs, funded by the settlement, have already been put in place in Florida, and would be jeopardized if the funds were suddenly not available. 
   Additionally, the Health Care Financing Administration's plan to obtain these funds by witholding federal Medicaid payments to the states could very well affect the states' ability to provide much needed care for the millions of Americans who depend on Medicaid. 
   The Administration's attempt to dictate how the money should be spent demonstrates a disregard for state budgeting process. I hope that my colleagues will support this bi-partisan bill that protects state tobacco settlements from federal recoupment.
